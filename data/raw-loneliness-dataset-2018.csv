In particular, among older adults, a considerably large group of individuals has been identified as not using the Internet by themselves; rather, they ask members of their personal networks to do things online for them—they “use” the Internet by proxy. Since previous research shows that children and grandchildren are important sources of help when it comes to Internet use, the current paper indicates that the notion of intergenerational solidarity is a sound conceptual basis for understanding the relationship between social support networks and proxy Internet use among Internet non-users. Notably, the concept of functional solidarity as a dimension of intergenerational solidarity is advanced, as this relates to the frequency of the intergenerational exchange of resources and services encompassing various types of assistance and support offered between two generations. Empirically, this paper investigates how the two types of social support networks and their characteristics are associated with proxy Internet use. The results from multivariate analyses of survey data from a nation-wide representative sample show that when comparing emotional support and socializing networks, only the latter is associated with proxy Internet use: Internet non-users who have (grand-)children in their socializing support network are more likely to engage in proxy Internet use. The results also indicate that non-users who are younger, more educated, have children, and live in urban areas are more inclined to engage in proxy Internet use, regardless of the type of social support. The findings indicate the importance of empirical investigation related to different aspects of functional solidarity, as the effects on proxy Internet use depend on the type of social support. © 2017",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042285324,0,0,0,broader

Methods: The 6-8-5 method and affinity mapping were used to create e-health design ideas that were translated into storyboards and scenarios. Focus groups were conducted to obtain feedback on the prototypes and included participant sketching. A qualitative analysis of the focus groups for emerging themes was conducted, and sketches were analyzed. Results: Forty-three older adults participated in six focus group sessions. The majority of participants found the wellness tools useful. Preferences included features that supported participants in areas of unmet needs, such as ability to find reliable health information, cognitive training, or maintaining social ties. Participants favored features such as use of voice navigation, but were concerned over cost and the need for technology skills and access. Sketches reinforced these wants, including portability, convenience, and simplicity. Conclusions: Several factors were found to increase the desirability of such devices including convenient access to their health and health information, a simple, accessible interface, and support for memory issues. Researchers and designers should incorporate the feedback of older adults regarding wellness tools, so that future designs meet the needs of older adults. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016119005,1,1,0,

Studies have shown that older adults use of social networks and online communication can increase social support, improve quality of life and increase their health. The purpose of this study was to understand the older adult's experiences of online Social Interactions. Materials and Methods: This study was performed following a qualitative approach and phenomenological methodology in Semnan (Iran) in 2016. The studied sample was taken by purposive sampling method. Required data was collected via deep and semi-structured interviews with 9 older adults who were active members of at least one online social network. The obtained data was analyzed using the seven-step Colaizzi's method. Results: From data analysis, the main theme of ""developed social interactions"" was extracted from five sub-themes: ""interaction with family and friends"", ""revival of old relationships"", ""familiar with people with common interests"", ""impalpable control"" and ""liberation from loneliness"". Conclusion: The results explained the various dimensions of the use of the older adults from online social networks and showed that these networks have the potential to be used to enhance social interactions in aging. The results of this study can help planners by identifying the benefits of these networks, while taking necessary interventions to increase the use of the elderly from these networks, promote social interactions and, consequently, promote the health of the elderly. © 2018, Semnan University of Medical Sciences.

The perspectives of flow, entertainment, social interaction, and endorsement",2018,Telematics and Informatics,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040066051&doi=10.1016%2fj.tele.2017.12.003&partnerID=40&md5=0e2d709699ad80542836e85fd1097f29,"Live-stream is the real-time audio and video transmission of an event over the Internet. Since a live-stream can also be interactive, it has some of the characteristics of a small community. People often become addicted to television, movies, or video blogs for the sake of entertainment. They can also become blind and obsessive about worshiping popular idols. Moreover, their willingness to use media is affected by their own perception of the media or their expectation of the benefits. This study therefore proposes four key factors: flow, entertainment, social interaction, and endorsement. We use path analysis to test their relationships with attitude, perceived value and watching intention to understand the influential factors and channels that induce audiences to watch live-streaming events. Analysis of 313 valid responses to a survey questionnaire indicate that approximately 65% of Taiwanese people watch live-streams via social network sites. In general, they watched live-streams simply because they liked to do so. The main reason behind their favorable impression of live-streaming was that live-streams made people happy and relieved stress. Secondly, people were attracted by the charm of the streamers, but the attraction differs slightly by gender. Females developed a more favorable impression of a live-stream when they admired the streamer. Males, on the other hand, developed a more favorable impression of a live-stream when they interacted with the streamer or other audience members. Young people tended to like live-streaming because it gave them a sense of flow, while older people were not affected by flow. This study contributes to the development of live-stream services and future studies on live-streaming. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040066051,0,0,0,

One service that addresses both these imperatives is home visiting services. Home visiting services connect home visitors with isolated older people. To examine how older people navigate volunteering for a home visiting service, six visitors were interviewed and the interviews were analysed using discourse analysis. A professionalism discourse was used to construct home visiting as a structured social support service that improved the lives of isolated older people. A personal relationship discourse constructed home visiting as an opportunity to forge long-term relationships that benefit both parties. At times these two discourses created tension for home visitors. Examining how the home visiting service is described by the service organisation online explains these tensions. The online materials construct active older volunteers as providing professional services while those they visit are constructed as receiving friendship. These discourses provide different ageing identities for visitors from those they visit, which contributes to the difficulties in navigating home visiting services. Addressing these tensions will enable service co-ordinators to better meet the needs of both visitors and clients in the context of increasing need for such services. © Cambridge University Press 2016.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007416081,0,1,0,

When their primary function, to inform, has been rendered obsolete, we are faced with the question why people continue to display these objects, often next to newer models, in their living rooms. The main argument is that Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) commodities, old and new, defective and repaired, are primarily social objects that are embedded in complex webs of practices and expectations which unsettle the taken-for-granted associations between technology and time. ICT objects are shown to be metonyms of dynamics in social relationships between owners of these ICT goods and others; and, although seemingly paradoxically, these same objects, even when damaged, inhabit promises for a better future. The article thus offers an alternative perspective on electronic modernity, and in particular, the role of Africa therein. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84966707933,0,maybe,0,

High levels of technophobia (fear of modern technologies or discomfort with them), however, may constrain older Internet users’ online activity and limit the benefits they derive therefrom. The literature on technophobia in later life tends to focus on nonusers and ignore older individuals who already use advanced technologies. Relying on an online survey of 537 Internet users aged 60 and up, this study explored the extent to which technophobia constrains older users’ online activity. The results demonstrated varying levels of technophobia among users and significant associations between technophobia and Internet use patterns, including type and complexity of use. Technophobia also correlated with users’ education, perceived health and well-being: Technophobes tended to be less satisfied with their lives—a correlation that remained significant even after controlling for background variables and online activities. The findings suggest that technophobia plays a role at both the first and second levels of the digital divide among seniors. They also indicate that technophobia may be a risk factor in later life, suggesting that older users ought to be taken into account in planning measures to reduce technophobia among seniors. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040988674,0,1,0,

Face-to-face contact through video-calls may help reduce loneliness, but little is known about the processes of engaging people in care environments in using video-calls. We aimed to identify the barriers to and facilitators of implementing video-calls for older people in care environments. Methods: A collaborative action research (CAR) approach was taken to implement a video-call intervention in care environments. We undertook five steps of recruitment, planning, implementation, reflection and re-evaluation, in seven care homes and one hospital in the UK. The video-call intervention 'Skype on Wheels' (SoW) comprised a wheeled device that could hold an iPad and handset, and used Skype to provide a free video-call service. Care staff were collaborators who implemented the intervention within the care-setting by agreeing the intervention, recruiting older people and their family, and setting up video-calls. Field notes and reflective diaries on observations and conversations with staff, older people and family were maintained over 15 months, and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Four care homes implemented the intervention. Eight older people with their respective social contacts made use of video-calls. Older people were able to use SoW with assistance from staff, and enjoyed the use of video-calls to stay better connected with family. However five barriers towards implementation included staff turnover, risk averseness, the SoW design, lack of family commitment and staff attitudes regarding technology. Conclusions: The SoW intervention, or something similar, could aid older people to stay better connected with their families in care environments, but if implemented as part of a rigorous evaluation, then co-production of the intervention at each recruitment site may be needed to overcome barriers and maximise engagement. © 2018 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042877274,1,1,1,

The study sample included n = 1995 community dwelling older people aged between 65 and 74 years from the baseline of the longitudinal International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS). In order to measure social networks for each type of social tie, participants were asked about the number of contacts, the number of contacts they see at least once a month or have a very good relationship with, or speak with at least once a month. For social support, participants had to rate the level of social support provided by the four types of contacts for five Likert scale items. Confirmatory Factor Analysis was conducted to determine the goodness of fit of the measurement models. Satisfactory goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the satisfactory factorial structure of the IMIAS-SNSS instrument. Reliability coefficients were 0.80, 0.81, 0.85, and 0.88 for friends, children, family, and partner models, respectively. The models were confirmed by CFA for each type of social tie. Moreover, IMIAS-SNSS detected gender differences in the older adult populations of IMIAS. These results provide evidence supporting that IMIAS-SNSS is a psychometrically sound instrument and of its validity and reliability for international populations of older adults. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042200580,0,1,0,

Methods: We conducted an online survey in China that lasted eight weeks. Respondents were required to report their demographic characteristics and feelings regarding SNS use. Data were analysed using SPSS 20 and Amos 21. Results: We collected 596 valid samples. The empirical results show that SNS use improves older people's life satisfaction by reducing their loneliness and improving their self-efficacy. Social support alleviates the negative effect of loneliness and enhances the positive effect of self-efficacy on life satisfaction. Sex differences and education differences were significant. Men and less educated people had higher levels of life satisfaction. Conclusion: Policymakers should offer support to SNSs targeting older people and encourage them to provide more useful services. SNS operators should encourage social support among older users and pay attention to sex differences and education differences. © 2018 AJA Inc.,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043708009,1,maybe,0,

Past evidence shows that family victimization may play an essential role in the way adolescents learn cyberbullying behaviors. Yet, research on the co-occurrence of family victimization and cyberbullying is limited. This study aims to investigate the associations between cyberbullying and family victimization among adolescents, and to examine the health correlates of cyberbullying and family poly-victimization. A large sample of 18,341 students, aged 15–17, from six cities in China, collected between 2009 and 2010 is employed in the present study, which investigated the association between various kinds of family victimization and adolescent cyberbullying. Data analysis was conducted in 2017. In-law conflict, intimate partner violence, elder abuse and neglect, and child maltreatment were associated with a higher possibility of children becoming internet victims. Parents’ divorce and separation, low family income, mother's low level of education, and father's unemployment were all associated with cyberbullying victimization. Cyber victimization was positively correlated to symptoms of PTSD and depression, self-harm, and other physical and mental health variables. Possible explanations for the relationships found in this study are discussed and implications for future research and services are provided.

Contact with new technology is a problem for many older adults. Objective: The goal of the present study was to examine how family members support older adults in the acquisition and usage of ICT. Methods: In the qualitative preliminary study, structured interviews with older adults (n = 5) and their family members (n = 6) were performed, which included questions on technology biography, technology acquisition and the effect of the technology usage on the social network. The results were part of the questionnaire of the main study. The main study was part of an accompanying intervention study. A total of 46 adults older than 60 years were included. In addition to aspects from the preliminary study, questions to sex-specific differences regarding the technical support of the social network were also analyzed. Results: Data analysis revealed that mainly family members purchase ICT for the older adults, and they are the main contact persons for technical problems. Above all, the seniors asked their own children for advice. Moreover, seniors who had increased technology use in everyday life (95.7%, n = 22) and higher technology acceptance (mean = 44.0, standard deviation = 7.4) had already had previous experience with technology during school age/career. Conclusion: In the households of older adults, fewer new ICT are found. The interest to purchase ICT is triggered by the technology support of family members. If the technical assistance was distributed to several members of the family and other networks, the burden of an individual family member could be reduced. In addition, the influence of different participants could increase the technology usage of older adults. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028333916,1,1,0,focus on elderly

Recent studies show beneficial effects of using ICTs for older adults, particularly in terms of reducing loneliness and depression. However, little is known about the factors that may prevent discontinued ICT use in populations that may be at greater risk, such as those in continuing care retirement communities (CCRCs). Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine a range of factors that may influence discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) searching for health information, and (3) searching for general information over time among CCRC residents. Methods: We use longitudinal data from a randomized controlled trial conducted with residents of 19 CCRCs. We use flexible parametric models to estimate the hazard ratio or hazard rate over 5 waves of data to determine what factors significantly predict discontinued (1) ICT use, (2) health information searching, and (3) general information searching. Results: The analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in an 8-week ICT training intervention were less likely to stop using ICTs. Age and the number of instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairments significantly predicted an increased likelihood of stopping ICT use. When examining specific ICT-related activities, the analysis reveals that independent living residents who took part in the ICT training intervention were less likely to stop searching for health information and general information online. In addition, age and the number of IADL impairments were associated with increased likelihood of discontinued health information searches and discontinued general information searches. Conclusion: ICT training interventions may motivate residents of CCRCs to stay connected by increasing the ICT skill level and promoting confidence, thus decreasing the probability that they will discontinue using ICTs and searching for general information. However, the effects of ICT training on motivating continued ICT usage may be more pronounced among independent living residents. Limitations in the number of IADL impairments is a key factor leading to discontinued use of ICTs among CCRC residents, suggesting that designers of ICTs should be cognizant of the cognitive and physical limitations among this group. © 2017 S.

However, whether Internet use increases or decreases social networks, loneliness, and quality of life is not clear-cut. Purposes: To explore the direct and/or indirect effects of Internet use on QoL, and to examine whether ethnicity and time the elderly spent with family moderate the mediation effect of Internet use on quality of life throughout loneliness. Methods: This descriptive-correlational study was carried out in 2016 by structured interviews with a convenience sample of 502 respondents aged 50 and older, living in northern Israel. Bootstrapping with resampling strategies was used for testing mediation a model. Results: Use of the Internet was found to be positively associated with QoL. However, this relationship was mediated by loneliness, and moderated by the time the elderly spent with family members. In addition, respondents’ ethnicity significantly moderated the mediation effect between Internet use and loneliness. Conclusions: Internet use can enhance QoL of older adults directly or indirectly by reducing loneliness. However, these effects are conditional on other variables. The indirect effect moderated by ethnicity, and the direct effect moderated by the time the elderly spend with their families.

While risk factors for problem drinking in late life have been identified, it remains unknown whether these factors drive daily drinking among older problem drinkers. This study examined the daily drivers of drinking among problem drinkers, moderated by age, utilizing ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Method: Participants (N = 139), ages 20–73, received daily EMA online surveys completed via a smartphone prior to initiation of treatment. Multilevel modeling tested the moderating impact of age on within- and between-person relationships between drinking and focal predictors (mood, loneliness, boredom, stress, poor sleep, social factors, alcohol salience, commitment and confidence not to drink heavily). Results: Older adults reported greater alcohol consumption when daily boredom levels were higher. Heavier drinking among younger adults was associated with poorer sleep quality. Greater daily confidence, daily commitment and daily alcohol salience did not impact drinking to the same extent for older adults as for younger adults. Greater person-level commitment predicted reduced drinking equivalently across age, but low person-level commitment predicted greater drinking among older adults compared to their younger counterparts. Conclusion: Older adults may have unique daily drivers of drinking that are not fully realized in current research and intervention efforts. Addressing the growing substance-use treatment needs among this population will require identifying the unique drivers of drinking among older adults, such as boredom, when compared to younger adults. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044390759,1,0,0,

ROBIN is integrated in a sensor-rich environment that aims to continuously monitor physical and psychological wellbeing of older persons living alone. The caregivers (formal/informal) can communicate through it with their assisted persons. Long-term trials in real houses highlighted several user requirements that inspired improvements on the robotic platform. The enhanced telepresence robot was assessed by users to test its suitability to support social interaction and provide motivational feedback on health-related aspects. Methods: Twenty-five users (n = 25) assessed the new multimodal interaction capabilities and new communication services. A psychophysiological approach was adopted to investigate aspects like engagement, usability, and affective impact, as well as the possible role of individual differences on the quality of human-robot interaction. Results: ROBIN was overall judged usable, the interaction with/through it resulted pleasant and the required workload was limited, thus supporting the idea of using it as a central component for remote assistance and social participation. Open-minded users tended to have a more positive interaction with it. Conclusions: This work describes an enabling technology for remote assistance and social communication. It highlights the importance of being compliant with users' needs to develop solutions easy to use and able to foster their social connections. The role of personality appeared to be relevant for the interaction, underscoring a clear role of the service personalization. © Copyright 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2018.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041746549,1,maybe,0,

Fear of falling might reduce physical activities resulting in declining social interactions and eventually causing depression. To lessen the effects of a fall, timely delivery of medical treatment can play a vital role. In a similar scenario, an IoT-based wearable system can pave the most promising way to mitigate serious consequences of a fall while providing the convenience of usage. However, to deliver sufficient degree of monitoring and reliability, wearable devices working at the core of fall detection systems are required to work for a prolonged period of time. In this work, we focus on energy efficiency of a wearable sensor node in an Internet-of-Things (IoT) based fall detection system. We propose the design of a tiny, lightweight, flexible and energy efficient wearable device. We investigate different parameters (e.g. sampling rate, communication bus interface, transmission protocol, and transmission rate) impacting on energy consumption of the wearable device. In addition, we provide a comprehensive analysis of energy consumption of the wearable in different configurations and operating conditions. Furthermore, we provide hints (hardware and software) for system designers implementing the optimal wearable device for IoT-based fall detection systems in terms of energy efficiency and high quality of service. The results clearly indicate that the proposed sensor node is novel and energy efficient. In a critical condition, the wearable device can be used continuously for 76 h with a 1000 mAh li-ion battery. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032812646,0,0,0,

In this study, we aimed at (a) developing a measurement instrument assessing the factors of older adults' perceptions of their environment, (b) examining the associations of these environmental factors with quality of life domains physical health, psychological, social relations, and environmental, controlling for background characteristics. Design and Methods: Associations between environmental factors and quality of life domains were examined in a crosssectional study using a sample of 1,031 Dutch people aged 65 years and older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the ""Senioren Barometer."" Forty-two questions on environmental factors were asked, and quality of life domains were assessed by the WHOQOL-BREF. Results: Seven scales (comprising 3-9 items) of environment were constructed-housing, facilities, nuisance, residents, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic. All quality of life domains (physical, psychological, social, environmental) were associated with at least one environmental scale. Housing, residents, and nuisance were associated with 4, 3, and 2 domains, respectively. Facilities, neighborhood, stench/noise, and traffic were associated only with quality of life environmental. Implications: This study showed that multiple environmental factors are associated with quality of life in older people. To support independent living in older people health and social care professionals and policymakers may need to carry out interventions, in particular focusing on housing, residents, and nuisance. © 2017 The Author(s).

However, older adults may engage with Web 2.0 interventions differently than younger adults. The aims of this study were to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0 and Web 1.0) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for website usage and to determine whether an interaction between intervention (Web 2.0, Web 1.0 and logbook) and age group (<55y and ≥55y) exists for intervention effectiveness (changes in physical activity). Methods: As part of the WALK 2.0 trial, 504 Australian adults were randomly assigned to receive either a paper logbook (n = 171), a Web 1.0 (n = 165) or a Web 2.0 (n = 168) physical activity intervention. Moderate to vigorous physical activity was measured using ActiGraph monitors at baseline 3, 12 and 18months. Website usage statistics including time on site, number of log-ins and number of step entries were also recorded. Generalised linear and intention-to-treat linear mixed models were used to test interactions between intervention and age groups (<55y and ≥55y) for website usage and moderate to vigorous physical activity changes. Results: Time on site was higher for the Web 2.0 compared to the Web 1.0 intervention from baseline to 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.01-2.14, p = .047). Participants in the Web 2.0 group increased their activity more than the logbook group at 3months, and this difference was significantly greater in the older group (moderate to vigorous physical activity adjusted mean difference = 13.74, 95%CI = 1.08-26.40min per day, p = .03). No intervention by age interactions were observed for Web 1.0 and logbook groups. Conclusions: Results partially support the use of Web 2.0 features to improve adults over 55s' engagement in and behaviour changes from web-based physical activity interventions.

Yet the ramifications of SNS use in this population remain understudied. Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults (N = 2,003), this study focuses on Facebook users (N = 1,138) and examines patterns of Facebook use by younger (aged 18–65 years) and older users (aged 65 or older), as well as the social benefits associated with older users’ Facebook use. Findings show that older users have different network structures, but the frequency of their visits and engagement in Social Media Relationship Maintenance Behaviors (SMRMB), a measure of perceived likelihood to engage with others via social media, do not significantly differ from those of younger users. Moreover, our results suggest that among older users (N = 98), the number of self-reported “actual” friends on Facebook and SMRMB positively predict perceived support, while SMRMB contributes to perceptions of access to useful information. Overall, the study highlights unique usage patterns and social benefits associated with Facebook use among older adults.

A novel security mechanism named as the traceable threshold attribute-based signcryption (TTABSC) can permits patients to be friends and make a proper tradeoff between privacy and traceability. The proposed scheme leverages a four-party model to prevent the leak of a patient's sensitive information, including symptom information, identity and patient's health information (PHI).

The specific target of our work is older adults, with no critical pathological conditions, who wish to stay home as long as possible. The work proposes a plan for a rigorous systematization of the users needs and their validation based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative research techniques involving both the primary users (older users at home) and the secondary users (formal and informal caregivers) who constitute the network of persons around them. Four main areas relevant to the realization of personalized services have been identified that could help to support independent living and improve Quality of Life (QoL) which include the monitoring of Social Interaction, Physiological Data, Daily Activities and Environmental Data. The presented results are also consistent with the global theoretical framework of International Classification of the Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) which highlights the main factors contributions to independent living. This study also investigates the perceived usefulness and acceptance of specific services (considering both primary and secondary users perspective) that have been listed inside each category with the aim to indicate a clear priority level and preferences of users. The article concludes by providing insights on practical implications for the systems development, presenting concrete examples of possible use cases relevant for the AAL domain linked to the elicited user requirements. © 2018 -IOS Press and the authors.

It affects people of all ages but particularly elderly who struggle to maintain social ties into later-life. Interventions in social isolation primarily focus on elderly in clinical care, overlooking the existence of older adults who live independently. Despite facing dwindling social contact, groups of healthy older adults reside alongside large groups of younger citizens that might offer much needed social interaction. This type of intergenerational social interaction seems promising but motivations of elderly to engage with younger groups who are not necessarily related to them are not well-understood and vice-versa. Persuasive games have the potential to encouraging social interaction. This paper presents a preliminary work on investigating motivations for intergenerational interaction rooted in persuasion theory.

The social media advertising campaign focused on enrollment for a Phase 1 clinical trial. Traditional means of recruiting-billboards, newspaper advertising, word of mouth, personal referrals, and direct mail-were not producing enough qualified participants. Objective: To demonstrate the effectiveness of using targeted advertising on the social networking site Facebook to recruit people aged 60 years and older for volunteer clinical trial participation. Methods: The trial sponsor used a proactive approach to recruit participants using advertising on social media. The sponsor placed and monitored an Institutional Review Board-Approved advertising campaign on Facebook to recruit potential candidates for a Phase 1 clinical trial. The clinical trial required a 10-day residential (overnight) stay at a clinic in Michigan, with one follow-up visit. The sponsor of the clinical trial placed the advertising, which directed interested respondents to a trial-specific landing page controlled by the Contract Research Organization (CRO). The CRO provided all follow-up consenting, prescreening, screening, and enrollment procedures. The campaign was waged over an 8-week period to supplement recruiting by the CRO. Results: A total of 621 people responded to a Facebook advertising campaign by completing an online form or telephoning the CRO, and the clinical trial was fully enrolled at 45 subjects following an 8-week Facebook advertising campaign. Conclusions: An 8-week Facebook advertising campaign contributed to 868 inquiries made regarding a Phase 1 clinical trial seeking to enroll healthy elderly subjects. Over the initial 11 weeks of recruitment, 178 inquiries were received using traditional methods of outreach. Respondents to the Facebook advertising campaign described in this report engaged with the sponsored advertising at a higher rate than is typical for social media-based clinical trial recruitment strategies. The older adults' engagement rate of 4.92% was more than twice as high as click-Through rates of younger adults engaged with social media advertising in other clinical trial recruitment studies. Advertising placed on the social media platform Facebook is effective with the healthy volunteer population aged 60 years and older. This approach can quickly and cost-effectively reach qualified candidates for clinical trial recruitment as a supplement to traditional means of recruiting.

The primary objective of this project is to examine the response of isolated rural carers for older people with dementia to a videoconference (VC) based peer support and information program. Will participation in the program improve self-efficacy, quality of life, and mental health? Secondary objectives are to develop a VC based peer support program for isolated rural carers for older people with dementia, using a co-design approach; and to assess the feasibility of VC technology for enhancing social support to family caregivers in their homes.

A large proportion of these people will need significant help to manage various chronic illnesses, including dementia, heart disease, diabetes, limited physical movement and many others. Current approaches typically focus on acute episodes of illness and are not well designed to provide adequately for daily living care support. In our rapidly ageing society, a critical need exists for effective, affordable, scalable and safe in- home and in-residential care solutions leveraging a range of current and emerging sensor, interaction and integration technologies. Key aims are to support the ageing to live longer in their own homes; make daily challenges associated with ageing less limiting through use of technology supports; better support carers - both professional and family - in providing monitoring, proactive intervention, and community connectedness; enable in-home and in-residential care organisations to scale their support services and better use their workforces; and ultimately provide better quality of life. Deakin University researchers have been investigating a range of emerging technologies and platforms to realise this vision, which we in broad terms coin Digital Enhanced Living, in the ageing space but also supporting those with anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, various chronic diseases, recovery from injury, and various predictive analytics. A Smart Home solution, carried out in conjunction with a local start-up, has produced and trialled a novel sensor, interaction, and AI- based technology. Virtual Reality (VR) solutions have been used to support carers in the set-up of dementia-friendly homes, in conjunction with Alzheimers Australia. Activity and nutrition solutions, including the use of conversational agents, have been used to build dialogue to engage and change behaviour. Predictive analytics, in conjunction with major hospitals, have been applied to large medical datasets to better support professionals making judgements around discharge outcomes. A set of lessons have been learned from the design, deployment and trialing of these diverse solutions and new development approaches have been crafted to address the challenges faced. In particular, we found that there is a need to consider user emotional expectations as first-class citizens and create methodologies that consider the user needs during the creation of the software solutions. We find that quality and emotional aspects have to be engineered into the solution, rather than added after a technical solution is deployed. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

This paper presents a new 12-item short form Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ-SF). Methods: The original field trial data used to develop the 24-item AAQ (AAQ-24) were used to compare 6-item, 9-item, and 12-item versions of AAQ-SF (sample 1, n = 2487) and to test the discriminative validity of the selected 12-item AAQ-SF (sample 2, n = 2488). Data from a separate study reporting on the AAQ-24 (sample 3, n = 792) verified the analyses. Results: The 12-item AAQ-SF reported adequate internal consistency in both sample 1 (PL α =.72, PC α =.72, and PG α =.62) and sample 3 (PL α =.68, PC α =.73, and PG α =.61). The AAQ-SF functioned consistently with the profile of the AAQ-24 in that subscales in both formats of this measure discriminate between respondents on key parameters such as depression, subjective health status, and overall quality of life in sample 2. Sample 3 also demonstrated the AAQ-SF can detect the differences in attitudes toward aging between individuals experiencing anxiety and depression and those without psychological symptoms. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the structure of the AAQ-SF mirrors that of the original 24-item AAQ. Conclusions: The AAQ-SF is a robust measure of attitudes toward aging, which can reduce respondent burden when used within longer questionnaire batteries or longitudinal research.

Concurrently, communication technology is increasingly more mobile and the use of social networking sites (SNS) amongst older adults is at an unprecedented level. Through in-depth interviews with 29 Grey Nomads caravanning through Mid-West Western Australia, this study explores the use(s) of SNS amongst Grey Nomads. Respondents were classified as active, passive or non-users of SNS. Emergent themes effecting the use of SNS include its ‘perceived usefulness’ and the level of Grey Nomad ‘self-efficacy’. Grey Nomads have a pragmatic approach to SNS, acknowledging SNS allows them to ‘stay connected’ and is a useful ‘source of information’. This study contributes to initiating an understanding of how Grey Nomads use SNS within their caravanning environment. Stakeholders in the caravanning industry should ensure the incorporation and strategic use of SNS in their marketing and business operations. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041365266,0,1,0,

Discrimination in healthcare can affect the ability of TGNC persons to age successfully as it often deters them from seeking care. The purpose of this study was to determine if anticipation of bias from healthcare professionals, as well as other variables, predicted perceived successful aging in a sample of TGNC adults. Methods: A total of 384 (of the original 1963) participants older than 50 years completed the relevant parts of an 83-item online survey as part of the Trans MetLife Survey on Later-Life Preparedness and Perceptions in Transgender-Identified Individuals. Results: Larger social support networks and higher levels of confidence that a healthcare professional will treat them with dignity and respect as a TGNC person at the end of their life were associated with increased odds of perceiving that they were aging successfully. Conclusion: With high rates of discrimination and prejudice toward TGNC persons in various contexts (e.g., healthcare, education, and housing), it is imperative that practitioners, researchers, policymakers, and institutions work together to eradicate healthcare disparities, promote social change, and support an environment that encourages successful aging. This calls for a coordinated, proactive outreach effort to put trust back into a system that has historically let down an entire subset of the population. © 2017, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038362566,1,0,0,

Background: The growing ageing population places demands on the healthcare system to promote healthy ageing and to strengthen the older person's self-care ability. This requires innovative approaches to facilitate communication between the older person and healthcare professionals, and to increase the older person's participation in their care. An information and communication technology-platform could be used for this purpose, but the content needs to be relevant to both the older persons and the healthcare professionals. Design: Descriptive qualitative design. Methods: This study was based on three samplings: a scoping review of the literature (n = 20 articles), interviews with healthcare professionals (n = 5) and a secondary analysis of interviews with older persons (n = 8) and nursing assistants (n = 7). The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Four areas were identified to be of relevance to older persons’ perceived health: frame of mind, having relationships and social activities, physical ability and concerns, and maintaining self-care. Self-care was described in the literature and by the healthcare professionals more than by the older persons. Conclusions: The results show a concordance in the data samplings that give a clear indication of the areas relevant to older persons’ health and self-care that can be integrated in an interactive information and communication technology-platform for use in regular daily care assessments. Descriptions of self-care were limited indicating a possible gap in knowledge that requires further research. Relevance to clinical practice: Areas relevant to older persons’ health and self-care could be used for regular assessment to support and promote healthy ageing. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019650723,1,1,0,focus on elderly

Two of the channels are “smart” (technological) channels, comprising (i) where consumers shop using a computer and (ii) where consumers shop using a mobile phone. These two channels are compared with (iii) the traditional store channel. The paper explores the effect that consumers’ interactions with these channels has on their wellbeing, with a focus on individuals who perceive themselves as being socially excluded, for example, lacking access to goods, services and information. We make a connection between social exclusion and channel contribution to wellbeing for multiple channels, through the lens of the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The online survey findings (n = 1368) indicate that for each channel, there is a higher contribution to wellbeing for that channel for people who are more socially excluded. Social exclusion can have many underlying causes, but channel contributions to wellbeing remain for consumers suffering from financial stress and also those with mobility disability. For the mobile phone channel, the positive channel contributions to wellbeing are greater for younger than for older people.

With advances in technology, computer-based cognitive exercises are increasingly integrated into traditional cognitive interventions, such as cognitive training. Another type of cognitive intervention involving technology use is cognitive engagement, consisting of involving participants in highly motivational and mentally challenging activities, such as learning to use a form of new digital technology. This study examined the feasibility and acceptability of a computerized cognitive stimulation (CCS) program and a computerized cognitive engagement (CCE) program, and then compared their effects in older adults with MCI. Patients and methods: In this randomized study, data from 19 MCI patients were analyzed (n=9 in CCS and n=10 in CCE). The patients attended a group weekly session for a duration of 3 months. Assessments of cognitive and psychosocial variables were conducted at baseline (M0) and at the end of the programs (M3). Results: All of the participants attended the 12 sessions and showed a high level of motivation. Attrition rate was very low (one dropout at M3 assessment). At M3, the CCS participants displayed a significant improvement in part B of the Trail Making Test (TMT-B; p=0.03) and self-esteem (p=0.005), while the CCE participants showed a significant improvement in part A of the Trail Making Test (TMT-A; p=0.007) and a higher level of technology acceptance (p=0.006). The two groups did not differ significantly (p>0.05) in cognitive and psychosocial changes after the intervention. However, medium effect sizes (Cohen’s d=0.56; 95% CI =-0.43:1.55) were found on the free recall, favoring the CCS group, as well as on TMT-A (d=0.51; 95% CI =-0.48:1.49) and technology acceptance (d=-0.65; 95% CI =-1.64:0.34), favoring the CCE group. Conclusion: Both interventions were highly feasible and acceptable and allowed improvement in different aspects of cognitive and psychosocial functioning in MCI subjects. © 2017 Djabelkhir et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035203421,1,1,1,

The main aim of My-AHA is to reduce frailty risk by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being in older adults with pre-frailty symptoms. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, providing new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support. An ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via non-stigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected (pre-frail), My-AHA will provide targeted ICT-based interventions. These interventions will follow an integrated approach to motivate users to participate in physical exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with My-AHA. A randomized controlled study (RCT), involving 300 subjects receiving intervention, and 300 controls from many EU and non EU countries, to evaluate intercultural aspects, is ongoing in order to evaluate efficacy of the my-AHA platform. The ultimate aim is to deliver significant innovation in the area of active and healthy ageing through cooperation between European health care organizations, SMEs, and NGOs.1 © 2017 University of Split, FESB.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041336293,0,0,0,proposal

Specifically, FamilyPal firstly uses smartphones built-in sensors, such as GPS, accelerometer, microphone, gyroscope, and Wi-Fi to obtain the motion and location of users, the surrounding voice, etc. Secondly, with the sensed data, we propose an effective method based on Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) to detect family activities, including occurrence of meal, cooking, TV viewing, conversations, in an unobtrusive manner. Thirdly, we select appropriate sensors for classification to improve smartphones battery life. FamilyPal has been implemented on the Android platform and evaluation of the system with 10 subjects over one week shows that FamilyPal can accurately classify family activities with the average precision of 71%, the average recall of 73% and the F-measure of 71.99%. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041190899,0,maybe,maybe,

Online cognitive training is currently a popular, though controversialmethod. Although some changes seempossible in older adults through training, far transfer, and longitudinal maintenance are rarely seen. Based on previous literature we created a unique, state-of-the-art intervention study by incorporating frequent sessions and flexible, novel, adaptive training tasks, along with an active control group. We created a program called TAPASS (Training Project Amsterdam Seniors and Stroke), a randomized controlled trial. Healthy older adults (60-80 y.o.) were assigned to a frequent- (FS) or infrequent switching (IS) experimental condition or to the active control group and performed 58 half-hour sessions over the course of 12 weeks. Effects on executive functioning, processing- and psychomotor speed, planning, verbal long term memory, verbal fluency, and reasoning were measured on four time points before, during and after the training. Additionally, we examined the explorative question which individual aspects added to training benefit. Besides improvements on the training, we found significant time effects on multiple transfer tasks in all three groups that likely reflected retest effects. No training-specific improvements were detected, and we did not find evidence of additional benefits of individual characteristics. Judging from these results, the therapeutic value of using commercially available training games to train the aging brain is modest, though any apparent effects should be ascribed more to expectancy and motivation than to the elements in our training protocol. Our results emphasize the importance of using parallel tests as outcome measures for transfer and including both active and passive control conditions. Further investigation into different training methods is advised, including stimulating social interaction and the use of more variable, novel, group-based yet individual-adjusted exercises. © 2017 Buitenweg, van de Ven, Prinssen, Murre and Ridderinkhof.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041000466,0,1,1,60-80

Radiotherapy toxicity may be divided into acute/early and late effects of treatment. The latter may have limited relevance to an older patient with competing causes of mortality due to significant comorbidity. Altered fractionation regimes have been employed in numerous sites, with no significant toxicity impact. These offer greater convenience in the elderly, especially those with limited social support or in active caregiving roles. As radiotherapy toxicity is site specific, it's important to assess baseline function via Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), and any pre-existing comorbidities that may influence toxicity. With modern radiotherapy technology and capabilities, these are less of an issue and radiotherapy is a very suitable treatment option for the older adult. When evaluating the literature on toxicity in older patients, it's important to recognise that older studies do not represent modern day radiotherapy techniques and capabilities. Advanced technology may simultaneously deliver enhanced target coverage and reduced toxicity. More research is required related to the predictive power of CGA in linking radiotherapy toxicity to frailty. What little evidence exists shows that CGA has a role in treatment of older patients with radiotherapy and that, in general, radiotherapy appears to be well tolerated in older adults. The purpose of this review is to provide a broad overview of the mechanisms of normal tissue reactions to radiotherapy and how radiation induced toxicity may affect older patients. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85025124117,0,0,0,

Focus groups were conducted to: (1) understand older adults' familiarity with, and barriers to, interacting with new technologies and tablets; and (2) utilize user-engagement in refining an intervention protocol. Methods: Eighteen older adults (65-76 years old; 83.3% female) who were novice tablet users participated in discussions about their perceptions of and barriers to interacting with tablets. We conducted three separate focus groups and used a generic qualitative design applying thematic analysis to analyse the data. The focus groups explored attitudes toward tablets and technology in general. We also explored the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using tablets, familiarity with, and barriers to interacting with tablets. In two of the focus groups, participants had previous computing experience (e.g., desktop), while in the other, participants had no previous computing experience. None of the participants had any previous experience with tablet computers. Results: The themes that emerged were related to barriers (i.e., lack of instructions and guidance, lack of knowledge and confidence, health-related barriers, cost); disadvantages and concerns (i.e., too much and too complex technology, feelings of inadequacy, and comparison with younger generations, lack of social interaction and communication, negative features of tablets); advantages (i.e., positive features of tablets, accessing information, willingness to adopt technology); and skepticism about using tablets and technology in general. After brief exposure to tablets, participants emphasized the likelihood of using a tablet in the future. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that most of our participants were eager to adopt new technology and willing to learn using a tablet. However, they voiced apprehension about lack of, or lack of clarity in, instructions and support. Understanding older adults' perceptions of technology is important to assist with introducing it to this population and maximize the potential of technology to facilitate independent living. © 2017 Vaportzis, Giatsi Clausen and Gow.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030531151,1,1,0,

However, it has been difficult to examine the effects of these interventions, because of problems in assessing interactions. The present study was designed to quantitatively measure and visualize face-to-face interactions among elderly participants in an exercise program. We also examined relationships among interactional variables, personality and interest in community involvement, including interactions with the local community. Methods: Older adults living in the same community were recruited to participate in an exercise program that consisted of four sessions. We collected data on face-to-face interactions of the participants by using a wearable sensor technology device. Results: Network analysis identified the communication networks of participants in the exercise program, as well as changes in these networks. Additionally, there were significant correlations between the number of people involved in face-to-face interactions and changes in both interest in community involvement and interactions with local community residents, as well as personality traits, including agreeableness. Conclusions: Social networks in the community are essential for solving problems caused by the aging society. We showed the possible applications of face-to-face interactional data for identifying core participants having many interactions, and isolated participants having only a few interactions within the community. Such data would be useful for carrying out efficient interventions for increasing participants’ involvement with their community.

Methods Forty-seven participants were enrolled and assigned to receive one of two versions of the Internet intervention, either delivered individually (III) or with peer support (II+PS), or to a wait list control group (WLC). Primary outcomes included change in depressive symptoms from baseline to post-intervention (week 8), site use, self-reported usability, and coach time. Secondary outcomes included measures of social support and isolation and anxiety. Results Follow-up data were provided by 85.1% (40 of 47) of enrolled participants. There were significant differences in depression change across groups (F(2,37) = 3.81, p = 0.03). Greater reductions in depressive symptoms were found for the III (p = 0.02) and II+PS (p = 0.03) compared with WLC, and significantly less coach time was required in the II+PS (p = 0.003). Conclusions These results highlight the potential of cognitive-behaviorally informed Internet interventions for older adults with depression, and indicate that peer-supported programs are both acceptable and equivalent to individually delivered Internet interventions. Including peer support may be a viable and potentially more cost-effective option for disseminating online treatments for depression for older adults. © 2017 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019724381,1,1,1,

However, studies are lacking the consideration of the demand and use of UGS by different population groups and connecting UGS with social infrastructure. In an era of worldwide urbanization and ageing, this European study sheds light on the role of UGS for care facilities for elderly. 126 care facilities from 17 cities in Austria, Germany, Norway, Poland, Romania and Slovenia took part in an online survey. Administrations of care facilities gave insights on the (1) importance of gardens related to care facilities for the quality of life for the seniors, (2) importance of UGS outside of care facilities for the quality of life for the seniors and (3) the consideration of natural and age-friendly designs and management of ecosystem disservices of UGS. The results emphasize not only the importance of UGS for the quality of life of seniors residing in care facilities, but also for the staff and visitors. UGS contribute to physical activities, recreation, and social interactions. The study found that in particular facilities with an own garden are highly aware of the benefits UGS provide. The study holds important lessons for UGS planning, management and design not only to focus on the quantitative supply of UGS, but also to consider age-sensitive amenities in and access to UGS of high quality for seniors. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028314826,0,0,0,

This study examined the efficacy of learning and using an online social networking website, Facebook.com, as an intervention to maintain or enhance cognitive function in older adults. Method: Forty-one older adults were assigned to learn and use Facebook (n = 14) or an online diary website (active control, n = 13) for 8 weeks or placed on a waitlist (n = 14). Outcome measures included neuropsychological tests of executive functions, memory, and processing speed and self-report questionnaires about social engagement. Results: The Facebook group showed a significant increase in a composite measure of updating, an executive function factor associated with complex working memory tasks, compared to no significant change in the control groups. Other measures of cognitive function and social support showed no differential improvement in the Facebook group. Discussion: Learning and using an online social networking site may provide specific benefits for complex working memory in a group of healthy older adults. This may reflect the particular cognitive demands associated with online social networking and/or the benefits of social engagement more generally. © The Author 2016.

Method: A nationally representative sample of older adults aged 50 or older (N = 6,306), from four waves of the Korean Welfare Panel Study, was used in the analyses. All analyses were conducted using generalized estimation equations, and the mediation effects of social relationship satisfaction and depression in the relationship between Internet use and suicidal ideation were calculated using the product-of-coefficients approach. Results: Internet use was linked with lower levels of suicidal ideation directly and indirectly via the protective effects of Internet use on lowering depression, which was partially mediated by the positive influence Internet use has on older adults’ social relationship satisfaction. Discussion: The results support previous theories about the relationship between social relationships, depression, and suicidal behavior and prior results about how the Internet might confer mental and social health benefits to older adults. This suggests that the Internet is an important social and health activity that contributes to lowering suicidal ideation in older adults. © The Author 2016.

This study examines the predominance of the residential context within older adults’ everyday lives. Method: We provided 60 older adults in four New York City neighborhoods with iPhones, which captured Global Positioning Systems (GPS) locations at 5-min intervals over 1 week (n = 55,561) and 17 ecological momentary assessments (EMAs) over 4 days (n = 757) to assess real-time activities. Results: Older adults in our sample spent nearly 40% of their time outside of their residential tracts and they visited 28 other tracts, on average. Exercising, shopping, socializing, and social activities were especially likely to take place outside of residential tracts. Differences in residential and nonresidential poverty exposure vary across gender, race/ethnicity, education, car ownership, and residential areas. Discussion: Measuring activity space, rather than relying on residential tracts, allows examination of the social environments that are relevant for older adults’ everyday lives.

Thus, we predicted that using information and communication technology (ICT) in service of socially meaningful versus informational goals relates to higher well-being among the oldest-old. Method: We surveyed 445 adults aged 80+ (mean = 84, range = 80–93; 64% female; 26% non-White) online or via telephone. Participants reported motivations for ICT use (connect with others, learn new information) and rated their psychological and physical well-being (i.e., life satisfaction, loneliness, goal attainment, subjective health, functional limitations). We conducted regression and mediation analyses to test our hypothesis. Results: Participants used ICT more to connect with friends/family (M = 3.66, SD = 1.28) than to learn information (M = 2.61, SD = 1.44), p < .001. Overall, ICT use predicted higher well-being across outcomes, ps ≤ .008. Motivations for use differentially mediated these effects: Social motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and psychological well-being, whereas informational motivations mediated the relationships between ICT use and physical well-being. Discussion: Older adults aged 80+ use ICT less than other generations, but may have much to gain. Using social versus informational technologies may enhance multiple aspects of well-being in different ways during very late life. Highlighting such benefits may increase ICT adoption among the oldest-old. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Gerontological Society of America.

Exploring perceived benefits and challenges with web-based information and communication technologies as a means of supporting working carers' in their caregiving role, this paper draws on findings from a qualitative study. The study aimed to describe working carers' experiences of having access to the web-based family care support network ‘A good place' (AGP) provided by the municipality to support those caring for an older family member. Content analysis of interviews with nine working carers revealed three themes: A support hub, connections to peers, personnel and knowledge; Experiencing ICT support as relevant in changing life circumstances; and Upholding one's personal firewall. Findings indicate that the web-based family care support network AGP is an accessible, complementary means of support. Utilising support while balancing caregiving, work obligations and responsibilities was made easier with access to AGP; enabling working carers to access information, psychosocial support and learning opportunities. In particular, it provided channels for carers to share experiences with others, to be informed, and to gain insights into medical and care issues. This reinforced working carers' sense of competence, helping them meet caregiving demands and see positive aspects in their situation. Carers' low levels of digital skills and anxieties about using computer-based support were barriers to utilising web-based support and could lead to deprioritising of this support. However, to help carers overcome these barriers and to better match web-based support to working carers' preferences and situations, web-based support must be introduced in a timely manner and must more accurately meet each working carer's unique caregiving needs. © 2016 Nordic College of Caring Science",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994525328,0,0,0,

A sequential explanatory mixed method design was employed consisting of an online survey with a convenience sample of 101 men who tested positive for the breast cancer mutation following up with an in-depth interview with a subsample of 26 males who participated in the survey. The survey results revealed that 70.3% (n = 45) considered “Family Risk” as the primary reason for getting BRCA tested; 21.9% (n = 14) considered “Medical Considerations,” and 7.8% (n = 5) considered “Social Support” as their primary reason. Male participants who were 50 years old or younger or who did not have children were more likely to consider medical reasons as the primary reason to get tested. In terms of self-concept, younger men were more stigmatized than their older counterparts; married men felt a greater loss of control with regard to their BRCA-positive mutation diagnosis than single men; and professional men as a whole felt more vulnerable to the negative influences of the disease than those who had already retired. Regression analysis results indicated that negative self-concept was strongly related to sampled males’ BRCA involvement 6 months after testing. Applying an intersectional approach to health care, decision-making outcomes among BRCA-positive mutation males provides an important lens for ascertaining the within-sex/gender demographic and psychosocial factors that affect the diversity of men’s pretesting and posttesting medical decisions. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027730788,0,0,0,

In this context, a survey has been conducted to assess nurses and caregivers’ palliative care training, needs and expectations. Methods An anonymous survey has been conducted in June 2015, including the nurses and all the caregivers of a 379-bed residential facility for the elderly requiring full time care and geriatric long time care unit. Dr-Chastaingt hospital is a public institution attached to Limoges university hospital (France). A questionnaire was addressed to review the local palliative context, the needs of heathcare personnels and their expectations. Results and discussion Ninety-four questionnaires were returned, with four white sheets and 90 filled forms. The main reasons for seeking advice from the palliative care team are the patient and his pain and caregivers suffering and at the third place family support. Pain management and end of life remain the main expectations of caregivers both for technical assistance, training and support. These results show a questioning on the end of life, a need for modeling in order to identify the tipping point between healing and terminal care. They also show the need to build a common space for dialogue between physicians, nurses, caregivers, patient and family in order to act together instead of interacting on a confrontational or suspicious way. The cooperation with the palliative care team is described both by the form and mode. The cooperation is based on meetings and practical cooperation (care, prescriptions, visits). Pain and autonomy assessments are regular but not systematic in geriatrics. The palliative care team trigger tools are not known (Pallia-10, Palliative Performans Scale). Conclusion Despite all the efforts, we have yet to build a collaborative network on the basis of a common palliative culture.

Methods: Attempts were made to re-contact, via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview, all 752 NEMS participants who reported mistreatment since age 60 at Wave I, as well as a randomly selected sample of non-mistreated NEMS participants Results: 183 NEMS Wave I elder abuse victims and 591 non-victims provided data. In bivariate analyses, elder mistreatment 8 years earlier increased risk of negative outcomes by 200–700%. However, multivariate analyses revealed that Current (Wave II) social support was highly protective against most negative outcomes (excepting PTSD), and even appeared to nullify effects of mistreatment on GAD and poor self-reported health. Conclusions: Outcomes of elder mistreatment have not been studied prospectively in a national sample. The NEMS 8-year follow-up findings indicate a strong relationship between elder mistreatment at Wave I and negative emotional and physical health 8 years later.

Methods First, we determined the technical abilities and needs of middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illnesses using smartphones. Then, we developed smartphone content through principles of user-centered design and modified an existing smartphone platform. Finally, we conducted a usability test using “think aloud” and verbal probing. Results We adapted a psychosocial self-management intervention to a smartphone application and tested its usability. Ten participants (mean age: 55.3 years, SD: 6.2 years) with serious mental illness and comorbid chronic health conditions reported a high level of usability and satisfaction with the smartphone application. Conclusions Middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness and limited technical abilities were able to participate in a process involving user-centered design and adaptation of a self-management intervention to be delivered by a smartphone. High usability ratings suggest that middle-aged and older adults with serious mental illness have the potential to use tailored smartphone interventions.

However, their abilities to participate in the online service system are often undermined by a continuing ‘digital divide’. This divide may be exacerbated by the strategies of service providers who fail to recognise and respond to the needs of older rural clients. This paper is based on a case study in Clare, a small rural town in South Australia, and examines the experiences of older residents and local service providers in trying to engage online for digital service delivery. Drawing on two sets of in-depth interviews, the study uses a mix of thematic content analysis and social network analysis to identify the nature and extent of digital interactions between older people and service providers, and the enablers and challenges for online service engagement. Older participants demonstrated considerable interest in learning how to use the Internet for accessing particular services, with social support networks and third party facilitators being crucial enablers. Service providers’ ambitions to engage with older people online appeared more limited as a result of entrenched stereotypes of older non-users, a lack of internal digital skills, as well as organisational and funding constraints. The case study findings emphasise the importance of balancing the views of older people and service providers in the design of online engagement strategies. These insights are critical for improving online service delivery in rural communities affected by an increasing withdrawal of physical services. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009876967,0,maybe,0,

The main reasons may be related to the decline in fertility rates, increased life expectancy, improved healthcare and the incorporation of healthier living habits, providing conditions for active aging. Active aging is a theme addressed by professionals who more directly that are related to the aging process. In this context, it is important to analyze and promote actions with the elderly population for this can be an integral and active part of the digital society, because increasingly the exercise of civic rights and duties to be carried out through digital platforms. At present, the digital society implies that all citizens are equipped with digital skills, in this particular case, given that the elderly population is referred to as computer exclusion population, it is urgent to create conditions to promote their digital inclusion that will enable them to true social inclusion thus providing active aging. Given the physiological and cognitive decline associated with aging is important to promote initiatives to prevent situations that could increase dementia among the elderly. In particular, there are already a number of digital applications (APPs) that aim to stimulation and cognitive training. In this research, we were used APPs in this area (Peak and Neuronation) which involved a sample of 18 seniors who attended USALBI (Universidade Sénior Albicastrense). This Project Workseeks to ascertain whether the use of digital applications (APPs) Peak & Neuronation can contribute to active aging of the elderly, with regard to cognitive training that they provide.

Part of this increased access may be the result of older adults who are living with a chronic disease and are reaching out for online support. Colorectal cancer (CRC) risk is among those concerns, particularly among middle-age and older minority populations where disparities exist. This exploratory study investigates information seeking behavior related to cancer factors (e.g. testing for colon cancer, cancer fatalism) and current social media usage among racial and ethnic minority groups (African American and Latinos) and Whites age 50 and older. The secondary data from the 2012 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) was analyzed to compare these populations. Results show that African Americans and Latinos were only slightly more likely to use social network sites to seek out cancer information compared to Whites. However, Whites were more likely to use the Internet to seek health information compared to African Americans and Latinos. In this sample, Whites were also more likely to be informed by a physician about CRC testing (p <.01). Whites were also more fatalistic about CRC (p<.001) and more likely to have self-reported receiving a positive diagnosis (p <.001). Implications of this study suggest that use of both traditional health information sources (physician) and the Internet (social media networks, Internet sites) have increased among older Americans and can serve as critical channels for cancer information and education. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978701848,0,0,0,

To investigate this, we focus on older adults 65+ residing in the Toronto locality of East York, using 42 interviews lasting about 90 minutes done in 2013–2014. We find that digital media help in mobilizing social support as well as maintaining and strengthening existing relationships with geographically near and distant contacts. This is especially important for those individuals (and their network members) who have limited mobility. Once older adults start using digital media, they become routinely incorporated into their lives, used in conjunction with the telephone to maintain existing relationships but not to develop new ones. Contradicting fears that digital media are inadequate for meaningful relational contact, we found that these older adults considered social support exchanged via digital media to be real support that cannot be dismissed as token. Older adults especially used and valued digital media for companionship. They also used them for coordination, maintaining ties, and casual conversations. Email was used more with friends than relatives; some Skype was used with close family ties. Our research suggests that policy efforts need to emphasize the strengthening of existing networks rather than the establishment of interventions that are outside of older adults’ existing ties. Our findings also show that learning how to master technology is in itself a form of social support that provides opportunities to strengthen the networks of older adults. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017430982,0,1,0,

In order to estimate an accurate age or age group of a facial image, most of the existing algorithms require a huge face data set attached with age labels. This imposes a constraint on the utilization of the immensely unlabeled or weakly labeled training data, e.g., the huge amount of human photos in the social networks. These images may provide no age label, but it is easy to derive the age difference for an image pair of the same person. To improve the age estimation accuracy, we propose a novel learning scheme to take advantage of these weakly labeled data through the deep convolutional neural networks. For each image pair, Kullback-Leibler divergence is employed to embed the age difference information. The entropy loss and the cross entropy loss are adaptively applied on each image to make the distribution exhibit a single peak value. The combination of these losses is designed to drive the neural network to understand the age gradually from only the age difference information. We also contribute a data set, including more than 100 000 face images attached with their taken dates. Each image is both labeled with the timestamp and people identity. Experimental results on two aging face databases show the advantages of the proposed age difference learning system, and the state-of-the-art performance is gained. © 2016 IEEE.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021730725,0,0,0,

Mobile games that require cognitive skills were tested with a test group in a Chinese elderly care home. User feedback was collected by interviews and observations in the game event. The most noteworthy finding was the positive user experience both of the elderly and the nursing staff and the experience of the games being cognitively stimulating. Games also seemed to provide potential for self-rehabilitation and to support social interaction. Also some special characteristics related to the Chinese culture were found in the game trial, although the experiences were surprisingly similar compared to original Finnish trials despite the cultural differences of Finland and China.

Method: Over 22 days, 135 older adults with knee OA reported their morning self-efficacy for being physically active throughout the day using a handheld computer and wore an accelerometer to measure moderate activity and steps. Results: Morning self-efficacy had a significant positive effect on steps and moderate-intensity activity throughout that day, above and beyond the effects of demographic background and other psychosocial factors as well as spouses' support and social control. The lagged effect of morning self-efficacy on the next day's physical activity and the reciprocal lagged effect of physical activity on the next day's self-efficacy were not significant. Positive between-person effects of self-efficacy on physical activity were found. Conclusions: Future research should aim to better understand the mechanisms underlying fluctuations in patients' daily self-efficacy, and target patients' daily self-efficacy as a modifiable psychological mechanism for promoting physical activity. © 2017 American Psychological Association.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014594426,1,1,0,

Our objective was to characterise retired professional ice hockey players' cognitive and psychosocial functioning in relation to concussion exposure and apolipoprotein μ 4 status. Methods Alumni athletes (N=33, aged 34-71â €..years) and an age-matched sample of comparison participants (N=18) were administered measures of cognitive function and questionnaires concerning psychosocial and psychiatric functioning. Results No significant group differences were found on neuropsychological measures of speeded attention, verbal memory or visuospatial functions, nor were significant differences observed on computerised measures of response speed, inhibitory control and visuospatial problem solving. Reliable group differences in cognitive performance were observed on tests of executive and intellectual function; performance on these measures was associated with concussion exposure. Group differences were observed for cognitive, affective and behavioural impairment on psychosocial questionnaires and psychiatric diagnoses. There was no evidence of differential effects associated with age in the alumni athletes. Possession of an apolipoprotein 4 allele was associated with increased endorsement of psychiatric complaints, but not with objective cognitive performance. Conclusions We found only subtle objective cognitive impairment in alumni athletes in the context of high subjective complaints and psychiatric impairment. Apolipoprotein 4 status related to psychiatric, but not cognitive status. These findings provide benchmarks for the degree of cognitive and behavioural impairment in retired professional athletes and a point of comparison for future neuroimaging and longitudinal studies. © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Research on older adults' use of the Internet has merely focused on users versus nonusers and consequences of Internet use and nonuse. Older adults are a heterogeneous group, which may implicate that their use of the Internet is diverse as well. Older adults can use the Internet for different activities, and this usage can be of influence on benefits the Internet can have for them.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper was to describe the diversity or heterogeneity in the activities for which older adults use the Internet and determine whether diversity is related to social or health-related variables.METHODS: We used data of a national representative Internet panel in the Netherlands. Panel members aged 65 years and older and who have access to and use the Internet were selected (N=1418). We conducted a latent class analysis based on the Internet activities that panel members reported to spend time on. Second, we described the identified clusters with descriptive statistics and compared the clusters using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests.RESULTS: Four clusters were distinguished. Cluster 1 was labeled as the ""practical users"" (36.88%, n=523). These respondents mainly used the Internet for practical and financial purposes such as searching for information, comparing products, and banking. Respondents in Cluster 2, the ""minimizers"" (32.23%, n=457), reported lowest frequency on most Internet activities, are older (mean age 73 years), and spent the smallest time on the Internet. Cluster 3 was labeled as the ""maximizers"" (17.77%, n=252); these respondents used the Internet for various activities, spent most time on the Internet, and were relatively younger (mean age below 70 years). Respondents in Cluster 4, the ""social users,"" mainly used the Internet for social and leisure-related activities such as gaming and social network sites. The identified clusters significantly differed in age (P<.001, ω2=0.07), time spent on the Internet (P<.001, ω2=0.12), and frequency of downloading apps (P<.001, ω2=0.14), with medium to large effect sizes. Social and health-related variables were significantly different between the clusters, except social and emotional loneliness. However, effect sizes were small. The minimizers scored significantly lower on psychological well-being, instrumental activities of daily living (iADL), and experienced health compared with the practical users and maximizers.CONCLUSIONS: Older adults are a diverse group in terms of their activities on the Internet. This underlines the importance to look beyond use versus nonuse when studying older adults' Internet use. The clusters we have identified in this study can help tailor the development and deployment of eHealth intervention to specific segments of the older population.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031091663,1,1,0,

As people age in their homes, there is a greater risk of social isolation, which can be ameliorated by informal support networks. This study examined the relationship between changes in social support networks for older people living in a regional area following weekly videoconference groups delivered to the home. Between February and June 2014, we delivered 44 weekly group meetings via videoconference to participants in a regional town in Australia. The meetings provided participants with education and an opportunity to discuss health issues and connect with others in similar circumstances. An uncontrolled, pre-post-test methodology was employed. A social network tool was completed by 45 (87%) participants either pre- or post-intervention, of which 24 (46%) participants completed the tool pre- and post-intervention. In addition, 14 semi-structured interviews and 4 focus groups were conducted. Following the intervention, participants identified increased membership of their social networks, although they did not identify individuals from the weekly videoconference groups. The most important social support networks remained the same pre- and post-intervention namely, health professionals, close family and partners. However, post-intervention participants identified friends and wider family as more important to managing their chronic condition compared to pre-intervention. Participants derived social support, in particular, companionship, emotional and informational support as well as feeling more engaged with life, from the weekly videoconference meetings. Videoconference education groups delivered into the home can provide social support and enhance self-management for older people with chronic conditions. They provide the opportunity to develop a virtual social support network containing new and diverse social connections. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983751468,0,1,1,

Methods: This analysis used a convenience sample of participants (N=231) who had been newly prescribed an antidepressant in a randomized controlled trial of a program to improve antidepressant adherence and depression outcomes among older adults (≥55). After determining the proportion of participants with and without MDD (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV), the authors compared groups on demographic, clinical, and psychosocial characteristics, including the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey physical and mental component summary scores (PCS and MCS). Logistic regression was used to test the association of these characteristics with antidepressant use in the absence of MDD. Results: Most (57%) participants did not have MDD. This group was older (69.4 versus 64.7, p<001), had a larger proportion of white participants (82% versus 56%, p<001), and reported better physical (PCS, 43.4 versus 39.9, p=.03) and emotional (MCS, 40.2 versus 30.5, p<001) well-being compared with the group with MDD. In the final regression model, white race (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=3.11, p=.03) and better emotional well-being (AOR=1.16, p<001) were associated with antidepressant use in the absence of MDD. Conclusions: Older adults prescribed antidepressants in the absence of MDD did not report similar distress levels compared with their counterparts with MDD.

Thus, this study aims to explore the risk factors of MCI as compared to UA and SA among older adults, in a large community based cohort study in Malaysia. Method: 1993 subjects from four states in Malaysia were recruited. A comprehensive interview-based questionnaire was administered to determine socio-demographic information, followed by assessments to evaluate cognitive function, functional status, dietary intake, lifestyle and psychosocial status. Risk factors of cognitive impairment were assessed using the ordinal logistic regression (OLR). Result: The prevalence of SA, UA and MCI in this study was 11, 73 and 16 % respectively. OLR indicated that higher fasting blood sugar, hyperlipidemia, disability, lower education level, not regularly involved in technical based activities, limited use of modern technologies, lower intake of fruits and fresh fruit juices and not practicing calorie restriction were among the risk factors of poor cognitive performance in this study. Conclusion: This study will be a stepping stone for future researchers to develop intervention strategies to prevent cognitive decline. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961115717,1,1,0,

We aimed to assess feasibility, reach and costs of implementing a new tailored computer-aided health and social risk appraisal system in primary care. Methods: Design: Feasibility study. Setting: Five General Practices in London (Ealing) and Hertfordshire, United Kingdom (UK) Participants: Random sample of patients aged 65 + years. Intervention: The Multi-dimensional Risk Appraisal for Older people (MRA-O) system includes: 1) Postal questionnaire including health, lifestyle, social and environmental domains; 2) Software system generating a personalised feedback report with advice on health and wellbeing; 3) Follow-up of people with new concerning or complex needs by GPs or practice nurses. Evaluation: Feasibility of implementation; participant wellbeing, functional ability and quality of life; social needs, health risks, potential lifestyle changes; and costs of implementation. Results: Response rates to initial postal invitations were low (526/1550, 34%). Of these, 454/526 (86%) completed MRA-O assessments. Compared to local UK Census data on older people, participants were younger, more were owner-occupiers and fewer were from ethnic minority groups than expected. A range of problems was identified by participants, including pain in last week (269/438, 61.4%), low physical activity (173/453, 38.2%), sedentary lifestyle (174/447, 38.3%), falls (117/439, 26.7%), incontinence (111/441 25.2%), impaired vision 116/451 (25.7%), impaired hearing (145/431, 33.6%), depressed mood (71/451, 15.7%), impaired memory (44/444 9.9%), social isolation (46/449, 10.2%) and loneliness (31/442, 7.0%). Self-rated health was good/excellent in 312/437 (71.4%), and quality of life and well-being were slightly above age-specific population norms. Implementation costs were low. Practices reviewed medical records of 143/454 (31.5%) of participants as a consequence of their responses, and actively followed up 110/454 (24.2%) of their patients. Conclusions: A computer-aided risk appraisal system was feasible for General Practices to implement, yields useful information about health and social problems, and identifies individual needs. Participation rates were however low, particularly for the oldest old, the poorest, and ethnic minority groups, and this type of intervention may increase inequalities in access. Widespread implementation of this approach would require work to address potential inequalities. © 2017 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016103168,1,1,0,

Design, participants and setting: Cross-sectional survey of currently practising Australian doctors aged 55 or older registered with a commercial database. Participants completed an online self-report questionnaire in October 2015. Main outcome measures: Associations between intention to retire and demographic and practice characteristics; health; emotional, social and financial resources; work centrality; and anxiety about ageing. Results: 62.0% of 1048 respondents (17.5% response rate) intended to retire, 11.4% had no intention of retiring and 26.6% were unsure. The odds of retiring were higher for those with adequate financial resources (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.18-1.44) and greater anxiety about ageing (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09); the odds of retiring were lower for international medical graduates (aOR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.44-0.85), for those with greater work centrality (aOR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85e 0.92) and greater emotional resources (aOR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.98).

Conclusion: Intention to retire was determined by a mixture of professional and psychosocial characteristics. In particular, our results support the view that delaying retirement by doctors may be related to the primacy of work compared with other life roles.

However, recent evidence suggests that the within-person association between stress and negative affect (i.e., affective stress-reactivity) may increase over time and in times of high stress, at least in older adult populations. The objective of the current study was to examine the across-time stability of stress-reactivity in a younger sample–emerging adulthood–and examine neuroticism, overall stress, social support and life events as potential moderators of stability. Design & Methods: Undergraduate students (N = 540, mean age = 18.76 years) participated in a measurement burst design, completing a 30-day daily diary annually for four years. Moderators were assessed once at every burst, while negative affect and stress were assessed daily via a secure website. Results & Conclusions: Findings suggest a relatively high degree of rank-order and mean-level stability in stress-reactivity across the four years, and within-person changes in neuroticism and overall stress predicted concurrent shifts in stress-reactivity. Unlike older samples, there was no evidence of an overall linear change in stability over time, though there was significant variability in linear change trajectories. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989229135,1,0,0,

Computer classes for older adults make significant contributions to social and cognitive aspects of aging. Games in a virtual reality (VR) environment stimulate the practice of communicative and cognitive skills and might also bring benefits to older adults. Furthermore, it might help to initiate their contact to the modern technology. The purpose of this study protocol is to evaluate the effects of practicing VR games during computer classes on the level of loneliness of students of an elderly reference center. Methods and Analysis: This study will be a prospective longitudinal study with a randomised cross-over design, with subjects aged 50 years and older, of both genders, spontaneously enrolled in computer classes for beginners. Data collection will be done in 3 moments: moment 0 (T0) - at baseline; moment 1 (T1) - after 8 typical computer classes; and moment 2 (T2) - after 8 computer classes which include 15 minutes for practicing games in VR environment. A characterization questionnaire, the short version of the Short Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults (SELSA-S) and 3 games with VR (Random, MoviLetrando, and Reaction Time) will be used. For the intervention phase 4 other games will be used: Coincident Timing, Motor Skill Analyser, Labyrinth, and Fitts. The statistical analysis will compare the evolution in loneliness perception, performance, and reaction time during the practice of the games between the 3 moments of data collection. Performance and reaction time during the practice of the games will also be correlated to the loneliness perception.

We developed and qualitatively evaluated an English training program for older French adults; our principal objective was to determine whether a program integrating technology is feasible for this population. We conducted a 4-month pilot study (16, 2-h sessions) with 14 French participants, (nine women, five men, average age 75). Questionnaires were administered pre- and post-intervention to measure cognitive level and subjective feelings of loneliness or social isolation; however, these scores did not improve significantly. Post-intervention, semi-directive interviews were carried out with participants, and a content/theme analysis was performed. Five main themes were identified from the interviews: Associations with school, attitudes toward English, motivation for learning English, attitudes toward the program's organization, and social ties. The program was found to be feasible for this age group, yet perceived as quite difficult for participants who lacked experience with English. Nonetheless, most participants found the program to be stimulating and enjoyable.

Methods: The architecture proposed is based on an open software platform and standard personal computing hardware.

Results: An actual system as a proof-of-concept was designed, implemented, and deployed. Applications range from social network clients to vital signs monitoring; from interactive TV contests to conventional online care applications such as medication reminders or telemedicine. Conclusion: In both cases, the results have been very positive, confirming the initial perception of the TV as a convenient, easy-to-use technology to provide social and health care. The TV set is a much more familiar computing interface for most senior users, and as a consequence, smart TVs become a most convenient solution for the design and implementation of applications and services targeted to this user group.

Method Qualitative design and analysis of 14 semi-structured interviews with seven participants before and after a period with computer-assisted home training. The interviews evolved around themes, such as the elderly participants' self-efficacy, motivation and acceptance of the technology. Results Age was not an excuse for the modest exercise compliance. The participants were basically self-efficient and accepted the technology, but their knowledge and understanding of the training programme were insufficient. The participants asked for a greater variation in the exercises and asked for closer contact with the physiotherapist. When Mitii is used for vestibular rehabilitation, the system has some limitations. Conclusions The modest level of exercise compliance can be explained by (1) missing variety of exercise speed and duration and lack of introducing new exercises, (2) insufficient interaction with the physiotherapist regarding the participants’ performance and lack of social contact with other patients and (3) desire for a deeper understanding of the training programme with supplying information on the parts of the vestibular system addressed by the training.Implications for Rehabilitation Computer-assisted technologies should generate feedback on the quality of user performance and inform the patient of the relevance of the exercise. The technology should support social contact among patients with the same diagnosis and establish contact with the physiotherapist at the hospital advice and feedback.

As a positive technology, it can be classified at the eudaimonic level; (2) 'EARTH of Well-Being', a virtual reality application designed to induce positive emotions in a controlled way and reinforce psychological resources, covering the hedonic and eudaimonic levels; (3) 'Smiling is Fun', a positive technology intervention designed to generate coping resources and foster psychological well-being at both at the hedonic and eudaimonic levels; and (4) 'BUTLER', which aims to contribute to improve the quality of life of the elderly. It includes the most popular Internet services integrated into a single platform, adapting its characteristics to the needs of the elderly population. It is designed to cover the three levels of positive technologies: hedonic, eudaimonic, and social interaction. All these applications are presented and the different possibilities and advantages that this perspective may involve are analysed. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

In this article, we address age differences in health-related quality of life in older disaster survivors exposed to the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and the 2010 BP Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the role played by social engagement in influencing these differences. Methods Participants were noncoastal residents, current coastal residents, and current coastal fishers who were economically affected by the BP oil spill. Social engagement was estimated on the basis of disruptions in charitable work and social support after the 2005 hurricanes relative to a typical year before the storms. Criterion measures were participants' responses to the SF-36 Health Survey which includes composite indexes of physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) health. Results The results of logistic regressions indicated that age was inversely associated with SF-36 PCS scores. A reduction in perceived social support after Hurricane Katrina was also inversely associated with SF-36 MCS scores. Conclusions These results illuminate risk factors that impact well-being among older adults after multiple disasters. Implications of these data for psychological adjustment after multiple disasters are considered. © 2017 Society for Disaster Medicine and Public Health, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006263968,1,maybe,0,

The purpose of this pilot trial is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel intervention to reduce loneliness, improve functional fitness, social connectedness, hearing and health-related quality of life in older adults with HL. Methods: This 10-week, single-blind, pilot randomized control trial (RCT) will include a convenience sample of ambulatory adults aged 65 years or older with self-reported HL. Following baseline assessments, participants will be randomized to either intervention (exercise, health education, socialization and group auditory rehabilitation (GAR)) or control (GAR only) groups. The intervention group will attend a local YMCA twice a week and the control group once a week. Intervention sessions will include 45 min of strengthening, balance and resistance exercises, 30 min of group walking at a self-selected pace and 60 min of interactive health education or GAR. The control group will attend 60-min GAR sessions. GAR sessions will include education about hearing, hearing technologies, enhancing communication skills, and psychosocial support. Pre-post trial data collection and measures will include: functional fitness (gait speed, 30-s Sit to Stand Test), hearing and health-related quality of life, loneliness, depression, social participation and social support. At trial end, feasibility (recruitment, randomization, retention, acceptability) and GAR will be evaluated. Discussion: Despite evidence suggesting that HL is associated with declines in functional fitness, there are no studies aimed at addressing functional fitness declines associated with the disability of HL. This pilot trial will provide knowledge about the physical, mental and social impacts on health related to HL as a disability. This will inform the feasibility of a larger RCT and preliminary evidence about the initial effects of a novel, community-based, holistic intervention addressing both the negative psychosocial and functional physical effects of HL among older adults.

These events require a dissolution of social and emotional ties, adjustments in daily routine and changes in identity and perspectives for the future. After a normative grief or distress reaction, most individuals cope well with the loss. However, some develop a prolonged grief reaction. Internet-based self-help interventions have proved beneficial for a broad range of disorders, including complicated grief. Based on the task model and the dual-process model of coping with bereavement, we developed a guided internet-based self-help intervention for individuals who experienced marital bereavement, separation or divorce at least 6 months prior to enrolment. The intervention consists of 10 text-based self-help sessions and one supportive email a week. The primary purpose of this study is the evaluation of the feasibility and efficacy of the intervention compared with a waiting control group. The secondary purpose is to compare the effects in bereaved and separated participants. Furthermore, we aim to analyze other predictors, moderators and mediators of the outcome, such as age, psychological distress and intensity of use of the intervention. Methods: The design is a randomized controlled trial with a waiting control condition of 12 weeks and a 24-weeks follow-up. At least 72 widowed or separated participants will be recruited via our study website and internet forums. Primary outcomes are reductions in grief symptoms, depression and psychological distress. Secondary outcome measures are related to loneliness, satisfaction with life, embitterment and the sessions. Discussion: The trial will provide insights into the acceptance and efficacy of internet-based interventions among adults experiencing grief symptoms, psychological distress and adaptation problems in daily life after spousal bereavement, separation or divorce. Findings will add to existing knowledge by (1) evaluating an internet-based intervention specifically designed for spousal bereavement and its consequences; (2) testing whether this intervention is equally effective for individuals after separation or divorce; and (3) suggesting adaptations to improve the efficacy of the intervention, selective indication and adaptations for different needs.

Intervention programs to promote physical activity in older adults, either in group or home settings, have shown equivalent health outcomes but different results when considering adherence. Group-based interventions seem to achieve higher participation in the long-term. However, there are many factors that can make of group exercises a challenging setting for older adults. A major one, due to the heterogeneity of this particular population, is the difference in the level of skills. In this paper we report on the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes of a technology-based intervention that enable online group exercises in older adults with different levels of skills. Methods. A total of 37 older adults between 65 and 87 years old followed a personalized exercise program based on theOTAGOprogram for fall prevention, for a period of eight weeks. Participants could join online group exercises using a tablet-based application. Participants were assigned either to the Control group, representing the traditional individual home-based training program, or the Social group, representing the online group exercising. Pre- and post- measurements were taken to analyze the physical, psychological and social wellbeing outcomes. Results. After the eight-weeks training program there were improvements in both the Social and Control groups in terms of physical outcomes, given the high level of adherence of both groups. Considering the baseline measures, however, the results suggest that while in the Control group fitter individuals tended to adhere more to the training, this was not the case for the Social group, where the initial level had no effect on adherence. For psychological outcomes there were improvements on both groups, regardless of the application used. There was no significant difference between groups in social wellbeing outcomes, both groups seeing a decrease in loneliness despite the presence of social features in the Social group. However, online social interactions have shown to be correlated to the decrease in loneliness in the Social group. Conclusion. The results indicate that technology-supported online group-exercising which conceals individual differences in physical skills is effective in motivating and enabling individuals who are less fit to train as much as fitter individuals. This not only indicates the feasibility of training together despite differences in physical skills but also suggests that online exercise might reduce the effect of skills on adherence in a social context. However, results from this pilot are limited to a small sample size and therefore are not conclusive. Longer term interventions with more participants are instead recommended to assess impacts on wellbeing and behavior change. © 2017 Baez et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016942354,1,1,1,

METHODS: Participants (N.=32) were assigned to one of three groups: training group (N.=16), mobile group (N.=7) and control group (N.=9). Training group and mobile group performed the same training program, based on strength training with elastics bands and aerobic exercise, during 10 weeks; only the delivery mode differed. RESULTS: The mobile group increased handgrip strength, aerobic capacity and decreased systolic blood pressure and heart rate after exercise though there were no significant differences respect to control group. The training group decreased significantly systolic blood pressure (P=0.038), diastolic blood pressure (P=0.005), mean arterial pressure (P=0.006) and heart rate after exercise (P=0.002), respect to control group.

There is variability however in how much benefit each recipient derives from his or her CI. This study’s primary objective is to determine the effects of individual and environmental characteristics on CI outcomes. Design: Seventy-six adults who developed postlingual severe to profound hearing loss and received their first unilateral CI at 65 years and older were eligible for the study. Fifty-five patients were asked to participate and the 33 (60%) with complete data were classified as “group 1.” The remaining patients were placed in “group 2.” Primary outcomes included changes in quality of life and open-set speech perception scores. Independent variables included age, health status, trait emotional intelligence (EI), comfort with technology, and living arrangements. Survey outcomes and audiological measurements were collected prospectively at 12 months after surgery, whereas preoperative data were collected retrospectively. Comparisons between groups 1 and 2 were made. Wilcoxon signed rank test, Spearman correlations, Mann–Whitney tests, Chi-square tests, and linear regressions were performed only on group 1 data. Results: Having a CI was associated with improved quality of life and speech perception. Familiarity with electronic tablets was associated with increased 12-month postoperative AzBio gains when adjusted for preoperative AzBio scores (adjusted p = 0.019), but only marginally significant when a family-wise error correction was applied (p = 0.057). Furthermore, patients who lived with other people scored at least 20 points higher on the AzBio sentences than those who lived alone (adjusted p = 0.046). Finally, consultation with an auditory rehabilitation therapist was associated with higher self-reported quality of life (p = 0.035). Conclusion: This study suggests that in a cohort of older patients cochlear implantation is associated with a meaningful increase in both quality of life and speech perception. Furthermore, it suggests the potential importance of adjunct support and services, including the tailoring of CI rehabilitation sessions depending on the patient’s familiarity with technology and living situation. Investment in rehabilitation and other services is associated with improvements in quality of life and may mitigate clinical, individual and social risk factors for poor communication outcome.

My-AHA proposes a holistic view of age-related frailty, comprising frailty across interrelated domains of: cognition, physical function, mood, social isolation and sleep. Age-related frailty represents a major burden to older adults and social and health care systems. Early detection and intervention are crucial in sustaining active and healthy ageing (AHA) and slowing or reversing further decline. The main aim of My-AHA is to reduce frailty risk in older adults at risk of becoming frail by improving physical activity and cognitive function, psychological state, social resources, nutrition, sleep and overall well-being. It will empower older citizens to better manage their own health, resulting in healthcare cost savings. My-AHA will use state-of-the-art analytical concepts to provide new ways of health monitoring and disease prevention through individualized profiling and personalized recommendations, feedback and support. An ICT-based platform will detect defined risks in the frailty domains early and accurately via nonstigmatising embedded sensors and data readily available in the daily living environment of older adults. When risk is detected, My-AHA will provide individually tailored ICT-based interventions with a scientific evidence base of efficacy, including vetted interventions from established providers of medical and AHA support. These interventions will be deployed in a manner designed to motivate users to participate in exercise, cognitively stimulating games and social networking to achieve long-term behavioural change, sustained by continued end user engagement with My-AHA. By this, different platforms (Smart Companion, iStoppFalls, etc.) will be connected by the My-AHA Middleware and combine information and data from different sources with a decision support system for choosing the personal interventions. The My-AHA platform will be tested in a multicentre randomized controlled trial involving centres across Europe, Japan, South Korea and Australia. The project is currently in Alpha phase testing. Following alpha wave testing, the RCT will commence including feasibility and manageability testing of the pre-post design. During the first project year, interventions were defined and analysed for their proven effectiveness and their chance for combination. Selection of the platforms has been completed with middleware development approaching completion. The prototype setup has been deployed with the first participants in the Alpha Wave. During this time, experience on the new data protection regulation for EU countries was gained as well as for business opportunities for the developed interventions and results of the trial.

This paper presents the translation of the results of a field study into multilevel and multidisciplinary educational material. Method: During home visits, community-dwelling seniors were interviewed regarding reasons for their level of technology use. All types of technology that could support activities of daily living, were included. Resulting themes formed the basis of the development of personas and scripts for education. Next, lecturers from vocational and higher technical and care education developed an evidence-based educational module from the perspective of professional service provision. Results: 53 older adults were interviewed. The level of technology use is influenced by six themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioural options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organisations; and the role of the physical environment. Four personas were developed, one of which was featured into a film, with twelve separate scenes. For each scene, lessons were developed that consisted of specific questions (first level), in-depth questions (second level) and suggestions for classes (for lecturers). Three personas were translated into case histories. Conclusion: Older adults’ perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context.

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the factors that may influence the motivation of older people to use exergames to improve their physical function and reduce fall risk. Methods: Mixed methods were employed in which 14 semistructured interviews were conducted with older people (n=12, aged 59-91 years) from 2 assisted living facilities in the North West of the United Kingdom. The older people participated in a 6-week trial of exergames along with one manager and one physiotherapist; 81 h of observation and Technology Acceptance Model questionnaires were conducted. Results: The findings suggest that the participants were intrinsically motivated to participate in the exergames because of the enjoyment experienced when playing the exergames and perceived improvements in their physical and mental health and social confidence. The social interaction provided in this study was an important extrinsic motivator that increased the intrinsic motivation to adhere to the exergame program. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that exergames may be a promising tool for delivering falls prevention exercises and increasing adherence to exercise in older people.

Physical health deteriorates more rapidly with age among men and women with lower socioeconomic status (SES) than among those with higher SES. The biological processes underlying these differences are best understood by adopting a life course approach. In this paper we introduce the pan- European LIFEPATH project which uses multiple cohorts - including biomarker data - to investigate ageing as a phenomenon with two broad stages across life: build-up and decline. The ‘build-up’ stage, from conception and early intra-uterine life to late adolescence or early twenties, is characterised by rapid successions of developmentally and socially sensitive periods. The second stage, starting in early adulthood, is a period of ‘decline’ from maximum attained health to loss of function, overt disease and death. LIFEPATH adopts a study design that integrates social science and public health approaches with biology (including molecular epidemiology), using well-characterised population cohorts and omics measurements (particularly epigenomics). LIFEPATH includes information and biological samples from 17 cohorts, including several with extensive phenotyping and repeat biological samples, and a very large cohort (1 million individuals) without biological samples (WHIP, from Italy). The countries that are covered by the cohorts are France, Italy, Portugal, Ireland, UK, Finland, Switzerland and Australia. These cohorts are only a small proportion of all cohorts available in Europe, but we have chosen them for the combination of good measures of socioeconomic status, risk factors for non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and biomarkers already measured (or availability of blood samples for further testing). The majority of cohorts include ‘hard’ outcomes (diabetes, cancer, Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), total mortality), and the extensively phenotyped cohorts also include several measurements of the functional components of healthy ageing, including frailty, impaired vision, cognitive function, renal and brain function, osteoporosis, sleep disturbances and mental health. All age groups are represented with two birth cohorts, one cohort of adolescents and several cohorts encompassing young adults (age 18 and above). Furthermore, there is a strong representation of elderly subjects in seven cohorts. The specific objectives of the project are: (a) to show that healthy ageing is an achievable goal for society; (b) to improve the understanding of the mechanisms through which healthy ageing pathways diverge by SES, by investigating life course biological pathways using omic technologies; (c) to examine the consequences of the current economic recession on health and the biology of ageing (and the consequent increase in social inequalities); (d) to provide updated, relevant and innovative evidence for healthy ageing policies (particularly ‘health in all policies’) using both observational studies and an experimental approach based on a reanalysis of data from a ‘conditional cash transfer’ randomised experiment in New York and new data collected as part of an earned income tax credit randomised experiment in Atlanta and New York. To achieve these objectives, data are used from three categories of studies: 1. national census-based followup data to obtain mortality by socioeconomic status; 2. cohorts with intense phenotyping and repeat biological samples; 3. large cohorts with biological samples. With these objectives and methodologies, LIFEPATH seeks to provide updated, relevant and innovative evidence to underpin future policies and strategies for the promotion of healthy ageing, targeted disease prevention and clinical interventions that address the issue of social disparities in ageing and the social determinants of health. The present paper describes the design and some initial results of LIFEPATH as an example of the integration of social and biological sciences to provide evidence for public health policies. © 2017, Society for Longitudinal and Life Course Studies.

The question arises how recent developments in robotics can contribute to the care for older people. The study is part of the EU-funded ENRICHME project. Objectives of Study. The aim of the study was to investigate opinions of occupational therapy students (OTS), as future professional caregivers, on the use of robots in care for older people. Methods. It included 26 OTS from Poznan University of Medical Sciences. To collect data, the Users’ Needs, Requirements, and Abilities Questionnaire (UNRAQ) was developed. Findings. OTS perceived the robot as “a useful device” and “an assistant” rather than “a companion” (P < 0.01). In their opinion, the most important functions of the robot were related to health aspects (emergency alarms, health parameters monitoring, physical activity and memory training, and reminders about medication, drinks, etc.), scored positively by 23-26 OTS. Functions such as mood detection, encouraging to contact with friends, and monitoring of food consumption were accepted by 16-17 OTS. Two statements concerning social functions (accompanying in everyday activities and decreasing the sense of loneliness) were rated positively by less the than half of the participants. Limitations and Recommendations for Further Research. A module concerning technology use, including robotics, should constitute an important part of the curricula of both academic and continuous education of OTS. © 2017 Sławomir Tobis et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029375005,1,0,0,

Objective: This study deals with the acceptance and impact of a tablet-based memory game, which was played on a weekly or semiweekly basis by visitors in two daycare units. Material and methods: Within the framework of focus groups the technical system was adapted for elderly users. The video-assisted data at the level of the game and the dynamics were investigated with respect to interaction and communication. Results: The analysis of psychological observation forms and game protocols, which were conducted over a period of 3 months, indicated different effects of the game on psychosocial and cognitive activation. The individual memory cards in particular served as an intensification of communication and a stimulation of episodic memory. Finally, with video analysis during the whole game setting three theoretical relationship patterns of the spheres playing and speech could be depicted. Conclusion: Coherence, separation and incoherence of playing and speech are different forms of interaction in which individual and collaborative competences of people with and without dementia can be visualized.

Objective: To identify best practices among KTx professionals when considering individuals in LTC settings for transplantation. Design and Setting: A cross-sectional survey administered online to US transplant professionals via e-mail LISTSERVs and other professional networks. Participants: One hundred twenty-six KTx professionals working in the United States. Main Outcome Measures: The survey was composed of demographic questions and 6 hypothetical scenarios. These scenarios asked participants to assess transplant candidacy of patients with ESRD living in LTC settings based on the information provided in the scenario. Each scenario presented a different variable that necessitated LTC placement, including lack of social support, moderate intellectual disability, stable neurological condition, mild dementia, a psychiatric condition controlled on medications, and limited mobility. Results: The only scenario that elicited an overwhelmingly negative response was mild dementia with 73.9% of participants unwilling to consider such patients for KTx. By contrast, the proportion of KTx professionals reluctant to proceed with KTx in the remaining scenarios ranged between 40.0% and 50.6%. Conclusions: This survey of a large number of KTx professionals suggests that there is presently no best practice consensus regarding offering KTx to patients living in LTC settings.

As decision-making regarding colorectal surgery is challenging in the older patients, it is important to have insight in the potential impact due to ostomies. Methods: An internet-based survey was sent to all members with registered email addresses of the Dutch Ostomy Patient Association. Results: The response rate was 49 %; 932 cases were included of whom 526 were aged <70 years old (“younger respondents”), 301 were aged between 70 and 79 years old (“the elderly”), and 105 were aged ≥80 years old (“oldest old”). Ostomy-related limitations were similar in the different age groups, just as uncertainty (8–10 %) and dependency (18–22 %) due to the ostomy.

Unlike feminine hygiene products that are designed to absorb menstrual blood, these Class 1 medical devices (classified by the United States [US] Federal Drug Administration) are specifically designed to absorb and contain urine and feces. Absorbent products are also useful in mitigating the potential clinical complications from incontinence, such as skin irritation, breakdown, and the development of wounds in the perineal area. High-performing products are also vital in supporting individuals in dealing with the very stressful psycho-social implications of incontinence, such as embarrassing visible leakage, unpleasant odors, and even social isolation (Payne D. Selecting appropriate absorbent products to treat urinary incontinence. Br J Community Nurs. 2015;20(11):551-8). Individuals that benefit from other treatment options for incontinence, such as behavioral interventions, drug therapies, or surgical procedures, can utilize absorbent products as an adjunct for additional protection, personal hygiene, and confidence. These products are particularly useful in supporting persons who are unable to benefit from other treatments or interventions and therefore remain incontinent, such as disabled individuals, the elderly, or the very ill. To meet the varied needs of individuals and their lifestyles, these products include a variety of designs, absorbency levels, and options for use, and are utilized across the continuum of care, from the active and independent consumer at home, to the mostly immobile or bed-bound dependent patient in a clinical care setting. These products can be readily accessed to provide treatment in clinical settings, or purchased through retail channels in stores or via the web online. Over the past decade, as acuity rates and accompanying medical conditions have increased while the population ages, there is rising demand for more options in this product category, which has even been cited as the fastest-growing household product business (Eisen S. Betting on boomers, P and G enters the adult diaper market. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Consumer News and Business Channel; 2014). This demand has also led to increased research and continuous innovation by manufacturers to capture more market share, as they invest heavily to out-perform competitors, capture consumer confidence, and increase the conversion rate to their brands. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042472266,0,0,0,

Objective: To explore solutions to this problem, our study examined older Veterans' reported ability to access technology through their close social ties. Methods: Data were collected via mail survey from a sample of Veterans aged 65 years and older (N=266). Results: Nearly half (44.0%, 117/266) of the sample reported having no Internet access. Yet, among those without current access, older Veterans reported having a median of 5 (IQR 7) close social ties with home Internet access. These older Veterans also reported that they would feel comfortable asking a median of 2 (IQR 4) social ties for help to access the Internet, and that a median of 2 (IQR 4) social ties would directly access the Internet for the older Veteran to help with health management. Conclusions: Findings suggest that even older Veterans without current Internet access have at least two social ties with home Internet who could be called upon for technology support. Thus, older Veterans may be willing to call upon these ""surrogate seekers"" for technology assistance and support in health management. This has implications for the digital divide, technology design, and health care policy. © Tana M Luger, Timothy P Hogan, Lorilei M Richardson, Lisa Cioffari-Bailiff, Kimberly Harvey, Thomas K Houston.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84996774879,1,1,0,

In many cases promising therapeutic options exist but patients are often left with visual deficits, which require a high degree of individualized counseling. This article analyzed which counseling offers can be found by patients and relatives using simple and routine searching via the internet. Method: Analyses were performed using colloquial search terms in the search engine Google in order to find counseling options for elderly people with visual impairments available via the internet. Results: With this strategy 189 offers for counseling were found, which showed very heterogeneous regional differences in distribution. The counseling options found in the internet commonly address topics such as therapeutic interventions or topics on visual aids corresponding to the professions offering rehabilitation most present in the internet, such as ophthalmologists and opticians. Regarding contents addressing psychosocial and help in daily tasks, self-help and support groups offer the most differentiated and broadest spectrum. Support offers for daily living tasks and psychosocial counseling from social providers were more difficult to find with these search terms despite a high presence in the internet. Discussion: There are a large number of providers of counseling and consulting for older persons with visual impairment. In order to be found more easily by patients and to be recommended more often by ophthalmologists and general practitioners, the presence of providers in the internet must be improved, especially providers of daily living and psychosocial support offers. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975166692,1,0,0,

Adults of different ages may share motivations for companionship and affection, but dating profiles may reveal differences in adults' goals. Theories addressing age-related changes in motivation suggest that younger adults are likely to emphasize themselves, achievements, attractiveness, and sexuality. Older adults are likely to present themselves positively and emphasize their existing relationships and health. Method: We collected 4,000 dating profiles from two popular websites to examine age differences in self-presentations. We used stratified sampling to obtain a sample equally divided by gender, aged 18-95 years. We identified 12 themes in the profiles using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software (Pennebaker, Booth, & Francis, 2007). Results: Regression analyses revealed that older adults were more likely to use first-person plural pronouns (e.g., we, our) and words associated with health and positive emotions. Younger adults were more likely to use first-person singular pronouns (e.g., I, my) and words associated with work and achievement. Discussion: Findings suggest that younger adults enhance the ""self"" when seeking romantic partnership. In contrast, older adults are more positive in their profiles and focus more on connectedness and relationships to others. © 2015 The Author.

They reported how much they enjoyed each activity on a 0-10 scale. An individual Enjoyment Index was calculated as the time-weighted average of each participant's enjoyment ratings. Time-weighted enjoyment ratings were also calculated for nine mutually exclusive and exhaustive activity domains (Sleep, Chores, Work, Social, Screen Time, Self-care, Quiet Time, Transport, Physical Activity) and sub-domains.RESULTS: the mean (±SD) Enjoyment Index was 7.43 ± 0.61, and was significantly and positively associated with well-being (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001) and sleep quality (P = 0.03 to P < 0.0001), and negatively associated with loneliness (P = 0.003 to P < 0.0001). Mean Enjoyment Index values increased significantly (P < 0.0001) from pre-retirement (7.19 ± 0.82) to post-retirement (7.46 ± 0.89, 7.42 ± 0.91 and 7.49 ± 0.89 at 3, 6 and 12 months post-retirement). There were significant differences in enjoyment across domains, with Physical Activity (7.86 ± 1.11) and Social (7.66 ± 0.85) being the most enjoyable, and Work (7.10 ± 0.89) and Chores (7.09 ± 0.85) the least enjoyable.CONCLUSION: enjoyment of everyday activities increased after retirement and remained elevated for at least 12 months.

Objectives: To propose a system for continuous and objective remote monitoring of problematic daily living activity areas and design personalized interventions based on system feedback and clinical observations for improving cognitive function and health-related quality of life. Methods: The assistive technology of the proposed system, including wearable, sleep, object motion, presence, and utility usage sensors, was methodically deployed at four different home installations of people with cognitive impairment. Detection of sleep patterns, physical activity, and activities of daily living, based on the collected sensor data and analytics, was available at all times through comprehensive data visualization solutions. Combined with clinical observation, targeted psychosocial interventions were introduced to enhance the participants' quality of life and improve their cognitive functions and daily functionality. Meanwhile, participants and their caregivers were able to visualize a reduced set of information tailored to their needs. Results: Overall, paired-sample t-test analysis of monitored qualities revealed improvement for all participants in neuropsychological assessment. Moreover, improvement was detected from the beginning to the end of the trial, in physical condition and in the domains of sleep. Detecting abnormalities via the system, for example in sleep quality, such as REM sleep, has proved to be critical to assess current status, drive interventions, and evaluate improvements in a reliable manner. Conclusion: It has been proved that the proposed system is suitable to support clinicians to reliably drive and evaluate clinical interventions toward quality of life improvement of people with cognitive impairment. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

Using a nationally representative sample of 1,620 Americans older than 50 from the 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS), we examine the relationship between older adults' SNS use and social wellbeing associated with non-kin and kin relations and explore how these associations vary by age. Results of ordinary least-squares regression analyses suggest that SNS use is positively associated with non-kin-related social wellbeing outcomes, including perceived support from friends (β = 0.13; p < 0.001; N = 460) and feelings of connectedness (β = 0.10; p < 0.001; N = 463). Regression models employing interaction terms of age and SNS use further reveal that SNS use contributes to feelings of connectedness to a greater extent as people age (β = 0.10; p < 0.001; N = 463). Of all kin-related social wellbeing outcomes, SNS use only predicts increased perceived support from children (β = 0.08; p < 0.05; N = 410), and age negatively shapes this relationship (β = -0.14; p < 0.001; N = 410). As older people engage with an increasingly smaller and narrower network with a greater proportion of kin contacts, our results suggest that SNS use may help older adults access differential social benefits throughout later life. © Copyright 2015 Cambridge University Press.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934325062,0,0,0,50+

To reduce loneliness and support activities, social internet-based interventions are indicated to be effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a social internet-based intervention for older adults who are vulnerable to loneliness. Method An explorative, randomised, crossover study with an AB/BA sequence was completed. The intervention was conducted over a period of three months. Thirty participants were included (24 women and six men, 61-89 years old) and allocated to two groups. Data were collected at three time points. The primary outcome was the UCLA loneliness scale, and the secondary outcomes were satisfaction with social contacts and social interaction skills. Statistical analyses were conducted with the paired t-test, Wilcoxon's signed-rank test and repeated-measures analysis of variance. Results Loneliness was significantly decreased in both groups post intervention, and satisfaction with social contacts online significantly increased in one group. Significant treatment effects were detected for all outcomes. Conclusion The results of the social internet-based intervention programme are promising, but further evaluations are needed. © The College of Occupational Therapists Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991746940,1,1,1,

While the vast majority of older people do not experience significant degrees of loneliness, a minority do and there are some reports that this is even greater among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) seniors. This article examines the experience of loneliness and social support among LGBTI people aged 50 and over living in New South Wales, Australia. It also explores their interest in participating in social and health-promoting activities. Findings from an online survey delivered to 312 people are reported. Loneliness was associated with living alone, not being in a relationship, higher psychological distress and lower mental health. Nonetheless, most respondents reported that they are able to gain support from both biological family and friends if they need it in a crisis. The social and health-promoting activities that were most preferred among all respondents were fitness groups, walking groups, swimming and meditation. Those who experienced the greatest degree of loneliness were much more likely than those who were less lonely to want to participate in social and health-promoting activities with other LGBTI people. The findings indicate scope for community organisations to develop targeted interventions, such as those social and health-promoting activities most preferred by the participants of this study. © Copyright 2015 Cambridge University Press.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84984671969,0,0,0,

As our first trial, this system is designed to support a user to talk while watching a TV program. It features two conversation techniques: realizing natural timing of simultaneous response and providing interesting utterances from social media networks related to the TV program the user is watching. To achieve natural response timing, the proposed system includes three response functions: backchannel, repetition and machine answering. While the system keeps talking using the three kinds of responses, it searches human text comments about the TV program from social network services (SNS). When a comment is found, the robot outputs the comment by synthetic speech. A preliminary experiment is conducted to evaluate how the proposed response technique encourages a user to speak to the chat robot. The results show that average number of user utterances with the proposed robot using social media networks and the above three functions is significantly higher than that when the chat robot only outputs social media comments. © 2016 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992027457,0,0,0,

However, few studies have directly examined associations between technology use for social reasons and physical and psychological health among older adults. The current study examines the benefits of technology use in 591 older adults from the 2012 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (Mage = 68.18, SD = 10.75; 55.5% female). Social technology use was assessed through five technology-based behaviors (i.e., using e-mail, social networking sites, online video/phone calls, online chatting/instant messaging, using a smartphone). Attitudes toward the usability and benefits of technology use were also assessed. Older adults had generally positive attitudes toward technology. Higher social technology use was associated with better self-rated health, fewer chronic illnesses, higher subjective well-being, and fewer depressive symptoms. Furthermore, each of the links between social technology use and physical and psychological health was mediated by reduced loneliness. Close relationships are a large determinant of physical health and well-being, and technology has the potential to cultivate successful relationships among older adults. © 2016 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988485791,0,1,0,

Information and communication technologies (ICT) have strong potential to overcome some of these barriers by supporting the delivery of evidence-based psychosocial treatments for common psychogeriatric issues. This paper presents two case studies that illustrate when and how psychologists can use various ICT applications (e.g., tablet devices, web-based applications) integrated with cognitive behavioural and reminiscence-based therapies. Both case studies demonstrate that ICT can effectively support the therapeutic alliance, enhance therapeutic engagement, and individualize treatment delivery to accommodate the needs of elderly patients. It is hoped that these case studies will encourage clinicians to consider using ICT to augment therapy with their elderly patients. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963648035,0,maybe,maybe,

Internet development makes information spread faster, also allows elderly and their caregivers to more easily access information and actively participate in value co-creation in the services. This study aims to investigate the designs of value co-creation by the supply and demand sides of the senior industry.Design: This study investigated senior industry in Taiwan and analyzed bussiness models of 33 selected successful senior enterprises in 2013. We adopted series field observation, reviews of documentations, analysis of meeting records and in-depth interviews with 65 CEOs and managers.Setting: Thirty-three quality enterprises in senior industry.Participants: Sixty-five CEOs and managers in 33 senior enterprises.Intervention(s): None.Main Outcome Measure(s): Value co-creation design, value co-creating process.Results: We constructed a conceptual model that comprehensively describes essential aspects of value co-creation and categorized the value co-creation designs into four types applying for different business models: (i) interaction in experience spaces co-creation design, (ii) on-site interacting co-creation design, (iii) social networking platform co-creation design and (iv) empowering customers co-creation design. Through value co-creation platform design, the senior enterprises have converted the originally passive roles of the elderly and caregivers into active participants in the value co-creation process.Conclusions: The new paradigm of value co-creation designs not only promote innovative development during the interactive process, lead enterprises reveal and meet customers' needs but also increase markets and profits. © The Author 2016.

This study examines the influences of sociodemographic, health, and environmental characteristics on older adults' walking behaviors, and the role physicians can play in promoting physical activity. Methods: Online and paper surveys (n = 272) were distributed to community-dwelling older (age ≥ 60) adults from a large integrated healthcare system in two counties in Central Texas. Descriptive statistics were utilized to characterize participant's walking behaviors and places. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to predict being: 1) a frequent walker (i.e., walking at least three times a week); and 2) meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) PA recommendation through walking (i.e., walking ≥150 min per week), while considering sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Results: Individuals had a median age of 69 years, were of both genders (50.37 % female), and were primarily non-Hispanic White (84.87 %). While the majority (59.55 %) walked at least three times a week, only 27.86 % walked ≥150 min a week. Factors associated with a lower likelihood of being frequent walkers included experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.345, 95 % CI = 0.185-0.645) and residing in areas with low or moderate (versus high) perceived neighborhood cohesion (OR = 0.471, 95 % CI = 0.228-0.974), while those in Census Tracts reflecting populations with a lower median age were more likely to report frequent walking behavior (OR = 1.799, 95 % CI = 1.034-3.131). Factors associated with a lower likelihood of meeting the CDC PA recommendation included being 60-69 years (versus 70 years or older) (OR = 0.538, 95 % CI = 0.290-0.997), experiencing poor mental health in the past month (OR = 0.432, 95 % CI = 0.198-0.944), and lacking social support for walking (OR = 0.383, 95 % CI = 0.154-0.957). Conclusion: Given the health benefits, PA promotion must be seen as a national responsibility. In particular, physicians have a major role to play in communicating the importance of PA to their older patients and making discussions about strategies for overcoming barriers to walking an integral part of their clinical encounter with these patients. © 2016 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988369473,1,1,0,

The umbrella term for these problems is ‘fear of falling’, seen in up to 85% of older adults who fall. Evidence of effectiveness of physical and psychological interventions is limited, with no previous studies examining the role of an individually delivered cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) approach. Objectives Primary objectiveTo develop and then determine the effectiveness of a new CBT intervention (CBTi) delivered by health-care assistants (HCAs) plus usual care compared with usual care alone in reducing fear of falling. Secondary objectivesTo measure the impact of the intervention on falls, injuries, functional abilities, anxiety/depression, quality of life, social participation and loneliness; investigate the acceptability of the intervention for patients, family members and professionals and factors that promote or inhibit its implementation; and measure the costs and benefits of the intervention.  Design Phase ICBTi development. Phase IIParallel-group patient randomised controlled trial (RCT) of the new CBTi plus usual care compared with usual care alone.  Setting Multidisciplinary falls services. Participants Consecutive community-dwelling older adults, both sexes, aged ≥ 60 years, with excessive or undue fear of falling per Falls Efficacy Scale–International (FES-I) score of > 23. Interventions Phase IDevelopment of the CBTi. The CBTi was developed following patient interviews and taught to HCAs to maximise the potential for uptake and generalisability to a UK NHS setting. Phase IIRCT. The CBTi was delivered by HCAs weekly for 8 weeks, with a 6-month booster session plus usual care.  Main outcome measures These were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Primary outcome measureFear of falling measured by change in FES-I scores at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures These comprised falls, injuries, anxiety/depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], quality of life, social participation, loneliness and measures of physical function. There were process and health-economic evaluations alongside the trial.  Results Four hundred and fifteen patients were recruited, with 210 patients randomised to CBTi group and 205 to the control group. There were significant reductions in mean FES-I [–4.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) –5.95 to –2.1], single-item numerical fear of falling scale (–1.42; 95% CI –1.87 to 1.07) and HADS (–1; 95% CI –1.6 to –0.3) scores at 12 months in the CBTi group compared with the usual care group. There were no differences in the other secondary outcome measures. Most patients found the CBTi acceptable. Factors affecting the delivery of the CBTi as part of routine practice were identified. There was no evidence that the intervention was cost-effective. Conclusions Our new CBTi delivered by HCAs significantly improved fear of falling and depression scores in older adults who were attending falls services. There was no impact on other measures. Further work Further work should focus on a joint CBTi and physical training approach to fear of falling, more rational targeting of CBTi, the possibility of mixed group and individual CBTi, and the cost-effectiveness of provision of CBTi by non-specialists.

It is also a fundamental component of active ageing and if active ageing objectives are to be met for the growing ageing population, barriers to learning need to be understood and addressed. This study aimed at determining the degree that structural factors deter people aged 55 years and older from engaging in learning activities. Method: The data were obtained from survey (n=421) with a purposive sample of Australian Seniors aged 55 to 75+, and open ended follow up interviews (n=40). The survey responses to the 22 barriers to learning questions were ranked and quantified. The issues identified in the interviews shed further light on the survey data. Results: The analyses revealed that factors related to educational institutions as well as infrastructure were commonly cited as barriers to participation in learning. In particular expense of educational programmes (55.1%), long travelling time (45.6%) other transportation difficulties (38.9%), lack of interest in offered programmes ((36.4) and lack of information about courses (31.1%) were seen as barriers. The interviews revealed and confirmed five main barriers; money, offerings of interest/availability, travel/transport, information, computer skills and being employed. Conclusion: The findings should provide policy makers, institutions, organizations and government with a list of areas where changes might be made so as to improve older people’s opportunities for learning as they proceed through older age. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981309688,1,0,0,55+

Methods: The psychometric properties of the Dutch WHOQOL-OLD were examined in a cross-sectional study using a sample of 1,340 people aged 60years or older. Participants completed a Web-based questionnaire, the 'Senioren Barometer'. Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha and corrected item-total correlations. Construct validity of the Dutch WHOQOL-OLD was evaluated with confirmatory factor analyses, and correlations within and between scales, using scales WHOQOL-BREF, Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI), and the Emotional and Social Loneliness Scale (ESLS). Results: The reliabilities of the six WHOQOL-OLD facets or subscales were sufficient to good (.66-.91). The convergent validity of the WHOQOL-OLD was good, whereas our findings on the divergent validity of the WHOQOL-OLD were somewhat mixed. Findings corroborating the divergent validity were that the 6-factor model fitted better than the second-order factor model, and WHOQOL-OLD facets sensory abilities, past, present and future activities, death and dying, intimacy correlated more strongly with similar than dissimilar scales. Not fully supporting divergent validity were the extremely high correlations between the factors corresponding to autonomy, past, present and future activities, and social participation. Conclusion: We offer Dutch healthcare and social workers an instrument with good psychometric properties for measuring quality of life in older people. Further research on interrelations between WHOQOL-OLD facets is recommended. ï¿½ 2016 The Author(s).",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84987755528,1,1,0,

An understanding of access, usage patterns, and preferences for receiving health information is critical for state-level organizations to effectively reach and serve this growing population. Design A telephone survey was developed to assess media and technology access, use patterns, health-seeking information patterns, and preferences for receiving health information. The survey was conducted in New York state from August 8 to November 4, 2013, using random digit dialing. The overall sample of 1350 included 412 Hispanic/Latino adults who are the focus of this study. Results Most Hispanic/Latino respondents reported having at least one working computer at home (78%) and using the Internet (84%); almost all who had a computer reported having high-speed Internet service (90%). Cell phone ownership was common (88%), and many had a smartphone (71%). Activities most likely to occur several times per day were sending text messages (61%), using phone apps (49%), using a search engine (40%), using email (34%), and using social networking sites (32%). The most preferred channels of receiving health information were websites, mail, and television. Older respondents were significantly less likely to have the technologies, engage in technology activities, and prefer newer forms of information dissemination (i.e., text messages). Education and income were important predictors in some cases. Conclusions While most Hispanics/Latinos have access to various technologies, the reason for using those technologies and preferences for receiving health information most often varies by age and, sometimes, by education and income. Older adults tend to seek health information from traditional sources such as television and brochures, while younger adults favored newer technologies. Knowing preferences of the population can help ensure proper media channels are selected for dissemination of health information to Hispanic/Latino communities. © W.

In this study, older adults who were computer novices were trained to use a tablet computer and associated software applications. We hypothesize that sustained engagement in this mentally challenging training would yield a dual benefit of improved cognition and enhancement of everyday function by introducing useful skills. Design and Methods: A total of 54 older adults (age 60-90) committed 15 hr/week for 3 months. Eighteen participants received extensive iPad training, learning a broad range of practical applications. The iPad group was compared with 2 separate controls: a Placebo group that engaged in passive tasks requiring little new learning; and a Social group that had regular social interaction, but no active skill acquisition. All participants completed the same cognitive battery pre- and post-engagement. Results: Compared with both controls, the iPad group showed greater improvements in episodic memory and processing speed but did not differ in mental control or visuospatial processing. Implications: iPad training improved cognition relative to engaging in social or nonchallenging activities. Mastering relevant technological devices have the added advantage of providing older adults with technological skills useful in facilitating everyday activities (e.g., banking). This work informs the selection of targeted activities for future interventions and community programs. © The Author 2014.

The aim of this research study was to facilitate and increase opportunities for social connectedness for older people living in regional areas through the use of technology training. Weekly technology training sessions were conducted at a Seniors Citizen's Club with a peer trainer (an experienced, retired computer teacher) and sessions were attended not only by the six study participants, but also by other club members, with up to 15 club members participating in sessions. Data analysis involved all documents generated by the project, including the individual interviews, researcher observations of training sessions, reports from the peer trainer and weekly diaries maintained by participants. Findings demonstrated that computer training at the Senior Citizens Club helped participants build group cohesion and to form tiered connections with partners, family, and friends with whom they no longer live. When the trainer is seen as a peer, and training is person-centred, older people are more receptive to learning, exploring, and experimenting with technology. Although only six people were involved in the in-depth evaluation part of the study, voluntary training with the trainer in the absence of any funding continues even to this present time. The outcome of this research reinforces the potential for technology facilitated tiered connectivity to enhance the quality of life for older people living in regional and rural Australia. © 2016, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964039206,0,1,1,

Memotree is designed to promote intergenerational family communication. The system incorporates the Family Tree design concept and provides family communication mechanisms based on the Family Communication Scale. In addition, the system optimizes hardware and interface use to conform to the specific needs of older and substantially younger individuals. Regarding the impact of variables on SNS with respect to the interaction of usability variables in the construction of a cross-generational communication platform, we adopted the TAM model and Chung et al.'s suggestions to promote user acceptance of the proposed Memotree system. A total of 39 grandchildren and 39 grandparents met the criteria and were included in the study. The elderly and young respondents revealed substantial willingness to use and/or satisfaction with using the Memotree system. Empirical results indicate that technology affordances and perceived ease of use have a positive impact on perceived usefulness, while perceived ease of use is affected by technology affordances. Internet self-efficacy and perceived usefulness have a positive impact on the user's behavioral intention toward the system. In addition, this study investigated age as a moderating variable in the model. The results indicate that grandchildren have a larger significant effect on the path between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention than grandparents. This study proposes a more complete framework for investigating the user's behavioral intention and provides a more appropriate explanation of related services for cross-generational interaction with SNS services. © 2016 Tsai et al.

Methods: Thirteen older adults were provided in-home ICT training by graduate occupational therapy students using an iPad. The breadth and frequency of ICT use, perspectives on technology, and perceived independence were recorded at baseline, during the 3-month training and at follow-up, along with an end-of-study questionnaire. Non-parametric Friedman analysis was conducted to verify trends in the outcome measures. The qualitative data were examined by content analysis. Results: Participants breadth of ICT activities showed a significant trend across 6 months. Leisure accounted for the significant increase, while health management and social connections activities increased modestly. A positive trend in participants perspectives on technology was evident along with a marginal increase in perceived independence.

The results show that the difference in perceived risk-benefit balance partly mediates the relationship between use or non-use of SNSs and concern. SNS users are less concerned because they perceive more benefits relative to risks. Concern regarding privacy between young and old was mediated by their differences in privacy conceptions.

The Health TAPESTRY approach includes intentional, proactive conversations about a person's life and health goals and health risks and then initiation of congruent tailored interventions that support achievement of those goals and addressing of risks through (1) trained volunteers visiting clients in their homes to serve as a link between the primary care team and the client; (2) the use of novel technology including a personal health record from the home to link directly with the primary healthcare team; and (3) improved processes for connections, system navigation, and care delivery among interprofessional primary care teams, community service providers, and informal caregivers. The primary outcome will be the goal attainment scaling score. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy for managing chronic disease, quality of life, the participant perspective on their own aging, social support, access to health services, comprehensiveness of care, patient empowerment, patient-centeredness, caregiver strain, satisfaction with care, healthcare resource utilization, and cost-effectiveness. Implementation processes will also be evaluated. The main comparative analysis will take place at 6months. Discussion: Evidence of the individual elements of the Health TAPESTRY platform has been shown in isolation in the previous research. However, this study will better understand how to best integrate them to maximize the system's transformation of person-focused, primary care for older adults.

There has been less attention given to isolation in senior housing communities. The objectives of this pilot study were to test two methods to identify socially isolated residents in low-income senior housing and compare findings about the extent of isolation from these two methods. The first method, self-report by residents, included 47 out of 135 residents who completed in-person interviews. To determine self-report isolation, residents completed the Lubben Social Network Scale 6 (LSNS-6). The second method involved a staff member who reported the extent of isolation on all 135 residents via an online survey. Results indicated that 26% of residents who were interviewed were deemed socially isolated by the LSNS-6. Staff members rated 12% of residents as having some or a lot of isolation. In comparing the two methods, staff members rated 2% of interviewed residents as having a lot of isolation. The combination of self-report and staff report could be more informative than just self-report alone, particularly when participation rates are low. However, researchers should be aware of the potential discrepancy between these two methods. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978039774,0,1,0,

Mobile applications (apps) have been developed to facilitate CBT-I in the general population. However, because of deteriorating perceptual and cognitive functioning, the effectiveness of mobile apps in older adults remains unknown. Materials and Methods: This case report aims to demonstrate the utilization, advantages, and limitations of mobile app-assisted CBT-I in an older female adult. An app (""Win-Win aSleep"" [WWaS]) was applied in a six-session CBT-I treatment. Results: The patient successfully discontinued her hypnotics and had restored sleep quality after the intervention with WWaS-assisted CBT-I. Several limitations of WWaS were summarized, and pertinent approaches for enhancing future work were discussed. Conclusions: Mobile apps integrating wearable devices might overcome the difficulty for applying WWaS in older adults. In addition to tailored design of mobile technology for older adults, psychosocial support for the utilization of apps may not only enhance the compliance but also provide additional connection to the environment. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962071185,1,1,0,

Observation studies, group interviews with staff and individual interviews with residents, relatives, architects and key stakeholders in the context of Swedish elder-care were conducted. Common spaces are the major location for in-house social interaction on the units. The results show a higher presence on the dementia units, compared to the somatic units. No significant correlation was found between the residents' mobility limitations and their degree of presence in the common spaces. The results also suggest a contradiction between the staff's intentions to provide a social context and the capabilities of the residents. Although common spaces are not used much between meals, the residents stress their importance for social interaction, suggesting that common spaces have important qualitative aspects, rather than quantitative. The results also show that few of the residents used the common spaces together with their relatives. The increasing use of assistive technology creates a shortage of space, suggesting a conflict between the efforts to create a home-like environment and the use of assistive technology.

Moreover, little is known about the optimal type of social support, or its mechanism effect between coping and emotional outcome in men affected by this disease to identify areas for clinical intervention. This study aimed to empirically test the propositions of social support theory in ""real time"" within individual men living with and beyond prostate cancer. Methods: Purposeful sub-sample from a larger prospective longitudinal study of prostate cancer survivors, took part in real time data collection using mobile technology. Self-reports were collected for 31 days prompted by an audio alarm 3 times per day (a total of 93 data entries) for each of the 12 case studies. Electronic data were analysed using time series analysis. Results: Majority of response rates were >90%. Men reported a lack of satisfaction with their support over time. Testing the propositions of social support theory ""within individuals"" over time demonstrated different results for main effect, moderation and mediation pathways that linked coping and social support to emotional outcome. For two men, negative effects of social support were identified. For six men the propositions of social support theory did not hold considering their within-person data.

Aims: We investigated affective instability (a pattern of frequent and large mood shifts over time) as a predictor of recovery from episodes of bipolar depression and as a moderator of response to psychosocial treatment for acute depression. Method: A total of 252 out-patients with DSM-IV bipolar I or II disorder and who were depressed enrolled in the Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD) and were randomised to one of three types of intensive psychotherapy for depression (n= 141) or a brief psychoeducational intervention (n =111). All analyses were by intention-to-treat. Results: Degree of instability of symptoms of depression and mania predicted a lower likelihood of recovery and longer time until recovery, independent of the concurrent effects of symptom severity. Affective instability did not moderate the effects of psychosocial treatment on recovery from depression.

Recently, there has been an implicit call to differentiate job characteristics beyond the two factors of job demands and job resources. As needs, abilities and motivation fluctuate with age, different job characteristics might yield differential benefits. Additionally, markers beyond chronological age should be considered. Aims: To explore systematically interactions between different job characteristics, age and age covariates (i.e. job tenure and position type) and their relationship with work-related health outcomes.Methods: An online survey of workers in Switzerland, Austria and Germany, recruited through a panel data service provider. We excluded participants working fewer than 30 hours a week, trainees, self-employed people and senior managers. We assessed seven areas of psychosocial risks at work, burnout, work engagement and demographics. Results: Of the 6000 workers contacted, 1916 responded (31%). After applying exclusion criteria, we analysed data from 1417 respondents. We found that age barely had a moderating effect between psychosocial factors and health outcomes, but its three-way interaction with age covariates had more explanatory potential. Young workers with high job tenure showed particular vulnerability to job demands and the lack of certain job resources. Older workers with managerial positions were more resilient. Conclusions: Age and its covariates, such as job tenure and position type, should be considered in developing age-sensitive occupational health models. © The Author 2016.

The Department of Defense's Military Health System (MHS) is one of the largest healthcare providers in the United States, serving approximately 9.2 million active duty service members, retirees, spouses, and children. The annual cost to the MHS for morbidities associated with being overweight exceeds $1 billion. The preschool age has been suggested as an opportune time to intervene for the prevention of obesity. Thus, this study investigated the current level of technology usage by military service member families and assessed their needs and interests in health/nutrition information. This needs assessment is crucial for researchers/educators to design further studies and intervention programs for obesity prevention in military families with young children.

Computerized exercises were designed based on the hypothesis that repeated task-dependent coactivation of multiple DMN regions would translate into regulation of resting-state network connectivity. Forty seniors (mean age: 65.90 years; SD: 8.53) were recruited and assigned either to an experimental group (n = 21) who received one month of intensive cognitive stimulation, or to a control group (n = 19) who maintained a regime of daily-life activities explicitly focused on social interactions. An MRI protocol and a battery of neuropsychological tests were administered at baseline and at the end of the study. Changes in the DMN (measured via functional connectivity of posterior-cingulate seeds), in brain volumes, and in cognitive performance were measured with mixed models assessing group-by-timepoint interactions. Moreover, regression models were run to test gray-matter correlates of the various stimulation tasks. Significant associations were found between task performance and gray-matter volume of multiple DMN core regions. Training-dependent up-regulation of functional connectivity was found in the posterior DMN component. This interaction was driven by a pattern of increased connectivity in the training group, while little or no up-regulation was seen in the control group. Minimal changes in brain volumes were found, but there was no change in cognitive performance. The training-dependent regulation of functional connectivity within the posterior DMN component suggests that this stimulation program might exert a beneficial impact in the prevention and treatment of early AD neurodegeneration, in which this neurofunctional pathway is progressively affected by the disease. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84952659410,0,1,1,

Technology can play a role in staying independent, active and healthy. However, the use of technology varies considerably among older adults. Previous research indicates that current models of technology acceptance are missing essential predictors specific to community-dwelling older adults. Furthermore, in situ research within the specific context of aging in place is scarce, while this type of research is needed to better understand how and why community-dwelling older adults are using technology. Objective: To explore which factors influence the level of use of various types of technology by older adults who are aging in place and to describe these factors in a comprehensive model. Methods: A qualitative explorative field study was set up, involving home visits to 53 community-dwelling older adults, aged 68-95, living in the Netherlands. Purposive sampling was used to include participants with different health statuses, living arrangements, and levels of technology experience. During each home visit: (1) background information on the participants' chronic conditions, major life events, frailty, cognitive functioning, subjective health, ownership and use of technology was gathered, and (2) a semistructured interview was conducted regarding reasons for the level of use of technology. The study was designed to include various types of technology that could support activities of daily living, personal health or safety, mobility, communication, physical activity, personal development, and leisure activities. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze interview transcripts. Results: The level of technology use in the context of aging in place is influenced by six major themes: challenges in the domain of independent living; behavioral options; personal thoughts on technology use; influence of the social network; influence of organizations, and the role of the physical environment. Conclusion: Older adults' perceptions and use of technology are embedded in their personal, social, and physical context. Awareness of these psychological and contextual factors is needed in order to facilitate aging in place through the use of technology. A conceptual model covering these factors is presented. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84959193555,1,1,0,

The purpose of the present study is to examine the unique associations between prolonged grief symptoms and service utilization patterns. Methods: An online self-report assessment battery was administered among a sample of 275 older adults with at least one chronic illness that caused significant physical impairment. Results: Even after statistically controlling for relevant physical health (e.g. severity of physical limitations, somatic symptoms, number of chronic illnesses) and psychosocial variables (e.g. social support, depression/anxiety), more severe prolonged grief symptoms were associated with a greater number of emergency room visits, overnight stays in the hospital and total nights in the hospital. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of screening for prolonged grief symptomatology with older individuals with a debilitating chronic illness.Implications for RehabilitationRecent evidence suggests that prolonged grief may have relevance for losses associated with physical illness.The present study shows that prolonged grief reactions related to physical illness (e.g. grieving the loss of functioning) are uniquely associated with increased hospital-based service utilization.Given the relevance of prolonged grief reactions in this population, practitioners may wish to assess for these symptoms.Future clinical research should focus on developing interventions to target prolonged grief symptoms associated with these losses. © 2015 Informa UK Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951833667,1,1,0,

This is probably due to methodological limitations, such as absence of an accurate neighborhood definition, lack of environmental heterogeneity, environmental co-variation, and recall bias. Furthermore, most previous studies are observational in nature. We aimed to address these limitations by investigating the effects of manipulating photographs on micro-scale environmental factors on the appeal of a street for older adults' transportation walking. Secondly, we used latent class analysis to examine whether subgroups could be identified that have different environmental preferences for transportation walking. Thirdly, we investigated whether these subgroups differed in socio-demographic, functional and psychosocial characteristics, current level of walking and environmental perceptions of their own street. Methods: Data were collected among 1131 Flemish older adults through an online (n=940) or an interview version of the questionnaire (n=191). This questionnaire included a choice-based conjoint exercise with manipulated photographs of a street. These manipulated photographs originated from one panoramic photograph of an existing street that was manipulated on nine environmental attributes. Participants chose which of two presented streets they would prefer to walk for transport. Results: In the total sample, sidewalk evenness had by far the greatest appeal for transportation walking. The other environmental attributes were less important. Four subgroups that differed in their environmental preferences for transportation walking were identified. In the two largest subgroups (representing 86% of the sample) sidewalk evenness was the most important environmental attribute. In the two smaller subgroups (each comprising 7% of the sample), traffic volume and speed limit were the most important environmental attributes for one, and the presence of vegetation and a bench were the most important environmental attributes for the other. This latter subgroup included a higher percentage of service flat residents than the other subgroups. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the provision of even sidewalks should be considered a priority when developing environmental interventions aiming to stimulate older adults' transportation walking. Natural experiments are needed to confirm whether our findings can be translated to real environments and actual transportation walking behavior. © 2016 Van Cauwenberg et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954415822,1,1,0,

Design: Cross-sectional population study. Setting: Canadian Community Health Survey (Healthy Aging Cycle, 2008-2009). Subjects: Middle-aged (45-60 years; n = 8161) and older adults (60 years and older; n = 9128) were used for analysis. Measures: Self-reported perceived health, sense of belonging to community, mood disorder, and satisfaction with life were used as outcomes. Sedentary activities were playing bingo, computer use, doing crosswords/puzzles, handicrafts, listening to radio/music, playing a musical instrument, reading, visiting others, and watching TV. Analysis: Chi-squares, t-tests and multivariable logistic regressions. Results: Among respondents not diagnosed with a mood disorder, positive associations were noted for crosswords/puzzles in older adults (odds ratio [OR]: 1.39, confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.91) and listening to radio/music or playing an instrument in middle-aged adults (OR: 1.43, CI: 1.16-1.75; OR: 2.14, CI: 1.17-3.81). Satisfaction with life was positively associated with computer use in middle-aged (OR: 1.53, CI: 1.07-2.20) and older adults (OR: 1.42, CI: 1.09-1.84). Sense of belonging was consistently positively associated with sedentary activities. Conclusion: Several sedentary activities were found to be positively associated with self-reported measures of psychosocial wellness in middle-aged and older adults.

Even at old age, PA remains useful but participation in PA decreases with age. In long-term care facilities (LTCFs), PA appears to be reduced to a bare minimum. Because administrators have a key role in developing the care policy of LTCFs, it is important that they support the organization of PA in LTCFs. Objective: The main objective of this mixed-method study was to identify motivators and barriers for organizing PA in LTCFs according to administrators. A secondary goal was to examine the knowledge of the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines regarding PA and to reveal potential motivators and barriers for the implementation of the guidelines. Methods: First, 24 administrators completed semistructured interviews. Data were analyzed using the deductive approach of qualitative content analysis. The obtained motivators and barriers were categorized on 3 different levels (intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community) according to the socioecological model by 2 independent reviewers; conflicts were resolved with a third researcher. Next, 127 administrators of Flemish (Belgium) LTCFs completed an online questionnaire survey containing open-ended, unique, and multiple choice questions regarding the LTCFs, PA, and the WHO guidelines, as well as statements (scored on a 5-point Likert scale) regarding perceived motivators and barriers for organizing PA sessions in the LTCF. Results: In the qualitative component, the administrators reported 31 motivators and 24 barriers for organizing PA in the LTCF. In the survey, maintaining or enhancing general health of the residents (98%) and improving the psychological well-being of the residents were marked as key motivators at the intrapersonal level. The administrators (97%) were convinced that PA is a useful way to spend time for LTCF residents. Encouraging social contact (94%) and countering loneliness (86%) are the motivators cited at the interpersonal level. At the community level, the infrastructure of the facility (91%) and adequate and sufficient material (88%) are the main motivators. The barriers that were presented to the participants were scored as less important. The majority of the administrators (83%) are not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA; 70% of the participants believe that the guidelines are useful, but only 40% is convinced that it is realistic to implement the guidelines in an LTCF. Conclusions: This study described different motivators and barriers for administrators to organize PA in LTCFs. Contrary to other studies, lack of staff, lack of adequate equipment, and lack of financial resources were rejected as potential barriers for organizing PA. Despite the fact that administrators were not familiar with the WHO guidelines for PA, they believed that the guidelines are useful. The participants reported several barriers for implementation of the guidelines. Administrators of LTCFs are motivated to implement the guidelines if PA can be integrated in daily activities and education of LTCF staff regarding PA is provided. © 2016 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955182612,1,0,0,

The aims of the current study were to determine the prevalence of depression and subsyndromal depression among older adults in Singapore. Materials and Methods: The Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study was a comprehensive single phase, cross-sectional survey. Stage 1 Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (GMS-AGECAT) depression syndrome was used for this analysis. Association of depression and subsyndromal depression with sociodemographic characteristics, social support as well as comorbidity with chronic physical illnesses and quality of life was assessed. Results: The prevalence of GMS-AGECAT depression and subsyndromal depression was 3.7% and 13.4%, respectively. The odds of depression were significantly higher among those aged 75 to 84 (2.1) as compared to those aged 60 to 74 years and in those who had a history of depression diagnosis by a doctor (4.1). The odds of depression were higher among those of Indian and Malay ethnicities (5.2 and 3.2 times, respectively) as compared to those of Chinese ethnicity. Those with depression and subsyndromal depression were associated with more disability, poorer life satisfaction, and medical comorbidities. Conclusion: Our study suggests that the prevalence of depression seems to have decreased as compared to a decade ago wherein the prevalence of depression was estimated to be 5.5%. This positive trend can be ascribed to concerted efforts across various disciplines and sectors, which need to be continually strengthened, monitored and evaluated. © 2016, Academy of Medicine Singapore.

These cognitive defi cits may be even more pronounced in older adults with depression and particularly in those with cardiovascular risk factors, where cognitive impairment is linked with multiple pathophysiologies including white matter lesions and alterations in key grey matter brain structures. In this group, underlying neurodegenerative pathology is also an important consideration. Of concern, cognitive defi cits are predictive of treatment responsiveness and may persist despite depressive symptom resolution. However, most traditional treatments for depression (i.e. antidepressants and psychological therapies) do not focus on cognition. By contrast, cognitive training is a novel non-pharmacological therapy that may be used to directly target cognition and psychosocial functioning, by promoting neural plasticity. In this chapter, we review the evidence for cognitive training in depression with additional reference to work in healthy samples and those with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease. Studies using both computer-based and strategy-based training approaches are discussed. To date, there is a lack of well-controlled studies utilising cognitive training for people with depression. Nonetheless, 13 studies employing computer-based cognitive training programs reveal promising results, particularly for improving memory and mood. Further randomised controlled trials in those with depression are now required, to examine the potential magnitude of cognitive improvement and to determine which individual, clinical and treatment-related factors may influence treatment efficacy. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted with a population-based random sample of 366 elderly (≥ 60 years of age) persons registered at a primary healthcare unit in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. HRQOL was measured using the Medical Outcomes Study 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) and the scores obtained in the physical component score (PCS) and mental component score (MCS) were our response variables. Social relations, sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle, and health conditions were considered our groups of explanatory variables. Multiple linear regression models were used for the analysis. Results: In the final multivariate models, we found that elevated number of diagnosis of chronic diseases, and being bedridden for the last 15 days were variables associated with worse PCS and MCS. However, lack of education, dissatisfaction with personal relationships, lack of support and help when bedridden or to go to the doctor, and to prepare meals were associated with worse HRQOL only in MCS.

The concept of frailty and its interaction with disability and psychosocial functioning has been well established in community-based studies. However, its association with outcomes in hospitalised older adults is less understood. This study gives the clinician a greater understanding of the impact of frailty on rehabilitation outcomes by evaluating the changes in physical function, quality of life and falls self-efficacy in frail older adults undergoing inpatient rehabilitation. A secondary aim was to examine the association between frailty, physical function, quality of life, falls self-efficacy, therapy time, length of stay and discharge destination. Methods: This prospective cohort study assessed 41 subjects (mean age 80.3 ± 7.1 years) admitted to an inpatient post-acute rehabilitation unit. Eligible participants must have been aged 65 years or older and mobile pre-admission. The primary outcome measure was the Timed Up and Go test. Secondary measures included the Clinical Frailty Scale, grip strength, 10-Metre Walk Test, Elderly Mobility Scale, Tinetti Balance and Gait Test, Barthel Index, EuroQol-5D Visual Analogue Scale and Falls Efficacy Scale. These were assessed by the multidisciplinary team on admission and at discharge. Time spent in therapy, discharge destination and length of stay were also recorded on discharge. Results: Statistically significant improvements were found in physical function, quality of life and falls self-efficacy. Moderate and strong correlations were found between admission scores on the Clinical Frailty Scale, Timed Up and Go (r=0.438, p<0.0004), gait speed (r=0.408, p<0.009), Tinetti Balance and Gait Test (r=–0.489, p<0.001) and Elderly Mobility Scale (r=–0.5, p<0.001). Moderate correlations were also found between admission Clinical Frailty Scale and therapy time and length of stay (median 35 days). Regression analysis was performed on admission frailty scores adjusting for age, gender, number of co-morbidities, Mini Mental State Examination and mobility level and found that admission Clinical Frailty Scale scores were predictive of mobility markers, dependency and length of stay. Conclusions: Frailty on admission had a moderate relationship with determinants of physical function, therapy time and length of stay. Further research investigating the validity of frailty measures is required before frailty can be validly utilised as an outcome for elderly rehabilitation. © 2016 MA Healthcare Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975781970,1,1,1,

Participants (N = 300) were randomly assigned to receive the PRISM system, which was designed to support social connections, information gathering, prospective memory, and access to local and national resources, or a binder that contained similar information. The intervention lasted one year, and the computer usage of the PRISM group was monitored. This trial represented a unique opportunity to explore potential barriers to the adoption and continued use of information and communications technologies. Specifically, this paper explored the relationship between computer proficiency and use of the PRISM system over time. Contrary to what one might predict, participants with initially low proficiency used the system more over the course of the trial (r(123) = −.22, p <.05). The fact that even those with the lowest levels or proficiency were able to become among the most active PRISM users may reflect that the system was designed well for older adult computer novices (the intended target of the intervention). Over the course of the trial, participants assigned to the PRISM condition improved substantially in their computer proficiency. Increased computer proficiency from baseline to 12 months was a much strong predictor of system use (r(123) =.53, p <.001), possibly reflecting increased proficiency as a result of greater use over time. Overall, data suggest a complex relationship between computer use, computer proficiency, and changes in computer proficiency over time worthy of additional exploration to further understand the effects of, and barriers to, the use of information and communications technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978245181,0,1,1,

With the current explosion in electronic sources of health information, including thousands of websites and hundreds of mobile phone health apps, electronic health literacy is gaining an increasing prominence in health and medical research. An important dimension of electronic health literacy is the ability to appraise the quality of information that will facilitate everyday health care decisions. Health information seekers explore their care options by gathering information from health websites, blogs, Web-based forums, social networking websites, and advertisements, despite the fact that information quality on the Internet varies greatly. Nonetheless, research has lagged behind in establishing multidimensional instruments, in part due to the evolving construct of health literacy itself. Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine psychometric properties of a new electronic health literacy (ehealth literacy) measure in a national sample of Internet users with specific attention to older users. Our paper is motivated by the fact that ehealth literacy is an underinvestigated area of inquiry. Methods: Our sample was drawn from a panel of more than 55,000 participants maintained by Knowledge Networks, the largest national probability-based research panel for Web-based surveys. We examined the factor structure of a 19-item electronic Health Literacy Scale (e-HLS) through exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis, internal consistency reliability, and construct validity on sample of adults (n=710) and a subsample of older adults (n=194). The AMOS graphics program 21.0 was used to construct a measurement model, linking latent factors obtained from EFA with 19 indicators to determine whether this factor structure achieved a good fit with our entire sample and the subsample (age ≥ 60 years). Linear regression analyses were performed in separate models to examine: (1) the construct validity of the e-HLS and (2) its association with respondents' demographic characteristics and health variables. Results: The EFA produced a 3-factor solution: Communication (2 items), trust (4 items), and action (13 items). The 3-factor structure of the e-HLS was found to be invariant for the subsample. Fit indices obtained were as follows: Full sample: χ2 (710)=698.547, df=131, P&lt;.001, comparative fit index (CFI)=0.94, normed fit index (NFI)=0.92, root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)=0.08; and for the older subsample (age ≥ 60 years): χ2 (194)=275.744, df=131, P&lt;.001, CFI=0.95, NFI=0.90, RMSEA=0.08. Conclusions: The analyses supported the e-HLS validity and internal reliability for the full sample and subsample. The overwhelming majority of our respondents reported a great deal of confidence in their ability to appraise the quality of information obtained from the Internet, yet less than half reported performing quality checks contained on the e-HLS.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989885205,1,1,0,focus on elderly

The purpose of this article is to explain the role case managers can have to promote the use of social media by the elderly, as a means to decrease their loneliness and isolation. Primary Practice Settings: The promotion of the use of social media will take place in the community setting, involving willing and competent elderly patients who live alone. It is framed as one strategy to help combat loneliness. The primary target audiences for this initiative are case managers who work in the community, as they are the ones who have contact with this population. However, hospital case managers could also benefi t, as they need to be aware of ways to help discharged elderly patients feel more connected to their community; the use of social media is one way to achieve this outcome. Findings: The elderly population experience changes brought on by their longer life. One of those changes or undesirable effects is an increase in social isolation and experiencing loneliness. There are many factors that contribute to loneliness and social isolation in the elderly such as a change in fi nancial situations, death, divorce, or migration. Utilizing the capabilities of the internet, coupled with the use of social media (e.g., Facebook), can facilitate opening up a virtual world where the elderly can communicate with family and friends, make new friends, or occupy their time with the many interactive games that are available online. Implications for Case Management Practice: Case managers should increase their awareness to identify patients who are socially isolated; the outcome is to decrease the risk of developing a major depressive disorder. Community case managers might at times be the only professional health care givers who are visiting patients in their home; therefore, they should also be aware of the signs and symptoms of depression so they can encourage patients to get the necessary help needed as soon as possible. This article identifi es key case management strategies to promote the use of social media by isolated elderly clients that include assessment of their learning needs and capabilities, devising a plan of action, implementation of technology, and evaluation and follow-up of the implementation. © Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation history, ejection fraction <30% and coronary heart disease are some of the indications for their application. Other signs are the presence of arrhythmias due to right ventricular dysplasia, long QT syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Despite its life-saving potential, the holistic approach of ICD therapy carries a risk for physiological, psychological consequences and may affect the recipients lifestyle. Aim: The aim of this study was the investigation of patients' comparative assessment the general health, physiological and psychological state and the quality of life after the recent implanted defibrillator. Methods: The study population consisted of 65 patients (44 men and 21 women) who were recent recipients of implantable cardioverter defibrillator. There was no shockable patient. Data were collected through a telephone interview with the patients, using a questionnaire which included social and demographic characteristics and the rest were based from SF-36, DURU QUESTIONNAIRE and General Health and self-esteem questionnaires. Results: The reliability of the questionnaire was very good based on the internal consistency Cronbach index (a=0.732). The parameters of physiological and psychological status, general health and overall the quality of life of people after recent defibrillator implantation showed no significant measurable differences. However, the socio-demographic parameters, gender (female vs male), age (<vs> 50 years), educational level (> vs <graduates High School, colleges & universities) and workers differentiate significantly the parameters of self-esteem, quality of life, general health, daily physical and social activities. Most vulnerable in this study are women, elder patients, workers. Moreover, it was found a positive correlation between patients' educational level and daily roles limitation (p=0,002). There were no more statistically important correlations between marital status and quality of life in both the physical health axis (physical functioning, role fulfillment limitation, pain/body image, general health) and mental health axis (emotional well-being, social functioning, view of life with the ICD). Conclusions: The technology progress of ICDs with the improvement of the implantation procedure minimized the negative influence they use to have in recipients' quality of life. But, there are some demographic characteristics which continue to be independent risk factors for worse quality of life after implantation. More researches should take place in order to be found better approaches of ICD recipients for improvement of their physical and psychosocial well-being.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018289164,1,0,0,

It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928566433,1,1,0,

This results in an asymmetric condition, where younger and older adults use different media and communication channels. To balance communication practices we integrated classic media based on pen and paper with online social networks. In this paper we present a 36 weeks deployment study with an extended family (n=12) of the use of Tlatosketch, a hybrid system based on a digital photo frame, and digital pen and paper technology. This combination allows older adults to stay updated on Facebook and to post paper notes to Facebook. Our results show that Tlatosketch provides the older adult with a new media for self-expression, and improves the family social experience, thus helping them remain active while ageing.

Objectives: This article illustrates how formative organizational evaluation can be used to adapt health literacy interventions delivered by community partners. Methods: Key informant interviews and ethnographic observations were conducted as part of a formative organizational evaluation of potential community partners. Lessons Learned: The observed brevity of volunteer-client interaction led program planners to incorporate substantial emphasis on communicating with older adults into the health literacy coach training curriculum. Ethnographic observations made clear that program materials had to be portable and fit it in with the mobile nature of MOW delivery. Conclusions: Formative organizational research can greatly increase the chance of successful implementation of public health interventions when those interventions will be implemented in partnerships with community-based organizations in diverse settings and with varying practices. © 2015 The Johns Hopkins University Press.,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949561274,1,0,0,

Methods: We interviewed community dwelling elderly persons of two rural areas in Nigeria using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-30). Those who scored 11 and above on the GDS-30 were further interviewed using Geriatric Mental State Schedule (GMSS). Diagnosis of depression was based on the International Classification of Diseases 10th edition (ICD-10) and GMSS-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (GMMS-AGECAT). Results: A total of 458 community dwelling elderly persons participated in the study of which 57% were females. Mean age of the participants was 73.65(±7.8) years (95% CI 72.93-74.37).

Older adults in aged care facilities have higher levels of depression, and lower levels of social support and sense of belonging compared with older adults living in the community. Research has begun to assess the effectiveness of interventions to improve the mental health of residents and has found both cognitive and physical benefits of video game playing. The benefits of playing these games in a group may also lead to greater social interaction and decreased loneliness. The current study aims to investigate an intervention program designed to foster relationships among older adults in care based on shared interests. Residents will be assessed on the effectiveness of a 6 week program of playing Wii bowling in comparison to a control group. Method/Design: Participants will be allocated to the intervention (Wii bowling) or the control group based on their place of residence. Participants in the intervention group will be invited to participate in Wii bowling twice weekly, with up to three other residents for a period of 6 weeks. Residents in both conditions will be assessed for depression, social support, sense of belonging, and current self-rated mood at pre-intervention (0 weeks), post-intervention (6 weeks), and at 2-month follow up (14 weeks). Qualitative data on social interaction between group members will also be collected at weeks 1, 3, and 6. Both groups will receive a Wii console after week 6 to establish if residents and staff engage with the Wii without intervention. Discussion: The Wii provides a user friendly platform for older adults to use video games, and it incorporates both social and competitive aspects in the game play. Existing research has not extensively investigated the social aspects of using this type of technology with older adults. If found to be effective, incorporating Wii games into an activity schedule may benefit the mental health of older adults living in care by establishing an intervention that is fun, economical, and easy to use.

As China is probably the largest personal data pool and vastest application market of big data, the situation of Chinese privacy trust plays a significant role. Based on the 17 most common data collection scenarios, the following aspects have been observed through 508 questionnaires and interviews of 20 samples.To start with, there is a severe privacy trust crisis in China, both in the field of enterprise services such as online shopping and social networks, etc. and in some public services like medical care and education, etc. Besides, there are also doubts about data collected by the government since individuals refuse to offer personal information or give false information as much as possible. Some people even buy two phone numbers, one is in use, while the other is not carried around or used by them, which is only bought to be offered to data collectors. Secondly, in terms of gender, females have lower trust in enterprises and social associations than males, especially in the fields of social networks and personal consumption. However, there is no obvious difference in fields of government and public services. Females possess stronger awareness but less skilled in precautions than males. Thirdly, people between the ages of 18 and 50 are more suspicious of data collected by enterprises, while age exerts little obvious influence on the credibility of data collected by the government, social associations and public services. Older people are less aware of precautions than people at other ages. In addition, from the perspective of education background, people with higher degrees possess stronger awareness of precautions and thus lower degree of trust. Therefore, it is suggested that more education on privacy consciousness should be given, and relative laws as well as regulations need improving. Besides, innovation in privacy protection technologies should be encouraged. What is more, we need to reinforce the management of the internet industry and strictly regulate personal data collection of the government. © 2015 Zhong Wang & Qian Yu.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84948177916,0,0,0,

There has also been a dramatic increase in the number and diversity of both sources of information on health issues and the possibilities for sharing information and experiences over ICT-based social networks. It has been suggested that these developments have the potential to 'empower' patients, reducing their dependence on providers and possibly improving their quality of care by increasing the volume and timeliness of diagnostic data and encouraging active self-management of their condition, for example through lifestyle changes. Perhaps more significantly, it is also seen by many economies with ageing populations as a way to contain high and ever rising healthcare costs.It has also been suggested that a move to greater self-management supported by expert networks and smart phone technology could improve the treatment of many millions of patients with chronic diseases in low and middle income economies that are also confronting the potential cost implications of epidemiological and demographic transitions, combined with the higher expectations of a more educated and knowledgeable population. There is now limited evidence that some fairly basic e- and mHealth interventions, for example in the areas of MNCH, malaria and HIV/AIDS can have a positive impact, even in resource-poor contexts. The aim here is to explore the extent to which further investment in technology could play a role in the development of an effective and affordable health sector strategy for at least some developing economies. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the approach may be highly dependent on the specific health conditions addressed, the nature of existing health systems and the overall socio-economic and cultural context. © 2014 The Author.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945976207,0,0,0,

We examined the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial to assess whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation through personal computers, webcams, and a user-friendly interactive Internet interface had high adherence and a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults without dementia. Methods Daily 30-minute face-to-face communications were conducted during a 6-week trial period in the intervention group. The control group received only a weekly telephone interview. The cognitive status of normal subjects and those with mild cognitive impairment was operationally defined as a global clinical dementia rating of 0 and 0.5, respectively. Age, sex, education, mini mental state examination score, and clinical dementia rating score were balancing factors in randomization. The subjects were recruited using mass-mailing invitations. The pre- to postintervention differences in the cognitive test scores and loneliness scores were compared between the control and intervention groups using linear regression models. Results Eighty-three subjects participated (41 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group). Their mean ± standard deviation age was 80.5 ± 6.8 years. Adherence to the protocol was high. There was no dropout and mean percentage of days completed of the targeted trial days among the intervention group was 89% (range 77%-100%). Among the cognitively intact participants, the intervention group improved more than did the control group on a semantic fluency test (P =.003) at the post-trial assessment and a phonemic fluency test (P =.004) at the 18-week assessments. Among those with mild cognitive impairment, a trend (P =.04) toward improved psychomotor speed was observed in the intervention group. Conclusion Daily conversations by way of user-friendly Internet communication programs demonstrated high adherence. Among the cognitively intact, the intervention group showed greater improvement in tests of language-based executive functions. Increasing daily social contacts through communication technologies could offer cost-effective home-based prevention methods. Additional studies with a longer follow-up duration are required to examine whether the intervention slows cognitive declines and delays the onset of dementia. © 2015 The Authors.

The goal of this study was to examine the benefit of wearing medical alert devices to activate emergency medical systems for elderly women living alone. This was a randomized, controlled pilot trial. Women over 60 with at least 1 stroke risk factor were recruited from Southeast Michigan. Subjects received either a medical alert device or control. The primary outcome was change in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) from baseline to 90 days of wearing the device or control. A planned sample size of 320 could not be reached, and the trial was stopped at 265 women randomized prior to data examination. On average, the treatment group was older, reported lower prevalence of high cholesterol, and was less likely to complete follow-up. There was a nonsignificant smaller loss of healthy days in the past month in the intervention group (0.46) compared with the control group (2.23) (p = 0.213). Similarly, the secondary outcomes of changes in anxiety, depression, and changes in perceived isolation did not differ by treatment and control groups.

HCV prevalence is influenced by a complex interplay of drug-use behaviors, social networks, and geography, as well as the availability of interventions, such as needle exchange programs. To adequately address this complexity in HCV epidemic forecasting, we have developed a computational model, the Agent-based Pathogen Kinetics model (APK). APK simulates the PWID population in metropolitan Chicago, including the social interactions that result in HCV infection. We used multiple empirical data sources on Chicago PWID to build a spatial distribution of an in silico PWID population and modeled networks among the PWID by considering the geography of the city and its suburbs. APK was validated against 2012 empirical data (the latest available) and shown to agree with network and epidemiological surveys to within 1%. For the period 2010-2020, APK forecasts a decline in HCV prevalence of 0.8% per year from 44(±2)% to 36(±5)%, although some sub-populations would continue to have relatively high prevalence, including Non-Hispanic Blacks, 48(±5)%. The rate of decline will be lowest in Non-Hispanic Whites and we find, in a reversal of historical trends, that incidence among non-Hispanic Whites would exceed incidence among Non-Hispanic Blacks (0.66 per 100 per years vs 0.17 per 100 person years). APK also forecasts an increase in PWID mean age from 35(±1) to 40(±2) with a corresponding increase from 59 (±2)% to 80(±6)% in the proportion of the population >30 years old. Our studies highlight the importance of analyzing subpopulations in disease predictions, the utility of computer simulation for analyzing demographic and health trends among PWID and serve as a tool for guiding intervention and prevention strategies in Chicago, and other major cities.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947708355,0,0,0,

Design: This is a parallel 1:1 randomized controlled feasibility study. Setting: The study was conducted in a teaching hospital in Vancouver, BC, Canada. Participants: Participants were community-dwelling adults over 60 years of age with a recent hip fracture. They were recruited and assessed in hospital, and then randomized after hospital discharge to the intervention or control group by a web-based randomization service. Treatment allocation was concealed to the investigators, measurement team, and data entry assistants and analysts. Participants and the research physiotherapist were aware of treatment allocation. Intervention: Intervention included usual care for hip fracture plus a 1-hour in-hospital educational session using a patient-centered educational manual and four videos, and up to five postdischarge telephone calls from a physiotherapist to provide recovery coaching. The control group received usual care plus a 1-hour in-hospital educational session using the educational manual and videos. Measurement: Our primary outcome was feasibility, specifically recruitment and retention of participants. We also collected selected health outcomes, including health-related quality of life (EQ5D-5L), gait speed, and psychosocial factors (ICEpop CAPability measure for Older people and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Results: Our pilot study results indicate that it is feasible to recruit, retain, and provide follow-up telephone coaching to older adults after hip fracture. We enrolled 30 older adults (mean age 81.5 years; range 61–97 years), representing a 42% recruitment rate. Participants excluded were those who were not community dwelling on admission, were discharged to a residential care facility, had physician-diagnosed dementia, and/or had medical contraindications to participation. There were 27 participants who completed the study: eleven in the intervention group, 15 in the control group, and one participant completed a qualitative interview only. There were no differences between groups for health measures. Conclusion: We highlight the feasibility of telephone coaching for older adults after hip fracture to improve adherence to mobility recovery goals. © 2015 Langford et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84942778101,1,1,1,

The mobility needs of older wheelchair users are particularly complex due to a constellation of chronic conditions and comorbidities that may compromise optimal use of the device. The purpose of the Mobility Outcomes via Information Technologies (MOvIT) project is to examine the feasibility of automated calls for the systematic monitoring for adverse outcomes associated with wheelchair use. Methods: A two-phase mixed methods approach was used. Phase I involved user-centered development and face validation of a monitoring questionnaire with end-users (seven wheelchair users and five healthcare providers). Phase II tested the feasibility of monitoring outcomes using automated calls to administer the MOvIT questionnaire 1 and 3 months after wheelchair delivery with a prospective cohort of older adults (50-84 years of age). When problems were identified, the computer monitoring system notified a clinical coordinator who followed up with respondents requiring interventions. Feasibility data were extracted from the web database and from individual interviews covering perceived ease of use, usefulness and intention to use the MOvIT questionnaire in the future. Results: The MOvIT monitoring questionnaire developed in phase I tracks nine potential wheelchair-related adverse outcomes considered important for end-users: 1) non-use of wheelchair, 2) pain, 3) skin condition, 4) positioning, 5) wheelchair incidents, 6) psychosocial issues, 7) restricted wheelchair participation, 8) limited wheelchair skills and knowledge, and 9) technical problems. In phase II, 92 individuals who received a wheelchair were eligible, 71 out of 92 accepted (77 %) and 65 out of 71 (92 %) completed the 3-month follow-up. In the sample of 65 participants, a wheelchair-related adverse outcome was confirmed by a rehabilitation professional for 58.5 %, and at least one recommendation was given to 66.2 % during the 3-month monitoring period. A majority of participants found the intervention useful (82.8 %) and said they intended to use the MOvIT monitoring questionnaire in the future (81.5 %). Participants made suggestions to make the calls more adaptive to various ability profiles. Conclusions: Automated calls tailored for individuals with mobility limitations and associated comorbidities are a promising approach to reach clients who need post-rehabilitation support. © 2015 Auger et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941618654,1,0,0,

Thus, a growing body of research has been looking into the relationship between social capital and Internet usage. This research has been showing a positive relationship between them; however, results are not as conclusive when we consider one of the main dimensions of social capital: bonding. Bonding relates to resources that are embedded in one’s strong ties (i.e., family members and close friends). The study of bonding is of particular sociological interest, since the discussion around the social effects of the Internet still suggests that it takes time away from strong ties and that is more useful to connect with weak ties (i.e., acquaintances). This study examines the relationship between bonding and the Internet, using representative survey data and semi-structured interviews from Portugal. Findings show that bonding is predicted positively by Internet use but negatively by age. On one hand, the Internet seems to compensate for the negative age effect because older adults who use it are more likely to have a high level of bonding. On the other hand, the Internet reinforces accumulated social advantage. Â© 2015 University of Rome ‘La Sapienza’.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937819985,0,0,0,

Taking age-cohort effects into account, it is still unclear how the mechanisms concerning stress and health function and how the distribution of stressors, stress mediators and stress effects on health differ between generations. Objectives: The article approaches stress from a generational perspective asking: which are the stressors the baby boomer generation is facing? Under which conditions and with which resources is exposure to stressors harmful to health? Is there an accumulation of stress in later working life? Material and methods: In the course of the project “Wellbeing”, a quantitative online survey was carried out in selected commercial enterprises and public institutions in four project partner countries. The results for Austrian participants are presented in this article. Results: Employees of the baby boomer generation are exposed to both time-related and social stressors at the workplace and a high percentage of respondents expressed symptoms of physical and psychological stress. Stress mediators, such as agency-based coping strategies and social resources at the workplace could buffer these stressors; however, stressors and stress mediators are significantly correlated creating a “triple whammy” effect (i.e. exposure to stressors, lack of social resources and restricted coping), which particularly affects older male baby boomers. Conclusion: Social support buffers the negative effects of a limited health and lower education for female baby boomers, which supports the buffering hypothesis of social convoy theory, whereas male baby boomers lack the resources to effectively cope with work stress. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939266683,1,maybe,0,

There is evidence to suggest age impacts overall SNS use, but little is known about how different age groups use Facebook, and whether use is associated with improved or diminished well-being. Method This study examined how individuals aged 18-70+ years used Facebook, and how their well-being was impacted by said use. An anonymous survey was completed by 529 individuals assessing the association between age, frequency of Facebook use in the past 30 days, trouble controlling use, body-image as it pertained to use, and site-related social fulfillment. A series of univariate ANOVAs and regressions were conducted to better understand differences in use and effects of use on trichotomized age groups. Results Results indicate that there are significant differences in both the ways in which older adults use Facebook and the effects Facebook has on this population compared to younger cohorts. Findings suggest that younger adults use Facebook more frequently and are significantly more emotionally impacted by the site than older adults. For example, younger adults spend more time per day on the site and experience more negative body image because of Facebook than do older adults. These preliminary findings highlight the need for more research into the effects of SNS on individuals of different age groups and individualized intervention methods for SNS-related problems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

This article describes a qualitative method for using case notes from the clinical records of older individuals in order to investigate the priority concerns spontaneously reported by older adults to deepen our understanding of both the context in which reported loneliness occurs in Ireland and the potential triggers. The participants in this study represent a cross-section of older adults who participated in the Technology Research for Independent Living Clinic (TRIL). Data were collected from participants through interviewer case notes at the TRIL centre in St James's hospital, Dublin. 624 participants (431 females; 193 males) ranging in age from 60-92 years (Mean 73 years, SD 7 years) took part in the study. All were community dwelling and provided consent. A thematic analysis from grounded theory was used to evaluate the case notes for each participant. Preliminary results highlight the richness of phenomenological experience to enhance our understanding of loneliness and provide an opportunity to better understand the precursors and variability that loneliness may take. In this study we found themes in the case note analysis linking social loneliness with self-imposed limitations on social engagement due to declining health while predominate themes for emotionally lonely focused on psychological issues of stress and anxiety associated with adverse life events. The results suggest the importance of case notes to inform clinical practice.

If the ambition of 'care closer to home' is to be realised, then industry, health and social care providers must evolve ways to work with older people to co-produce useful and useable solutions. Method: We conducted 10 co-design workshops with users of telehealth and telecare, their carers, service providers and technology suppliers. Using vignettes developed from in-depth ethnographic case studies, we explored participants' perspectives on the design features of technologies and services to enable and facilitate the co-production of new care solutions. Workshop discussions were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: Analysis revealed four main themes. First, there is a need to raise awareness and provide information to potential users of assisted living technologies (ALTs). Second, technologies must be highly customisable and adaptable to accommodate the multiple and changing needs of different users. Third, the service must align closely with the individual's wider social support network. Finally, the service must support a high degree of information sharing and coordination. Conclusions: The case vignettes within inclusive and democratic co-design workshops provided a powerful means for ALT users and their carers to contribute, along with other stakeholders, to technology and service design. The workshops identified a need to focus attention on supporting the social processes that facilitate the collective efforts of formal and informal care networks in ALT delivery and use. © 2015 Wherton et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930170696,1,0,0,

We used self-report data from six waves of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health over 14 years. A total of 12,338 women participating in the midage cohort (aging from 45-50 to 59-64) provided self-report indications of DE at Surveys 1 and 2, and QoL (SF-36 component scales-mental [MCS] and physical [PCS]) at Surveys 2-6. DE was reported by 10.98% of the women; this group also reported significantly poorer mental and physical QoL than those without DE, and this effect was sustained over time. Comparison with a parallel analysis of a younger cohort of women showed that the effect on midage women's physical QoL is greater than that of the younger women. The relationships between baseline DE and changes in QoL (both physical and mental) over time were mediated by levels of depressive symptoms and of social support over time. This study underscores the significant effect of DE on QoL in midage, an effect which is partially or fully mediated by depressive symptoms or social support. Well-being of midage women with indicators of DE needs to be supported by tailoring prevention and interventions activities specifically for this group. © 2015 American Psychological Association.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928576131,0,0,0,

Methods/Design: This study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial, will evaluate the effectiveness and cost of Elder Tree. Older adults who are at risk for losing their independence - along with their informal caregivers, if they name them - are randomized to two groups. The intervention group has access to their usual sources of information and communication as well as to Elder Tree for 18 months while the control group uses only their usual sources of information and communication. The primary outcome of the study is older adult quality of life. Secondary outcomes are cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year and the impact of the technology on independence, loneliness, falls, medication management, driving and transportation, and caregiver appraisal and mastery. We will also examine the mediating effect of self-determination theory. We will evaluate the effectiveness of Elder Tree by comparing intervention- and control-group participants at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18. We will use mixed-effect models to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes, where pretest score functions as a covariate, treatment condition is a between-subjects factor, and the multivariate outcome reflects scores for a given assessment at the three time points. Separate analyses will be conducted for each outcome. Cost per Quality-Adjusted Life Year will be compared between the intervention and control groups. Additional analyses will examine the mediating effect of self-determination theory on each outcome. Discussion: Elder Tree is a multifaceted intervention, making it a challenge to assess which services or combinations of services account for outcomes in which subsets of older adults. If Elder Tree can improve quality of life and reduce healthcare costs among older adults, it could suggest a promising way to ease the burden that advancing age can place on older adults, their families, and the healthcare system. © Gustafson et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928777670,1,0,0,proposal

It is expensive to provide high quality services to small populations who are widely dispersed; staff and patients are often required to travel considerable distances to access services, and the economic downturn has created a climate where delivery costs are under constant review. There is potential for technology to overcome some of these problems by decreasing or ceasing the need for patients and health professionals to travel to attend/deliver in-person appointments. A variety of eHealth initiatives (for example Pathways through Pain an online course aimed to aid self-help amongst those living with persistent pain) have been launched across the UK, but roll out remains at an early stage. Methods: This mixed-methods study of older adults with chronic pain examines attitudes towards, current use of and acceptance of the use of technology in healthcare. A survey (n∈=∈168, 40% response rate) captured broad experiences of the use of technology in health and social care. Semi-structured interviews (four with technology and seven without technology participants) elicited attitudes towards technology in healthcare and explored attributes of personal and social interaction during home visits. Results: People suffering from chronic pain access healthcare in a variety of ways. eHealth technology use was most common amongst older adults who lived alone. There was broad acceptance of eHealth being used in future care of people with chronic pain, but older adults wanted eHealth to be delivered alongside existing in-person visits from health and social care professionals. Conclusions: eHealth has the potential to overcome some traditional challenges of providing rural healthcare, however roll out needs to be gradual and begin by supplementing, not substituting, existing care and should be mindful of individual's circumstances, capability and preferences. Acceptance of technology may relate to existing levels of personal and social contact, and may be greater where technological help is not perceived to be replacing in-person care. © 2015 Currie et al.; license BioMed Central.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928816564,1,1,0,

Through reflexive ethnographic analysis the human-(non-)human boundary-making and temporalities are analyzed from the ""ICT biographies"" of sixteen interviewees. The perspectives of aging as lived experience and as socio-cultural phenomenon; and the socio-materiality entangled with temporal layers; are combined to understand the intra-action between the aging ICT users and technology. The social relations are discussed as an essential part of this intra-action: the interviewees perceive themselves as slow and clumsy ICT users in relation to younger ""generations"", for example. In the boundary making between humans and machines, the interviewees' previous experiences on communication technologies are significant. Continuing on the path set by previous studies on ICT and aging, this article further discusses the benefits of ethnographic study on existing ICT practices for computing design. What could be learnt from these practices in relation to, for example, technology usage in private and public places, negative and positive experiences, motivations and needs of aging citizens? How could design benefit from understanding aging as situated, lived experience; and on the other hand, from investigating research process through reflexive ethnography? © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924852003,0,1,0,

Fecal incontinence leads to a high economic burden to the healthcare system and is an important cause of institutionalization. In addition, fecal incontinence is associated with shame, social isolation and reduced quality of life. The importance of identifying treatable causes in the frail elderly is strongly emphasized. It is recommended that an assessment of fecal incontinence should be implemented as part of an evaluation of older patients. Although there is a substantial evidence base to guide choice of implementation activities targeting healthcare professionals, little implementation research has focused on the care of older people nor involved care processes or care personnel. This study is based on the assumption that fecal incontinence among nursing home patients can be prevented, cured or ameliorated by offering care staff knowledge of best practice through a multifaceted educational program. The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that a multifaceted educational program for nursing home care staff on assessment and treatment of fecal incontinence reduces patients' frequency of fecal incontinence. Methods/design: The study is a two-armed, parallel cluster-randomized controlled trial. Primary outcome is the frequency of fecal incontinence among patients. Sample size calculations resulted in a need for a total sample of 240 patients. Twenty nursing home units in one city in Norway will be recruited and allocated to intervention or control by an independent statistician using computer-generated tables. The intervention is a multifaceted educational program. Units in the control arm will provide care as usual. The intervention period is 3 months. Data will be collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months. Data will be analyzed using mixed effect models with the cluster treated as a random effect. Discussion: This study is the first randomized controlled trial specifically focusing on this neglected area. The result of the study will give evidence for best practice for continence care in nursing homes, and organizational advice concerning implementation strategies.

To fill this knowledge gap, special attention is paid to understanding the issues of social exclusion and happiness in relation to the indigenous peoples in Taiwan. Methods: Data used were drawn from a nationwide representativeness survey of the Taiwanese Indigenous People in 2007; it included 2,200 respondents. This study employed binary logistic regression to examine the effects of different domains of social exclusion on the likelihood of perceiving happiness; other exogenous factors, were controlled. Results: The results show that among the respondents, mountain indigenous peoples, females, the elderly and those who are healthier, wealthier, highly educated, possessing western beliefs, and are more likely to be happy, compared to their counterparts. As expected, the results reveal that the likelihood of being happy is higher for those who have received medical benefits, as well as those persons without housing problems or financial difficulties, compared to their excluded counterparts. However, no significant association is found between happiness and some social exclusion domains, such as child and youth benefits, and unemployment benefits. Conclusions: The disengagement of the indigenous peoples in mainstream society, with respect to the accessibility of welfare provisions, is a crucial element in regard to social exclusion and happiness. Several policy implications for the social sustainability of indigenous peoples can be inferred from these findings. For example, providing a mobile clinical tour, on-site health counseling, or homecare service can contribute to the removal of institutional and geographic barriers to medical welfare provisions for the mountain indigenes. Moreover, the government may devote more welfare resources to assist indigenous families and tribal communities to develop their own social safety net, instead of the individual-oriented welfare provisions. © 2015 Jiun-Hao Wang.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923169959,1,0,0,

For cancer survivors who have lost their job, return to work can be more challenging compared to employed survivors, as they generally find themselves in a more vulnerable social and financial position. Cancer survivors with job loss may therefore be in need of tailored return to work support. However, there is a lack of return to work intervention programs specifically targeting these cancer survivors. The number of cancer survivors with job loss in developed countries is rising due to, amongst others, increases in the incidence and survivor rate of cancer, the retirement age and the proportion of flexible employment contracts. Hence, we consider it important to develop a tailored return to work intervention program for cancer survivors with job loss, and to evaluate its effectiveness compared to usual care. Methods/Design: This study employs a two-armed randomised controlled trial with a follow-up period of 12 months. The study population (n=164) will be recruited from a national sample of cancer survivors (18-60 years), who have been sick-listed for 12-36 months. Participants will be randomised by using computerized blocked randomisation (blocks of four). All participants will receive usual care as provided by the Dutch Social Security Agency. Additionally, participants in the intervention group will receive a tailored return to work intervention program, which includes vocational rehabilitation and supportive psychosocial components, as well as (therapeutic) placement at work. The primary outcome measure is duration until sustainable return to work; the secondary outcome measure is rate of return to work. Other parameters include, amongst others, fatigue, coping strategy and quality of life. We will perform Cox regression analyses to estimate hazard ratios for time to sustainable return to work. Discussion: The hypothesis of this study is that a tailored approach for cancer survivors with job loss is more effective, regarding return to work, compared to usual care. The results of this study will provide insight into the ways in which return to work can be facilitated for cancer survivors with job loss.

Interventions were personalized and delivered in home for a minimum of 3 weeks. Postintervention measures indicated the technology was easy to use, significantly facilitated meaningful and positive engagement, and simplified caregivers' daily lives. Although intervention goals were met, caregivers had high expectations of their loved one's ability to regain independence.

After describing how SARs can be of benefit in this form of healthcare, we detail our participatory design study with older adults and therapists aimed at developing preventive SARs applications for this population. We found therapists and older adults to be willing and able to participate in assistive robot design, though hands-on participation was a challenge.

Material and Methods: With our guidance, each of the six CCRCs recruited a volunteer (V-Group) and random (R-Group) sample of independent living residents. We provided face-to-face training and ongoing remote electronic support to the CCRC staff on the testing battery and the Web-based data entry system. The testing battery was consisted of demographic, physical function, and psychosocial assessments. Results: After training, CCRC staff were receptive to the study goals and successfully used the data entry Website. In the V-Group (N = 189), 76% were already participating in CCRC wellness programs. We attempted to recruit a random, unbiased (R-Group) sample of 20% (n = 105) of eligible residents; however, only 30 consented to be tested and 70% of this group (21/30) were also already participating in a wellness program.

Social Network Services like Facebook have the potential to ameliorate the social connectivity of this segment of the population. However, they are still not fully adopted by them, whether because of age-related limitations or the lack of appropriate technological skills. In this paper we argue that the development of SNSs based on technology already used by older adults, like Television, or technology which has proven to be more accessible to them, like Tablets, can improve the ability of older adults to use these systems. We report findings from a study composed of semi-structured interviews and focus groups which aimed at the development of two Facebook-based prototypes for TV and Tablet. Results show good receptiveness from older adults to perform social tasks on TV and Tablet-based applications, for interacting using alternative modalities like speech, or back-of-device tapping, and for the use of adaptation mechanisms.

Although many such networks exist, they are rarely assessed with tools that account for their complexity. This study examined the structure of mentorship and collaboration relationships among members of the Healthy Aging Research Network (HAN) using social network analysis (SNA). Methods We invited 97 HAN members and partners to complete an online social network survey that included closed-ended questions about HAN-specific mentorship and collaboration during the previous 12 months. Collaboration was measured by examining the activity of the network on 6 types of products: published articles, in-progress manuscripts, grant applications, tools, research projects, and presentations. We computed network-level measures such as density, number of components, and centralization to assess the cohesiveness of the network. Results Sixty-three respondents completed the survey (response rate, 65%). Responses, which included information about collaboration with nonrespondents, suggested that 74% of HAN members were connected through mentorship ties and that all 97 members were connected through at least one form of collaboration. Mentorship and collaboration ties were present both within and across boundaries of HAN member organizations.

Methods: Discussions with 12 older adults, divided into three focus groups, generated data that were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Six women and six men between 67 and 79 years of age were purposively selected and recruited from a retirement organization in northern Sweden. Results: Findings reflect how online contexts generated new possibilities for togetherness in everyday occupations and created a sense of belonging with others and to society at large. However, togetherness through the Internet was also associated with ambiguity and uncertainty among older adults. The Internet provided opportunities for togetherness that were somehow different from togetherness derived from face-to-face contact, but it was also connected with a fear and a resistance. Conclusions: Findings from this research can extend our understanding of how online contexts have the possibility to promote togetherness in everyday occupations and what it means to be part of such a context among older adults. In light of these findings, the need is highlighted to consider the Internet as a tool for older adults to be socially engaged with the potential to reduce loneliness and isolation. © 2015 © Informa Healthcare.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937215779,1,1,0,

ICT use is associated with decreased feelings of loneliness and depression, along with increased feelings of independence and personal growth. However, limited access and low technological self-efficacy are key reasons why some groups, especially older adults, are excluded from being fully engaged in the digital world. In this study, we focus on older adults’ technological self-efficacy, which is related to their actual use of technology and the second level digital divide. Specifically, we examine: (a) how older adults decide to use a new technology, tablet computers; (b) how they conquer the barrier of technological self-efficacy through using tablets; and (c) the impacts of using this new technology in their lives. Twenty-one in-depth interviews were conducted with older adults residing in independent living communities in a medium-sized city in the Deep South region of the United States. Observational and enactive learning played important roles for older adults in using tablets. Seeing others use tablets, getting recommendations from family members, or having tablets given to them were the primary reasons they started to use tablet computers. The ease of use feature of tablets helped solve the problem of lacking technological self-efficacy. Using tablets helped increase a sense of connectedness.

Regular physical activity can substantially improve the physical wellbeing of older adults, preventing several chronic diseases and increasing cognitive performance and mood. However, research has shown that older adults are the most sedentary segment of society, spending much of their time seated or inactive. A variety of barriers make it difficult for older adults to maintain an active lifestyle, including logistical difficulties in going to a gym(for some adults, leaving home can be challenging), reduced functional abilities, and lack of motivation. In this paper, we report on the design and evaluation of Gymcentral. A training application running on tablet was designed to allow older adults to follow a personalized home-based exercise program while being remotely assisted by a coach. The objective of the study was to assess if a virtual gym that enables virtual presence and social interaction is more motivating for training than the same virtual gymwithout social interaction. Methods. A total of 37 adults aged between 65 and 87 years old (28 females and 9 males, mean age = 71, sd = 5.8) followed a personalized home-based strength and balance training plan for eight weeks. The participants performed the exercises autonomously at home using the Gymcentral application. Participants were assigned to two training groups: the Social group used an application with persuasive and social functionalities, while the Control group used a basic version of the service with no persuasive and social features.We further explored the effects of social facilitation, and in particular of virtual social presence, in user participation to training sessions. Outcome measures were adherence, persistence and co-presence rate. Results. Participants in the Social group attended significantly more exercise sessions than the Control group, providing evidence of a better engagement in the training program. Besides the focus on social persuasion measures, the study also confirms that a virtual gymservice is effective for supporting individually tailored home-based physical training for older adults. The study also confirms that social facilitation tools motivate users to train together in a virtual fitness environment. Discussion. The study confirms that Gymcentral increases the participation of older adults in physical training compare to a similar version of the application without social and persuasive features. In addition, a significant increase in the co-presence of the Social group indicates that social presence motivates the participants to join training sessions at the same time with the other participants. These results are encouraging, as they motivate further research into using home-based training programs as an opportunity to stay physically and socially active, especially for those who for various reasons are bound to stay at home. © 2015 Khaghani Far et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016997614,1,1,1,

Our review yields considerations for how interventions may need to be developed or modified to be efficacious for this population segment. Technology may be a key component in adopting interventions, particularly tele-technologies, which we define and discuss in depth. © 2015 International Journal of Automation and Smart Technology.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949658705,0,0,0,

However, among these older populations, little is known about what factors influence their eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information. Objective: The intent of the study was to explore the extent to which sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use influences eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for health information among baby boomers and older adults. Methods: A random sample of baby boomers and older adults (n=283, mean 67.46 years, SD 9.98) participated in a cross-sectional, telephone survey that included the eHealth literacy scale (eHEALS) and items from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) assessing electronic device use and use of Web 2.0 for health information. An independent samples t test compared eHealth literacy among users and non-users of Web 2.0 for health information. Multiple linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between sociodemographic, social determinants, and electronic device use on self-reported eHealth literacy and use of Web 2.0 for seeking and sharing health information. Results: Almost 90% of older Web 2.0 users (90/101, 89.1%) reported using popular Web 2.0 websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, to find and share health information. Respondents reporting use of Web 2.0 reported greater eHealth literacy (mean 30.38, SD 5.45, n=101) than those who did not use Web 2.0 (mean 28.31, SD 5.79, n=182), t<inf>217.60</inf> =-2.98, P=.003. Younger age (b=-0.10), more education (b=0.48), and use of more electronic devices (b=1.26) were significantly associated with greater eHealth literacy (R2 =.17, R2adj =.14, F<inf>9,229</inf>=5.277, P<.001). Women were nearly three times more likely than men to use Web 2.0 for health information (OR 2.63, Wald= 8.09, df=1, P=.004). Finally, more education predicted greater use of Web 2.0 for health information, with college graduates (OR 2.57, Wald= 3.86, df =1, P=.049) and post graduates (OR 7.105, Wald= 4.278, df=1, P=.04) nearly 2 to 7 times more likely than non-high school graduates to use Web 2.0 for health information. Conclusions: Being younger and possessing more education was associated with greater eHealth literacy among baby boomers and older adults. Females and those highly educated, particularly at the post graduate level, reported greater use of Web 2.0 for health information. More in-depth surveys and interviews among more diverse groups of baby boomers and older adult populations will likely yield a better understanding regarding how current Web-based health information seeking and sharing behaviors influence health-related decision making. © Bethany Tennant, Michael Stellefson, Virginia Dodd, Beth Chaney, Don Chaney, Samantha Paige, Julia Alber.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929676133,1,1,0,

Among these concerns, the reluctance of older adults to use digital media may cause them social isolation, leading to negative effects in their physical and mental health. Objective: This paper aims to formalize a model to mediate asymmetries in cross-generational communication and support the eInclusion of older adults. Methods: We conducted semi-structured interviews to the members of 20 cross-generational families. Following the grounded theory approach, we identified emerging themes regarding asymmetries in family communication practices when older adults are involved. We then derived and formalized computer-based mediation strategies using a model-driven engineering approach. Results: We identified three main sources of asymmetries: (1) implicit family agreements in terms of social interaction, (2) capability and preferences for using particular media, and (3) unbalanced socio-affective coupling between the involved parties. The proposed model addresses these asymmetries and provides strategies to coordinate the communication effort of family members with their elders. Conclusions: By using the proposed model, designers of software that supports family communities can conceive effective mechanisms to coordinate and mediate social communication among cross-generational family members through digital means. This allows the elderly to show a better reaction to digital media, thus facilitating their acceptance and appropriation of information technologies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947278916,1,maybe,0,

At the same time four catalysts were identified which motivated engagement with community resources both online and locally. These were: 'spaces and places', family, roles and loss. A sense of 'real' community was maintained through meeting people face to face with online communities and SNS being used predominantly as tools for achieving this aim.

The results indicate that the social interaction activities based phone calls through the mobile phone have an inverse correlation with social isolation level. In contrast, the social interaction activities based on the time spent inside home have a direct correlation.

To date, there have been limited robust systematic efforts to evaluate the psychosocial benefits of technology for older people and identify factors that influence both the usability and uptake of technology systems. In response to these issues, we developed the Personal Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM), a software application designed for older adults to support social connectivity, memory, knowledge about topics, leisure activities and access to resources. This trail is evaluating the impact of access to the PRISM system on outcomes such as social isolation, social support and connectivity. This paper reports on the approach used to design the PRISM system, study design, methodology and baseline data for the trial. The trial is multi-site randomized field trial. PRISM is being compared to a Binder condition where participants received a binder that contained content similar to that found on PRISM. The sample includes 300 older adults, aged 65-98. years, who lived alone and at risk for being isolated. The primary outcome measures for the trial include indices of social isolation and support and well-being. Secondary outcomes measures include indices of computer proficiency, technology uptake and attitudes towards technology. Follow-up assessments occurred at 6 and 12. months post-randomization. The results of this study will yield important information about the potential value of technology for older adults. The study also demonstrates how a user-centered iterative design approach can be incorporated into the design and evaluation of an intervention protocol. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84911500561,0,1,1,

Objective: The main purpose of this study was to examine factors influencing PTs to organize PA in LTCF for older adults. A secondary goal was to examine the PTs' knowledge about and their barriers at the PA guidelines for older adults of the World Health Organization (WHO). Methods: A mixed qualitative and quantitative study was carried out using semistructured interviews (n=24) followed by an online survey (n=254). As a frame the social-ecological model (McLeroy) was used, distinguishing factors at the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and community level. Results: In the qualitative component the PTs reported 41 motivators and 35 barriers for organizing PA in LTCF. The survey revealed that although the majority of the respondents (71%) are convinced of the usefulness of PA in LTCF, 84% are not familiar with the WHO-guidelines. Seventy-five percent of the respondents believe that the WHO-guidelines are not feasible for LTCF-residents. The strongest motivators on the intrapersonal level were maintaining the independence of the residents (98%), reducing the risk of falling (98%), and improving the physical (93%) and psychological (90%) wellbeing of LTCF-residents. The social interaction among LTCF-residents (91%) during PA was the strongest motivator on the interpersonal level. Motivators on the community level are the belief that PA is the basis of their physiotherapeutic work (89%) and that offering varied activities avoids PA becoming monotonous (71%). Barriers on the intra- and interpersonal level were of less influence. On the community level, they felt hindered to organize PA because of lack of time (38%) and the overload of paperwork (33%). Conclusions: This study described different motivators and barriers for PTs to organize PA in LTCFs. The majority does not know the WHO guidelines regarding the amount of PA for adults aged 65 and over. Although they agree that the guidelines are useful, they believe the guidelines are not feasible.

PC service includes psychosocial support (100 %), hospice in-patient care (30.2 %), homecare (60.5 %), PC outpatient clinic (14.0 %) and bereavement care (93.0 %).Conclusions: Elderly AML patients carry dismal prognosis with their final phase of disease mostly hospitalized in acute care settings. Infections and bleeding could complicate course of illness and lead to rapid deterioration. PC collaboration remains important in psychosocial support and coverage of dying AML patients in non-hospice settings. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919952600,1,1,0,

Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected with an online survey from 495 Italian wine drinkers in 2013. The survey was advertised through websites, blogs, social networks and emails. Based on background research and literature review, ten hypotheses were tested. Then a structural equation model was constructed using latent variables to test the causal links specified in the model. Findings – The results show that attitude towards sustainable-labelled wine is shaped by both environmental and quality beliefs about sustainable wine, while it is not affected by the economic dimension of sustainability. In addition, age appears to have a slight effect on attitude because young consumers seem to be more interested in sustainability aspects of food products than older people are. Practical implications – The paper suggests that company communication strategies should focus on sustainable issues to meet the requirements of environmentally conscious consumers. At the same time, sustainable certification on wine labels may help wineries to become more competitive using verifiable sustainable claims to differentiate their products. Originality/value – The work adds to the literature on wine marketing by evaluating which variables influence consumer attitude towards sustainable-labelled wine and, at the same time, to what extent sustainable aspects are important during wine purchase. © 2015, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947208554,1,0,0,

The global active users of the Facebook site surpassed one billion people on September 14th, 2012. It spent 13 years that the users of the Google site founded in 1998 surpassed one billion people in 2011. It spent 8 years that the Facebook site to do so. The official statistics of the Facebook site represented that there are about 15 million users visited the Facebook site monthly and there are about 12 million people visited the site by using the mobile Internet devices in the fourth quarter of 2013 in Taiwan. In the same time, there are about 11 million users visited the Facebook site daily and there are about 8.5 million people visited the site by using the mobile Internet devices in Taiwan. Taiwan is a mature market for the Facebook site, the website penetration is the highest in the world. Taiwan in where the Facebook site utility rate is so high faces the rapidly aging population issue. According to the statistics from Ministry of the Interior, Republic of China, the ratio of the population over 65 years old has exceeded 7% in 1993. It means that Taiwan is the aging society. The ratio of the population over 65 years old is 11.90% in October, 2014. With the statistics from Council for Economic Planning and Development in the Republic of China Executive Yuan, the ratio of Taiwan elderly population will exceed 14% in 2018, and Taiwan will be the aged society. The ratio of Taiwan elderly population will increase quickly from 2014 to 2025 because of the effect of the postwar baby boom.

We found that the elderly people is not the main usage group of the Facebook site, but using the Facebook site impacts positively for their learning, social networking, and the interactions among their family members. There are two difficulties for elderly people to use the Facebook site, one reason is they are not used to share their thinking to others, and the other reason is the computer operation is difficult for them.

Barriers to Internet uptake include attitude and a lack of knowledge and help. We have evaluated volunteer support in helping older people go online. Knowing what value the Internet has been to older people who have just gone online should guide how it is ""sold"" to those remaining offline. Objective: Objectives of this study are (1) to assess the feasibility of recruiting volunteers aged 50 years and older and supporting them in helping people (ie, beneficiaries) aged 65 years and older go online, (2) to assess the impact of beneficiaries using the Internet on contacts with others, loneliness, and mental health, and (3) to assess the perceived value to beneficiaries of going online. Methods: Beneficiaries received help in using the Internet from 32 volunteers in one of two ways: (1) one-on-one in their own homes, receiving an average of 12 hours of help over eight visits, or (2) in small group sessions, receiving 12 hours of help over six visits. We assessed, at registration and follow-up, the number of contacts with others, using Lubben's 6-item Lubben Social Network Scale (LBNS-6), loneliness, using De Jong Gierveld's 6-item De Jong Gierveld loneliness scale (DJG-6), and mental well-being, using Tennant's Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (SWEMWBS). We also assessed how beneficiaries valued going online using a Social Return on Investment (SROI) approach by postal survey. Results: A total of 144 beneficiaries were recruited with the aim of helping them go online via one-on-one (n=58) or small group (n=86) sessions. Data through to follow-up were available on 76.4% (110/144) of participants. From baseline to follow-up, the number of contacts with others was significantly increased-LBNS-6, mean 13.7 to mean 17.6-loneliness scores were reduced-DJG-6, mean 2.38 to mean 1.80-and mental well-being improved-SWEMWBS, mean 24.06 to mean 24.96. Out of six options, beneficiaries valued better communication with family and friends most and better health care least as a benefit of using the Internet. Out of nine options, having the Internet was valued less than having TV, but more than, for example, having a weekly visit from a cleaner. There were no associations between values placed on Internet use or volunteer help and psychological improvements. Conclusions: Volunteer help to go online seemed to result in increased social contacts, reduced loneliness, and improved mental well-being and was valued quite highly by beneficiaries. Although the use of the Internet for health care was the least valued, improved social contact can improve health.

Adults and elderly users of hearing aids suffer psychosocial reactions as a result of hearing loss. Auditory rehabilitation is typically carried out with support from a speech therapist, usually in a clinical center. For these cases, there is a lack of computer-based self-training tools for minimizing the psychosocial impact of hearing deficiency. OBJECTIVE. To develop and evaluate a web-based auditory self-training system for adult and elderly users of hearing aids. METHODS. Two modules were developed for the web system: an information module based on guidelines for using hearing aids; and an auditory training module presenting a sequence of training exercises for auditory abilities along the lines of the auditory skill steps within auditory processing. We built aweb system using PHP programming language and a MySQL database.from requirements surveyed through focus groups that were conducted by healthcare information technology experts. The web system was evaluated by speech therapists and hearing aid users. An initial sample of 150 patients at DSA/HRAC/USP was defined to apply the system with the inclusion criteria that: the individuals should be over the age of 25 years, presently have hearing impairment, be a hearing aid user, have a computer and have internet experience. They were divided into two groups: a control group (G1) and an experimental group (G2). These patients were evaluated clinically using the HHIE for adults and HHIA for elderly people, before and after system implementation. A third web group was formed with users who were invited through social networks for their opinions on using the system. A questionnaire evaluating hearing complaints was given to all three groups. The study hypothesis considered that G2 would present greater auditory perception, higher satisfaction and fewer complaints than G1 after the auditory training. It was expected that G3 would have fewer complaints regarding use and acceptance of the system. RESULTS. The web system, which was named SisTHA portal, was finalized, rated by experts and hearing aid users and approved for use. The system comprised auditory skills training along five lines: discrimination; recognition; comprehension and temporal sequencing; auditory closure; and cognitive-linguistic and communication strategies. Users needed to undergo auditory training over a minimum period of 1 month: 5 times a week for 30 minutes a day. Comparisons were made between G1 and G2 and web system use by G3. CONCLUSION. The web system developed was approved for release to hearing aid users. It is expected that the self-training will help improve effective use of hearing aids, thereby decreasing their rejection. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951961928,1,0,0,

Thus it is important to investigate whether and how attitudes toward robots can change. In this pilot study we investigate attitudinal changes in elderly citizens toward a tele-operated robot in relation to three parameters: (i) the information provided about robot functionality, (ii) the number of encounters, (iii) personality type. Fourteen elderly residents at a rehabilitation center participated. Pre-encounter attitudes toward robots, anthropomorphic thinking, and personality were assessed. Thereafter the participants interacted with a tele-operated robot (Telenoid) during their lunch (c. 30 min.) for up to 3 days. Half of the participants were informed that the robot was tele-operated (IC) whilst the other half were naïve to its functioning (UC). Post-encounter assessments of attitudes toward robots and anthropomorphic thinking were undertaken to assess change. Attitudes toward robots were assessed with a new generic 35-items questionnaire (attitudes toward social robots scale: ASOR-5), offering a differentiated conceptualization of the conditions for social interaction. There was no significant difference between the IC and UC groups in attitude change toward robots though trends were observed. Personality was correlated with some tendencies for attitude changes; Extraversion correlated with positive attitude changes to intimate-personal relatedness with the robot (r = 0.619) and to psychological relatedness (r = 0.581) whilst Neuroticism correlated negatively (r = -0.582) with mental relatedness with the robot. The results tentatively suggest that neither information about functionality nor direct repeated encounters are pivotal in changing attitudes toward robots in elderly citizens. This may reflect a cognitive congruence bias where the robot is experienced in congruence with initial attitudes, or it may support action-based explanations of cognitive dissonance reductions, given that robots, unlike computers, are not yet perceived as action targets. Specific personality traits may be indicators of attitude change relating to specific domains of social interaction. Implications and future directions are discussed. © 2015 Damholdt, Nørskov, Yamazaki, Hakli, Vesterager Hansen, Vestergaard and Seibt.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949659685,0,1,maybe,

As these kind of social-oriented technologies are by no way mandatory for maintaining an independent living at home, in order to ensure that they are accepted, adopted and actually used by elderly people, three complementary and intertwined issues are at stake: usability, usefulness and acceptability. In this paper, we describe how these three issues have been examined through the user-centred and mixed methodological approach that was adopted. We demonstrate that using both user tests in controlled lab environment and field trials at participants' homes has succeeded in producing relevant insights at each stage of the design process.

Additionally, older PLH are facing particular challenges related to accessing health care. The objective of this study is to investigate the older PLH's access to care and its relationship to emotional and tangible social support. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 225 PLH who were 50 years of age or older in Anhui, China. A computer-assisted personal interview was used to collect the participants' demographic characteristics, perceived health status, and access to care. The following two dimensions of social support were measured: emotional support and tangible support. The association between emotional/tangible support and access to care was calculated using Pearson's/point-biserial correlations and with multiple linear regression. Results Higher tangible support was reported by the participants who were married or living with a partner, those who had higher annual income levels, and those with better perceived health status. Emotional support was correlated with higher education, higher income, and better perceived health status. Multiple regression analyses showed that access to care was significantly associated with emotional support (β = 0.2807, p < 0.0001) but not with tangible support (β = -0.0183, p = 0.7922). Conclusions The study findings point to the importance of providing emotional support for older PLH. It is suggested that emotional support should be provided for older PLH in addition to tangible assistance, in order to engage them in treatment and care. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Drawing on qualitative data from 20 semi-structured interviews with older people in the South of England, three key themes are discussed: (i) types of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) used in later life; (ii) motivations and barriers to using ICT in later life; and (iii) older people's perspectives on virtual mobility. Participants had differing experiences in terms of accessing and using ICT. Half of the participants regularly used ICT, whilst the remaining participants had either tried and did not get on with, or had never used ICT. Motivations for using ICT were cited as: keeping in touch with family and friends, particularly those at a distance; a fascination for technology; a source for information; and receiving such technology as a gift. Whilst barriers to using ICT were identified as: lack of desire; affordability; and a lack of knowledge, skills and confidence. Participants reflected on how they currently substitute or supplement physical with virtual journeys, and saw particular benefit in being mobile through virtual methods if they were to become permanently immobile in the future. The most common ways that the participants were virtually mobile was through their use of emails, online shopping, and video telephone calls. This paper suggests virtual mobility is a timely alternative to physical mobility that could help older people to remain independent and living in their own homes for longer. Therefore, the economic and social benefits, alongside the drawbacks of supplementing or substituting physical with virtual mobility must be considered in policies that support older people, and improve their well-being and social inclusion, both now and in the future.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945967695,0,1,0,

Data used are from a cross-sectional survey adapted from World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) conducted in 2009/10 in rural South Africa. Bivariate statistics and multivariate logistical regression were used to assess the relationship between care-giving and/or care-receiving with functional disability, quality of life or emotional wellbeing, and self-rated health status, adjusted for socio-demographic factors. Sixty-three per cent of 422 older people were care-givers to at least one young adult or child; 27 per cent of older people were care-givers due to HIV-related reasons in young adults; 84 per cent of participants were care-recipients mainly from adult children, grandchildren and spouse. In logistic regressions adjusting for sex, age, marital status, education, receipt of grants, household headship, household wealth and HIV status, care-giving was statistically significantly associated with good functional ability as measured by ability to perform activities of daily living. This relationship was stronger for older people providing care-giving to adults than to children. In contrast, care-givers were less likely to report good emotional wellbeing; again the relationship was stronger for care-givers to adults than children. Simultaneous care-giving and -receiving was likewise associated with good functional ability, but about a 47 per cent lower chance of good emotional wellbeing. Participants who were HIV-infected were more likely to be in better health but less likely to be receiving care than those who were HIV-affected. Our findings suggest a strong relationship between care-giving and poor emotional wellbeing via an economic or psychological stressor pathway. Interventions that improve older people's socio-economic circumstances and reduce financial hardship as well as those that provide social support would go some way towards mitigating this relationship.

Methods Follow-up survey data were collected from midlife employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland, at three time points: wave 1 (2000–2002), wave 2 (2007), and wave 3 (2012). Changes in physical and psychosocial working conditions were assessed between waves 1 and 2. Physical health functioning was measured by the physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form 36 questionnaire at each of the three waves. In total, 2784 respondents (83% women) who remained employed over the follow-up were available for the analyses. Linear mixed-effect models were used to assess the associations and adjust for key covariates (age, gender, obesity, chronic diseases, and health behaviors). Results Repeated and increased exposure to adverse physical working conditions was associated with greater decline in physical health functioning over time. In contrast, decrease in exposures reduced the decline. Of the psychosocial working conditions, changes in job demands had no effects on physical health functioning. However, decreased job control was associated with greater decline and repeated high or increased job control reduced the decline in physical health functioning over time. Conclusions Adverse changes in physical working conditions and job control were associated with greater decline in physical health functioning over time, whereas favorable changes in these exposures reduced the decline. Preventing deterioration and promoting improvement of working conditions are likely to help maintain better physical health functioning among ageing employees. © 2015, Nordic Association of Occupational Safety and Health.

Methods Data were collected using a web-based survey that included previously developed and validated measures (i.e. SF-12, Dizziness Handicap Inventory, Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly Screening Version, Iowa Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire, Interpersonal Support Evaluation List, Brief COPES, Lehman's Quality of Life). Ninety-five individuals with Ménierè's disease who were members of one of five online Ménierè's disease support groups responded to the survey. Results The findings indicated that symptom severity was negatively associated with patients' quality of life, social supports were positively associated with quality of life, and the use of negative coping styles (e.g. substance use, blaming) was negatively associated with quality of life. Four predictors (i.e. SF-12 mental health, dizziness severity, self-esteem support, and negative coping styles) accounted for 62% of the variance in quality of life. Discussion The findings suggest that the factors associated with the quality of life of patients with Ménierè's disease are similar to those reported in the literature among patients with other chronic illnesses. The results also suggested that emphasis on psychosocial factors may be an important aspect of a comprehensive treatment intervention for individuals with Ménierè's disease. © SAGE Publications.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946549931,1,0,0,

The contact with the external and the ones caring about oneself is essential for the elderly. This study aims to develop application with the functions of healthcare and accompanying, and the accessibility design is included in the interface, where virtual pets are the major communication media to assist the elderly in using mobile application. The required functions and contents in mobile application as well as the preference for the interface and models of interaction for the elderly are investigated in this study. It aims to ease and convince the elderly of the easy use. In the process of cultivating and training the virtual pet mobile application, the elderly could be accompanied and reduced the sense of loneliness; in the further use and interaction with virtual pet mobile application, the physical and metal conditions of the elderly could be real-time monitored and recorded to assist monitoring stations in managing the physical conditions of the elderly and nursing personnel in periodical checks. This research is preceded as following. First, literatures are reviewed. Second, Focus Group Interview is utilized for concluding the application contents and functions and the requirements and preference of the elderly for virtual pets. Third, an application experimental prototype is designed according to such requirements and preference. Fourth, the questionnaire, aiming to test the usability of the elderly, is filled. Fifth, the principles and suggestions for mobile application design suitable for the elderly are concluded based on the test results and analyses. The research outcome would assist in and contribute to the accessibility design of mobile application and the application to medical care by providing possible solutions for insufficient caring manpower in ageing societies and uneven distribution of medical resources. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949745192,0,maybe,0,not clear if OA are involved or will be involved

Exercise programs can effectively reduce fall risk in older people. The iStoppFalls project developed an Information and Communication Technology-based system to deliver an unsupervised exercise program in older people’s homes. The primary aims of the iStoppFalls randomized controlled trial were to assess the feasibility (exercise adherence, acceptability and safety) of the intervention program and its effectiveness on common fall risk factors. Methods: A total of 153 community-dwelling people aged 65+ years took part in this international, multicentre, randomized controlled trial. Intervention group participants conducted the exercise program for 16 weeks, with a recommended duration of 120 min/week for balance exergames and 60 min/week for strength exercises. All intervention and control participants received educational material including advice on a healthy lifestyle and fall prevention. Assessments included physical and cognitive tests, and questionnaires for health, fear of falling, number of falls, quality of life and psychosocial outcomes. Results: The median total exercise duration was 11.7 h (IQR = 22.0) over the 16-week intervention period. There were no adverse events. Physiological fall risk (Physiological Profile Assessment, PPA) reduced significantly more in the intervention group compared to the control group (F1,127 = 4.54, p = 0.035). There was a significant three-way interaction for fall risk assessed by the PPA between the high-adherence (&gt;90 min/week; n = 18, 25.4 %), low-adherence (&lt;90 min/week; n = 53, 74.6 %) and control group (F2,125 = 3.12, n = 75, p = 0.044). Post hoc analysis revealed a significantly larger effect in favour of the high-adherence group compared to the control group for fall risk (p = 0.031), postural sway (p = 0.046), stepping reaction time (p = 0.041), executive functioning (p = 0.044), and quality of life (p for trend = 0.052). Conclusions: The iStoppFalls exercise program reduced physiological fall risk in the study sample. Additional subgroup analyses revealed that intervention participants with better adherence also improved in postural sway, stepping reaction, and executive function.

Objective: Analize the occurrence of trauma and demographic characteristics of elderly people attended by a mobile emergency service. Method: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the city of Sousa, in northeast region of Brazil, using data from 190 records of elderly victims of trauma attended by the MES from January 1St to December 31St of 2011. The Pearson's chi-square test (χ2) or Fisher's exact test with Freeman-Halton extension, were used to observe possible associations between variables. A significance level of α<5% was considered. Results: From the total of 190 elderly, 51.1% were male, aged between 60 and 104 years, mean age of 75.3 years (SD 10.44 years) and median of 74.0 years. Regarding the occurrence of trauma, 91.6% occurred in urban areas, 35.8% in the morning, 46.3% at weekend and 42.1% in the months from May to August. Falls stood out with 65.3% of cases and 87.9% had no alcohol on their breath during first-aid care. Among the injuries, wounds were predominant (62.3%) and 87.4% were referred to hospital. A significant association was observed between the presence of alcohol on the breath and sex (p<0.001) and age group (p=0.004) and between trauma mechanism and sex (p<0.001). Higher susceptibility was observed among males in the most advanced age group. Among the types of trauma, falls occurred mainly among women and traffic accidents among men. The presence of alcohol on the breath was verified especially among men and the majority of them were referred to hospitals. Conclusion: Knowledge of the characteristics of the demographics and occurrences of trauma in elderly people is necessary for the early identification of those individuals more exposed to this risk. Thus, it is considered that this research was relevant to characterize the elderly people requiring first-aid assistance and the occurrences of trauma, furthermore it is hoped that educational measures should be implemented in the community in order to prevent such traumas. © Under License of Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929577355,1,1,0,

This study aimed to explore the global functioning of COPD patients with and without functional balance impairment. Functional balance was assessed with the Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test and global functioning with the Comprehensive ICF Core Set for Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases. Participants (n = 134) were divided in 2 groups according to their performance in TUG (with and without balance impairment) and the ICF Core Set results were compared between groups. Fifty-four (40.3%) participants had functional balance impairment. The groups presented a similar extent of problems in several categories of the ICF components. However, participants with balance impairment were more severely affected (p < 0.05) in energy, pain, respiratory system, weight maintenance, exercise tolerance, neuromusculoskeletal and movement-related functions, and structure of head and neck. They also presented a significantly worse performance in handling psychological demands and activities related to mobility, self-care, domestic, community and social life, and a more negative perception of Environmental factors related to products and technology of buildings for private use and social support services (p < 0.05). Patients with functional balance impairment have more functional problems and are more severely restricted in daily life than patients without compromised balance. Understanding the relationship between balance control and global functioning will contribute to guide interventions aimed at maintaining functioning and minimizing disability. © 2015 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928953859,0,1,maybe,

Persistent hip pain in older people is usually due to hip osteoarthritis (OA), a major cause of pain, disability, and psychological dysfunction. Objective. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether adding an Internet-based pain coping skills training (PCST) protocol to a standardized intervention of education followed by physical therapist-instructed home exercise leads to greater reductions in pain and improvements in function. Design. An assessor-, therapist-, and participant-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted. Setting. The study will be conducted in a community setting. Participants. The participants will be 142 people over 50 years of age with self-reported hip pain consistent with hip OA. Intervention. Participants will be randomly allocated to: (1) a control group receiving a 24-week standardized intervention comprising an 8-week Internet-based education package followed by 5 individual physical therapy exercise sessions plus home exercises (3 times weekly) or (2) a PCST group receiving an 8-week Internet-based PCST protocol in addition to the control intervention. Measurements. Outcomes will be measured at baseline and 8, 24, and 52 weeks, with the primary time point at 24 weeks. Primary outcomes are hip pain on walking and self-reported physical function. Secondary outcomes include health-related quality-of-life, participant-perceived treatment response, self-efficacy for pain management and function, pain coping attempts, pain catastrophizing, and physical activity. Measurements of adherence, adverse events, use of health services, and process measures will be collected at 24 and 52 weeks. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed at 52 weeks. Limitations. A self-reported diagnosis of persistent hip pain will be used. Conclusions. The findings will help determine whether adding an Internet-based PCST protocol to standardized education and physical therapist-instructed home exercise is more effective than education and exercise alone for persistent hip pain.

Conventionally, this is done using various clinical assessment tools applied at the point of care and relies on patients' and caregivers' ability to accurately recall daily activity and trends in personal health. These practices suffer from the infrequency and generally short durations of visits. Since 2004, researchers at the Oregon Center for Aging and Technology (ORCATECH) at the Oregon Health and Science University have been working on developing technologies to transform this model. ORCATECH researchers have developed a system of continuous in-home monitoring using pervasive computing technologies that make it possible to more accurately track activities and behaviors and measure relevant intra-individual changes. We have installed a system of strategically placed sensors in over 480 homes and have been collecting data for up to 8 years. Using this continuous in-home monitoring system, ORCATECH researchers have collected data on multiple behaviors such as gait and mobility, sleep and activity patterns, medication adherence, and computer use. Patterns of intra-individual variation detected in each of these areas are used to predict outcomes such as low mood, loneliness, and cognitive function. These methods have the potential to improve the quality of patient health data and in turn patient care especially related to cognitive decline. Furthermore, the continuous real-world nature of the data may improve the efficiency and ecological validity of clinical intervention studies. © 2015 Lyons, Austin, Seelye, Petersen, Yeargers, Riley, Sharma, Mattek, Wild, Dodge and Kaye.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84936749129,0,0,0,

Cognitive, functional and psychosocial issues are likely to be more important than standard prognostic factors. To assess the role of these issues in the decision-making process regarding dialysis initiation in the elderly, a survey was conducted among nephrologists in the Netherlands. Methods: An internet-based survey was sent to all members of the Netherlands Federation of Nephrology. Results: Out of 298 invited, 94 Dutch nephrologists responded to the questionnaire. Reaching consensus with the patient and relatives and early withdrawal are difficult issues in the decision-making process in elderly end-stage renal disease patients. Geriatric impairments were considered (very) relevant issues (varying from 7-10 on a scale from 1-10) in the context of dialysis initiation, with cognitive dysfunction being most relevant (median 10, range 6-10). The majority of nephrologists (56%) underlined the need for screening for geriatric problems when considering dialysis in the elderly. A total of 26% reported using some form of screening measurement for the determination of the presence of one or more geriatric impairments. Conclusions: Although cognitive, functional and psychosocial issues are considered relevant items in the context of dialysis initiation in the elderly, systematic assessment of these items is not standard of care in nephrology practice. Future research is needed to determine whether a more systematic screening for the presence of geriatric impairments can improve the decision-making process. © Van Zuiden Communications B.V.

One challenge in these prevention trials is sample recruitment bias. Those willing to volunteer for these trials could be socially active, in relatively good health, and have high educational levels and cognitive function. These participants' characteristics could reduce the generalizability of study results and, more importantly, mask trial effects. We developed a randomized controlled trial to examine whether conversation-based cognitive stimulation delivered through personal computers, a webcam and the internet would have a positive effect on cognitive function among older adults with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment. To examine the selectivity of samples, we conducted a mass mail-in survey distribution among community-dwelling older adults, assessing factors associated with a willingness to participate in the trial. Methods: Two thousand mail-in surveys were distributed to retirement communities in order to collect data on demographics, the nature and frequency of social activities, personal computer use and additional health-related variables, and interest in the prevention study. We also asked for their contact information if they were interested in being contacted as potential participants in the trial. Results: Of 1,102 surveys returned (55.1% response rate), 983 surveys had complete data for all the variables of interest. Among them, 309 showed interest in the study and provided their contact information (operationally defined as the committed with interest group), 74 provided contact information without interest in the study (committed without interest group), 66 showed interest, but provided no contact information (interest only group), and 534 showed no interest and provided no contact information (no interest group). Compared with the no interest group, the committed with interest group were more likely to be personal computer users (odds ratio (OR)=2.78), physically active (OR=1.03) and had higher levels of loneliness (OR=1.16). Conclusion: Increasing potential participants' familiarity with a personal computer and the internet before trial recruitment could increase participation rates and improve the generalizability of future studies of this type. © 2014 Dodge et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925130006,1,maybe,0,

Method We used self-report data from six waves of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women s Health over 14 years. A total of 12,338 women participating in the mid-age cohort (ageing from 45-50 to 59-64) provided self-report indications of DE at Surveys 1 and 2, and QoL (SF-36 component scales - mental [MCS] and physical [PCS]) at Surveys 2-6. Results DE was reported by 10.25% of the women who also reported significantly poorer mental and physical QoL than those without DE; this effect was sustained over 12 years. Effect size differences for the midlife and younger women, between those with and without DE, showed a larger impact on physical QoL over time for the mid-age women. Midlife women with high levels of depressive symptoms (with and without DE) had the lowest initial mental QoL scores. Midlife women with high depression and DE had the greatest increase in mental QoL over time, but their mean score was still considerably lower than all other groups. Conclusions This study underscores the significant effect of midlife DE on QoL, particularly when comorbid with depression, suggesting specific support options are needed for mid-age women. © 2014 Fairweather-Schmidt et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85006189361,1,0,0,

The aim of this research study is to investigate the factors affecting the likelihood of adoption and use of OSN within an older population. Using an online questionnaire, empirical data was drawn from Hertfordshire, a vicinity in the United Kingdom, and analysed using the Partial Least Squares method. The findings revealed that - in a household situation - older individuals adopt internet technologies if they have 'anytime access' to internet capable devices, a fast reliable internet connection, the support of their family and friends, as well as an apparent provision of privacy. For organizations, these findings indicate that the provision of a technical/trusted support department is essential, as is the provision for broadband and reliable internet connections.

Design/methodology/approach – An online survey was developed, pre-tested and validated, and sent to the regional associations of nurses in Spain for distribution to their members. Data collection involved a cross-sectional design. A total of 2,094 valid questionnaires were completed online. The majority of responding nurses were located in Catalunya and Gipuzkoa. Respondents were given 15 reasons and asked to indicate the extent to which each played a role in their decision to work part-time. Job context and job content scales bearing multi items reliable measures were also employed. All scales met the criteria of reliability. Findings – Nurses working full-time included more males, were older, had longer nursing experience (both job and unit tenure), reported higher levels of both job resources (autonomy, self-development opportunities), higher levels of positive work attitudes (job involvement, affective commitment, work engagement), more medication use, and a higher intention to quit. Full-time and part-time nursing staff were similar on marital status, levels of social support (supervisor, co-worker, spouse, and family), self-reported absenteeism, levels of burnout, levels of psychological well-being (psychosomatic symptoms, self-reported health), and potential accident propensity. Some of the more concrete results include: first, reasons for working part-time were varied with some being voluntary (going to school) and others involuntary (poor health). Second, different clusters of individuals likely exist (e.g. students, caretakers, transitioning to retirement or other career options). Third, part-time nursing staff tended to report a more negative workplace (less autonomy, fewer opportunities for self-development) and less favorable work attitudes (less engagement, job involvement, and affective commitment) than their full-time counterparts. Research limitations/implications – First, all data were collected using self-report questionnaires, raising the possibility of response set tendencies. Second, all data were collected at one point in time, making it difficult to determine cause-effect relationships. Third, although the sample was very large, it was not possible to determine its representativeness or a response rate given the data collection procedure employed. Fourth, the large sample size resulted in relatively small mean differences reaching levels of statistical significance. Fifth, many of the nurse and work/organizational outcomes were themselves significantly correlated inflating the number of statistically significant relationships reported. Finally, it is not clear to what extent the findings apply to Spain only. Practical implications – Health care organizations interested in encouraging and supporting part-time nursing staff to consider working full-time may have some sources of leverage. Part-time nursing staff indicated generally lower levels of commitment involvement and engagement compared to their full-time colleagues. Part-time nursing staff in this study reported lower levels of job resources, such as autonomy and self-development opportunities. Increasing nursing staff input into decision making, increasing levels of nursing staff empowerment, increasing supervisory development that in supporting and respecting the nursing staff contributions, reducing levels of workplace incivility, and improving nursing work team functioning would make the work experiences of part-time nursing staff more meaningful and satisfying. In addition, offering more flexible work schedules and tackling the stereotype associated with working only part-time would also address factors associated with working part-time. A more long-term strategy would involve enhancing both the psychological and physical health of nursing staff through the introduction of a corporate wellness initiative. Increasing the work ability of nursing staff by improving their psychological and physical well-being addresses a common factor in the part-time work decision. Social implications – There is a call in the paper for Spanish authorities to consider implementing the “Magnet hospital program” which is one model that has been shown to improve nurse and patient outcomes and is one solution to the shortage of hospital nurses in attracting them to work on a full-time basis. The process of Magnet recognition involves implementing 14 evidence-based standards. Originality/value – Experts claim that the part-time phenomenon is a growing trend and is there to stay. The authors still do not know sufficiently about the HR implications for having a large workforce of part-time employees. In this paper, a tentative attempt was made to better understand this phenomenon, especially when there is a shortage of qualified nurses in the health sector. Several promising research directions follow from this investigation. First, nurses working part-time need to be polled to identify factors that would encourage and support them should they desire to change to full-time work. Second, the authors learn more about the relatively low levels of involvement, commitment, and engagement of part-time nurses, a phenomenon that most organizations wish to minimize. © 2014, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958530138,1,0,0,

The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a frequently employed and previously validated measure of shoulder pain and disability. Although the SPADI has high reliability and construct validity, greater differences between individual patients are often observed than would be expected on the basis of diagnosis and pathophysiology alone. This study aims to determine how psychological factors (namely depression, catastrophic thinking, and self-efficacy) affect pain and perceived disability in the shoulder. Methods: A cohort of 139 patients completed a sociodemographic survey and elements from the SPADI, Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ), Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), and Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-2). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine the association of psychosocial factors, demographic characteristics, and specific diagnosis with shoulder pain and disability. Results: The SPADI score showed medium correlation with the PCS (r = 0.43; p < 0.001), PHQ-2 (r = 0.39; p < 0.001), and PSEQ (r = 20.45; p < 0.001). Current work status (F = 4.35; p = 0.006) and body mass index (r = 0.27; p = 0.002) were also associated with the SPADI score. In the multivariate analysis, greater catastrophic thinking (estimate, 0.003; p = 0.029), lower self-efficacy (estimate, 20.005; p = 0.001), higher body mass index (estimate, 0.006; p = 0.048), and being disabled (estimate, 0.15; p = 0.017) or retired (estimate, 0.16; p < 0.001) compared with being employed were associated with worse SPADI scores. The primary diagnosis did not have a significant relationship (p > 0.05) with the SPADI. Conclusions: Catastrophic thinking and decreased self-efficacy are associated with greater shoulder pain and disability. Our data support the notion that patient-To-patient variation in symptom intensity and magnitude of disability is more strongly related to psychological distress than to the specific shoulder diagnosis.

Identifying and assisting lonely individuals is therefore increasingly important - especially in the home setting - as the very nature of loneliness often makes it difficult to detect by traditional methods. One critical component in assessing loneliness unobtrusively is to measure time spent out-of-home, as loneliness often presents with decreased physical activity, decreased motor functioning, and a decline in activities of daily living, all of which may cause decrease in the amount of time spent outside the home. Using passive and unobtrusive in-home sensing technologies, we have developed a methodology for detecting time spent out-of-home based on logistic regression. Our approach was both sensitive (0.939) and specific (0.975) in detecting time out-of-home across over 41 000 epochs of data collected from four subjects monitored for at least 30 days each in their own homes. In addition to linking time spent out-of-home to loneliness, (r = -0.44, p = 0.011) as measured by the UCLA Loneliness Index, we demonstrate its usefulness in other applications such as uncovering general behavioral patterns of elderly and exploring the link between time spent out-of-home and physical activity (r = 0.415, p = 0.031), as measured by the Berkman Social Disengagement Index. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921673606,0,maybe,1,

In this frame, media and communication technologies seem to be more and more relevant for the elderly, thanks to those services and devices helping people to grow old actively. Technologies, the Internet and ICTs could help the elderly to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. Our ongoing research investigates the relationship between the elderly and use of technologies, and explores the role played by media and ICTs in building a friendly and positive environment for the elderly, and in constructing and maintaining social relations and promoting healthy ageing. Specifically, the research will investigate the use of ICTs by the elderly by taking into account two different perspectives: a) Exchanges between generations: lengthening of life corresponds to a longer period of cohabitation between at least three generations (grandparents, children, grandchildren), and also of co-use of digital media. The research wants to investigate relations between two age groups (grandparents and grandchildren; young people and older people) to understand the dynamics of intergenerational mutuality in the use of technologies and ICTs. b) Media, ICTs, Health: the Western world is increasingly populated by elderly population. Technologies and ICTs can help elderly people to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. ICTs should encourage active ageing and, in the case of health technologies, new models of care.

Within the current international European Commission's Seventh Framework Program (FP7) project 'iStoppFalls' an Information and Communication Technology (ICT) based system has been developed to regularly assess a person's risk of falling in their own home and to deliver an individual and tailored home-based exercise and education program for fall prevention. The primary aims of iStoppFalls are to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention program, and its effectiveness to improve balance, muscle strength and quality of life in older people. Methods/Design. This international, multicenter study is designed as a single-blinded, two-group randomized controlled trial. A total of 160 community-dwelling older people aged 65 years and older will be recruited in Germany (n = 60), Spain (n = 40), and Australia (n = 60) between November 2013 and May 2014. Participants in the intervention group will conduct a 16-week exercise program using the iStoppFalls system through their television set at home. Participants are encouraged to exercise for a total duration of 180 minutes per week. The training program consists of a variety of balance and strength exercises in the form of video games using exergame technology. Educational material about a healthy lifestyle will be provided to each participant. Final reassessments will be conducted after 16 weeks. The assessments include physical and cognitive tests as well as questionnaires assessing health, fear of falling, quality of life and psychosocial determinants. Falls will be followed up for six months by monthly falls calendars. Discussion. We hypothesize that the regular use of this newly developed ICT-based system for fall prevention at home is feasible for older people. By using the iStoppFalls sensor-based exercise program, older people are expected to improve in balance and strength outcomes. In addition, the exercise training may have a positive impact on quality of life by reducing the risk of falls. Taken together with expected cognitive improvements, the individual approach of the iStoppFalls program may provide an effective model for fall prevention in older people who prefer to exercise at home.

This was developed over the years as a network of citizens, associations, institutions, and professionals, providing a relational and support ecosystem to frail elderly people. The issue of financial sustainability of the health and social welfare system, in the phase of ongoing demographic revolution, has stimulated the creation of a service that aims to encourage the permanence of frail elderly citizens at home to prevent the onset of frailty or dependency and to improve their quality of life by fighting social isolation through the use of appropriate IT technologies. Community-based voluntary associations also play a key role in the eCare Network for the frail elderly. Starting for an evolving and always more challenging concept of frailty, the chapter describes the reality of the socio-geographical context of Bologna and the Emilia- Romagna region, together with the public as well as private organizational possibilities for intervention, which gave birth to the first experimentation of the eCare service. The chapter describes the gradual specialization and refinement of the service, and the parallel instruments used for better identification and take into charge all the aspects of frailty among the senior population. In the course of the chapter, a constant attention is paid to the necessary, and yet sometimes controversial, relationship between human help and technological aid. Finally, in addition to a detailed description of the activities that have been put in place, the service outcomes, innovations, and prospects for further development are illustrated. © 2014 by IGI Global.

Design: Cross-sectional questionnaire survey. Settings: Undergraduate classes at a large state university and senior-oriented computer classes at public libraries and senior centers. Subjects: 438 respondents, including 226 undergraduates (mean age 20) and 212 community-dwelling older adults (mean age 72). Methods: Respondents were administered the Health Information Wants Questionnaire (HIWQ), a 21-item instrument designed to measure preferences for 7 types of health information and decision-making, in group settings. Main Results: The younger age group spent significantly more time online compared to the older age group. Frequent Internet users in both populations expressed an overall preference for more information regarding diagnosis, but less information for psychosocial and health care provider concerns. Internet use was positively correlated to the overall preference rating, leading the researchers to suggest that, as a whole, regular Internet users prefer more information and independence in decision-making. Conclusions: The study concludes that Internet use frequency is associated with an overall preference for obtaining health information and participating in decision making. Internet use as related to different types of preferences is inconsistent. Age was not found to be associated with the overall preference rating, and time spent online is proposed to be a stronger indicator of respondents' health information preferences.

However, very little research has been carried out on the role of age in acute stress effects on memory. We aimed to explore the role of age and sex in the relationship between hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA-axis) and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) reactivity to psychosocial stress and short-term declarative memory performance. To do so, sixty-seven participants divided into two age groups (each group with a similar number of men and women) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and a control condition in a crossover design. Memory performance was assessed by the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). As expected, worse memory performance was associated with age but more interestingly, the stressor impaired recall after interference only in the older group. In addition, this effect was negatively correlated with the alpha-amylase over cortisol ratio, which has recently been suggested as a good marker of stress system dysregulation. However, we failed to find sex differences in memory performance. These results show that age moderates stress-induced effects on declarative memory, and they point out the importance of studying both of the physiological systems involved in the stress response together. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896841660,0,0,0,

Caring for an elderly relative with dementia may be burdensome and stressful, and can negatively affect the carer's social, family, and professional life. The combination of loss, the physical demands of caregiving, prolonged distress, and biological vulnerabilities of older carers may compromise their physical health, increase social isolation, and increase the risk of anxiety and depressive disorders. Caregiver stress is also linked to negative outcomes for the recipient of care and costs to society, including increased nursing home and hospital admissions. Consequently, carer support interventions are an important component of dementia care. Computer-mediated carer support offers a range of potential advantages compared to traditional face-to-face support groups, including accessibility and the possibility of tailoring to meet individual needs, but there has been little research on its effectiveness so far. Objective: This mixed-methods study examined the impact of a well-respected UK-based online support forum for carers of people with dementia. Methods: A total of 61 new forum users completed measures of anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale, GAD-7), depression (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), and quality of relationship with the person with dementia (Scale for the Quality of the Current Relationship in Caregiving, SQCRC), at baseline and again after 12 weeks of forum usage, within a pre-post design. In addition, 8 participants were interviewed about their experiences with using the forum. Results: There was an improvement in the quality of the relationship with the person with dementia (SQCRC: P=.003). There was no change in users' depression (PHQ-9) or anxiety (GAD-7) over the 12-week study period. Interview participants reported a range of positive experiences and benefits from using the forum. Limited negative experiences were also reported. Conclusions: Many of the reported experiences and benefits are unique to online peer support.

The whole system comprises wandering path tracking and fall detection, safety-zone monitoring, communication services, alert notifications, and emergency medical services. To effectively track the elderly, the PTFaD uses a smartphone camera to take real-time pictures along the user's path as he or she moves about. Those photos, along with time and GPS signals, are delivered to and stored on the Cloud system. When there is a need, family caregivers can download those data to quickly find a way to help the elderly individual. Additionally, this study uses tri-axial accelerometers to examine falls. When a fall incident is detected, the alarm system issues notification messages to all emergency contact person in sequence until one responds to the system. If no one responds within a pre-determined time period, then the system immediately calls emergency medical services to procure timely help for that elderly individual. To assure individuals' data is safeguarded appropriately, an RSA method has been adopted by the system to encrypt stored data. The purpose is to guarantee that personal privacy is well protected. Any attempt at unauthorized access to the smartphone or Cloud will not succeed. Our reliable and minimally intrusive system provides people with dementia with an opportunity to maintain their social networks and to improve their quality of lives. © 2014 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946691361,0,0,0,

The purpose of this study is to examine the association between Internet use among retired older adults in the United States and changes in a commonly used predictor of depression (the CES-D). Method. Analyzing data from four waves (2002-2008) of the Health and Retirement Survey, we assess whether an available and commonly used index of a depression state was affected by prior values of the index and Internet use. The sample includes 3,075 respondents observed over 4 waves of data, yielding a total of 12,300 observations. We analyzed the effect on depression of Internet use and past depression in a full sample and a matched sample. We also conducted informal tests for confounders. Finally, we tested a basic mediation model to determine whether Internet use affected depression through its relationship with loneliness and social isolation. Results. Across methods, we found a positive contribution of Internet use to mental well-being of retired older adults in the United States, where Internet use reduced the probability of a depression state by one third. We found no evidence of confounding. Some evidence of mediation was found. Discussion. Our dynamic probit model indicates that for retired older adults in the United States, Internet use was found to reduce the probability of a depressed state by about 33%. Number of people in the household partially mediates this relationship, with the reduction in depression largest for people living alone. This provides some evidence that the mechanism linking Internet use to depression is the remediation of social isolation and loneliness.

However, due to financial constraints and limited technology literacy, older adults often lack the access needed to tap into the benefits of this type of communication technology. To reduce isolation and open their world to new experiences, Singtel, a local telecommunication company, has initiated a project called Silverline. It calls for the donation of used iPhones and chargers for use by needy older adults. Our on-going study seeks to explore to what extent and in what ways smartphones influence the quality of life of older adults, as well as unique and/or significant factors in their appropriation and reinvention of smartphones. Method: In 2013, twenty-seven used iPhones were collected and donated to older adults living alone. We conducted semi-structured interviews with nine recipients (six males, three females, between the ages of 63 to 82 years old) (Figure 1). The interview questionnaire was divided into two sections: Section A solicited data on the respondent's profile such as gender, age, race, as well as life satisfaction and ability to care for one's self; Section B used a modified version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)1,2, that included questions used to assess the older adult's perceptions of smartphone usefulness, ease of use, internal and external controls, willingness to use, as well as intention for future use. Whilst the questionnaire was made up of structured questions, they were also accompanied by open-ended questions that were later extracted and coded to ensure that responses were not confined within the limits of existing theoretical frameworks. The interviews ranged between one to two hours, were conducted in their preferred language and were audio-recorded. Results & Discussion: In spite of living alone, all our interviewees demonstrated an ability to live independently and expressed moderate to high satisfaction towards their current life. Generally, they had a positive attitude toward smartphones. They found them to especially useful and entertaining, to the extent that some expressed they were not willing to have the iPhone taken away from them. Aside from making phone calls to their family and friends, iPhones were most commonly used to take pictures and play games - the main reason for this was the iPhones' ability to help the elderly overcome loneliness and boredom. Only one older adult was active on a social networking site (Facebook) to keep in touch with his family members overseas. Findings were gathered with regard to the problems encountered by older adults due to declined physical, cognitive and perceptual abilities. They had a difficult time quickly finding certain applications or necessary information (e.g. SMS, contacts) on the phone, the ability to update/download new apps from the online store, or to use the phone to take clear pictures. Nevertheless, those problems were easily overcome by persistence or seeking help from others (e.g. family, friends). For older adults, the social context of use is thus argued to be one of the most significant factors driving the adoption and appropriation of smartphones. Some interviewees viewed the smartphone as a status symbol, since they perceived that those with smartphones are younger and have higher incomes. Unsurprisingly, cost is a major hurdle for their adoption of smartphones.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929417715,1,1,0,

Although useful vital sign monitoring equipment and information communication technologies are readily available, many researchers and businesses are still attempting to expand coverage, and expectations for widespread adoption of home telehealth services have not been realized in Taiwan. Lack of user motivation is the key. This research suggests a paradigm shift in home telehealth systems from provision of telehealth care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation. Method: The core of the system is a tablet on which the CDF (Core Delivery Frame) App is installed (Figure 1). Vital sign measurement data from various devices, are transmitted via Bluetooth to the tablet. Under the SSL and HTTPS data transmission security of Facebook, data are encrypted and then posted to the elderly adult's Facebook timeline by using the one touch data-upload button on the CDF App interface. Facebook also becomes the 'user interface' of CDF for younger persons and family members who are 'Facebook friends' of the elderly adult. Under Facebook privacy settings, children and family members can browse the elderly adult's vital sign measurement data and also post caring messages, photos, and videos using the regular Facebook App. The elderly adult is able to read these messages from Facebook displayed in the simplified user interface of the CDF App on the tablet. The professional caregiver, who is a 'Facebook friend' of the elderly adult, is allowed to use the 'Comm & Care' App installed on a smartphone to retrieve vital sign data stored in Facebook. The 'Comm & Care' App provides standard home telehealth functions, such as multiple user management, graphical display, data analysis and export, event alert, etc. In addition, data can be permanently deleted from the Facebook server, as indicated in an official announcement from Facebook. A total of ten elderly adults, age 55-79, who are not living with their children, participated in a user evaluation of CDF. Only one participant had experience with computers. Nine participants suffer hypertension and diabetes. The other has diabetes but not hypertension. The average number of interactions for the participants through CDF were collected for more than five months. This research used Qualitative Content Analysis (QCA) to obtain complete and straightforward user feedback. Results & Discussion: During the evaluation period, each participant had 1.79 to 3.50 CDF interactions per day in Facebook. CDF was well received by the elderly participants and their children as indicated by the increased motivation due to the inclusion of the elderly into social networking. Implementing telehealth functions in CDF consists of installing Apps only. Cost is minimal. CDF delivered tracking vital signs, providing health-care, and forming a small 'family social network'.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929402154,1,1,maybe,

Financial incentives and peer networks could be delivered through eHealth technologies to encourage older adults to walk more. Methods. We conducted a 24-week randomized trial in which 92 older adults with a computer and Internet access received a pedometer, daily walking goals, and weekly feedback on goal achievement. Participants were randomized to weekly feedback only (Comparison), entry into a lottery with potential to earn up to $200 each week walking goals were met (Financial Incentive), linkage to four other participants through an online message board (Peer Network), or both interventions (Combined). Main outcomes were the proportion of days walking goals were met during the 16-week intervention and 8-week follow-up.

A recent study demonstrated that middle-aged and older adults with HIV also improved on a measure of speed of processing and a measure of everyday functioning after such training. The primary objective was to examine what predicts the speed of processing training gains observed in the previous study. Participants were administered an extensive battery of demographic, psychosocial, and neuropsychological measures at baseline. They were randomized either to the speed of processing training group (n = 22) or to a no-contact control group (n = 24). Participants received approximately 10 hours of computerized speed of processing training. Predictors of training gains on the Useful Field of View (UFOV) Test and the Timed Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (TIADL) Test were examined through correlational analyses. In general, those who performed worse on the UFOV and TIADL at baseline demonstrated significantly more training gains. Also, higher HIV viral load, poorer medication adherence, a higher number of years diagnosed with HIV, and lower baseline scores on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (an executive functioning measure) were correlated with better TIADL training gains. TIADL performance improved in those with higher HIV viral load, poorer medication adherence, and poor executive functioning.

The main aim of the AGNES project was to investigate the potential of new Information and Communication Technology (ICT) environments to help maintain the independence and wellbeing of elders. The innovative applications developed in this research project could have wide application for a large number of older adults living alone. Method: We used a web-based social network platform, enhanced with devices to detect users' states and collect activity data. The effectiveness of the ICT-based solution was assessed throughout the project with user and control groups in Spain, Sweden and Greece. User interviews and psychological testing were conducted at the beginning of the project and after a year of deployment of the equipment. Both groups completed the same assessment protocol. Results & discussion: We found that only the user group showed an improvement from pretest to posttest in the affective dimension of the wellbeing SPF-IL scale. This dimension relates to the degree of confidence, social acceptance, and level of satisfaction with the people around them. Exploring new ways to maintain the cognitive and functional state of older users is today a critical issue, for individuals, their families, and for whole societies. The study suggests the potential of AGNES to improve older adults' perceived wellbeing. However, more research may be needed to determine if AGNES is a tool to maintain mental health and independent living in older adults, especially those with MCI.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904397069,1,1,1,

Technology holds promise in terms of providing support to older people and enhancing their capacity to live independently. The objective of the PRISM trial is to gather rigorous evidence about the value of a technology application, the Personal Reminder Information and Social Management System (PRISM), which is designed for older adults to support social connectivity, memory, knowledge about topics, leisure activities, and access to resources. Method: The study design was a three-site randomized field trial. Following a baseline assessment, which included measures of demographics, health, prior technology experience, computer attitudes and proficiency, cognitive abilities, social support, and well-being, participants were randomly assigned to the PRISM condition or a Binder condition. Follow-up assessments occurred at 6 and 12 months post randomization. Participants also received a telephone interview at 18 months.

Telepresence Robots carry with them a set of technologies that provide a distinct advantage in helping older adults maintain social inclusion1. One challenging problem is how to include a robot in the homes of older adults and caregivers, while making it feel like a natural part of their daily life? This paper presents the development of WOBOT, which is a hybrid telepresence and companionship robot that offers interactive communication through video conferencing and tele-operated facial expressions, body motions, and built-in autonomous reactions. WOBOT is simple, non-humanoid robot that emphasizes 'fun' rather than 'functions', hoping to aid our elders in communication, leisure, and companionship. Method: WOBOT is our first design of a series of 'Caricature Robots', which are nonhumanoid robots that show humanoid motions in simplified or exaggerated ways. When stationary, WOBOT appears as a photo frame with two hands holding a tablet computer (Figure 1). With three degrees of freedom in motion, WOBOT's motion design is based on principles of cartoon character design2, used by animators to produce animated films. WOBOT brings some of the features of animated characters into real motions. Figure 2 shows the information structure of WOBOT. The remote user manipulates WOBOT through the user interface on a smart phone/tablet/PC to show cartoon-like facial expressions and body motions while video conferencing with the local user, the older adult staying with the robot in their home environment. By providing both verbal and nonverbal elements of interpersonal communication, the robot can better serve as the family members' or caregivers' avatar for expressing their care to the older adults at home. WOBOT is not only a communication gate, but also offers a set of autonomous reactions to interact with the older adults like a companion robot. WOBOT is in a ""Body and Brain"" system structure that enables it to be an open platform. New applications can be added by developing Apps on the tablet (brain), which transmits commands to the robotic platform through Bluetooth to perform requested motions. Result and Discussion: A lab-based evaluation, in which 16 older adults aged 52 to 80 interacted with a facilitator through WOBOT, showed positive results regarding seniors' acceptance of WOBOT. Older adults' levels of anxiety were low while interacting with WOBOT, based on their heart rate; also, the level of concentration while interacting with WOBOT was high, based on eye tracking records. With the aim of creating robots acceptable to seniors' for use in their homes, and following the Caricature Robot approach to expression and movement design, WOBOT Junior - a smaller version, to be controlled by a smart phone - is currently under development.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929417329,1,0,0,

The practical application of such systems are often found to be too complicated, too costly, and users, both older adults and professional caregivers, lack adequate motivation or experience to use the systems effectively. Methods: This paper describes a personal home telehealth system - Care Deliver Frame (CDF) - for older adults based on social networking, which transforms the home telehealth system into a platform for communication and care between older adults and their family members. The system is linked to existing social networking sites such as Facebook to encourage interpersonal communication between older adults and younger family members. The home telehealth system is implemented on personal mobile devices in the form of Apps. The scale and cost required for implementing the personal home telehealth system are greatly reduced. Results: From the pilot study of user evaluation, CDF was well accepted by the older participants and their children. Even though this evaluation is based upon a small sample size, it provides a good insight into participants ' behaviors, preferences, and expectations, which helps to determine the future development of CDF. Conclusion: CDF presented in this paper extends the value of a home telehealth system from the provision of health care to enhancing older adults' interpersonal communication and social participation.

We focus on social relationships, particularly intergenerational relationships between older parents and adult children, as a possible mediator in the association of cell phone use with late-life depressive symptoms. We therefore hypothesize that using cell phones contributes to the psychological well-being of older adults primarily through encouraging social relationships.Methods: We used 4 waves of data from the Nihon University Japanese Longitudinal Study of Aging (2001-2009) to analyze the impact of cell phone use on depressive symptoms. Results are based on ordinary least squares regression analyses.Results: Although the use of cell phones was related to lower levels of depressive symptoms among elderly Japanese people, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and physical health conditions wiped out the effects for men. In contrast, the protective effects of using cell phones persisted among women, even net of all controls. Moreover, the impact of using cell phones was not explained by filial relationship measures, suggesting that cell phone use influences the mental health of older women independently of social engagement.Conclusions: Among the many advantages brought about by recent technological developments, cell phones appear to be an important contributor to the psychological well-being of Japanese elders.

In recent years, ecotourism experiences and activities have become a favored outdoor activity by aging adults. People from 55 to 74 years of age are a relatively more active group in activities that encourage social relationships than has been true in the past1. Nevertheless, as the physical and mental abilities of older adults decline with age, they may have greater difficulty in using technologically advanced products. Thus, this study focused on understanding the use of technological products in ecotourism by an older adult group. The fundamental purposes of the study are: (i) to analyze the proportion of older adults using technological products in ecotourism; and (ii) to explore the aging group's demands for technological products during their ecotourism activities. Method: Based on the above goals, this study is divided into two stages. In the first stage, 46 elderly people were randomly chosen from Taiwan's intermediate elevation 'Sun Link Sea Resort' and eastern Taiwan's special ecological 'Taitung Forest Park' as well as 'Jhihben National Forest Recreation Area' to participate in a voluntary questionnaire and in-depth interviews, which focused on mobile devices and analyzed the classification of common mobile devices. The study attempted to determine which digital mobile products aging adults preferred. In the second stage, results of the first stage will be analyzed, and four elderly persons and two experts were invited for a return visit to participate as part of a focus group that will receive monetary compensation. Service design theory was used to organize the results. Results & Discussion: The first stage of research results showed how many of the 46 aging adults carried different mobile technological products with them during ecotourism are as follows: 25%, 7%, 29% and 3% carried only a smart phone, more traditional cell phone, a digital camera, or only a tablet PC, respectively; moreover, about 6% took both smart phones and digital cameras and 3% took both smart phones and tablet PCs. The second stage research results showed that the reason older adults used technological products during ecotourism included: (i) Recording: The aging group took photos either in the form of single person or in groups to record the current situation in order to recall emotions. (ii) Safety: Devices were needed to deal with emergencies such as getting lost; (iii) Knowledge: The aging group would like to know the name, age, habit and habitat, daily life and related everyday knowledge of various species of flora and fauna; (iv) Convenience: The technological products are multifunctional and convenient for the aging group to take; (v) Sharing: Older adults wanted to share the experiences of ecotourism in order to make stronger emotional connections to the current group and also to upload information on social networks and to use overseas SNS to share their experiences. The results of this study provide information related to the goals of older ecotourists and can guide the development and design of technological products in a way that enhances their usability for older adults and encourages them to engage in future ecotourism.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929406561,1,0,0,55+

The study utilizes the Computer-Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) method, in combination with a later-life planning questionnaire, to investigate adults (over 20 years old) across 25 counties and cities in Taiwan. The research design employed proportional stratified random sampling, and it received 1071 valid samples. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA, and logistic regression. Five findings stand out: First, later-life planning can be categorized into five domains: physical health, psychological adjustment, social relationships, financial management, and leisure life. Second, the subjects showed their recognition of the importance of later-life planning, especially with respect to physical health. Third, their preparations primarily took the form of following a balanced diet, maintaining a good mood, saving money, maintaining good relationships with family, and planning adequate leisure activities. Fourth, the results show intergenerational differences in recognition of the importance of later-life planning. Fifth, recognition of the importance of later-life planning effectively predicts one's practice of later-life preparation.

However, in the development of the PRISM trial (assessing whether a specialized computer system can improve the well-being of older adults at risk for isolation), we discovered that existing measures of computer proficiency are not suitable for people targeted by the PRISM trial who do not use computers. Measures were often designed for and validated with sample populations consisting of young adults or older adults who have ample computer experience. Existing measures also contained jargon, did not focus on computer activities predicted to be important for maintaining functional independence, and focused on experience rather than proficiency. As a result, we developed a new measure of proficiency and assessed its reliability and validity within our PRISM intervention sample and a sample of older adults who have computer experience. Subscale measures focused on measuring proficiency related to computer activities that are predicted to facilitate social support, communication, information access, prospective memory, and cognitive engagement. Here we present new data from the intervention, which further validate the Computer Proficiency Questionnaire (CPQ) measurements by demonstrating increased proficiency over time after PRISM computer training and exposure. Method: After pilot testing our new CPQ, we used baseline PRISM data (n=300) in addition to a sample of computer-proficient older adults (n=76) to demonstrate the reliability and validity of the CPQ1. We also measured CPQ scores over the course of a 12-month exposure to the PRISM computer system. Results & Discussion: We previously reported that the CPQ is a valid measure which correlates with both age and technology experience and, using discriminant analysis, can easily distinguish experienced and inexperienced computer users (>94% correct classification rate). The CPQ and each of its subscales were also found to be highly reliable (Cronbach's alpha=0.98, all CPQ subscales >0.86). To further demonstrate the validity of the CPQ, we examined changes in CPQ scores of older adults in the PRISM computer condition compared to participants in the non-computer control condition. After PRISM computer training and exposure, initial analyses indicated that PRISM participants demonstrated a significant increase in overall computer proficiency compared to the control condition as measured by the CPQ. Differential improvement in proficiency was also observed on each of the CPQ subscales. The ability of the CPQ to detect changes in proficiency as a function of training further establishes it as a valid measure, and significant changes in proficiency confirm the usefulness of the training developed for the PRISM computer system and the ease with which it can be mastered.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929412305,1,1,maybe,

To evaluate the differential effects, we had to ensure that both systems were usable by and useful for the target users (i.e., older adults at risk for social isolation). In addition, the instructions for use and the training had to be clear and effective. To that end, we employed a human factors approach to the development of the PRISM system. Human factors practitioners investigate the capabilities and limitations of people and the demands placed on them when they interact with a system. Method: Our approach was multifaceted: (i) needs assessment with target users - we conducted a survey of older adults with computer experience to determine how they used a computer and the internet; (ii) we interviewed older adults who lack computer experience to assess their needs and interest in PRISM; (iii) we identified a prototype system to use as the starting point for PRISM and conducted a heuristic evaluation and cognitive walk-through by experts; (iv) we conducted detailed user testing of all experimental materials; and (v) we developed and tested a detailed instruction and support system. Results & Discussion: The survey and interviews yielded content ideas and challenges to be met in the design of the system. The evaluation by experts and target users identified user needs and design recommendations that were implemented in the redesign (e.g., meaningful icons and labels, navigation demands). The need for extensive training and instructional support became clear through the development and testing process, and thus these materials were integral to the implementation process. Overall, these data illustrate how human factors assessment tools provided valuable insights for design of the field trial, a necessary first step to ensure reliable and valid behavioral assessments.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929391178,1,1,0,

Overview of the Symposium Presentations The PRISM system was developed with the aim of maintaining the social connectivity and well-being of older adults. This symposium reports recent outcomes of a comprehensive research project on the development and evaluation of the PRISM system. The PRISM system was designed based on user-centered design principles, while using interdisciplinary collaboration that considered human factors and the opinions of psychologists and ICT engineers. The research team conducted intensive investigations related to user needs using surveys with and interviews of both project designers and potential users. The prototypes of the system as well as the related instructions were carefully tested with the help of potential users. The usefulness and usability of the system developed here was systematically evaluated by project designers using various methods with the help of a large number of potential users from diverse backgrounds. The project team has also developed a Computer Proficiency Questionnaire, a new measure of computer proficiency for appropriate evaluation of modern ICT such as PRISM. Overall, the research team has conducted the project systematically and comprehensively, while fully considering various human factors, resulting in successful system deployment. Perspectives Successful outcomes, reported in this symposium, illustrate the effectiveness of interdisciplinary collaboration of engineers, psychologists, and practitioners, as well as the advantages of a human-centered design approach. One of the significant points of the project was that the researchers have also focused on the affective aspects, such as whether the users enjoy using the system or their feelings of connectedness, as well as the functionality and usability of the ICT. This viewpoint should be considered as important in the development of technologies designed to increase the well-being of older adults1.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929402759,1,maybe,0,

Interviews with 32 older adult survivors, using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the Experience after Treatment in Intensive Care (ETIC-7) scale, Miller's Q-sort, and social work clinical wisdom, yielded unique and unexpected research results. Four response types were identified: avoiding, depressed, denial, and coping. Psychological agency during illness was found to be important. Participants did not reveal posttraumatic stress disorder-related phenomena predicted in previous literature but instead experienced posttraumatic growth. Hallucinatory experiences during illness were not traumatic, whereas social support emerged as a complicated concept. Participants unexpectedly revealed that childhood trauma was an important factor. Implications for clinical social work practice and research are outlined following the discussion of findings. © 2014 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892554673,0,1,0,

However, the ageing population is growing rapidly, and Turkey is facing an aging population structure during the next decade. In this context, the majority of Turkey's elderly population will inevitably face significant health and social care needs in the future. Socio-economic and psychological issues such as loneliness, participation in society, maintaining quality of life and active aging, have become very important agendas with the increasingly elderly population. However, the formal and informal care workforce is insufficient. Moreover, a safe home environment will also be needed to provide access to health and social services such as assisted living facilities; this will enhance the quality of life and the participation of individuals in society. The need for technological devices that enable the elderly to provide for their own needs is very obvious. This paper describes a project using assisted living technology provided through local governments as well as by public and non-government organizations and also describes how to put this type of technology into practice. The purpose of the project is to address the challenges elderly people will confront and to meet the needs and demands of an aging population in Turkey. Method: In this study, we conducted face-to-face interviews with fifteen local government officials as well as with leaders of public and non-governmental organizations and managers who provide services in this project. Semi-structured interview techniques were used to analyze gerontechnological methods in Ankara, Antalya and I˙stanbul. We analyzed the perceived importance, acceptance, and difficulties in using gerontechnological products and services for older adults in Turkey. Results & Discussion: Gerontechnology is seen as a key solution for those who are faced with confronting the prospect of increasing demands for eldercare. The growing use of technology is facilitating access to health services in a way that enhances the quality of life for the elderly. Based on the results of this study, Turkish elderly people find gerontechnology readily acceptable, but social and economic access are crucial issues. The government must develop policies designed to provide affordable quality services, especially long-term care, for elderly people. Coordination and cooperation is needed between the various health and social care sectors. In conclusion, Turkey's population of elderly increasingly demand the use of technology. The elderly will benefit directly from technology but also face crucial challenges related to economic, social and cultural factors.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929398992,1,0,0,

If they do not maintain their social lives, they may feel lonely and anxious. In order prevent them from mental health problems, it is important for them to maintain active social lives. For example, they may have conversations with their caregivers or their peers1. Active listening is a communication technique in which the listener listens to the speaker carefully and attentively by confirming or asking for more details about what they heard. This kind of support helps to make the elderly feel cared about and to relieve their anxiety and loneliness. This paper presents our in-progress project that aims to develop a framework of a virtual companion agent who can engage active listening and maintain a long-term relationship with elderly users (Figure 1). Method: In order to achieve the agent's companionship with the user over a long period of time, we believe that it is essential for the agent to understand the user as best as it can. This kind of user-fitted conversation is not addressed in previous companion agent work2. Our approaches try to acquire the memory of the user's daily life in two situations: at-home and outside-home. In the former one, Microsoft Kinect depth sensors were utilized. The information gathered from multiple Kinects is integrated to detect the user's position and posture and then to estimate the user's daily activity. In the outsidehome configuration, the prototype application is an Android smartphone application that recognizes the user's moving status with the information from the on-board three-axis accelerometer as well as the location of the user from GPS information. These data are then used to estimate the user's outside-home activity. All estimated daily activities are recorded in an activity history database. In future work, the user's activity database will be utilized by a companion agent in its conversation with the user and probably by medical institutions or the user's family from remote. Results & Discussion: The at-home activity estimation is developed and evaluated in a laboratory environment at moderate accuracy. The outside-home activity estimation is currently developed and evaluated with a college student user. The interface of the companion agent is being developed and evaluated. After the technologies are more matured, we would like to conduct real-world experiments.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929406209,1,0,0,

Measurements: Problematic game use was measured with the Gaming Addiction Short Scale (GAS), which covers seven criteria including salience, withdrawal and conflict. Additionally, gaming behaviour and psychosocial wellbeing (social capital and support, life satisfaction and success) were measured in all three panel waves. Findings: The generally low GAS scores were very stable in yearly intervals [average autocorrelation across waves and age groups: r=0.74, confidence interval (CI)=0.71, 0.77]. Only nine respondents (1%, CI=0.5, 1.9) consistently exhibited symptoms of problematic game use across all waves, while no respondent could be classified consistently as being addicted according to the GAS criteria. Changes in problematic gaming were not related consistently to changes in psychosocial wellbeing, although some cross-lagged effects were statistically significant in younger and older adult groups.

In this frame, media and communication technologies seem to be more and more relevant for the elderly, thanks to those services and devices helping people to grow old actively. Technologies, the Internet and ICTs could help the elderly to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. Our ongoing research investigates the relationship between the elderly and use of technologies, and explores the role played by media and ICTs in building a friendly and positive environment for the elderly, and in constructing and maintaining social relations and promoting healthy ageing. Specifically, the research will investigate the use of ICTs by the elderly by taking into account two different perspectives: a) Exchanges between generations: lengthening of life corresponds to a longer period of cohabitation between at least three generations (grandparents, children, grandchildren), and also of co-use of digital media. The research wants to investigate relations between two age groups (grandparents and grandchildren; young people and older people) to understand the dynamics of intergenerational mutuality in the use of technologies and ICTs. b) Media, ICTs, Health: the Western world is increasingly populated by elderly population. Technologies and ICTs can help elderly people to improve their quality of life, to be healthy and independent and to get better assistance. ICTs should encourage active ageing and, in the case of health technologies, new models of care.

These BBS sites have high volume of traffic everyday with user discussions on a variety of topics. Therefore it is difficult for BBS visitors to find the posts that they are interested in from the large amount of discussion threads. We attempt to explore several main characteristics of BBS, including organizational flexibility of BBS texts, high data volume and aging characteristic of BBS topics. Based on these characteristics, we propose a novel method of Online Topic Detection (OTD) on BBS, which mainly includes a representative post selection procedure based on Markov chain model and an efficient topic clustering algorithm with candidate topic set generation based on Aging Theory. Experimental results show that our method improves the performance of OTD in BBS environment in both detection accuracy and time efficiency. In addition, analysis on the aging characteristic of discussion topics shows that the generation and aging of topics on BBS is very fast, so it is wise to introduce candidate topic set generation strategy based on Aging Theory into the topic clustering algorithm.

The drastic increase in the percentage of aging people in the nation has created a boom of over 200 million seniors in China's communities1 today. This research article is based on this current challenging environment. This study considers seniors as a resource in an effort to deal with the aging population, through intervention designed to reintegrate seniors into society by fully utilizing the social contributions of seniors. Doing so will further enhance the role of seniors as a asset to society, increase the pool of people available to assist others in the social labor force, and thus achieve the goal of lessening the demands of seniors on the social resources society can provide. Method: First, reintegrating seniors into society will achieve the goal of changing the role and status of individual seniors. They will be transformed from a role of a prospective retiree who relies on social benefits into a vital part of the work force. Through reemployment, prolonged employment, and social volunteering, the potential value of seniors as human resources can be explored to discover the contribution seniors can make for social and economic development2. Second, integrating seniors into society will provide them with mental benefits by enhancing the aging process. Providing increased social interaction for seniors through volunteering will help seniors regain respect and will improve their mental health which will greatly enhance their lives after retirement. For example, the 'Gingko Club' in Hong Kong is a retiree-focused experiment3. It employs a chef, two assistant chefs and a purchaser; all other employees are seniors above the age of 60. They have all been provided with special training including an opportunity to improve their use of English as well as their appearance to enable them to work for the Gingko Club. In addition, the Club is specially equipped and designed with a focus on senior safety, including slip-resistant flooring, blood pressure measurement equipment and a large character menu. A social worker is available in the Club to work with and help seniors on a daily base. Results & Discussion: The reintegration for seniors has gained momentum and achieved good results. From 2000 to 2006, the percentage of seniors whom participated in social charitable activities and volunteering increased from 38.7% to 45.1% in the cities. Also, the percentage of residents who are willing to communicate with seniors who have difficulties in the cities has increased from 50% to 60.7%. The percentage of senior who participate in community events organized by the organizations, has increased from 56.4% to 66.2% generally, and in the city to 54.0% to 61.4%4. These efforts achieve the goal for transforming silver seniors into golden resources for the society. It not only helps seniors to enrich their lives during retirement, but also helps society as a whole to rethink the role of seniors; seniors transition from being thought of as consumers of social services to active participants in society who are socially responsible and provide benefits to society as a whole. Above all, gerontechnology plays an important role in helping older adults to return to work. Gerontechnology could improve the diagnosis of the process of memory impairment, and the assessment of functional disabilities among seniors as it relates to activities of daily living. Information and communication technologies may also allow the development of tools used to improve the rehabilitation and cognitive stimulation of society's senior members. Finally, technological tools can be designed to compensate for the cognitive impairment of seniors and to support patients and their families5.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929411059,1,maybe,0,

Many physical activity interventions are of short duration and do not report long-term changes in clinical measures or adoption of prescribed health behaviors. Previously, we have reported the clinical and behavioral outcomes from the first phase of a physical activity prescription and mHealth intervention delivered through the primary care setting. The purpose of this next phase is to perform a longitudinal follow-up 6-months postintervention. Methods: Mixed methods analysis including repeated measures ANOVA of functional aerobic capacity (VO2max) at preintervention, postintervention, and follow-up clinic visits, and whole text analysis of semistructured interviews discussing the participant experience in a health behavior intervention. Results: Twenty participants, mean age 63 ± 5 years, participated. Gains made in VO2max were maintained at 6 months (P &lt; 0.05). Participants reported engaging in sustained and routine physical activity, yet some identified a need for additional support to adopt the prescribed health behaviors. Emergent themes included the desire for short-term mHealth intervention to educate individuals about prescribed health behaviors without need for ongoing management by clinicians, leveraging mHealth to build social networks around prescribed health behaviors and to connect individuals to build a sense of community, and participant views of physical activity as medicine. Conclusions: The present study investigated both the long-term adoption of physical activity behaviors as well as the participant experience in a physical activity and mHealth intervention.

However, implementing Living Lab concepts requires a very open approach that sometimes contradicts a company's specific business model. Our project uses the concept of Living Labs to create a systematic and participatory approach to providing health care and strengthening community ties in tribal areas. This is, in fact, a regional planning project. Its open innovation platform incorporates three core functions: putting an IT platform for healthcare management in place, providing medical devices for home care through existing eldercare services, and situating communication devices to make daily life more convenient and facilitate tribal community building2-4. Method: We are establishing an experimental field for smart technologies designed to assist indigenous elderly in Nan-ao Township in cooperation with Saint Mary's Hospital Luodong, the Health Bureau of Yilan County, leading tele-care companies, the health care device industry, tribal leaders and community health networks. A university-based community partnership serves as a mediator, reducing health gaps in the region. Empowerment and user-driven innovation are key concepts to develop new service and business models. Research team members, working with tribal device users, design ICT products through a mutually supportive, participatory approach. At the same time, an innovative, foundational platform for promoting community health will be established by all stake holders in this indigenous tribe5. Eight community leaders and around 30 residents have taken part in this project. Results & Discussion: We designed a Living Lab with an e-learning platform to link social networking activity, detailed oral history data archives, and health promotion/rehabilitation activities with health data collections. The data collections were organized through health-related activities, coordinated mainly by the research team and the tribal association leaders. In this system, the community becomes a basic unit for developing self-sustained business and distributing neighborhood health information. Such neighborhoods may turn out to be both mobilization units and Living Labs for gathering data on local culture and eco-region planning.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929398207,1,maybe,0,

Method: As part of the Assistive Technologies for Healthy Living in Elders: Needs Assessment by Ethnography (ATHENE) project, 16 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key participants from organisations involved in developing and providing telecare technologies and services. Data were analysed thematically, using a conceptual model of diffusion of innovations. Results: Participants identified numerous interacting factors that facilitated or hindered adoption and use. As predicted by the model, these related variously to the technology, individual adopters, the process of social influence, the innovativeness and readiness of organisations, implementation and routinisation processes following initial adoption, and the nature and strength of linkages between these elements. Key issues included (i) the complexity and uniqueness of the ""user system"", (ii) the ongoing work needed to support telecare use beyond initial adoption, and (iii) the relatively weak links that typically exist between users of telecare technologies and the organisations who design and distribute them.

Studies suggest that older people may feel anxiety regarding the use of technology (computer anxiety), which is defined as emotional fear, apprehension and phobia felt by individuals related to interacting with computers or when thinking of working with a computer1-3. Method: This is a transversal, qualitative-quantitative and analytical study. The sample of participants was already defined. Data was collected at public and private locations in the city of Olimpia, in the state of Sao Paulo (i.e. a community center for the elderly and a club for elderly practicing sports) and in Ribeirao Preto City, Sao Paulo, where data collection was performed at the Digital Inclusion Project for Elderly (PIDI). Subjects were recruited by the researcher, through visits to the places mentioned above and by formal invitation to individuals to participate in the study. The data collection was done using a socioeconomic questionnaire, the scale of acceptance of technologies and a questionnaire about the factors that affect the use of electronic devices. The last two questionnaires had questions relating to the fear of using technology. At the PIDI, subjects were interviewed at the beginning of the course, so that there was no influence from the contact with the technologies and lessons on the feelings of fear on the participants. Descriptive statistics were used as the method of data analysis. Results & Discussion: The study included 100 older people aged between the ages of 60 and 86 years with a mean age of 69.38 years. Of the participants, 78% were female, 44% married, 59% had completed high school, and 86% were not economically active (retired or housewives). Of the elderly respondents, 24% reported being afraid to use new technological devices and 43.4% reported fear related to damaging the devices. The elderly responded that they feel afraid when using the internet; they fear viruses, social networks and spoiling or breaking the device. They are also afraid of ATMs, computers, new things, making mistakes and the consequences of these mistakes, such as deleting other people's documents on the computer, not being able to learn how to use a computer and being unable to use the device. They reported being afraid because of previous bad experiences with technology. The subjects stated that the complexity of the devices makes them difficult to use. The many features available on devices mean that people cannot understand the precise operation of the device. Also, the cost of maintaining the electronics eventually leaves them afraid that something will happen to the device. Older people who reported feeling apprehensive about damaging the device reported that they use excessive care when using the device. They think the devices should be simpler and also reported feeling apprehension about causing damage and not being able to get anyone to help fix any errors. Despite these difficulties, the elderly reported that they could overcome their fears after attending courses related to the inclusion of the elderly in the world; they are curious about technological advances. The results indicated that the considerable advancements in technology bring benefits, whether these advancements are inherent to the devices or to the individuals concerned, regardless of the barriers faced. Some of the barriers reported in the responses of the subjects included design, multiple functions, lack of security, and cognitive deficits. From the older people's responses, it is possible to note that fear has a significant influence on the attitudes of elderly people in relation to technological devices that can result in a lack of use or in a search for solutions to mitigate their fears and difficulties, such as seeking digital inclusion programs. Therefore, more research on variables such as the fear that may influence the use of new technology is needed, and strategies should be created to allow the elderly to better handle the obstacles that prevent the use of these devices.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929407720,1,1,0,

Dementia is predicted to become the leading cause of disability by 2016, with the number of cases in Australia expected to increase to close to 1 million by 2050 (AIHW 2007, p.52). While there is a growing literature around managing dementia, to date, insight into the role of housing in supporting PwD and the planning and coordination of health and housing services has been limited. This project on the Future housing and support needs of people with dementia aims to address this gap. In Chapter 1, we provide an introduction to the project and the report. This includes an outline of: the research and policy significance of the project; the major themes and questions that frame the research; and the structure of the Positioning Paper. In Chapter 2, we examine recent international and national research on dementia and housing. Key findings emerging from this review include: Housing is recognised as a critical protective factor in relation to the health and well-being of older Australians. Older Australians have articulated a desire to retain independence and they support a consumer-directed approach to health care. A substantial proportion of PwD live in the community, an estimated 70 per cent of all PwD, and this is expected to grow over the coming decades. A PwD's home is critical to their quality of life, with PwD more likely than others in the community to be spending a significant proportion of their time in the home. Continuing to live in their family home and share their lives with loved ones is of primary significance in enabling PwD to cope with the challenges of loss of memory function. One of the major advantages of PwD remaining in their own home following diagnosis is that the home is a familiar environment. For PwD, remaining in their own home holds distinct advantages during the mild and moderate stages of the condition, but this situation changes as the condition progresses. Co-resident caregivers become a critical companion in supporting PwD to continue to undertake tasks they are competent in and assisting with tasks when the PwD experiences a loss in capacity. PwD who live alone are at risk of social isolation, self-neglect, self-injury, depression, and exploitation by others. PwD are more likely to be female and to have lower incomes and they are less likely to access services and support. There are a range of design interventions and assistive technologies that can make a difference to the well-being of PwD and allow them to continue to mobilise remaining strengths and capacities. Home modifications are effective in decreasing the incidence of accidents and injury, and they can strengthen home-based social relationships and networks and reduce strain on caregivers. PwD are more likely to remain in place if supported by live-in carers, but carers' own pressing needs for appropriate housing are less often addressed, particularly those on low incomes. The impact of an ageing population on the housing sector is substantial, with older households projected to grow from 1.6 to 3.2 million between 2008 and 2028. An AHURI study of older persons in public housing (2008) found that housing authority staff felt that they were not well-equipped to assist tenants with dementia and that they have little knowledge of, and limited relationships with, community aged care services. The establishment of a National Indigenous Dementia Strategy reflects growing awareness of dementia as a public health concern in Indigenous communities and the need for a coordinated, partnership approach between Indigenous communities, governments, health networks and the research community in responding to community need. The role of housing is not well understood in relation to cognitive decline and dementia in Indigenous communities. However, it is recognised that poor living conditions and poor quality housing exacerbate problems for Indigenous people in remote areas with dementia. PwD, as their condition advances, will typically transition into residential care. The literature identifies three consistent predictors of entry into residential care: dementia severity and cognitive decline; behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; and caregivers' health and burden. Studies of transitions into residential care highlight the importance of participation by both PwD and their carers in the decision to enter into residential care. Service-integrated housing in Australia is experiencing moderate growth, primarily within the community and private sector. More research and policy development is required to ensure that this form of housing provision can support a diverse aged population. In Chapter 3, we examine available secondary data on the housing circumstances of older Australians and PwD. Key findings emerging from this review of secondary data sources relating to PwD include: There are 266 574 PwD in Australia in 2011. This is projected to increase to 553 285 people by 2030 and 942 624 by 2050. Dementia rates are relatively low until the age of 70 years and then incidence rates increase rapidly. In 2011, there were approximately 157 864 PwD living in an owner-occupied home, with 145 735 living in a home that is owned outright and a further 12 129 living in a mortgaged home. In 2011, there were approximately 11 756 PwD living in private rental and 8957 PwD living in public housing. The number of PwD living in public housing is expected to increase from 8957 people in 2011 to 12 916 in 2020 and 31 672 in 2050. The number of PwD living in private rental housing is expected to increase from 11 756 people in 2011 to 16 952 in 2020 and 41 570 in 2050. It is estimated that in 2011 there were 6003 CRA recipients aged 55 years and over who have dementia; 643 of these were aged 55-64 years and 5360 were aged 65 years and over. It is estimated that in 2011 there were 1742 CRA recipients aged 55 years and over who have dementia and who were experiencing housing stress; 262 of these were aged 55-64 years and 1480 were aged 65 years and over. It is estimated that in 2011, 30 per cent of PwD lived in cared accommodation, while 70 per cent lived in the community. In relation to living arrangements, in 2009 almost 9 in 10 (88%) PwD who lived in private dwellings lived with others, while 12 per cent lived alone. Men were more likely than women to have been living with others (93% and 84% respectively). In 2009, about 9 in 10 (92%) PwD living in the community were receiving care from one or more carers. Most PwD were being cared for by family, either their spouse/partner or their child/ren. Around 42 per cent of main carers of a person with dementia were the spouse/partner of the care recipient and 44 per cent were the son or daughter. PwD living in the community were most likely to need assistance with mobility (80%), followed by self-care (62%). They were least likely (39%) to need help with communication. In the final chapter, we provide an outline of the primary data collection stage of our project. This entails interviews conducted in two case sites, South Australia (SA) and Tasmania. The research team will conduct approximately 15 interviews with relevant stakeholders in each case site. Relevant stakeholders include: housing managers, social workers and aged care service providers. The research team will then conduct approximately 10 interviews with PwD and their carers across a range of low cost housing settings, including low income owner-occupiers, private rental tenants and public and community housing tenants. The interviews will be transcribed and analysed using the qualitative data analysis computer software package NVivo.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905440314,0,0,0,review

Design: Raters collected cross-sectional observational data and conducted semistructured interviews with participants of the Sydney Multisite Intervention of LaughterBosses and ElderClowns (SMILE) Study. Researchers tested the BEAM's reliability and validity and evaluated the instrument's discriminate validity for sampling resident behaviors. Setting: Data were collected in 36 long-term care homes. The sample included low-care hostels, high-care nursing homes, and residential facilities offering aging-in-place. Participants: Participants were 406 residents aged 52 to 105 years, with and without dementia. Measurements: Researchers collected direct observational data using the BEAM and operationalized behavioral domains based largely on concepts from Kitwood's model of person-centered care. Care staff reported on resident behavior using standardized measures of agitation, depression, quality of life, and social engagement. Results: The BEAM showed moderate-to-substantial interrater reliability and slight-to-moderate correlations with staff-report data gathered through standardized questionnaire measures. Observations showed that residents spent the greatest amount of time stationary and expressing little emotion, although actively engaged with their environment. Residents were observed to be coping adequately and experiencing a positive social and/or positive care interaction in approximately half of observations; however, close to a third of ratings identified ""ill-being."" Residents showed more positive behavior, appeared happier and less anxious, and exhibited higher ""well-being"" during structured activity than during free time or meals. Conclusion: The BEAM is a reliable and valid observational tool for measuring behavior in long-term care. Long-term care residents expressed little emotion and experienced limited positive social interaction in their daily routine. Increased provision of structured activities may increase resident experiences of positive behavior, affect, and well-being. © 2014 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903162147,1,0,0,52+

Methods: A mixed methods approach was adopted. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected by a survey of 323 older ICT users (aged ≥50 years) between 2011 and 2012. These data were supplemented by qualitative data obtained through in-depth interviews, focus groups and storytelling. Quantitative data were analysed using PASW including bivariate and multivariate analyses. Qualitative data were analysed using an inductive, thematic approach. Results: The findings show that, contrary to some stereotypes, many older people are enthusiastic, competent and confident users of ICTs. However, they report a range of challenges in reaching and maintaining this situation. These include technological complexity and change, age-related capability changes and a lack of learning and support mechanisms. Intrinsic motivation and social support are important in enabling older people to overcome these challenges. Discussion: Getting older people online has been a high priority in many countries over the past decade. However, little attention has been paid to whether and how their usage can be sustained over time. We discuss the implications of the findings for policy and practice. © 2013 S.

The role of feelings of loneliness and social isolation in dementia is less well understood, and prospective studies including these risk factors are scarce. Methods We tested the association between social isolation (living alone, unmarried, without social support), feelings of loneliness and incident dementia in a cohort study among 2173 non-demented community-living older persons. Participants were followed for 3 years when a diagnosis of dementia was assessed (Geriatric Mental State (GMS) Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy (AGECAT)). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between social isolation and feelings of loneliness and the risk of dementia, controlling for sociodemographic factors, medical conditions, depression, cognitive functioning and functional status. Results After adjustment for other risk factors, older persons with feelings of loneliness were more likely to develop dementia (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.56) than people without such feelings. Social isolation was not associated with a higher dementia risk in multivariate analysis. Conclusions Feeling lonely rather than being alone is associated with an increased risk of clinical dementia in later life and can be considered a major risk factor that, independently of vascular disease, depression and other confounding factors, deserves clinical attention.

With improvements in mobile phone technology, the elderly can communicate with their children or friends conveniently, which can improve their life satisfaction and subjective well-being1,2. This paper aims to describe changes in the elderly's use of mobile phones in 2010 and measure the association between use of mobile phones and social loneliness3. Method: Based on the 2010 ""Survey of the Older Population in Rural and Urban Beijing"", this paper focuses on a descriptive analysis of use of mobile phone to analyze older people's changing behaviors and then discusses the association between their mobile phone usage and social loneliness. Mobile phones can help the elderly obtain information and establish connections. This paper introduces the concept of 'social loneliness' as the most important reference of connection between the elderly and the society, and it has been operated as a subjective feeling question, namely the dependent variable. Results & Discussion: According to data analysis, mobile phones have become popular among the elderly. Only 44.3% of the elderly used mobile phones in 2006, but the number increased to 68.6% in 2010. As shown in Table 1, when demographic variables were controlled, mobile phone usage has a significant impact on social loneliness of the elderly. The more often old people use mobile phones, the less social loneliness they feel. The result shows that the necessity of using mobile phones for the elderly.

Social technologies offer enormous potential for enhancing aged care, but research on their use in aged care has largely focused on institutional or informal care settings, rather than formal care in the home. Meanwhile, technologies for aging in place typically focus on monitoring and security, rather than psychosocial support. We conducted a field study in which aged care managers used a photo and message-sharing tool to communicate with clients living in their own homes. Our findings demonstrate that visual and social forms of communication are valuable for supporting psychosocial care-giving, but there are barriers to effectively adopting new communication tools in this setting. Time constraints inhibited care managers' use of the technology, which was also influenced by their efforts to carefully maintain boundaries between their personal and professional lives.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900406069,0,0,1,

Based on interviews with 27 men aged 39-61 living in Manchester, this article addresses what middle-aged gay men's accounts of these particular homospaces say about their experiences of age/ageing and how relations of ageism work within them. Specifically, I focus on how study participants use 'ageing capital' in these fields to differentiate themselves from their younger counterparts in three ways. First, ageing capital is implicated in capitulation to gay ageism and a reverse ageism - visible in accounts of differentiation from the 'superficial,' reckless ways of sexualized space that participants associated with younger gay men. Second, it was visible in accounts of resistance to/questioning of gay ageism - strategies that could make sexualized homospaces more habitable. Third, ageing capital was implicated in negotiation with ageing/gay ageism - visible in ambivalent stances hovering between compliance and resistance - towards ageing and ageism, which could reinforce constraints on uses/display of the body. The first and third accounts indicate the multidirectional character of gay ageism, limits on the deployment on ageing capital and show how middle-aged men can undermine their generational claims to represent a more authentic form of gay male embodiment. En route, I also complicate stereotypical thinking that gay social/support groups represent more inclusive, empowering space whilst overtly sexualized spaces of the 'gay scene' represent the opposite. © London School of Economics and Political Science 2014.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896356909,0,0,0,

Results showed that preparedness was most strongly predicted when emergency communications were received from neighbourhood and community member sources rather than the media or other organisations. Findings also highlighted that communities are inherently different and need targeted emergency communications, tailored to the disaster type and community composition. In particular, the elderly and the unemployed reported social isolation and less access to mobile phone and internet communications. The findings show that emergency communications need to be two-way so that those at risk in an emergency can access specific advice about their household and what action to take to protect themselves and their property.

Since the aging population increases demands on healthcare budgets, effectively stimulating physical activity (PA) against acceptable costs is of major relevance. This study provides insight into long-term health outcomes and cost-effectiveness of a tailored PA intervention among adults aged over fifty. Methods: Intervention participants (N = 1729) received tailored advice three times within four months, targeting the psychosocial determinants of PA. The intervention was delivered in different conditions (i.e. print-delivered versus Web-based, and with or without additional information on local PA opportunities). In a clustered RCT, the effects of the different intervention conditions were compared to each other and to a control group. Effects on weekly Metabolic Equivalents (MET)-hours of PA obtained one year after the intervention started were extrapolated to long-term outcomes (5-year, 10-year and lifetime horizons) in terms of health effects and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and its effect on healthcare costs, using a computer simulation model. Combining the model outcomes with intervention cost estimates, this study provides insight into the long-term cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated. Results: For all extrapolated time horizons, the printed and the Web-based intervention resulted in decreased incidence numbers for diabetes, colon cancer, breast cancer, acute myocardial infarctions, and stroke and increased QALYs as a result of increased PA. Considering a societal Willingness-to-Pay of €20,000/QALY, on a lifetime horizon the printed (ICER = €7,500/QALY) as well as the Web-based interventions (ICER = €10,100/QALY) were cost-effective. On a 5-year time horizon, the Web-based intervention was preferred over the printed intervention. On a 10-year and lifetime horizon, the printed intervention was the preferred intervention condition, since the monetary savings of the Web-based intervention did no longer outweigh its lower effects. Adding environmental information resulted in a lower cost-effectiveness. Conclusion: A tailored PA intervention in a printed delivery mode, without environmental information, has the most potential for being cost-effective in adults aged over 50. ï¿½ 2014 Peels et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940639024,1,0,1,50+

Migration of people, both within a country and across borders, is a global phenomenon. South Africa has diverse historical and contemporary migration patterns, and there are various factors underlying emigration; these may be of an economic, social or personal nature. A general theory regarding the causes of migration distinguishes between push and pull factors. Pull factors include personal safety in society, a better standard of living as well as various job opportunities. Push factors in South Africa, among others, include dissatisfaction of the standard of public and commercial services, perceptions of moral decline in society, an unemployment-rate of 25.6% (Statistics SA 2013) and dissatisfaction with affirmative action issues. One of the main push factors in South Africa is the high level of crime. The desire to travel and a sense of adventure also play a part in people's decision to emigrate. The country's database and statistics on emigration flows are inadequate; and the impact of emigration on the mental health of the families who have been left behind, especially parents, remains a neglected topic in South Africa. According to media reports, South Africa is suffering from the effects of a ""brain-drain"", and the country is also exposed to free trade agreements and globalising tendencies. Each person leaving the country leaves behind a family. The effects on those who have to remain in South Africa, particularly the parents, have yet to be sufficiently researched. Part of the parents' psycho-social support system suddenly falls away when their children emigrate. Some parents lose all their children as a result of emigration. The communication and interaction with their children on different continents become complex. A contributing factor to poor communication is parents' inability to utilize technology as a means of staying in contact with their children. These parents are usually middle-aged and some of them even older, and are dependent on other people for their daily care. They have to adapt to the new circumstances in this relatively advanced phase in their lives. In previous generations, this used to be a phase in which people slowed down, retired and settled down to enjoy their grandchildren. After their children's emigration, they are no longer able to see their grandchildren growing up; in a significant way, they are being excluded from their children's daily life. Some of the parents relied on their children to take care of them in later years and suddenly they have to try and find alternative support systems. A Christian existential paradigm was used, which, in searching to find meaning in life and to make responsible choices, views a person as a whole entity. The framework of the Theory of Health Promotion (Department of Nursing 2010) forms the philosophical and theoretical basis, as the phenomenon of emigration impacts on families as a system; seeing that the abovementioned theory follows a holistic perspective, it should adequately address families' sense of loss. A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual study of the experiences of parents whose children had emigrated, was done by using community radio as the medium of interaction. The community radio was used to invite parents whose children had emigrated to participate in this research. The radio medium is a powerful, cost-effective medium with which to reach thousands of people at the same time. It is also ideal for psycho-educational purposes because of the convenience to listen to it in your house, car or while doing something else. The aim was to facilitate the mental health of those parents who had been left behind. Indepth interviews were conducted with 16 parents after broadcasting an invitation to participate in the study by means of a community radio station. The population was Afrikaans-speaking people with a Christian tradition. The average period of their children's emigration was nine years. All the parents' children had emigrated longer than one year ago. The following was found: parents whose children emigrate experience a feeling of disillusionment, expressed in the words ""we raise them to leave us!"" The loss is ambiguous, with a main feeling of helplessness; their affective response painfully fluctuates. The experience is unique and personal and parents apply effective and less effective coping mechanisms in order to deal with the ambiguous loss.

The Hawai'i Family Study of Cognition (HFSC), initiated in the early 1970s, included a cohort of over 6500 individuals representing over 1800 families of parents and their offspring. The HFSC gathered data on cognitive, personality, biological and other psychosocial variables, and provided novel information on the nature of cognitive abilities, especially on family issues. Some families were reassessed with short-term retesting in the 1970s. A select sample of offspring and their siblings and spouses were re-measured in the 1980s. Decades later, a 40-year follow-up of the original HFSC cohort was facilitated by the availability of contemporary tracking and tracing methods and internet-based testing. A subgroup of the original HFSC participants was re-contacted and retested on contemporary cognitive as well as socio-demographic and health measures.

However, information is often insufficiently shared among members of the health care staff. Currently in Japan, an ordinary paper notebook is used to facilitate communication among health care professionals, and sharing information with this method of communication is sometimes difficult to do in a timely fashion. The authors improved a previously developed iPad application for home health care named 'e-Renraku Notebook' (e-RN), i.e., e-Communication Notebook; 'Renraku' means 'communication' or 'contact' in Japanese1. eRN enables home care patients and their families to input the daily status of patients and to exchange information with the health care staff in a timely manner. The authors report the results of a study of its utility. Method: The characteristics of the e-RN are as follows. (i) Unlike an ordinary electronic medical chart, care recipients and their families can input data and also can access all of the data. (ii) Letters are large enough for the elderly to read easily, as shown in Figure 1, and the operation is intuitive. (iii) The system can be accessed anywhere by using an LTE/3G wireless network. (iv) The e-RN performs speech-to-text conversion. (v) It allows sharing of photos and movies. To develop the system, the authors used cloud computing for data management. When exchanging information via the internet, the server requires authentication, and all exchanged information is encrypted. All of the user access histories are saved in the database of the server. Home care patients and health care staff were furnished e-RNinstalled iPads for two months to input their schedules and their daily status, such as vital signs, and to exchange messages with each other. For evaluation of the system, the authors carried out a survey before and after usage of the system. Results &amp; Discussion: Twenty home care patients and their health care teams in four regions of Kyoto Prefecture participated in the trial. More than half of the information input was conducted by patients and their families, followed by nurses, and the other health care professionals. About 30% of the communications were related to daily life, excluding health information or inquiries. The communication was made primarily between patients/families and nurses, and communication between patients/families and other health care professionals was not rare. The authors developed a new system which allows home health care information to be shared by anyone, anywhere by utilizing the e-RN. The e-RN is effective for timely sharing of information, and the contents of home health care status can be visualized. The e-RN may facilitate collaboration among people in various professions. Effective usage of the e-RN has the potential to improve the quality of home health care and to bring a sense of connectedness to patients/families and their health care staff members.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84929399216,1,0,0,

The interviewed home care patients felt they had a natural conversation through the videoconference device. The individuals' views of the usefulness of videoconference technology seemed to be an essential factor in the acceptance and use of technology. The use of the videoconference device was not considered particularly challenging, so the ease of the use of technology and learning to use the device were not considered a major challenge, not even for the elderly. The customers were worried about the privacy because of the installed cameras, but considered the safety the system brings more important.

Information and communication technologies have been utilized to assist homecare of older adults. However, in addition to transmitting vital sign data for healthcare purposes, older adults may expect to share their life experiences and feelings by different forms of interactions with their children and family members. Communication tools did facilitate interpersonal communication in terms of real-time verbal communication. Nevertheless, nonverbal communication, such as facial expression and body language, is more powerful and efficient in conveying ideas, thoughts, and emotions. ""TRiCmini +"" is a telepresence robot for interpersonal communication. It demonstrates extensive capability to provide different levels of ""care delivery"" to older adults through vital sign monitoring, interpersonal communication, robotic movements, and social network integration. TRiCmini + integrates two distinct applications, the ""Care Delivery Frame (CDF)"" and the telepresence robot. CDF is an App designed for older adults as an information channel on the tablet PC, which is also the ""face"" of TRiCmini +. CDF is integrated with social network services, and remote caregivers can share messages, photos or video clips with older adults. Moreover, the tablet is also the control center of the robot. In this innovative control structure, the robot control App can be downloaded and maintained easily through the Internet. The prototype and functional test of TRiCmini + have been completed.

As the online social networks are getting more common in peoples social lives, there is therefore a growing need for social applications that are designed for the elderly. In this paper we present design and implementation of the AMCOSOP system that enables the elderly to stay connected with their families, friends and safety network even though they are living by themselves. Consisting of a touchscreen user interface and web-based solutions, the AMCOSOP system was used in field trials in two countries for several months.

The main focus of this exploratory study was to investigate elderly peoples' perceptions and experiences of social interaction and leisure activities living in a residential aged care (RAC) facility. Six residents were interviewed. Themes emerging from discussions about their social interactions included: importance of family, fostering friendships with fellow residents, placement at dining room tables, multiple communication methods, and minimal social isolation and boredom. Excursions away from the RAC facility were favourite activities. Participants commonly were involved in leisure activities to be socially connected. Poor health, family, the RAC facility, staffi ng, transportation, and geography influenced their social interaction and participation in leisure activities. The use of new technologies and creative problem solving with staff are ways in which residents could enhance their social lives and remain engaged in leisure activities. © eContent Management Pty Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892540859,0,1,0,

To understand how individuals across 3 generations (young, middle-aged, and older) think about the design and use of collaborative health and wellness management technologies and what roles these could take in their lives. Face-to-face semistructured interviews, paper prototype systems, and video skits were used to assess how individuals from 3 age cohorts (young: 18-25 years; middle-aged: 35-50 years; and older: ≥65 years) conceptualize the role that health and wellness computing could take in their lives. A total of 21 participants in the 3 age cohorts took part (young: n=7; middle-aged: n=7; and older: n=7). Young adults expected to be able to actively manage the presentation of their health-related information. Middle-aged adults had more nuanced expectations that reflect their engagement with work and other life activities. Older adults questioned the sharing of health information with a larger audience, although they saw the value in 1-way sharing between family members or providing aggregated information. Our findings inform our suggestions for improving the design of future collaborative health and wellness applications that target specific age groups. We recommend that collaborative ICT health applications targeting young adults should integrate with existing social networking sites, whereas those targeting middle-aged and older adults should support small social networks that rely on intimate personal relationships. Systems that target middle-aged adults should support episodic needs, such as time-sensitive, perhaps intermittent, goal setting. They should also have a low barrier to entry, allowing individuals who do not normally engage with the Internet to participate with the application for the specific purposes of health engagement. Collaborative ICT health applications targeting older adults should allow discreet 1-way sharing, and also support sharing of information in aggregate with others' data. These systems should also provide mechanisms to preselect recipients of different kinds of data, or to easily direct specific information to individuals in real time.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891853636,0,0,0,broader

These problems can be readily compounded (for example, reduced levels of attention are associated with an increased risk of falling). Keeping active is commonly advised to reduce these problems - many senior groups exist that meet regularly and engage in activities that encourage social interaction. However, mobility and other problems mean that elderly people may not be able to attend such groups very often, if at all. To address this problem, we set out to create an experience that confers the same benefits (increasing social connectedness and inhibiting cognitive decline) without users having to leave their homes. Our user group selected one of the games they play together, Memory, a game that requires players to closely attend to their experience. We designed and developed a digital multiplayer version of Memory for browser and tablet targeted at elderly users. The game is integrated into a custom social network, and enables users to talk and play without having to be in the same physical space. It also incorporates user-generated content from the social network. A pilot study has been carried out with two user groups across two European countries. It investigates whether the experience of playing a physical game between players in present the same physical space differs significantly from playing in different locations using the digital version of the game. In order to uncover differences, the study compared how intrinsically motivating each experience is. In the study, which uses within-subjects design, the users played Memory with real cards together in the physical space and afterwards completed the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI). The users also played the digital version of the game via the social network, this time where users are in different locations using a PC, Smart TV, or Tablet, and communicate using VOIP, and afterwards completed the IMI. The data collected was analysed and used to inform semi-structured interviews. This paper presents findings from the pilot study, and from these findings outlines the main study and future work in investigating and improving the game's benefits.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893864978,0,maybe,0,

People are spending a significant amount of time at the top social networking websites in order to manage existing relationships with friends, reconnect with old friends, share media and find new contacts that have similar interests. Fulfilling these needs are just as important for elderly people as it is for everyone else, but can become more difficult. Many are no longer at work so they do not have a daily set of activities with the same group of people. This, combined with increasing frailty, can lead to a habit of staying at home, which adds to the feeling of loneliness and isolation. In spite of this need for social contact, elderly people, even those who use the internet, tend to miss out on the benefits of online social networking platforms. Elderly people are keen to maintain contact with the different generations of their family. Many older people have already invested significant time in building contact lists and relationships within the major social networks. Go-myLife has therefore not attempted to set up a new social network but rather a platform from where elderly people can post messages and receive updates and take part in discussions across a variety of platforms, thus bringing existing communities together. In this paper, the authors present a context-aware social networking platform, the ""Going online: my social life"" platform, which is adapted to the needs of elderly users. © 2013 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84888267365,0,maybe,0,

One important aspect is the need and wish of older people to live as long as possible in their own home and maintain an independent life. As people grew older, their social networks disperse, with friends and families moving to other parts of town, other cities or even countries. Additionally, people become less mobile with age, leading to less active participation in societal life. Combined, this normal, age-related development leads to increased loneliness and social isolation of older people, with negative effects on mental and physical health of those people. In the AGNES project, a home-based system has been developed that allows connecting elderly with their families, friends and other significant people over the Internet. As most older people have limited experience with computers and often special requirements on technology, one focus of AGNES was to develop with the users novel technological means for interacting with their social network. The resulting system uses ambient displays, tangible interfaces and wearable devices providing ubiquitous options for interaction with the network, and secondary sensors for additionally generating carefully chosen information on the person to be relayed to significant persons. Evaluations show that the chosen modalities for interaction are well adopted by the users. Further it was found that use of the AGNES system had positive effects on the mental state of the users, compared to the control group without the technology. © 2013 OpenInterface Association.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891736649,0,maybe,1,

This paper focuses on the experiences of such nurses who undertake shift work. Background: The mean age of registered nurses in New Zealand has been rising steadily, and 40% are now aged 50 years or over. While there is substantial literature on the phenomenon and consequences of the ageing nursing workforce, little is known of the particular experiences of nurses aged over 50 years who work shifts. Method: An anonymous online survey was emailed to eligible nurse New Zealand Nurses Organisation members aged over 50 years in February 2012. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the 3273 responses received were undertaken. Result: Over 45% of respondents worked shifts or flexible hours. While shift work suited many, others noted deleterious effects on family and social relationships, physical and mental health (notably sleep patterns and fatigue), and decreasing tolerance for shift work as they age. Poor scheduling practices were particularly detrimental. Conclusion and implications for nursing management: Worldwide, workforce ageing means strategies are required to retain older nurses in the workforce. Improved scheduling practices including increasing access to flexible and part time work hours, and development of resources on coping with shift work are recommended. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885851284,1,0,0,

This will be an even larger issue in the future with growing numbers of elderly and less resources, for example, in terms of economy and staff. Loneliness and social isolation can, however, be addressed in several ways using different interactive eHealth services. Objective: This case study investigated novel eHealth services for the elderly, and their usage of a social interactive device designed especially for them. Methods: In this work, we used an innovative mobile communication device connected to the television (TV), which worked as a remotely controlled large interactive screen. The device was tested by 8 volunteers who visited a senior center. They were between 65 and 80 years of age and lived in their own homes. Throughout the 1.5 year-long project, 7 design workshops were held with the seniors and the staff at the center. During these workshops, demands and preferences regarding existing and new services were gathered. At the end of the project the participants' experience of the device and of the services was elaborated in 3 workshops to get ideas for improved or new meaningful services. During the data analyses and development process, what seniors thought would be useful in relation to what was feasible was prioritized by the development company. Results: Regarding daily usage, the seniors reported that they mainly used the service for receiving information from the senior center and for communication with other participants in the group or with younger relatives. They also read information about events at the senior center and they liked to perform a weekly sent out workout exercise. Further, they played games such as Memory and Sudoku using the device. The service development focused on three categories of services: cognitive activities, social activities, and physical activities. A cognitive activity service that would be meaningful to develop was a game for practicing working memory. In the social activities category, the seniors wanted different quizzes and multi-player games. For physical activities, the seniors desired more workout exercises and suggestions for guided walking routes. A new category, ""information and news"", was suggested since they lacked services like senior-customized global and local news. Conclusions: This study showed the importance of input from a group of seniors when designing new services for elderly citizens. Besides input to interactive eHealth service development for seniors, this study showed the importance of a social context around such work. The seniors were very engaged throughout the project and workshops were frequently visited and the seniors became friends. The high amount of input from the seniors could be explained in terms of social inclusion; they belonged to a group and each member was considered important for the work. The friendly workshop atmosphere facilitated new ideas and redesign of the services. © Isabella Scandurra, Marie Sjölinder.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887957045,1,1,0,

Four focus group discussions and 26 individual interviews were undertaken. Qualitative data were analyzed using NVivo software and were categorized using coding and grounded theory techniques. The result indicated that old people in Hong Kong had an overall positive attitude toward technology. Positive attitudes were most frequently related to enhanced convenience and advanced features. Negative attitudes were most frequently associated with health risks and social problems arising from using technology (e.g., social isolation and addiction). Usage of technology is driven by outcome expectations and social influences, and supported by facilitators, whereas non-use of gerontechnology relates to the personal (e.g., health and functional capacities), technological (e.g., cost and complexity), and environmental barriers experienced. Use of gerontechnology is a synthesis of person, technology, and environment. To encourage non-users to adopt technology, there is a need to remove barriers at personal, technological, and environmental levels. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84885101420,0,1,0,

Design: The most serious health needs of seniors in 2 Canadian jurisdictions were identified and linked to the specific services and associated competencies required of health care providers (HCPs) to address those needs. The amounts of each service required were quantified and compared against the capacity of HCPs to perform the services, measured using a self-assessment survey, by using a previously developed analytical framework. Setting: Home and LTC sectors in Nova Scotia and Nunavut, Canada. Participants: Regulated and nonregulated HCPs were invited to complete either an online or paper-based competency self-assessment survey. Results: Survey response rates in Nova Scotia and Nunavut were 11% (160 responses) and 20% (22responses), respectively. Comparisons of the estimated number of seniors likely to need each service with the number who can be served by the workforces in each jurisdiction indicated that the workforces in both jurisdictions are sufficiently numerous, active, productive, and competent to provide most of the services likely to be required. However, significant gaps were identified in pharmacy services, ongoing client assessment, client/family education and involvement, and client/family functional and social supports. Conclusion: Service-based HHR planning is feasible for identifying gaps in services required by older adults, and can guide policy makers in planning hiring/recruitment, professional development, and provider education curricula. Implementation will require commitment of policy makers and other stakeholders, as well as ongoing evaluation of its effectiveness. More broadly, the ongoing effectiveness of the approach will depend on workforce planning being conducted in an iterative way, driven by regular reevaluation of population health needs and HHR effectiveness. © 2013 American Medical Directors Association, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881256560,1,0,0,

This study assessed the transportation needs of low-mobility individuals using three dimensions: (1) travel characteristics, (2) social strength in terms of transportation assistance received from their social networks, and (3) accessibility to public transportation. A mixed survey method combining an in-person interview at the collaborating organizations and a mail-back survey were used. Results showed that older adults remain mobile and make more frequent short trips. The results also showed a much higher reliance on private vehicles among older adults and individuals with low income, whereas a much higher reliance on public transportation and much lower reliance on private transportation was found among individuals with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities were still active, as almost half of them travel to work frequently. However, the number of nonwork trips made by individuals with disabilities was significantly low. These findings indicated a positive relationship between transportation mode choices and social dependence with family and friends. Individuals with stronger family social ties were more likely to receive adequate help meeting their transportation needs. The accessibility analysis revealed that low-mobility individuals in Cache County, Utah, have difficulties accessing transit due to the long walking distances from their residences. These findings may be used to guide policy for improving public transportation and paratransit services to meet low-mobility individuals' needs. © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879705218,0,0,0,broader

Engagement with 'traditional' computing devices amongst older adults, including arguably mobile devices, such as laptop computers is low due to dexterity issues amongst this population (Hertzum & Hornbaek, 2010). Whilst the iPad removes some of the traditional barriers to computer engagement, new barriers including weight and screen reflection are evident to an older user group. This paper provides an exploratory evaluation of how older adults in 11 UK care-home settings and the staff engaged in their care are using iPads to help improve communication, build physical social networks amongst residents, staff and family members, and map the most frequently used applications by an older population during a six-month pilot period. Results suggest that applications involving information searching for personally related and historical information were most valued by older adults. Further, older adults and care staff alike report mainly positive experiences of iPad use in care settings including the increased opportunities for social interaction and the enhancement of intergenerational communication. Additionally, the barriers to use (e.g. device weight) are often overcome by low-tech adaptations and adjustment when using the device. This paper argues that the portability and adaptive nature of the iPad combined with the increased social interaction afforded by device could increase quality of life in care settings.

We argue that these online activities serve as a meaningful form of civic engagement by broadening who participates and encouraging other forms of participation. Using a survey of randomly chosen undergraduates at a large Midwestern university, we discover that important distinctions exist between those who friend or join these online social networks and those who participate in more traditional off-line political activities. While interest in politics is a precursor to off-line engagement, it does not predict friending or joining an online social network that is political in nature. However, friending candidates or joining such networks appears to mobilize college students to engage in other forms of political participation. © The Author(s) 2012.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84877336214,0,0,0,

Our Web-survey used the newly developed CAP burden of illness questionnaire (CAP-BIQ) designed to assess the presence of key symptoms, comorbid conditions affected by CAP, psychosocial impacts, productivity, and CAP-associated physician visits in US adults aged 50 years and older. Methods: The CAP-BIQ was developed from semi-structured one-on-one interviews and finalized after cognitive debriefings with recently diagnosed CAP patients. The CAP-BIQ was then administered to 500 survey participants with a CAP diagnosis within the past 120 days confirmed by chest imaging recruited from a Web-based panel. Analyses of survey results were weighted for national representativeness, and were compared between relevant age, hospitalization status, and pneumonia-risk subgroups. Results: The survey participants' mean age was 62.4 years; 45 % were men; and 39.6 % were hospitalized due to CAP. On average, the surveys were completed 56.9 days after pneumonia diagnosis. Nearly all participants reported tiredness, cough, body aches, weakness, shortness of breath, wheezing, and a weak appetite at the time of diagnosis (99.0, 96.8, 96.9, 94.1, 89.1, 85.8, and 78.5 %, respectively). There was generally greater symptom prevalence at diagnosis in younger, nonhospitalized, or high-risk subgroups when compared to their respective older, hospitalized, or low-risk counterparts. Most participants reported at least one cough-related and weakness-related impact on their daily life and activities from CAP. Over three quarters of the respondents (77.4 %) needed assistance from a friend or family member during their bout with pneumonia and a majority of respondents (83.6 %) were satisfied with the care they received from their doctors across the course of their illness. Conclusions: This study systematically assessed CAP symptoms and their impacts using the CAP-BIQ, a questionnaire with established content validity. At CAP diagnosis, the range of patient-reported symptoms was broader than previous studies have reported. Additionally, the overwhelming need for caregiver assistance demonstrates the burden this illness places on older adults. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880120348,1,1,0,

However, 76% of these adults do not have hearing aids or other management. The impact of this unmet need can be substantial and has been linked to depression, social isolation, employment problems, loss of independence, and dementia. This article explores how hearing screening-universal, targeted, or opportunistic-can address prevalent, incident, and future needs for hearing services as well as better define the extent of need. Method: Adults age ≥60 years living at home in England took part in a health survey, part of which was to determine the extent of need for hearing services in this population. Survey methods included a face-to-face interview and hearing screening using pure tones as well as a self-report questionnaire on other health issues. Results: The survey highlighted additional hearing-related factors that will enable referral decisions in primary care to be made with reasonable confidence that patients will use hearing aids and benefit from them. Some relevant nonhearing factors are also reported. Conclusion: There is a growing aging population with increasing needs and expectations for hearing services.

Objective: To understand how individuals across 3 generations (young, middle-aged, and older) think about the design and use of collaborative health and wellness management technologies and what roles these could take in their lives. Methods: Face-to-face semistructured interviews, paper prototype systems, and video skits were used to assess how individuals from 3 age cohorts (young: 18-25 years; middle-aged: 35-50 years; and older: ≥65 years) conceptualize the role that health and wellness computing could take in their lives. Results: A total of 21 participants in the 3 age cohorts took part (young: n=7; middle-aged: n=7; and older: n=7). Young adults expected to be able to actively manage the presentation of their health-related information. Middle-aged adults had more nuanced expectations that reflect their engagement with work and other life activities. Older adults questioned the sharing of health information with a larger audience, although they saw the value in 1-way sharing between family members or providing aggregated information. Conclusions: Our findings inform our suggestions for improving the design of future collaborative health and wellness applications that target specific age groups. We recommend that collaborative ICT health applications targeting young adults should integrate with existing social networking sites, whereas those targeting middle-aged and older adults should support small social networks that rely on intimate personal relationships. Systems that target middle-aged adults should support episodic needs, such as time-sensitive, perhaps intermittent, goal setting. They should also have a low barrier to entry, allowing individuals who do not normally engage with the Internet to participate with the application for the specific purposes of health engagement. Collaborative ICT health applications targeting older adults should allow discreet 1-way sharing, and also support sharing of information in aggregate with others' data. These systems should also provide mechanisms to preselect recipients of different kinds of data, or to easily direct specific information to individuals in real time.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878702558,1,0,0,

Mainly during June, July, August and September, Grey Nomads frequent the northern half of Australia, to escape the colder climate of southern Australia. The term Grey Nomad is applied to the section of the older Australian population who use their retirement years as a time to experience travel once freed from the constraints of work and family commitments. This paper draws on research conducted about the health and social needs of Grey Nomads holidaying in a Central Queensland, Australia, coastal location. Open-ended, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 20 participants. Contingency plans concerning wellness, wellbeing and medical conditions all formed a part of the Grey Nomads' daily existence while travelling. Many important and lasting friendships and social support networks were formed during the journeying and sojourning phases of the travel. Many of the Grey Nomads interviewed felt the need to keep in contact with home, even though they willingly chose to leave it, and to be 'away'. Just as the Grey Nomad cohort have concerns and solutions about their health and related issues, so too, they have concerns for social networks and family connectedness while travelling in Australia.

These photos produced a backlash of abuse of the then fifty-year-old Madonna from music fans and can be situated in a wider online discursive sphere of brutal and offensive critique of Madonna's ageing body and femininity in social networking sites such as Facebook, for example. While longevity, experience and wisdom ensure that Madonna continues to be meaningful to nostalgic and new audiences alike, these attributes slide out of view as the focus remains upon her body, its femininity and its ability to pass in a youth-centred popular music culture. In the wider context of a cultural, political and industry debate around the practice of releasing pre-and post-airbrushed images, the leaked photos are instrumental (albeit unintentionally) for interrogating the relationship between media and authentic ageing female bodies.

Dormant ties, as distinguished from those that are merely inactive, are those that were once operational, but which have lapsed under the stressors of time, distance and circumstance, such as relationships between former college friends, neighbors or work colleagues. Reconnection is the process by which these dormant ties become active again, and is an activity which is supported in unique ways by internet communication technologies. This study presents findings from interviews with midlife adults on how the use of email, social network sites and search engines is leveraged to enhance and support the reconnection of dormant relationships and maintain weak ties. Grounded in a life course perspective, it examines how the experiences of longevity and the life course alter perceptions of the attributes and drawbacks that these technologies offer. By examining adults at midlife, a less-well studied group than teens and young adults, this work provides a more nuanced perspective of the technological practices at varied points in life, and offers insight on how various communication technologies might be utilized at different life stages. © 2013 Copyright Kelly Quinn.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875950348,0,0,0,

The psychological (bordering on sociological and anthropological) aspects of ""living"" in a virtual ""world,"" such as Second Life, are described. Opportunities and threats of those aspects regarding the possibilities of strengthening the personal network and quality of life are indicated. The chapter is based on a 5-year research project. The concrete outcome of which is translated into real life projects under the name VayaV. VayaV is described in this chapter as a case study. The Dutch municipalities all agree that the main social problems facing their citizens are exclusion, feeling lonely, passivity, and lack of friends and an adequate personal social network. In the latest figures, more than a third of the people who were interviewed (a cross section of the whole Dutch population) said: I am often lonely and I am suffering because of it. With their consent, a virtual environment is developed based on the research project in Second Life, in such a way that people who do not like computers and know nothing about digital social networks can meet and have fun and form a community of friends and acquaintances. In this case, there is more to the VayaV approach than playing a game in which someone has set the rules and goals for you. It is more like everyday life where people set their own goals and rules, according to their own values and norms. © 2013 by IGI Global.

This study aimed to explore (i) primary care (PC) patients' perceptions of links between their physical condition and mental health, (ii) their experiences of living with depression and CHD and (iii) their own self-help strategies and attitudes to current PC interventions for depression. Method. Qualitative study using consecutive sampling, in-depth interviews and thematic analysis using a process of constant comparison. 30 participants from the UPBEAT-UK cohort study, with CHD and symptoms of depression. All participants were registered on the General Practitioner (GP) primary care, coronary register. Results: A personal and social story of loss underpinned participants' accounts of their lives, both before and after their experience of having CHD. This theme included two interrelated domains: interpersonal loss and loss centred upon health/control issues. Strong links were made between CHD and depression by men who felt emasculated by CHD. Weaker links were made by participants who had experienced distressing life events such as divorce and bereavement or were living with additional chronic health conditions (i.e. multimorbidity). Participants also felt 'depressed' by the 'medicalisation' of their lives, loneliness and the experience of ageing and ill health. Just under half the sample had consulted their GP about their low mood and participants were somewhat ambivalent about accessing primary care interventions for depression believing the GP would not be able to help them with complex health and social issues. Talking therapies and interventions providing the opportunity for social interaction, support and exercise, such as Cardiac Rehabilitation, were thought to be helpful whereas anti-depressants were not favoured. Conclusions: The experiences and needs of patients with CHD and depression are diverse and include psycho-social issues involving interpersonal and health/control losses. In view of the varying social and health needs of patients with CHD and depression the adoption of a holistic, case management approach to care is recommended together with personalised support providing the opportunity for patients to develop and achieve life and health goals, where appropriate. © 2013 Simmonds et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875013737,1,0,0,

In a three-month trial, the MonAMI technology was installed in the homes of older people with various needs, in the cities of Stockholm, Sweden; Zaragoza, Spain; and Kosice, Slovakia. Evaluation criteria and instrumentation were developed to assess the effects of the services on users' perceived QOL in the domains of independence, physical health, psychological wellbeing, social networking, and physical environment. A total of 62 users, with a mean age of 79 years, participated in the trial. Results demonstrate that the MonAMI services had some positive, significant effects on users' QOL. For instance, users with a higher number of disabilities at baseline reported greater confidence in keeping intruders from entering their home compared to users with fewer disabilities (OR=2.51, 0.01 p<0.05). However, overall findings show that healthier, more independent users perceived more benefits from the services compared to users who report more health problems and are less independent. The complexities of conducting the MonAMI trial led to a small, heterogeneous sample of users over a short time span. This in turn created difficulties in observing the potential effects of the services and achieving significance on some indicators of QOL. This paper provides quantitative analyses around the impact of telecare services; suggests important directions for further research; and highlights the methodological challenges of evaluating ICT-based care services in a community setting. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Considered by many governments as important contributors to national science and innovation agendas, as well as potential members of an educated labour force, several states have implemented strategic regulatory changes to encourage foreign (post)graduate students in these fields to remain after their studies. However, these policies tend to frame such students as free agents able to respond to easing work permit or residency conditions in line with their individual career or lifestyle preferences. This paper advances theorisations of post-graduation decision making among international students by illustrating the extent to which diverse transnational social ties and personal concerns are highly influential in shaping migration and career strategies. Drawing on in-depth interviews with foreign students completing science and engineering (post)graduate degrees in London, UK and Toronto, Canada, the paper demonstrates that relationship considerations, such as care for ageing parents, managing dual careers, and future childcare and work-life balance concerns, are tightly intermingled with graduates' different employment and settlement considerations at this transitional life-stage.

Patients and method: This cross-sectional study comprised 120 DM1 consecutive patients. The following scales were used: Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Muscular Impairment Rating Scale (MIRS), battery of neuropsychological tests, acceptance of illness scale (AIS), Hamilton rating scale for depression (Ham-D), Krupp's Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Daytime Sleepiness Scale (DSS) and SF-36 questionnaire. Results: HRQoL was impaired in DM1 patients in both physical and mental domains (PCS was 41.8 ± 23.5, MCS 47.0 ± 24.3 and total SF-36 score 45.6 ± 24.0). The most significant factors correlating with better SF-36 total score were younger age (β = -0.45, p &lt; 0.001), shorter duration of disease (β = -0.27, p = 0.001), higher education (β = 0.20, p = 0.009), less severe muscular weakness (β = -0.52, p &lt; 0.001), normal swallowing (β = 0.22, p = 0.005), absence of fainting (β = 0.31, p = 0.002), absence of snoring (β = 0.21, p = 0.036), better acceptance of disease (β = -0.17, p = 0.036), lower depressiveness (β = -0.46, p = 0.001), lower fatigue (β = -0.32, p = 0.001), absence of cataract (β = -0.21, p = 0.034), absence of kyphosis (β = 0.31, p = 0.004) and absence of constipation (β = 0.24, p = 0.016). Second linear regression analysis revealed that depressed (β = -0.38, p &lt; 0.001) and elder patients (β = -0.27, p = 0.007) and as well as those with poor acceptance of illness (β = -0.21, p = 0.006) were in especially higher risk of having poor HRQoL (R2 = 0.68). Conclusion: We identified different central, social, muscular, cardiorespiratory and other factors correlating with HRQoL. It is of great importance that most of these factors are amenable to treatment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873720818,1,0,0,

With the increased use of mobile technologies among older adults, mobile tools may be an effective method to deliver PA promotion programs for OCS. Objective: To document the process of designing an OCS-friendly mobile-enabled Web application of PA promotion program. Methods: Mixed methods encompassing group discussions, individual interviews, and brief surveys with community leaders, OCS, cancer care providers, and software professionals were used in this formative research. Results: The varied stakeholders welcomed the idea of developing an online tool to promote PA in OCS. Our formative research revealed several major barriers to regular PA including limited access to senior-friendly PA resources, lack of motivation and social support, and insufficient knowledge and skills on building safe and appropriate workout plans. This feedback was incorporated into the development of iCanFit, a mobile-enabled Web application, designed specifically for OCS. The iCanFit online tools allow users to locate PA resources, set and track goals for PA, network with peer OCS in a secure online space, and receive practical and evidence-informed healthy tips.

A more in-depth understanding of the needs, preferences and social and technical dispositions of the pre-elderly (late 40s and 50s) would provide an enhanced perspective regarding the usability of smart environments. The pre-elderly would have different characteristics from those who are elderly at present. They are more skilled than the present-day elderly at using information technologies such as email, social networking services and smart phones. As they continue to age, the pre-elderly will need environments equipped with smart technologies for use in self-development and professional work. This is especially the case, as it is anticipated that the elderly of the future will have high levels of health and activity. This study involved intensive interviews with several double-income couples in their 40s. The couples' future desires and requirements for enabling technologies and smart home workspaces were identified.

Older adults who are not adopting SNSs might however feel like outsiders within their own families who increasingly rely on these services to socialize. Previous research has shown that situated displays can provide appropriate interfaces for older adults to use digital services. In this paper we explore how situated displays can intuitively provide ambient awareness to strengthen the family social network of older adults. We designed and developed Tlatoque, a situated display, to seamlessly integrate older adults into the SNS used by their relatives. The results of a 21-week deployment study of an initial version of Tlatoque in one extended family showed that the older adult became more conscious of relatives' activities, which also enriched in-person encounters. However, relatives expected the older adult to reply to their posts in the SNS and Tlatoque lacked mechanisms for the older adult to provide feedback. We re-designed Tlatoque to incorporate means for enabling the older adult to share information back to the SNS. We conducted a second 21-week deployment study with another extended family to evaluate the use of this new version of the system. Our results indicate that the second design was successful in providing ambient awareness to the older adult as well as to her relatives. We conclude that situated displays that provide SNS services can assist the integration of older adults to their social network and contribute to enhance asymmetric relations between the older adult and younger relatives. © 2012 Springer.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879502094,0,1,1,

In 2010 it was estimated that Americans spent a quarter of their online time using social networking sites (SNSs) and blogs. Prior studies have shown how people spend more time socializing through digital communication services such as SNSs reducing face- to-face interaction. Individuals limited offline interactions cause a sense of self-perception of being less socially involved. In this paper we explore how the use of an ubiquitous system we developed. Tlatoque is able to adapt and move the SNS's social capital outside the desktop into a domestic setting to support older adults' off line interactions with their family. The findings of a 21 week deployment study uncovered the offline practices surrounding the use of Tlatoque and its social implications toward the existing family ties (n = 30). Results qualitatively indicate that the content shared in SNSs strengthens older adults' social network by enriching and complementing traditional social engagements such as those conducted over the phone or in-person. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.,Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84886426157,0,1,1,

Participation in online communities that are dedicated to older adults is a significant trend in elders' use of the Internet. The present study aimed to explore the audience of these communities and to discover possible subsegments within that audience and the differences among them.Methods. The study was based on an online survey of 218 members of 16 English language-based seniors' online communities.Results. Analysis demonstrated that the audience of the communities is not homogeneous, as 3 segments of community members were identified: information swappers, aging-oriented, and socializers. These groups differed in their interests, background characteristics, and participation patterns. In addition, results indicated significant differences between the groups in perceived benefits. The socializers were those who reported the highest level of gratification. The aging-oriented reported more ""companionship"" than the information swappers, and the latter reported more ""joyfulness"" than the aging-oriented.Conclusions. The results suggested that members of seniors' online communities actively select community contents that best meet their psychosocial needs and use the communities interchangeably with other media and activities. Such purposeful use of the communities becomes an integral part of the strategies they utilize in order to cope with later life circumstances. © 2013 © The Author 2013.

In this study, the authors examined and compared the extent to which AYAs treated in pediatric or adult oncology settings reported use of, and unmet need for, psychosocial support services. Methods: Within 4 months of initial cancer diagnosis, 215 AYAs ages 14 to 39 years (99 from pediatric care settings and 116 from adult care settings; 75% response rate) were assessed for reporting use of information resources, emotional support services, and practical support services. Statistical analyses derived odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for service use and unmet needs after controlling for race, employment/school status, sex, relationship status, severity of cancer, treatment, and treatment-related side effects. Results: AYAs ages 20 to 29 years were significantly less likely than teens and older patients ages 30 to 39 years to report using professional mental health services and were significantly more likely to report an unmet need with regard to cancer information, infertility information, and diet/nutrition information. Compared with teens who were treated in pediatric facilities, AYAs who were treated in adult facilities were more likely to report an unmet need for age-appropriate Internet sites, professional mental health services, camp/retreats programs, transportation assistance, and complementary and alternative health services.

In the late stages of a terminal illness, we may come to underestimate the desirability of a high-functioning life. Increases in the availability of life-extending technology may make it difficult to perceive value in the normal experience of aging. However, health opportunities are not the only circumstantial factors that stand to influence our end of life choices. End of life decisions call up questions about what we believe death is, how we want others to see us, and what we think we deserve from them – among other deep questions about value. Biological limitations and the availability of medical technologies are not the only types of external factors that influence our views about these questions of value. Our individual answers to such questions are related to the religious views to which we have been exposed, the strength of our familial and social ties, the occupational and other life opportunities that our society has made available to us, and the views our society has promoted about our worth and the worth of people like us. A lifetime of social limitations (and/or opportunities) has shaped the perspective from which any of us decides whether to pursue lifeprolonging treatment, palliative care, or death. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Book Chapter,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019668472,0,0,0,

Today sixty-year-old person - if not affected by any serious health handicap - is still a person full of energy, power and, yet, mature and experienced enough to handle regular work tasks as well as unpredictable situations not possible to manage only by a routine approach. (Jenšík, 2013) Currently, the Age Management Concept, i.e. personnel management considering age and changing skills of employees within organisation, starts to be applied and implemented to some extent within the human resources management area. Thus, the organisation management, within this concept, should approach to every single employee differently, understand their individual needs, support their continuous growth or development, and, on the other hand, accept their limits or weaknesses. These weaknesses should be minimised or removed completely in the employee - organisation management mutual synergy. It is, thus, obvious that each employee shall have other positives and other negatives not only regarding the gender, work performance or position, but also with regard to the biological age. In this context, Vortelová (2013) presents the research of Manpower conducted in 2007 and focused on individual generations of employees from the perspective of social categories for the area of human resources management. It involves five generations of employees in total where one generation is limited by the duration approximately of 15 years. It concerns the generation of Pre- Boomers: employees born before 1946, and further the generation of Baby Boomers: employees born within the years from 1947 to 1960. The third generation is the X Generation: employees born during the years from 1961 to 1975. Typical for this generation is that the people are willing to work hard, they have distinctive individualistic features, money means value for them, and they strive not to run into debts, they make clear decisions between their family and career, and have rather pessimistic view of the world. The third generation is called Y Generation: employees born during the years from 1976 to 1990. This generation only sees money as a mean and willingly run into debts, requires good remuneration for work, willingly changes working places and, usually, does not seek any sense in the job, and requires more flexible working hours. The fifth generation is indicated as Z Generation: employees born during the years from 1991 to 2005. This youngest generation is highly interconnected and globalised, is constantly online, and uses advanced means of communication and technology. Pillinger (2008) or Polčáková (2011) define the Age Management Concept as a complex approach leading to the solution of demographic changes at the work place, supporting age diversity and management of work processes within the physical and social environment. The article offers a view to some of the partial results of quantitative and qualitative research conducted within the author's doctoral thesis focused on specific aspects of personnel management of employees of the age category 50+ in conditions of Czech and Slovak organisations and, further, of TACR (Technology Agency of the Czech Republic) grant project, OMEGA Programme to support applied social-science research and experimental development, registration No. TD010129, Performance Potential of Employees 50+, and specific forms of companies' human resources management. The main purpose of the article is to initiate discussion over the Age Management Concept or philosophy itself. Does, therefore, the personnel management considering the age and changing skills of organisation employees mean an opportunity or, on the contrary, a threat for the complex operation of the whole organisation?.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84905105899,0,0,0,50+

Digital watermarking is commonly used as a protection mechanism for files posted on the Internet. In recent years, the launching of social networking websites has highlighted the importance of looking into digital content security. In this study, the characteristics of digital watermarking and the influencing factors of digital rights management were used to analyze digital content providers' needs for managing digital rights. The results showed that value, share, protection, and management are four factors that can be used to analyze a digital content provider's requirements. Furthermore, it was found that digital content providers give importance to the management of the content that they share; and when they share contents online, they want to prevent illegal attacks. Different providers were then analyzed, and it was found that the female respondents often share digital content, so they need digital protection more than the male respondents.

In this paper, we present BeWell+ the next generation of the BeWell smartphone health app, which continuously monitors user behavior along three distinct health dimensions, namely sleep, physical activity, and social interaction. BeWell promotes improved behavioral patterns via feedback rendered as an ambient display on the smartphone's wallpaper. With BeWell+, we introduce new wellbeing mechanisms to address challenges identified during the initial deployment of the BeWell app; specifically, (i) community adaptive wellbeing feedback, which automatically generalize to diverse user communities (e.g., elderly, young adults, children) by balancing the need to promote better behavior yet remains realistic to the user's goals; and, (ii) wellbeing adaptive energy allocation, which prioritizes monitoring fidelity and feedback responsiveness on specific health dimensions of wellbeing (e.g., social interaction) where the user needs most help. We evaluate the performance of these mechanisms as part of an initial deployment and user study that includes 27 people using BeWell+ over a 19 day field trial.

We suggest that independence is a complex and fuzzy notion that is best thought of as a qualitative multiplicity and as an unstable achievement fabricated out of dependencies on bodies, technologies, infrastructures, social networks and other elements. Yet we also find that the study participants understand independent mobility as avoiding lifts provided by next of kin, friends or others for getting around. This is tied to the enactment of particular forms of embodiment and ageist subject positions for older people and implies that older adults are inadvertently complicit in the perpetuation of the connotations of dependency in later life with passivity, burden and undesirability. To counteract these tendencies, we end this paper by elaborating more inclusive and broader conceptualisations of dependence, independence and independent mobility in later life. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868690859,0,1,0,

This study aimed to find key factors influencing the development of Orange Technology Game (OTG) by introducing technology acceptance model (TAM) analysis. The results show that providing more recreational experiences (RE) and enhancing game induced self-efficacy (GISE) are two key factors, in which, memory improvement, social contact and self-learning are identified for RE, and perceived enjoyment, emotional stability and knowledge exchange are identified for GISE. Moreover, a hypothesis for seniors' TAM is proposed as that GISE will mediate RE to influence seniors' happiness & mental wellness along three identified dimensions of ""mental health care"", ""social relationships"" and ""leisure atisfaction"".

Informal caregivers can help older adults make a successful recovery by encouraging them to adhere to the therapy plans and improve their health behaviors. Few resources, however, are available for these caregivers to learn about how to assist their care receivers and cope with their unique caregiving situations. Objective: The study aims were to develop a comprehensive theory-based online hip fracture resource center (OHRC) for caregivers, Caring for Caregivers, and conducted a feasibility trial. Methods: The OHRC included self-learning modules, discussion boards, Ask the Experts, and a virtual library. The feasibility of the intervention was assessed by usage and usability. The feasibility of the future trial was tested using a one-group pre-post design on 36 caregiver-care receiver dyads recruited from six hospitals. The caregivers used the OHRC for 8 weeks. The impact of the intervention was assessed on both caregivers (primary) and care receivers (secondary). The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, paired t tests, and content analyses. Results: On average, caregivers reviewed five modules and used the discussion board 3.1 times. The mean perceived usability score for the OHRC was 74.04 ± 7.26 (range, 12-84). Exposure to the OHRC significantly improved caregivers' knowledge about the care of hip fracture patients (t = 3.17, p = .004) and eHealth literacy (t = 2.43, p = .002). Changes in other caregiver outcomes (e.g., strain, coping, and social support) and care receiver outcomes (e.g., self-efficacy for exercise and osteoporosis medication adherence) were favorable but not significant. Discussion: The findings suggest that the OHRC was user-friendly and could be beneficial for caregivers.

However, previous studies have not examined the relationship between daily activities and brain atrophy in older adults. This study aimed to explore what kind of daily activities were associated with atrophy of the medial temporal area including the entorhinal cortex (MTA-ERC) in older adults. Methods: In total, 122 older adults (aged 65 and over) with subjective memory complaints or a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5 underwent magnetic resonance imaging, and MTA-ERC atrophy was assessed by the voxel- based morphometry method. Based on magnetic resonance imaging data, the subjects were divided into atrophy and non-atrophy groups. Daily activities were assessed using a 20-item questionnaire (e.g., instrumental activities of daily living, social activities), and we compared activity participation between the groups. Results: The atrophy group (n=37) showed significantly lower participation in 4 out of 20 activity items (cleaning, intellectual activity, culture lessons, and using a personal computer) than the non-atrophy group (n=85).

Extending this technique to the assessment of chronic diseases, mixing quantitative and qualitative data appear to be a promising alternative to classical methods. Elderly depression reveals an important source of comorbidities. Yet, the intertwined relationship between late-life events and the social support of the elderly person remains difficult to capture. We illustrate the usefulness of RBM in modeling chronic diseases using the example of elderly depression in Belgium. Methods: We defined a conceptual framework of interactions between late-life events and social support impacting elderly depression. This conceptual framework was underpinned by experts' opinions elicited through a questionnaire. Several scenarios were implemented successively to better mimic the real population, and to explore a treatment effect and a socio-economic distinction. The simulated patterns of depression by age were compared with empirical patterns retrieved from the Belgian Health Interview Survey. Results: Simulations were run using different groupings of experts' opinions on the parameters. The results indicate that the conceptual framework can reflect a realistic evolution of the prevalence of depression. Indeed, simulations combining the opinions of well-selected experts and a treatment effect showed no significant difference with the empirical pattern. Conclusions: Our conceptual framework together with a quantification of parameters through elicited expert opinions improves the insights into possible dynamics driving elderly depression. While RBM does not require high-level skill in mathematics or computer programming, the whole implementation process provides a powerful tool to learn about complex chronic diseases, combining advantages of both quantitative and qualitative approaches. © 2012 Chiêm et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865446782,1,0,0,

Method: The BrightArm adjusted arm gravity loading through table tilting. Patients wore an arm support that sensed grasp strength and communicated wirelessly with a personal computer. Games were written to improve cognitive, psychosocial and the upper extremity motor function and adapted automatically to each patient. The system underwent feasibility trials spanning 6 weeks. Participants were evaluated pre-therapy, post-therapy, and at 6 weeks follow-up using standardized clinical measures. Computerized measures of supported arm reach and game performance were stored on a remote server. Results: Five participants had clinically significant improvements in their active range of shoulder movement, shoulder strength, grasp strength, and their ability to focus. Several participants demonstrated substantially higher arm function (measured with the Fugl-Meyer test) and two were less-depressed (measured with the Becks Depression Inventory, Second Edition). The BrightArm technology was well-accepted by the participants, who gave it an overall subjective rating of 4.1 on a 5 point Likert scale. Conclusions: Given these preliminary findings, it will be beneficial to evaluate the BrightArm through controlled clinical trials and to investigate its application to other clinical populations. © 2012 Informa UK, Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861369261,1,maybe,1,

Transition to disability retirement is based on ill-health, but working conditions are also of relevance. We examined the contributions of work arrangements, physical working conditions and psychosocial working conditions to subsequent disability retirement. Methods: The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort on employees of the City of Helsinki, Finland. Information on working conditions was obtained from the baseline surveys conducted in 2000, 2001 and 2002. These data were linked with register data on disability retirement and their main diagnoses obtained from the Finnish Centre for Pensions. Follow up by the end of 2008 yielded 525 disability retirement events. The analysed data included 6525 participants and 525 disability retirement events. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated from Cox regression analysis. Results: Several working conditions showed own associations with disability retirement before adjustment. After adjustment for all working conditions, the primary risk factors for all-cause disability retirement were physical workload among women (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.57-2.59) and men (HR 2.00, 95% CI 1.18-3.38), and low job control among women (HR 1.60, 95% CI 1.29-1.99). In addition, for disability retirement due to musculoskeletal causes, the risk factors were physical workload and low job control. For disability retirement due to mental causes the risk factors were computer work and low job control. Furthermore, occupational class was a risk factor for disability retirement due to all causes and musculoskeletal diseases. Conclusions: Among various working conditions, those that are physically demanding and those that imply low job control are potential risk factors for disability retirement. Improving the physical working environment and enhancing control over ones job is likely to help prevent early retirement due to disability. © 2012 Lahelma et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862203591,1,maybe,0,

Reducing avoidable use of expensive secondary care services, especially high cost admissions where no procedure is carried out, has become a focus for the commissioners of healthcare. Method. We set out to identify, evaluate and share learning about interventions to reduce avoidable hospital admission across a regional Academic Health and Social Care Network (AHSN). We conducted a service evaluation identifying initiatives that had taken place across the AHSN. This comprised a literature review, case studies, and two workshops. Results: We identified three types of intervention: pre-hospital; within the emergency department (ED); and post-admission evaluation of appropriateness. Pre-hospital interventions included the use of predictive modelling tools (PARR - Patients at risk of readmission and ACG - Adjusted Clinical Groups) sometimes supported by community matrons or virtual wards. GP-advisers and outreach nurses were employed within the ED. The principal post-hoc interventions were the audit of records in primary care or the application of the Appropriateness Evaluation Protocol (AEP) within the admission ward. Overall there was a shortage of independent evaluation and limited evidence that each intervention had an impact on rates of admission. Conclusions: Despite the frequency and cost of emergency admission there has been little independent evaluation of interventions to reduce avoidable admission. Commissioners of healthcare should consider interventions at all stages of the admission pathway, including regular audit, to ensure admission thresholds dont change. © 2012 Woodhams et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84861948544,1,0,0,

Furthermore differences in communication medium and frequency in regard to age, content, hierarchy position, departmental thresholds and company size need to be analyzed. For analysis purposes both qualitative and quantitative research methods were applied. Strong effects of age and communication content were found in survey with 194 participants. © 2012 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859859364,0,0,0,

The subjects were 1 man and 51 women going to a dance studio in Yokohama City. The results showed that although they had some interest in SNS, they did not have much knowledge of the service. Therefore we conducted another investigation into needs for general SNS functions using a questionnaire. The subjects were dance trainees and staff of a junior high school and a high school, totaling approximately 100 persons. Furthermore we asked 229 students of a junior high school and a high school the same questions. The analysis of the results revealed that younger people's needs are clearly different from older people's. We found out that to meet the older people's needs it is necessary to communicate using ones' real names like world-famous Facebook, not Japanese mixi type services, and expand the functions according to each person's needs.

In this article, we review three recently completed studies that evaluated technologies for personal memories intended for persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In the first study, we worked with 12 participants with AD or MCI and their families to construct DVD-based Multimedia Biographies that depicted prominent events, people, and places from the participant's past. We then evaluated over a period of 6 months psychosocial effects that viewing the biographies had on the participants and their family members. These effects included stimulating reminiscence of past events, triggering predominantly positive emotions of happiness and occasional moments of sadness, and engaging conversations with family members. In our second study, we designed a home-based ambient display that allowed a man with AD to similarly review his past life, in combination with recent photos automatically captured by a lifelogging device called SenseCam. Psychometric tests and semistructured interviews revealed how the intervention appeared to improve the participant's sense of self and lower apathy. In our final study of 5 cognitively impaired participants we compared representations of recent experiences captured with SenseCam in 3 ways: with the raw image stream, with a slide show consisting of a selected number of SenseCam images narrated by a family member, and with a control reviewing no images. Results included evidence that reviewing SenseCam images improved episodic recall for personal events depicted in the images for 4 of the 5 participants. Based on lessons learned from this research, we suggest that personal memory technologies should not just be framed as systems for augmenting an individual user's capacity for accurate recall of personal events, but instead should support groups of people such as members of a family in telling their life stories. This conception yields benefits beyond the support of memory, such as fostering a sense of self and strengthening interpersonal relationships with family members. We conclude the article by presenting design considerations to help guide and inform the development and evaluation of future personal memory technologies. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859919898,0,maybe,maybe,

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between a range of biopsychosocial measures and self-reported health in a sample of community-dwelling older people living in Dublin. Method: A total of 492 participants with a mean age of 72.5 (SD=7.34) were assessed at the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) clinic, a comprehensive geriatric assessment facility in St James's Hospital, Dublin, using standardised measures of medical morbidity, personality, functional status, depression, anxiety, perceived stress, cognition, loneliness and social support. The relationship between self-rated health and health measures was analysed using bivariate correlations and backward multiple regression. Indirect pathways of effects on perceived health were evaluated using bootstrapping mediation analysis. Results: Self-rated health was best predicted by instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), Charlson Co-morbidity Index (CCI), extraversion and perceived stress. The effects of cognition and social support from friends on self-rated health were found to be mediated by elements of these identified factors. Conclusion: Self-rated health is not simply the absence of physical illness but is also strongly influenced by the degree of functional impairment, personality factors and the level of stress experienced by the older person. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859734163,1,1,0,

This paper seeks to explore the lived experiences of older people in cold weather with a view to informing fuel poverty policy and service responses. Design/methodology/approach - A postal and online survey utilising an opportunistic sample of older people living in Ireland and linked with a range of services/community and voluntary groups was undertaken in January-April 2011. Data on the experiences of 722 older people in the cold weather of winter 2010/2011 were analysed in the context of socio-economic, health, and housing circumstances. Findings - During the period of extreme cold weather half of the sample reported that they went without other household necessities due to the cost of home-heating. In general, 62 per cent of those surveyed worried about the cost of home-heating. Homes considered ""too cold"" were more likely to lack central heating and experience damp/draughts. Staying indoors, keeping the heating on, and eating hot food/drinks were common responses to cold weather but a diverse range of behaviours was observed. Associations were observed between living in a cold home and higher levels of chronic illness, falls and loneliness, and fewer social activities. Research limitations/implications - The sample cannot be considered nationally representative; single occupancy and social housing units were overrepresented. Originality/value - This research found significant associations between living in a cold home/difficulty paying for heating, and aspects of ill-health and social exclusion. While no causal association can be assumed, this phenomenon has implications for policies supporting healthy ageing. Copyright © 2012 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Method: Older people aged between 68 and 93 years and receiving home rehabilitation were interviewed. A qualitative content analysis was performed on the interview text using the predetermined structure of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) environmental domain. The text was linked to the closest ICF category. Results: The results identified environmental facilitators and barriers that influenced activity and participation among older people receiving home rehabilitation. Approaches that provided a facilitative environment were access to assistive products and technologies, alterations to the physical environment, social support and relationships, and adjusted health and social care services. Conclusions: A qualitative study using ICF-listed environmental factors contributed a holistic view of facilitators and barriers in home rehabilitation for older people. Awareness of the importance of the impact of the social environment on activities and participation could improve home rehabilitation services for older people. The study represents an important step towards a holistic approach using the ICF, which aims to enable all health care professionals to describe, plan and evaluate rehabilitation services together with older people across the health and social care sectors.

Uncontrolled chronic pain can manifest constantly and/or intermittently, and can disrupt seniors' ability to plan or to maintain synchronous and scheduled contact with others. Such disruptions can expose seniors to stigma from others who do not understand this illness, social isolation, and a range of challenges to their social autonomy. We present results from an interview study of 27 seniors with chronic pain exploring how they mitigate and manage these disruptions in their lives. Drawing on Goffman's theory of impression management, we found that participants invested significant effort into controlling both the context of interactions and others' expectations, in order to mitigate the potential negative social consequences of disruptions. In performing this work, seniors were selective about what information they revealed to others about their chronic pain and availability. Given such efforts, seniors with chronic pain have unique needs for technologies to support their social interactions. © 2012 ACM.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858178762,0,1,0,

Method: Cross-sectional observational study at the Technology Research for Independent Living (TRIL) Clinic, a comprehensive geriatric assessment facility in St. James's Hospital, Dublin. In this study, 579 participants were given eight primary assessments (Centre for Epidemiological Studies of Depression, Geriatric Adverse Life Events Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, De Jong-Gierveld Scale, Practitioner Assessment of Network Type, Eysenck Personality Inventory, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Lubben Social Network Scale) and a broad range of health and demographic secondary assessments. Principal factor analysis identified the core components relating to psychosocial functioning. Following this, the regression factors of these components were correlated with health outcomes. Results: The first of three components identified accounted for 9.08% of the variance and related to a core internal component of psychological distress. The two other components related to external and physiological functioning, specifically social support networks and sleep. Spearman's Rho correlations indicated significant associations of walking speed, age, Berg Balance Scale and living alone with all three components. Additionally, the core component of psychological distress significantly correlated with the Fried Frailty Index, illness co-morbidity, ADL, IADL and nutrition. Conclusion: These results characterise the variation in psychosocial functioning in older adults and identifies psychological distress as a core facet of psychosocial functioning which has associations with frailty. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855937988,1,maybe,0,

At the same time the product development is coming up to limits of affordability, limits of effectiveness and ethics. The rapid developments in the fields of social robotics and medicine as well as the urgency of the social problem turn AAL into one of the most innovative areas. The objective of this article is to explore the outcomes of interdisciplinary collaboration along the value added change including the fundamental research, product development and user inclusion site of view. The Adaptable Ambient Living ASsistant (ALIAS) project aims to develop a mobile robot system that interacts with elderly users, monitors and provides cognitive assistance in daily life, and promotes social inclusion by creating connections to people and events in the wider world. The function of ALIAS is to keep the elderly users linked to the wide society and in this way to improve their quality of life by combating loneliness and increasing cognitively stimulating activities. ALIAS is embodied by a mobile robot platform with the capacity to monitor, interact with and access information from online services, without manipulation capabilities. ALIAS is not designed to replace human-human contacts, but rather, to enhance and promote these through the proposed wide range of integrated services. By serving as a monitor, a cognitive-prosthetic device and a facilitator of social contacts, the ALIAS system will significantly improve the daily life of elderly people. The ALIAS-project is characterized by a close cooperation of social scientist and engineers. The teams exchange information permanently and an interdisciplinary work of high quality is ensured. There is a permanent feedback between social and technical work packages. The objective is to develop a robot platform that adjusts to the individual wishes and needs of the elderly people. For this purpose the users have been involved at a very early stage of the project. Thus the research Area ""Gender Studies in Science"" has conducted inquiries, workshops and interviews with different user groups (e.g. seniors, relatives, caregivers and care consultants) and has realized a secondary analysis. The results of the investigations are fed back to the technical partners and have been incorporated into the development of the ALIAS platform. To provide technical solutions that are tailored to the requirements of the user groups a close cooperation in the overall project is necessary. That means the research teams also learn from the feedback of users. It is important, that the issues of the project are an inherent part in the work with elderly, of the interdisciplinary work between the teams in the project and also part of the engineering education, because the experiences and the results of ALIAS integrated in the engineering education. At the SEFI conference the very early involvement of different user groups in the development process and the results of the conducted inquiries as well as the technical implementation of the mobile robot platform should be highlighted and discussed with the conference attendees.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939530490,0,maybe,0,

The purpose of the Mobility Outcomes via Information Technologies (MOvIT) project is to optimize the mobility and community participation of older wheelchair users by systematically monitoring patient reported outcomes following a wheelchair prescription using an interactive voice response system (IVRS). One of the challenges in designing computerized automated calls was to maximize the acceptability of the monitoring intervention for middle-aged and older wheelchair users, and to consider the perceptions of the clinicians who provide the intervention. Thus, the phase I objectives of MOvIT were to customize the IVRS monitoring intervention for both groups of users. Main Content. An iterative user-centered design involved end-users during the development process to receive input about perceived usefulness and ease of use. A single investigator presented the IVRS prototype during individual interviews with 7 wheelchair users and 4 healthcare providers identified by 3 rehabilitation centers. To expose a maximum of age-friendly design issues, a majority of WC users were aged >70 years; healthcare providers had experience in geriatrics and wheelchair prescription. The prototype comprised 2 screening calls after wheelchair delivery, a reminder call to make an appointment for servicing, daily electronic notifications to a clinical coordinator listing cases to call back. Each individual tried 4 different IVRS audio scenarios, followed by a semi-structured interview adapted from the After-scenario Questionnaire and Post-Study Systems Usability Questionnaire. Results. The MOvIT questionnaire addresses eight WC-related adverse events: non-use of the WC, presence of pain, skin problem, positioning problem, WC tipping/falls, WC accidents, psychosocial, and mechanical problems. New concepts emerged, the most important being caregiver and psychosocial issues. Moreover, the conceptualization of the environment was simplified. To ensure ease of use, a number of adaptive strategies were implemented in the prototype such as choice of voice, words and expressions, response options, quantity of information in each step, timing of automated calls based on clinical relevance and a realistic callback delay. Conclusion. The involvement of end-users led to fundamental changes to tailor the monitoring IVRS intervention for the older population and to insure fit with clinical practice. Our results highlight the need for support following a WC intervention, especially for older adults who receive no formal rehabilitation program. Acknowledgements.

Dementia is a growing challenge in our aging society. Often, persons close to older people at some point in time sense that 'something is wrong' (long) before dementia is actually diagnosed, but do not know how to act upon it. This may lead to situations where dementia progresses unnoticed, until it escalates, and people need sudden admission to a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the aim of this project was to develop the outlines of an ICT system to effectively register and interpret signs of potential dementia, in order to give proper care long before things get out of hand. Besides relatives, close friends and health care workers, also other persons or organizations that are involved with older persons could play a role in the early detection of dementia. Individual signs often do not elicit a call to action. The combination of signals from several sources into a central digital system might generate a more complete view of an individual's situation. This yielded the following research questions: 1. Who are the important social contacts in the network of older persons that might detect early signs of problems? 2. How do social contacts currently experience and process possible signs of dementia? 3. How do older persons and their social contacts perceive a solution like the one we are envisioning (a kind of 'digital central signaling system')? Methods. The social network of 12 older persons was studied with semi-structured interviews. Furthermore, 12 formal carers, 12 informal carers and eight family carers of persons with dementia were interviewed, in order to map experiences and processing of early signs of dementia. In addition, the attitude toward the envisioned system was studied. In an expert panel of 18 participants the results of the interviews were transformed into recommendations. These were subsequently tested in two focus group sessions with older persons. Results. Family plays a central role, both in the social network of older persons as well as in the early signaling of dementia. All persons involved in this study valued the idea of a dementia signaling system. There is some skepticism with respect to privacy matters among carers. Apart from signaling, there is also a great demand for tailor made information in the pre-diagnostic stage. All involved persons indicate the need for support, but they experience high barriers in taking the first steps and finding the right aid and information. Conclusion. An adaptive information system that also offers signaling possibilities will be more appropriate than an exclusive signaling system. Such a system needs to prevent stigmatization, should be demand driven, focused on empowerment rather than care, and managed by the user. An approach from the welfare perspective might be more successful than a disease-oriented approach. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

Physical exercise may be used to improve mental cognition, physical strength and overall dexterity within the older population. This can enhance health and wellbeing. Walking is cited as the best exercise for persons over 60. We outline the development of a smart garment that allows the wearer to monitor their wellbeing whilst harnessing technology to provide additional safety measures and functionality. Main Content. In order to ascertain the user needs, questionnaires were designed and distributed to a target cohort of 50 hikers (aged 60 or over). These questionnaires elicited user opinions and experiences with walking activities, clothing attire and technology; in addition to examining what users sought from a smart garment. A number of workshops were organized to offer users hands-on experience with appropriate fabrics, textiles and technology. From the feedback received a technology mapping exercise was performed in which viable technologies were mapped onto the requirements elicited. Results. From this user interaction phase, themes were established: safety enhancement, additional functionality, support for monitoring health indicators and increased social interaction. The technology mapping exercise facilitated the development of an initial prototype that used a Smartphone and inbuilt sensors (accelerometer, GPS) to collect and record: location and walking attributes (such as speed, distance and altitude) all of which were fed back on an interactive map. A step count was implemented using the onboard accelerometer, to provide an indication of overall activity level. Further development will harness expertise in clothing manufacturing to create a layering system with the capability of integrating sensors to create a Body Area Network, to monitor and record requested information such as heart rate and (peripheral) body temperature. All this information must be assimilated in a useful and meaningful way. Hence the user interface and interaction methods will be designed appropriate to the age and experience of the target cohort, with elements of personalisation. Conclusion. Feedback from users on the development of a smart garment has influenced the initial prototype. Further technical development will be based on user evaluation of the wearable system. Feedback from these evaluations will be used to add, amend or remove functionality. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862220084,1,1,0,

In an aging society, it is increasingly important to understand how assistive devices can be used by older people to maintain quality of life despite chronic disabilities. Assistive technology is a mainstay of physical therapist practice, but the potential for device use to affect psychosocial well-being is not yet understood at the population level. Objective. The objective of this study was to develop a parsimonious indicator that can be used in population-based surveys to represent the effect of assistive technologies on quality of life for older people, separate from personal assistance. Design. This study was a cross-sectional survey. Methods. The methods used in this study were psychometric scale development and structural equation modeling. Results. The results indicated that a parsimonious, valid, and reliable scale reflecting quality of life related to assistive device use can be created from 3 questions designed to measure improvements in safety, control, and participation due to technology. The findings also suggested that assistive technology may more effectively improve quality of life for people with greater levels of functional limitations. Limitations. The data were derived from a cross-sectional survey conducted by telephone. The use of personal assistance, on average, was low; thus, the applicability to a population with more profound care needs has yet to be confirmed. Conclusions. Determining the broader impact of assistive technology on quality of life with population-level measures may provide insight into how best to leverage technologies to prevent dependence in aging adults. © 2011 American Physical Therapy Association.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-82955164039,1,maybe,0,

In 2035, about 54% of the Dutch population will be over 65 years of age. Loneliness will be a problem in an estimated 30-40% of these elderly. Most elderly prefer care at home and in most cases this is less expensive than institutionalised care. Both client and care provider could benefit from systems using advanced technology to support people at home. CareTV is a technological solution, which allows users to interact with carers, family and friends from their home. In prior research users mentioned that CareTV expanded their social contacts, but it had not been measured if feelings of loneliness as a consequence have decreased. This paper reports on research whether CareTV is a valid instrument for elderly to engage in meaningful social contacts by a video connection to avoid loneliness. Main content of the paper: 130 clients of home care organisation Proteion Thuis participated in this study and were connected to CareTV. Participants included men and women with an average age of 73,8 years. 45 clients terminated their participation during the trial period and were excluded. The CareTV duplex video/voice network allowed clients to communicate 24 hours, 7 days a week with a nurse practitioner. Applications of CareTV are (1) Alarm Service (2) Care Service (3) Good morning/good evening service (4) Welfare and housing and (5) Family Contact. During the one year trial period, feelings of loneliness and safety have been measured using a questionnaire. Social and emotional feelings of loneliness were measured with the validated 11-item loneliness-scale from de Jong-Gierveld. Safety has been measured with a not-validated 9-item scale. In addition, clients' experiences were evaluated in open questions in the survey. Results: The results show that the average feeling of loneliness at group level significantly (p<0,001) decreased from 5,97 to 4,02 (sd 3,91) between start and end of the study on a scale from 0 till 11. Social loneliness (5-items) as well as emotional loneliness (6-items) showed significant decreases. To evaluate safety, no sum score could be calculated, but on item level: for 5 out of 9 items, most clients felt less safe after one year. For one item most clients had improved feelings of safety and for three items, most clients had an equal score. Conclusion: Feelings of loneliness significantly decreased within one year. As loneliness is a problem in an estimated 30-40% of the elderly, CareTV seems to be a suitable instrument for elderly, to live longer at home with less feelings of loneliness. Feelings of safety on item level did not seem to improve, this might be due to the fact that no validated scale was used. On the other hand, comments of individual clients with respect to safety were: 'CareTV makes me feel safe'. In future a study with a validated safety scale should be performed in order to clarify the effect of CareTV on feelings of safety. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press.

Older adults have reported a preference for specific training and text manuals when they learn to use technologies, but no research has systematically examined what is actually used in everyday life. This study examined age and experience differences in the use of external support (knowledge in the world) over a ten day period. Interviews with participants about technology encounters during this period were analyzed. Three categories of knowledge in the world were identified: social support, instruction, and ondevice information. Age differences were found in use of social support and instruction. Age and experience differences were found in use of on-device information. These results confirm the importance of good instructional support for older adults that accommodates age-related declines and differences in specific knowledge. Data also suggest that development of a simple and reliable method for older adults to obtain social support may help low technology older adults to more effectively use everyday technologies and to resolve problems.

Background: British government policy for older people focuses on a vision of active ageing and independent living. In the face of diminishing personal capacities, the use of appropriate home-based technology (HBT) devices could potentially meet a wide range of needs and consequently improve many aspects of older people's quality of life such as physical health, psychosocial well-being, social relationships, and their physical or living environment. This study aimed to examine the use of HBT devices and the correlation between use of such devices and quality of life among older people living in extra-care housing (ECH). Methods. A structured questionnaire was administered for this study. Using purposive sampling 160 older people living in extra-care housing schemes were selected from 23 schemes in England. A face-to-face interview was conducted in each participant's living unit. In order to measure quality of life, the SEIQoL-Adapted and CASP-19 were used. Results: Although most basic appliances and emergency call systems were used in the living units, communally provided facilities such as personal computers, washing machines, and assisted bathing equipment in the schemes were not well utilised. Multiple regression analysis adjusted for confounders including age, sex, marital status, living arrangement and mobility use indicated a coefficient of 1.17 with 95% CI (0.05, 2.29) and p = 0.04 [SEIQoL-Adapted] and 2.83 with 95% CI (1.17, 4.50) and p = 0.001 [CASP-19]. Conclusions: The findings of the present study will be value to those who are developing new form of specialised housing for older people with functional limitations and, in particular, guiding investments in technological aids. The results of the present study also indicate that the home is an essential site for developing residential technologies. © 2011Matlabi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055008432,1,1,0,

Few such studies have employed large sample sizes or have focused on ethnically diverse populations of community-dwelling elders.Method: With a large number of overlapping predictors, zero-order analysis alone is poorly equipped to identify variables that are independently associated with computer use. Accordingly, both zero-order and stepwise logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine the correlates of two types of computer use: e-mail and general computer use.Results: Results indicate that younger age, greater level of education, non-Hispanic ethnicity, behaviorally active coping style, general physical health, and role-related emotional health each independently predicted computer usage.Conclusion: Study findings highlight differences in computer usage, especially in regard to Hispanic ethnicity and specific health and well-being factors.Application: Potential applications of this research include future intervention studies, individualized computer-based activity programming, or customizable software and user interface design for older adults responsive to a variety of personal characteristics and capabilities. © 2011, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053030501,1,1,0,

They do little to motivate patients to change their lifestyle and proactively manage their health. To address these shortcomings, we propose a web-based telehealth system, which uses Web 2.0 technologies in order to add social support and user defined content. In this study, we determine the functional and interface requirements of the system by conducting open individual semi-structured interviews with eight elderly people of age range 60 to 87.

The aim was to study the extent to which older people's lifelong experiences watching TV reduced their uncertainty when faced with TV-based applications. The study examined the factors that explained participants' continued use of the application. The implementation and testing of the system was structured as an iterative design process including conceptual development, a six-month test period in the homes of eleven users with usability tests and interviews, monthly focus groups and information gathered by a back-up function that also provided the users with immediate help with the technology if necessary. The results show that while the use of TV as a metaphor or platform succeeded in getting the older users to try out and use the ippi prototype, it did not contribute primarily to using the ippi on a daily basis during the test period. Rather, participants' access to a social context or a social network determined the extent of usage. There was a difference between what was easy to use in terms of the interface, and what was easy and worth using in a social everyday context on the other. In order to be used, a new product of this type must add value and that value depends upon integration into daily communication.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052275787,0,1,maybe,

The availability of a control cohort of approximately 2000 persons from the general population who complete the same basic questionnaire annually will provide the opportunity to estimate the unique impact of cancer, beyond that of normal ageing and comorbidities. Raw data from the PROFILES registry will be available for non-commercial scientific research, subject to study question, privacy and confidentiality restrictions, and registration (www. profilesregistry.nl). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the long-term efficacy of 2 computer-tailored physical activity interventions for older adults and its psychosocial and environmental mediators. Methods: A clustered randomized controlled trial (N = 1,971) was conducted that included 3 research arms: (a) basic computer-tailored print intervention, targeting psychosocial mediators; (b) environmentally computer-tailored print intervention, targeting psychosocial and environmental mediators; and (c) no-intervention control group. Interventions were developed using the intervention mapping approach and consisted of 3 computer-tailored letters delivered over 4 months. Questionnaires assessed the study outcomes (i.e., total weekly days and total weekly minutes of physical activity) at baseline and 12 months. Potential mediators (i.e., awareness, attitude, self-efficacy, intention, social influence, intrinsic motivation, self-regulation, and perceived environment) were assessed at baseline and at 3 or 6 months. Results: Multilevel regression analyses revealed that both interventions significantly changed total weekly days of physical activity compared with the control group, but only the environmentally computer-tailored print intervention significantly changed weekly minutes of physical activity. Multiple mediation models showed that the effects of both interventions on weekly days of physical activity were mediated by changes in awareness and intention. Conclusions: Computer-tailored interventions were effective in inducing long-term behavioral changes in physical activity behavior of older adults. Awareness and intention were found to be important mediators of changing daily physical activity and should be included in future computer-tailored intervention studies. © 2011 American Psychological Association.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960541226,1,1,1,

Design: A cross-sectional study using convenience sampling. Setting: North Shore City, Auckland, New Zealand. Data collection was carried out by a research nutritionist using computer assisted personal interviewing in the participant's own home. Participants: Fifty-one independently living people aged between 80 and 85 years. Measurement: A survey using three validated questionnaires: Practitioner Assessment of Network Type (PANT) to evaluate social networks; Elderly Assessment System (EASY-Care) to evaluate physical and mental wellbeing and Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition Version II (SCREEN II) to assess nutrition risk. Results: A third of the participants (31%) were at high risk of malnutrition (SCREEN II score <50; range 29-58 out of maximum score of 64). The majority of participants (82%) lived alone and nearly half (47%) had supportive social networks including close relationships with local family, friends and neighbours. Low self-rated health, disability and social factors (being born outside of New Zealand, losing a spouse and loneliness) were key underlying factors associated with being at nutrition risk. Conclusion: Nutrition risk is common among aged individuals living in the community. Health and social factors that shape eating behaviours place older people at increased nutrition risk. Strategies are needed for the early identification of risk factors to prevent nutrition problems.

In addition, use over time may bring about dependence and habituation thus leading older persons to believe they cannotdiscontinue the drug and to experience withdrawal symptoms should its use suddenly cease. The frequency of such negative consequences remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of self-rated addiction among older persons and its associated factors. Face-to-face computer-assisted interviews were conducted in the homes of 2,785 persons aged 65 years and over, randomly selected from across the Province of Quebec, Canada. Of the 707 users of benzodiazepines, 43% considered themselves addicted. They were more likely to be 75 years or over, to suffer from panic disorder, to believe that health professionals are ready and available to discuss emotional problems with them, and to be less than satisfied with their social relationships. This study showed that a large proportion of benzodiazepine users rated themselves as addicted. These findings indicate that it is important for nurses to screen older adults living in the community to identify those who continue to use benzodiazepine beyond the recommended therapeutic time frame, perceive themselves to be dependent, and could potentially benefit from participation in a withdrawal program. © 2011 International Nurses Society on Addictions.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953122837,0,1,0,

Recently, technology, such as telephone networks and the Internet, has received attention in supporting isolated and lonely older people. Despite lack of evidence, telephone befriending has been considered an effective low-level method to decrease loneliness among older people. This study evaluated the impact of a national befriending scheme for isolated and/or lonely older people, involving eight project sites across the UK 2007-2008. The purpose was to assess the impact of different models of telephone-based befriending services on older people's health and well-being. A mixed methods approach was used. This paper reports on the findings from 40 in-depth interviews with older service recipients. The most important finding was that the service helped older people to gain confidence, re-engage with the community and become socially active again. Three topics were identified: why older people valued the service, what impact it had made on their health and well-being and what they wanted from the service. In addition, nine subthemes emerged: life is worth living, gaining a sense of belonging, knowing they had a friend, a healthy mind is a healthy body, the alleviation of loneliness and anxiety, increased self-confidence, ordinary conversation, a trusted and reliable service, the future - giving something back. In conclusion, the findings present in-depth qualitative evidence of the impact of telephone befriending on older people's well-being. Befriending schemes provide low-cost means for socially isolated older people to become more confident and independent and develop a sense of self-respect potentially leading to increased participation and meaningful relationships. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-79751472961,0,maybe,0,

We assessed the feasibility of a wireless mobile device in measuring sociability and physical activity in older adults, and compared results with those of traditional questionnaires. METHODS This pilot observational study was conducted among a convenience sample of 8 men and women aged 65 years or older in a continuing care retirement community. Participants wore a waist-mounted device containing sensors that continuously capture data pertaining to behavior and environment (accelerometer, microphone, barometer, and sensors for temperature, humidity, and light). The sensors measured time spent walking level, up or down an elevation, and stationary (sitting or standing), and time spent speaking with 1 or more other people. The participants also completed 4 questionnaires: the 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36), the Yale Physical Activity Survey (YPAS), the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale, and the Friendship Scale. RESULTS Men spent 21.3% of their time walking and 64.4% stationary. Women spent 20.7% of their time walking and 62.0% stationary. Sensed physical activity was correlated with aggregate YPAS scores (r2 = 0.79, P =.02). Sensed time speaking was positively correlated with the mental component score of the SF-36 (r2 = 0.86, P =.03), and social interaction as assessed with the Friendship Scale (r2 = 0.97, P =.002), and showed a trend toward association with CES-D score (r2 = -0.75, P =.08). In adjusted models, sensed time speaking was associated with SF-36 mental component score (P =.08), social interaction measured with the Friendship Scale (P =.045), and CES-D score (P =.04).

Furthermore, increased social interaction has been shown to have a positive effect on adjustment in institutions for the aged. However, these social connections can be lost due to movement within the care system, with residents regularly relocating for a variety of reasons including cost and medical issues. Eleven health professionals and six residents living in a care home in Ireland were interviewed about their social activities and levels of engagement within the home. Storyboards were then developed and presented to the residents based on these interviews. Findings from the interviews indicate that activity levels among the more cognitively able residents are quite low due to activities catering for the less able residents. Furthermore, a lack of access to information and resources (such as books and newspapers) means that these more able residents reported experiencing long periods of boredom. Technology can potentially allow residents access to such information and resources, enabling them to pursue activities in their personal time which can then also be used as the basis for group discussions. The use of technology could, in addition, allow those residents who had moved out of the home to continue to participate and collaborate in activities with the other residents. © 2010 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-80055091860,0,1,0,focus on elderly

Various studies have concluded either that the new media and technologies are positive integrative aspects of the society or have devastating impacts on different groups. On the one hand, the Internet allows young people to discover new experiences and gain additional often unorthodox knowledge; on the other hand, observers have warned about the segregating effects of new technologies. A „digital divide“ has been opened between privileged users and the underprivileged masses, according to these more cautious voices. This divide has caused social deprivation and disintegration amongst the most vulnerable groups, in particular, older people, economically insecure groups and immigrants. Thus, various media life-styles establish a continuum between a media and information elite on the one end and the entertainment under-class on the other.

Kushkova A.,Female social control in the late soviet village: Comrades? courts as a nexus of official and customary justice (based on field materials from northwestern russia),2010,Everyday Life in Russian History: Quotidian Studies in Honor of Daniel Kaiser,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84900124475&partnerID=40&md5=2f4042f083100ef1cee100f84f760618,"This paper results from our project on rural comrades' courts, a case study based on field materials from northwestern Russia (village of Shola, Belozer-skii district, Vologda region).1 The time frame of the research is the 1960-80s, when Nikita Khrushchev returned to Lenin's ""utopian"" model of political development, also known as the ""withering away of the state."" According to Khrushchev's plan, comrades' courts, ""resurrected"" after several decades of virtual death, were supposed to become the primary institution of teaching the ""wide masses of the working people"" what political participation means, as well as turn into ""conductors"" of Soviet ideology at the grassroots level of society. In reality this meant an effort to introduce yet another form of all-embracing control over all layers of the population. We argue that in spite of this official legitimization, comrades' courts embodied a nexus of official and customary justice where ordinary people could exercise practices of traditional conflict resolution under the guise of legal procedures imposed from above. The gist of the idea of comradely justice is that the role of judges is played by the people who know the offender well-e.g., who work with him/her at the same enterprise or live with the offender in the same house or neighborhood. The aim of comradely justice was not so much to punish as to raise the moral level, not only of the guilty party, but of all members of the Soviet ""collective. "" Public opinion in all of its forms (reprimand, criticism, warning, etc.) was the major sanction of the comrades' court, although it could also impose minor fines. The jurisdiction of comrades' courts changed slightly over time, but generally they were responsible for ""petty offences,"" i.e., something that could be resolved at the lowest level of the justice system. The rural aspect is crucial for our research. The village as a relatively closed social space was and to a large extent still is the principal site of customary law (the concept coined and intensively studied in pre-revolutionary times primarily in reference to rural social relations). The village may be seen as a peculiar legal environment featuring alternative ideas on justice (what is right and wrong, particular sensibilities in respect to certain offences such as breaches of rural moral code, gender differences in relation to various offenses, etc.), specific practices of social control (e.g., ""shaming"" of the perpetrators), and mechanisms of conflict resolution. Certainly, one can not say that rural Russia in the 1960-80s ""resurrected"" practices of informal conflict resolution that existed in the second half of the 19th century However, we assume that there existed something in the structure of rural society itself that allowed these pre-revolutionary customary law institutions to ""lay the groundwork for dispute settlement with informal procedures, drawing upon local custom and mores, and directly involving the community at large in the process.""2 The anthropology of law differentiates between two approaches to description and interpretation. The first one, the rule-centered paradigm, defines social life as ""rule-governed,"" and ""normal behavior"" as ""the product of compliance with established normative precepts."" In the second, the proces-sual paradigm, the ""dynamics of order"" is placed ""in the social process itself,"" in the ""shared networks of relations and reciprocities."" In our research we are emphasizing the second approach, which, according to well-known specialists in the area of law and culture, Austin Sarat and Thomas Kearns, states that ""law shapes society from the inside out, by providing the principal categories that make life seem natural, normal, cohesive, and coherent.""3 This approach to understanding the phenomenon of comrades' courts requires attention to the issue of law and culture because it is a particular configuration of local culture that shapes specific practices of social regulation, creating a ""dynamic synthesis of legal ideas, values, and perspectives, as well as institutions, norms, relationships and acts"" that are collectively called ""customary law.""4 As Robert Post wrote, ""We have long been accustomed to think of law as something apart. The grand ideals of justice, of impartiality and fairness, have seemed to remove law from the ordinary, disordered paths of life.""5 But as Sarat and Kearns observe: ""Thinking about Law in the Domains of Culture requires attention to networks of cultural practices. It requires us to read and interpret those practices to understand how their form and content are constituted by law and also for what they reveal about the meanings of the law itself.6 This is even more so when we speak about customary law, for it never expresses only juridical relations, but is a part of a local culture in general. The comrades' court under discussion is situated in a village where we conducted our field research over the course of almost 10 years and collected a large corpus of materials on local history, everyday life, kinship ties and relations among neighbors, rituals of calendar and life cycle, everyday conflicts, magic, internal communicative practices (gossiping, nicknaming), etc. The two main sources for our research are ""Materials and Decisions of the Comrades' Court of Shola Rural Council"" (1964-82) (henceforth, ""Materials"") and oral interviews with village inhabitants collected in 2001-06. Let us briefly describe ""sociometric factors""7 relevant for our study. Shola is a collective name for seven villages situated in close proximity to each other; the distance from the nearest town of Belozersk is about 100 km, which is a long way considering the quality of the roads. While back in the 1960s Shola's population was about 5,000 people, now it hardly exceeds 2,000. In the 1960s-80s a considerable number of people were engaged in the local collective farm, which, however, gradually ""withered away"" until it was officially closed in early 2006. At that time there were a number of public organizations in the village: apart from three comrades' courts, there was a ""women's council,"" an organization of war veterans, a village club, and a choir. The only one of these still exhibiting some signs of life is the choir. Like many other rural areas of Russia, Shola is almost exclusively an ""all-female world,"" or more precisely, an ""all-old-female world"": most of our informants are elderly widowed women between 55 and 85. Men of younger generations, roughly those around the age of 50, have moved away to district towns and large cities; those who have stayed are mostly socially inept (invalids, drunkards), and live on their mothers' pensions (Bel-06-07. MGI).8 The notion of ""women's world"" as a more internal, private space and thus less penetrable for observation9 is hardly applicable to the village studied. In Shola women occupy both private and public spaces, they work in the local stores, in the hospital, in the old people's home. The project of reviving church life was also undertaken by three elderly women.10 Back in the 1960s-80s women already constituted the majority of the village population; they occupied various public positions and, at the same time, were the center of home life. The last important social parameter to be taken into consideration in our research has to do with the specificity of rural sociability as such. It may be described as the existence of tight networks of connections, based either on kinship ties or on relations among neighbors and acquaintances, not only within Shola itself, but also between Shola and other villages of the area. This network provides for the high degree of ""informational transparency"" of the village social space: ""everybody living in villages knows everything, no matter what"" (Bel-06-04. BLP); ""a village is not a city ... even about those who live 25 kilometers away, even if there are only 20 families living there - all is known about them here"" (Bel-06-02. ZhEN); ""This [when someone was caught stealing] is shame because the whole region will know about it, for relatives live everywhere!"" (Bel-06-13. MNS).11 The notion of ""contextualized person""12 would be very much in place for this village, as compared to the city, where these ties are usually much weaker. Among other things, this total connectedness allows correlating structural and communicative factors of villagers' social communication, including that in the situation of conflict. Since our general assumption is that a discussion of rural comrades' courts should be placed within the local culture of social regulation, we will focus on the following topics: the reasons that people were reluctant to take cases to comrades' courts; pre-judicial means of conflict resolution in the village; and forms of communication within the comrades' courts. Throughout the discussion we will be paying particular attention to gender to illustrate the role of women in rural practices of conflict resolution, of which the comrades' court was a relatively new possibility.

The aim of this chapter is to examine how family members helped to bridge the digital divide by influencing older people's use of the Internet. Our sample includes older people (n=108) from a deprived area of Greater Manchester, UK who have heart problems. Thus, they have much to gain from =virtual mobility' because they may be less likely to have home Internet access or to visit public Internet facilities. On the other hand, since they are likely to have fewer pre-existing online social ties, their initial inclination may be lower. We draw on the qualitative comments from the focus groups we conducted (n=30) alongside a 9-month randomized control trial in addition to comments posted on our project portal. Our study adds to the literature by examining the advantages of home computer and Internet access for those previously without them, while most studies focus on public use or those who already own computers. Further, by focusing on a sample that encounters multiple exclusions (e.g., deprived financially, poor health, older) we can develop a better understanding of the complex nature of the digital divide. Our findings suggest that grandchildren played an important part in the uptake and continued use of their computers for several people. Although some people reported that family relations had some negative influences on their Internet use, most had a positive experience and even developed new common interests with children, grandchildren, siblings and their spouses. We draw on Bourdieu's concept of habitus to understand the role that family had in shaping Internet use. © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This article explores these issues by employing in-depth interviews and explorative usability tests, comparing the experiences and usage of younger and older Facebook users. First, the interviews revealed that Facebook users in all age groups reported more contact with several different groups of people, which reflects different types of social capital (i.e., family, friends, and acquaintances), because of Facebook, but not without consequences for privacy. Having too many Facebook ""friends"" and access to different social capital disrupt the sharing process due to experiences of social surveillance and social control. This social control often forces younger people in particular to use conformity as a strategy when sharing content to maintain their privacy. Further, the interviews revealed different motivations and usage patterns when older and younger users are compared. Second, the usability test found a significant difference between younger and older adults in time completion and task completion related to Facebook settings. Younger users are more skilled in their Facebook usage, whereas adults over the age of 40 have difficulties in understanding the navigation logic and privacy settings. Younger and older adults display completely open public profiles without realizing it.

The aim of this whole design project is to use the methods of ethnography and contextual participatory research to understand the problem space, and then develop a conversational and entertainment social media for elderly people to empower their life. The elderly are often a neglected group in regard to product development and marketing; however, they are the only growing age group in most developed societies. Regarding the report from CEPD, by the year 2016, Taiwan will become an aging society, and it is expected that the aging population will have grown to 35.9% in 2050. Due to the responsibility of a digital media designer/educator, to highly consider the tendencies of an aging society, and ensure a smooth social, entertaining and meaningful life beyond the physiological, geographic and mobility restrictions, it is essential that a conversational and entertainment context for social relationships are available for them so that they may maintain their vigor. The older people get, the more difficult their adoption of technology is likely to be; they are traditionally considered as being resistant to change. Anxiety reaction appears when new technology product designs fail to target the special requirements of aging people. This research adopted the perspectives of anthropological methodology, and closely examined the target users' behaviors and expectations. In an effort to address the issue of offering the elderly a social and casual life, this research focused on the problem and solution search, analyzed explicit and implicit problems, both physical and emotional, and integrated them into a better understanding of current problems and needs. After identifying a set of essential issues related to social activities, entertainment, the usage and adoption of a new digital device and digital social media, this research indicated the direction for bridging the gaps between aging people and a digital social media life: the construction of a helpful framework for an ideal conversational and entertainment model of a social media platform. © 2010 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958547430,0,maybe,0,

FXTAS is a neurodegenerative disease occurring in approximately 45% of elderly male carriers and 8-16% of female carriers of the fragile X mental retardation one premutation. This study investigated the subjective needs of patients with FXTAS and their family caregivers, by utilizing Q-sort methodology. Method: Patients with FXTAS and their caregivers seen during January 2005 to June 2007 participated. The Q-sort was composed of 17 (eight formal and nine informal) items, designed to explore emotional, informational, and instrumental needs of patients with FXTAS and their caregivers. Item scores were generated from 1 = least important to 7 = most important. Analysis included descriptive statistics for all the demographic and outcome variables. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify which of the need domains were perceived as most important by the participants. Results: A total of 24 patients (79% men, mean age 65.6±6.4 years) with FXTAS and 18 caregivers (11% men, mean age 63.6±6.2 years) completed the Q-sort. Both patients and caregivers rated informational needs as most important, followed by emotional and, finally, by instrumental needs.

These services allow communication providers to develop new, added-value services for a wide range of applications such as social networking, elderly care and near-emergency early warning systems. At the core of these services is the ability to detect specific physical settings or the context a user is in, using either internal or external sensors. For example, using built-in accelerometers, it is possible to determine whether a user is walking or running at a specific time of day. By correlating this knowledge with GPS data, it is possible to provide specific information services to users with similar daily routines.

The project was implemented over a three-month period and utilised an in-home, one-on- one education strategy. Six older people aged 69 to 85 years were recruited from a community aged care programme in South Australia. All participants were connected to the internet and provided with one-on-one tutoring in how to use the social networking site. To evaluate the project, data were collected through in-depth interviews with older people at the commencement and completion of the project. An additional interview with the community programme co-ordinator was conducted at the completion of the project. Evaluation was also guided by data collected by the research team via reflective journals. The key findings to emerge from the inductive analysis of the data resulted in four major themes, these were: the participants' experience of loneliness; technology as an enabler; providing a supportive environment; connectivity. A case study is presented to provide in-depth understanding of how social networking can help reduce the participants' experience of loneliness. The findings from this project demonstrated that the utilisation of a social networking site has the potential to reduce loneliness in older people and therefore, based on these findings, recommendations for further research and practice implementation are made.

However, the findings suggest several other possible benefits, which may be available only to online communities. The communities may provide social support, contribute to self-preservation, and serve as an opportunity for self-discovery and growth. Because they offer both leisure activity and an expanded social network, it is suggested that active participation in the communities may contribute to the well-being of older adults.

The purpose was to better understand the psychosocial learning needs of cancer care providers and to use this knowledge to shape continuing education priorities. Respondents' preferred learning formats, access to technology and barriers to accessing psychosocial learning opportunities were also assessed. Cancer care providers including radiation therapists, social workers, dieticians, pharmacists, physicians and nurses in both community and agency settings were surveyed. Two hundred and sixtyseven people completed the survey. Key learning needs identified included cultural aspects of care, symptom management, treating the anxious patient, self-care for the professional, care of elderly patients, basic cancer-related medical issues surrounding care and ethics. Community respondents indicated more needs than agency respondents. On-site training was the most preferred learning format, and time constraints were the biggest barrier to accessing learning opportunities. Participants had access to technology. Next steps include conducting key informant and focus group interviews to determine if interest in a learning need is the same as a relevant knowledge and practice gap. This research suggests that cancer care providers are interested in learning more about the psychosocial issues related to cancer care. © Springer 2010.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956623985,0,0,0,

Purpose The purpose of the study was to conduct in-depth analysis on the long-term efficacy of two tailored physical activity interventions for older adults. Methods A randomized controlled trial (n=1,971) with two computer-tailored interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted. The two tailored interventions consisted of three tailored letters, delivered during 4 months. The basic tailored intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally tailored intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing tailored environmental information. Selfreported behaviors (i.e., total physical activity, transport walking and cycling, leisure walking and cycling, and sports) were measured at baseline and 12 months. Additionally, potential personal, health-related, and psychosocial moderators of the intervention effects were examined. Results The environmentally tailored intervention was effective in changing total physical activity, leisure cycling, and sports compared with the basic intervention and control group. No intervention effects were found for the basic intervention. Moderation analysis revealed that participants with a higher age, lower body mass index, and higher intention were unresponsive to the interventions. Conclusions Providing environmental information is an effective intervention strategy for increasing physical activity behaviors among older adults, especially among certain ""at-risk"" subgroups such as lower educated, overweight, or insufficiently active participants. Moderation analysis was perceived as a promising method for identifying meaningful subgroups that are unaffected by an intervention, which should receive special attention in future interventions. © The Society of Behavioral Medicine 2010.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954562868,1,1,1,

However, the modifying potential of psychosocial stress on the neurotoxicity of lead and their combined relationship to aging-associated decline have not been fully examined. Objectives: We examined the cross-sectional interaction between stress and lead exposure on Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores among 811 participants in the Normative Aging Study, a cohort of older U.S. men. Methods: We used two self-reported measures of stress appraisal-a self-report of stress related to their most severe problem and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Indices of lead exposure were blood lead and bone (tibia and patella) lead. Results: Participants with higher self-reported stress had lower MMSE scores, which were adjusted for age, education, computer experience, English as a first language, smoking, and alcohol intake. In multivariable-adjusted tests for interaction, those with higher PSS scores had a 0.57-point lower (95% confidence interval, -0.90 to 0.24) MMSE score for a 2-fold increase in blood lead than did those with lower PSS scores. In addition, the combination of high PSS scores and high blood lead categories on one or both was associated with a 0.05-0.08 reduction on the MMSE for each year of age compared with those with low PSS score and blood lead level (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Psychological stress had an independent inverse association with cognition and also modified the relationship between lead exposure and cognitive performance among older men.

Physical function is the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and the ability of older adults to reside in the community depends to a large extent on their level of physical function. Multiple physical and health-related variables may differentially affect physical function, but they have not been well characterized. The purpose of this investigation was to identify and examine physical and mental health-related correlates of physical function in a sample of community-dwelling older adults. Methods. Nine hundred and four community dwelling older men (n = 263) and women (n = 641) with a mean (95% Confidence Interval) age of 76.6 (76.1, 77.1) years underwent tests of physical function (Timed Up and Go; TUG), Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated from measured height and weight, and data were collected on self-reported health quality of life (SF-36), falls during the past 6 months, number of medications per day, depression (Geriatric Depression Scale; GDS), social support, and sociodemographic variables. Results. Subjects completed the TUG in 8.7 (8.2, 9.2) seconds and expended 6,976 (6,669, 7,284) Kcal.wk-1 in physical activity. The older persons had a mean BMI of 27. 6 (27.2, 28.0), 62% took 3 or more medications per day, and14.4% had fallen one or more times over the last 6 months. Mean scores on the Mental Component Summary (MCS) was 50.6 (50.2, 51,0) and the Physical Component Summary (PCS) was 41.3 (40.8, 41.8). Multiple sequential regression analysis showed that, after adjustment for TUG floor surface correlates of physical function included age, sex, education, physical activity (weekly energy expenditure), general health, bodily pain, number of medications taken per day, depression and Body Mass Index. Further, there is a dose response relationship such that greater degree of physical function impairment is associated with poorer scores on physical health-related variables. Conclusions. Physical function in community-dwelling older adults is associated with several physical and mental health-related factors. Further study examining the nature of the relationships between these variables is needed. © 2010 Garber et al.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949355837,1,1,0,

As they plan for retirement and for their eventual long-term care and end-of-life needs, GLBT baby boomers share in the hopes and experiences that characterize the largest generation in American history. At the same time, however, they reflect certain unique family structures and gender role differences-and they confront distinct concerns about caregiving, social support networks, retirement and end-of-life planning. In February 2006, in partnership with the MetLife Mature Market Institute, the Lesbian and Gay Aging Issues Network of the American Society on Aging undertook the first U.S. national survey of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender baby boomers. A sample of 1,000 self-identified GLBT people ages 40 to 61 participated in an online survey conducted by Zogby International, a leading polling and public-opinion research firm.3 The snapshot of GLBT baby boomers that emerges from the survey raises important questions for the wide range of professionals who work with older adults, employers, policymakers, and everyone interested in ensuring dignity, independence and the highest possible quality of life for the boomer generation as it reaches midlife and old age. Caregiving and Social Support Networks One in four respondents said that they had provided care for an adult friend or family member within the last six months. This high incidence of caregiving is particularly surprising, as previous studies of the U.S. population as a whole have found only one in five adults is a caregiver.4 Strikingly, about the same proportions of gay and bisexual men and lesbian and bisexual women are serving as caregivers. In contrast, recent studies of the general population have found that only between 25% and 44% of caregivers are male.5 The relatively even percentages of male and female GLBT caregivers in this study suggest that gay and bisexual men may be providing care much more frequently than men in the overall U.S. population. More than one-third (36%) of GLBT boomers who are caregivers are caring for parents, while about half as many (18%) are caring for their partners. An additional 14% are caring for friends and another 12% are caring for other nonrelatives. Even though at least three-quarters of the respondents expect to become caregivers for someone else, almost one in five reported being unsure who will take care of them when the need arises. This was especially the case for those without partners or spouses, of whom more than one-third said they are not sure who would provide them with needed care. In addition to close ties with their families of origin, more than three-quarters of the respondents have important connections with what researchers have called families of choice-close friends who are ""like family"" or ""like a second or extended family."" Concerns about Aging and Retirement Both lesbian and bisexual women as well as gay and bisexual men share a concern about their financial stability as they age into retirement. For women, their greatest fear is outliving their income as they age. For men, their great fear is becoming dependent upon others and becoming sick or disabled. More than a quarter (27%) of GLBT boomers reported great concern about discrimination as they age, and less than half expressed strong confidence that healthcare professionals will treat them ""with dignity and respect."" Fears of insensitive and discriminatory treatment by healthcare professionals are particularly strong among lesbians, of whom 12% said they have absolutely no confidence that they will be treated respectfully. GLBT baby boomers clearly want to spend their final days in the comfort of their own homes. Nearly half (47%) said they would like their end-of-life care to take place in their current residence with the help of hospice care, followed at a distant second by 16 percent who would prefer to spend their final days in their current homes without hospice care. Lesbian and bisexual women appear to be less financially prepared for the end of life. For instance, they are notably less likely than their male counterparts to have purchased long-term care insurance or to have written wills. One half (51%) of GLBT baby boomers have yet to complete wills or living wills spelling out their long-term care and end-of-life wishes-yet such documents are particularly important for GLBT older adults given the current lack of legal protection for GLBT couples and families. Almost 40 percent of respondents believe that being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender has helped them prepare for aging in some way. They have developed positive character traits, greater resilience, or better support networks as a consequence of being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. © 2006 MetLife, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951428440,0,0,0,

This trend is rapidly changing the common image of late-midlife technology users, which rests on the assumption that they find it difficult to embrace new technologies and also that their main interests are health related. Although technology use and lifestyles are changing, however, many other aspects of life remain the same. One of these aspects is that of the transitions, or life changes, that generally take place in these years. Besides retirement, these transitions include changes in health, housing, social interaction, work life, and personal finance. People develop different ways of coping with these transitions, which brings up interesting issues related to the late midlife stage. This paper presents a diary-aided interview study of late middle-age adults (N = 24) in Finland and Sweden with a focus on the interplay between technologies and transitions. Transitions were found to play a part in how the life interests of late middle-aged persons are often conflictive, forcing them to choose from among various 'possible selves'. At its best, technology can help alleviate these tensions. This finding is exemplified in the paper's discussion of two design implications associated with particular clashes of interests, related to how daily activities are organized and how contact is maintained with one's friends and family. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The study generated a rich set of data by conducting, first, an exploratory, qualitative study followed by a confirmatory, quantitative study Through this process, an initial list of 402 attitudes to knowledge transfer was derived which was narrowed to 75 for the quantitative survey which, through factor analysis, was further reduced to 24 variables. The 24 variables were grouped into four factors for which trust and motivation are more relevant to the knowledge provider and absorptive capacity and knowledge regeneration for the receiver. Findings - High levels of agreement were found for the propositions that senior academics lacked compensation for mentoring activities, and hence, the motivation to transfer knowledge, and that a heavy teaching load prevented the absorption of transferred knowledge. By contrast, disagreement was found with the propositions that an elderly age impeded the transfer of knowledge or adapting to new ways of transferring knowledge. Practical implications - From the responses obtained it was possible to identify those rated highly and from which conclusions could be drawn that may assist the university concerned to improve knowledge transfer among its academic staff. Compensation to senior academics for their time and effort was seen as the most important pre-requisite for knowledge transfer. A reduction in teaching loads and the range of expectations to which academics are subjected would also facilitate knowledge transfer as would increasing academics' use of ICT and ability to assess its effectiveness, as well as recognising that knowledge transfer during social interactions may ameliorate the lack of knowledge transfer in the more formal, technology-based environment. Originality/value - The paper identifies key attitudes of academics to transferring knowledge to colleagues in the changing work place at universities in which academics are expected to perform at a high level in diverse activities and use technology to maximise their efficiency and effectiveness. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862164688,1,0,0,

Method: A clustered randomized controlled trial with two computer tailored interventions and a no-intervention control group was conducted among 1971 adults aged ≥ 50. The two tailored interventions were developed using Intervention Mapping and consisted of three tailored letters delivered over a four-month period. The basic tailored intervention targeted psychosocial determinants alone, while the environmentally tailored intervention additionally targeted environmental determinants, by providing tailored environmental information. Study outcomes were collected with questionnaires at baseline, three and six months and comprised total physical activity (days/week), walking (min/week), cycling (min/week), sports (min/week), environmental perceptions and use and appreciation of the interventions. Results: Mediation analyses showed that changes in cycling, sports and total physical activity behaviour induced by the environmentally tailored intervention were mediated by changes in environmental perceptions. Changes in environmental perceptions did not mediate the effect of the basic tailored intervention on behaviour. Compared with the basic tailored intervention, the environmentally tailored intervention significantly improved cycling behaviour (τ = 30.2). Additionally, the tailored letters of the environmentally tailored intervention were better appreciated and used, although these differences did not mediate the intervention effect. Discussion: This study gave some first indications of the relevance of environmental perceptions as a determinant of changing physical activity behaviours and the potential effectiveness of providing environmental information as an intervention strategy aimed at enhancing physical activity behaviour among older adults. © 2009 van Stralen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-74049140425,1,0,1,50+

We explore how people of this age group understand social networking sites and how these understandings fit certain aspects of their life. Designing social networking sites that match older adults' life would increase their possibilities of coping with the changes related to their age and of contributing to the information society. In a qualitative study involving use of an existing social networking site, and group and personal interviews, we found that understanding the internet as a dangerous place, and social networking sites as places of socially unacceptable behavior, hinders the use of these technologies. To include older adults, we propose arrangement of social events for getting familiarized with these services and offering of clear and simple privacy management on the sites.

Anderson J.D.,Contradictions across space-time and language ideologies in northern arapaho language shift,2009,Native American Language Ideologies,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876823732&partnerID=40&md5=8d0362e5674856a13da0517e72570eb7,"In 1878, when the federal government relocated the Northern Arapaho tribe to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, all of the approximately eight hundred members were fluent in their indigenous language. Most were also fluent in Plains Indian sign language, some in one or more neighboring languages, and only several in English. By 2005 less than approximately 7 percent of the more than six thousand members of the tribe remained fluent in Arapaho. As Salzmann (1998:287) confirms, language shift has progressed to what can be defined as an irreversible stage. At present all remaining fluent speakers are bilingual and members of at least the grandparental generation. The age discrepancy in fluency varies with family and individual childrearing contexts, but only several people under the age of seventy remain fluent. Today, all children acquire English as their first language. In all social domains English predominates except in educational contexts for language renewal, ceremonial speech, and occasional interaction among elders. When elders are together they sporadically switch to Arapaho but generally only for a few exchanges as a speech event unfolds. Despite concerted efforts over the past twentyfive years, language renewal programs have produced no fluent speakers among younger generation students studying it as a second language in formal educational contexts. In the Northern Arapaho speech community the process of language shift over the past seventy years, and more recent efforts in the past three decades to reverse it, have been concomitant with a proliferation of competing and converging language ideologies. During the same history the Wind River Reservation social landscape and temporal order have changed dramatically. During my first continuous field study of 1988-94 I participated in many language and cultural education programs and was thus daily immersed in discourse articulating these ideologies. As Arapaho people talked about elements or the whole of language(s), I came to realize that the ideologies expressed were efforts to understand and resolve contradictions generated by the dramatically changing environment beyond language itself. Older fluent speakers today comment, often with a profound sense of loss, that they have few opportunities in their daily lives to speak Arapaho with others. With modern ordering of space-time, the vast majority of elders live in nuclear or extended domestic social spaces in which they are the single speaker or only one among several fluent senior relatives. Those who participate in interviews and educational programs often mentioned to me that they looked forward to such rare times to speak the language and connect with others in their own generation. As many observe, language shift is not just a demographic process of declining numbers of speakers but also a process of contracting ""domains"" of usage (Fishman 1972:440-53) or sites of cultural production (Silverstein 1998b:138). Language or speech does not, however, construct the social space and time of its use sui generis. As I explain elsewhere (Anderson 1998:51-52), domains themselves are equally constituted by the interdimensionality of time and space on a number of levels. The socially constructed spaces and time orientations in which Arapaho people live, such as ceremony, home, school, political discourse, and economic activity, have all changed significantly in history, both in the ways sites reproduce social relations internally and in the speech practices that link the domains together. Borrowing a useful term from Giddens, it is insightful to examine speech practices and reflective ideologies relative to ""time-space zones"" as individuals and groups move through ""time-space paths"" (1987:146) in daily life and trajectories of larger extension, such as the annual calendar, life cycle, and family history. What is needed is more attention in anthropology to the way communities change their speech practices in response to constructed changes in the physical and social environment. Built environments can enhance or inhibit any social practices, whether by design or unintentionally (Lawrence and Low 1990:461). More generally, as Harvey recognizes, imposed orders of space and time are the principal apparatus of ""conquest, imperial expansion, and neocolonial domination"" (1990:419). Following Foucault (1984:252), it can be said that governments exert power through built forms in a process of canalization, the control of the flow and distribution of individual bodies in space. With respect to time, Munn states, ""Control over time is not just a strategy of interaction; it is a medium of hierarchic power and governance"" (1992:109). Top-down-imposed orders of space and time were alien to indigenous peoples and as a whole were the primary apparatus for transforming the system of social reproduction, including language and culture. It is therefore essential to examine ways Arapaho people have tried to appropriate those structures, construct new structures, or adapt traditional ones to invent or sustain language and culture. In Native American history, dominant ideologies and their instantiation in local space-time orientation have never been coherently hegemonic. Approaches to language ideologies must steer theory away from reified social forces or hegemony toward an understanding of competing and historically shifting ideologies, which Friedrich defines as ""pragmatic ideologies"" (1989:300-302), grounded in the particular, concrete practices in local, socially constructed spaces and time orientations. Rather than blending, though, Euro-American oppressive and progressive ideologies have generated enduring contradictions in a hybridized chaos unique to the space-time of reservation communities in the United States. Wind River, like other reservations, is largely a constructed environment (Lawrence and Low 1990) always in the making and remaking, shaped by state policies that shift precipitously among competing, evolving ideologies that never congeal into a coherent or uniform system of thought qualifying as hegemony any group can embrace or resist in total. Thus, Arapaho language has shifted to English in a history in which, as Althusser recognized, ""the locus of confrontation may vary according to the relation of the contradictions in the structure in dominance in any given situation"" (1969:215-16). Dominant language ideologies are therefore neither wholly uniform nor explicitly durable within a speech community undergoing shift. At one level, language shift on reservations took place in a social space-time different from that of other groups, such as urban or transnational immigrant ethnic groups. State-sponsored shifting utopian models in reservation history have resulted in a local heterotopian space-time (Foucault 1986). The contradiction between utopian missions of integration and heterotopian realities of sequestration provides the material for many local language ideologies. As discussed below in more detail, Arapaho language ideologies negotiate but never resolve the contradictions between a utopian language renewal mission and the objective reality of shift as an irreversible process, between the utopian model of Euro-American education as the universalizable solution to all problems and the impoverished local political economy, and between idealized nostalgic purism within Arapaho ideologies and the proliferation of modern technologies and bureaucratic apparatuses of communication and governance. In the relatively new study of language shift there has been a tendency to remain unreflexive about the social scientific ideological ground and spatiotemporal constructions that support it (Collins 1998:259). To borrow Phillipson's terms, models of shift are often ""bedeviled by myths and binary over-simplifications"" (1992:23). Today there is no permanent, closed, ""us versus them"" border to contest, no singular Euro-American ideology set against a singular Arapaho language ideology, and there probably never has been. Beginning in the 1880s, for example, competing Euro-American ideologies approached the Arapaho speech community with contradictory purposes, such that repression reigned in some time-space zones, while acceptance and even valorization applied in others. In the mission boarding school at St. Stephens children were barred from speaking Arapaho in the classroom, but in chapel the priests and brothers spoke Arapaho with the aim of conversion. By the 1890s and early 1900s other Euro-Americans arrived to research the very language and culture that federal agents sought to eradicate. Dimensions of space and time interrelate to define language ideologies in four correlative ways, which I explore in the rest of this chapter. First, competing dominant culture ideologies have imposed orders of space and time on the reservation as solutions to the ""Indian problem,"" reflecting a range of dominant ideologies toward American Indians, from extreme racism to progressive compassion. Beginning with the first relation, as Deloria suggests, ""It is debatable which factor was most important in the destruction of tribal ceremonial life: The prohibition of performances of traditional rituals by the government, or the introduction of white man's system of keeping time"" (1985:18). The same statement applies if language prohibition is inserted and the effects of time for restructuring space appended. It is not enough to situate language loss and ideological frames about it in the narrow spaces, policies, or historical moments wherein Arapaho language has been openly repressed. © 2009 by University of Arizona Press.

Methods: Data originate from the first wave of the ESA (Étude de Santé des Ainés) longitudinal study on mental health of community dwelling older persons aged over 65 (n=2670). Depression, including major and minor depression, measured using a computer questionnaire; the ESA- Q developed by the research team and based on the DSM-IV criteria. Assessments of associations between depression and geographic area, informal social networks and community participation were estimated adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic and health characteristics. Results: The prevalence of depression was higher in rural (17%) and urban areas (15.1%) than in metropolitan Montreal (10.3%). The odds ratio of rural (OR=2.01 95% CI 1.59-2.68) and urban (OR=1.75; 95% CI 1.25-2.45) areas compared to the metropolitan area increased slightly after adjustment by all social and health covariates. Our study indicated that social support and the lack of conflict in intimate relationships were associated with lower prevalence of depression in all areas. Conclusion: Geographic differences in depression exist within the elderly population in Quebec that may generate significant impact on their health and functional abilities. Further research should be conducted to explain these differences. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350731101,1,1,0,

Drawing on a case study of a new outer-suburban 'master planned estate' in Brisbane, Queensland, the findings from interviews with 51 older residents and participant observations of a community group are presented. The study suggests that a traditional ideal of unreflexive community of place was an unreliable source of durable social bonds in contemporary fragmented and mobile social conditions, where the proximity of family members, durability of tenure and strong neighbourly ties are not inevitable. One successful resolution was found in a group of older residents who through exercising agency had joined a group the sole focus of which was social companionship.

For each aspect we were interested in how older adults perceive this aspect of support, what they think are the similarities and differences of this aspect of support in online settings vs offline settings, and what they perceive are the advantages and disadvantages of communicating this aspect of support online. We did this by conducting detailed interviews with three groups of older adults (31 people in total) with different levels of expertise in using the internet and online communication (older adults who do not use the internet, older adults who use only email, and older adults who participate in online support communities).

Thus, not only do they live alone, but they might seldom see these relatives for long periods, even though they often depend on them financially. With the goal of designing appropriate communication technology for seniors and their relatives experiencing this situation, we conducted interviews and evaluated scenarios and prototypes to reveal the practical ways they maintain emotional ties despite the distance. Based on those findings, we envisioned a communication system through which seniors and their relatives can maintain close social ties by sharing information, personal reminiscences and stories. We found that older adults perceived the system as a richer, natural form of communication with their relatives that could facilitate their integration into the networks that currently connect members of their families. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective: The goal of this study was to determine whether older adults' awareness of 2 major state and federal pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs was associated with the seniors' ability to access and process information about assistance programs. Methods: Data were gathered from a cross-sectional study of independently living, English- or Spanish-speaking adults aged ≥60 years. Participants were interviewed in 30 community-based settings (19 apartment complexes and 11 senior centers) in New York, New York. The analysis focused on adults aged ≥65 years who lacked Medicaid coverage. Multivariable logistic regression was used to model program awareness as a function of information access (family/social support, attendance at senior or community centers and places of worship, viewing of live health insurance presentations, instrumental activities of daily living, site of medical care, computer use, and having a proxy decision maker for health insurance matters) and information-processing ability (education level, English proficiency, health literacy, and cognitive function). The main outcome measure was awareness of New York's state pharmaceutical assistance program (Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage [EPIC]]) and the federal Medicare Part D low-income subsidy program (Extra Help). Results: A total of 269 patients were enrolled (mean [SD] age, 76.9 [7.5] years; 32.0% male; 39.9% white). Awareness of the programs differed widely: 77.3%) knew of EPIC! and 22.3% knew of Extra Help. In multivariable analysis, study participants were more likely to have heard of the EPIC program if they had attended a live presentation about health insurance issues (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 3.40; 95% CI, 1.20-9.61) and less likely if they received care in a clinic (AOR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.23-0.92). Awareness of Extra Help in the multivariable models was more likely among study participants who had viewed a live health insurance presentation (AOR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.55-7.24) and less likely for those with inadequate health literacy (AOR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03-0.74). Conclusions: Viewing of live health insurance presentations and adequate health literacy were associated with greater awareness of important pharmaceutical cost-assistance programs in this study in low-income, elderly individuals.

However, their enactment of active and health-promoting lifestyles can reduce such declines. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe the USC Well Elderly II study, a randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of a healthy lifestyle program for elders, and document how various methodological challenges were addressed during the course of the trial. Methods: In the study, 460 ethnically diverse elders recruited from a variety of sites in the urban Los Angeles area were enrolled in a randomized experiment involving a crossover design component. Within either the first or second 6-month phase of their study involvement, each elder received a lifestyle intervention designed to improve a variety of aging outcomes. At 4-5 time points over an 18-24 month interval, the research participants were assessed on measures of healthy activity, coping, social support, perceived control, stress-related biomarkers, perceived physical health, psychosocial well-being, and cognitive functioning to test the effectiveness of the intervention and document the process mechanisms responsible for its effects. Results: The study protocol was successfully implemented, including the enrollment of study sites, the recruitment of 460 older adults, administration of the intervention, adherence to the plan for assessment, and establishment of a large computerized data base. Limitations: Methodological challenges were encountered in the areas of site recruitment, participant recruitment, testing, and intervention delivery. Conclusions: The completion of clinical trials involving elders from numerous local sites requires careful oversight and anticipation of threats to the study design that stem from: (a) social situations that are particular to specific study sites; and (b) physical, functional, and social challenges pertaining to the elder population. © 2009 Sage Publications.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-62149148778,1,1,1,

Eighteen participants (n = 18) who met inclusion criteria were recruited from a community health clinic, provided informed signed consent, and were assigned in groups of six to an Internetbased support group program. Where needed, participants were supplied equipment (computers, Web cams, audio headsets) and trained to access an easy-to-use, password-protected Web site that uses videoconferencing to support group member-facilitator interactive communication. The aim of the intervention was to support group member bonding and sharing of challenges and strategies for managing a chronic disease. Following 10 weekly professionally facilitated sessions, the groups met weekly in a self-help mode for an additional 3 months. Participants were interviewed at 6-month follow-up. An interview guide was used to gain feedback on using the Internet to access a health service and to ask about the benefits of having participated in the videoconferencing support group program. At follow-up, participants responded positively to using technology to communicate with healthcare professionals and other group members. They also valued the information shared regarding self-care, and reported reduction in feelings of loneliness and isolation. Our Internet-based, videoconferencing intervention program can be viewed as a prototype for designing technology platforms for the delivery of professional healthcare services to home-based older adults with chronic disease. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-62649150754,0,1,1,

Facebook, widely used by students, is designed to facilitate communication with different groups of ‘friends’. This exploratory study involved interviewing a sample of student users of Facebook: it focuses on the extent to which older adults, especially parents, are accepted as Facebook friends, and the attitudes towards such friendships and potential friendships and what these reveal about notions of privacy. Parents were rarely reported to be Facebook friends, and there was a view that in general they would not be welcomed. The reasons were related to embarrassment, social norms, and worries about mothers. Underlying these were various notions of the private and the public. Students did not appear to conceive of there being two distinct realms: indeed, the ‘public’ appeared to be the individual's private social world. A level of sophistication is apparent, with nuanced understandings of concepts, suggesting that social networking sites such as Facebook are associated with new ways of construing some of the notions surrounding the traditional public/private dichotomy. Notions of what is private and what is public are fuzzy, with no clear-cut public/private dichotomy. Computer-mediated communication appears to make this fuzziness more apparent than has hitherto been the case. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-77950761707,0,0,0,

Issues such as fear, loneliness, dependency, and physical decline may be hard to observe or discuss in interviews. Pastiche scenarios and pastiche personae are techniques that employ characters to create a space for the discussion of new technological developments and user experience. This paper argues that the use of fictional characters can help to overcome restrictive notions of older people by disrupting designers' prior assumptions. In this paper, we reflect on our experiences using pastiche techniques in two separate technology design projects that sought to address the needs of older people. In the first pastiche scenarios were developed by the designers of the system and used as discussion documents with users. In the second pastiche personae were used by groups of users themselves to generate scenarios which were scribed for later use by the design team. We explore how the use of fictional characters and settings can generate new ideas and undercut the potential in scenarios, for weak characterisation of 'the user' to permit scenario writers to fit characters to technology rather than vice versa. To assist in future development of pastiche techniques in designing for older people, we provide an array of fictional older characters drawn from literary and popular culture. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-63649130563,0,maybe,0,

The usage of blogs, however, is different, with significant differences in the topological and structural patterns of post and response in blogs being evident in different demographics. We discover important information about the topological structures of online social networks by examining topological patterns in blog posts, also known as cascades. To accomplish this, we create and study the blogosphere, blog and post networks of an online social network used primarily by older adults. We also study the topological patterns of cascades in greater detail, reporting their common shapes, properties and size distribution. Our research has implications for the design of social network software for older Americans, as well as the algorithms used in search engines for such systems.

However, with the continuing increase in the non-communicable diseases, the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that disabilities have eroded nine years from the healthy quality of life of Jamaicans. The current study aims to provide factors that will explain how to attain 'good' health. Method: The research design for this study is an explanatory one. This research utilizes cross-sectional data taken from the Jamaica Survey of Living Conditions (JSLC) 2002 in order to identify and explain some of the determinants of well-being among the Jamaican elderly. Information collected used self-administered questionnaire. Multivariate regression was used to establish the well-being model. The surveyed population was 3009 respondents ages 60 years and older, with 52.7% females (n = 1423) and 47.3% males (n = 1423). The average age of the surveyed population was 71 years 10 months ± 8 years six months. Result: Of the 14 predisposed variables that were used to test the general hypothesis, 11 were found to be statistically significant. From the selected variables of this study, the six most important factors that impact on the well-being of the Jamaican elderly in descending order are as follows: social support (β = 0.486), average occupancy per room (β = -0.428), area of residence - living in Kingston Metropolitan Area (KMA) with reference to rural areas (β = 0.179) or dwelling in other towns with reference to rural area (β = 0.157), education (β = 0.155) followed by the physical environment (β = -0.138) and age of respondents (β = -0.129). Conclusion: The predisposed variables used in this study explain 45.9% of the variance in quality of life. The variable that has the most influential impact on well-being is social support. The general well-being of the Jamaican elderly is low (mean of 3.9/14 ± 2.3).

The aim of this study is to investigate the association between social relationships and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) among the elderly in Italy. Methods. A sample of 33,744 Italian residents, representing the non-institutionalised population aged 60 years and over was extracted from the national ISTAT cross-sectional survey during 1999-2000. HRQL was measured with the SF-12, from which the Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) were obtained. Data were subjected to descriptive analysis and multiple logistic regression models with adjustment for the main confounders. Results. Our analysis shows a gradient in PCS and MCS among the terziles in seeing/meeting ""friends"" and ""family"" and, for PCS, a North-South gradient among the Italian regions. Females, the elderly who reported a lower household income, those who spent less time in recreational and religious activities, who lived too far from their relatives and had few relationships with friends and relatives, were significantly less likely to have an MCS above the median value. For PCS, an increase in HRQL was likely to be associated with a higher educational level, while lower PCS scores were associated with: age 75+, inadequate household income, unmarried status, infrequency of seeing/meeting friends, too high a mean distance from own home to relatives' homes, lack of leisure time spent in recreational activities, living in the Centre-South of Italy, chronic diseases, reduced autonomy, and use of drugs during the previous two days. Significant interactions between suffering from one chronic disease and the use of drugs were also found for both MCS and PCS. Conclusion. Some dimensions of social relationships were significantly associated with HRQL. These findings are crucial for devising welfare strategies at both the regional and the European level, i.e. in countries such as Italy where the primacy of family support of the elderly has declined in recent years. © 2008 de Belvis et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-54049148136,1,1,0,

Data sources: The sample consisted of 500 randomly selected NPs who were certified to practice in New York State. The Geriatric Curriculum Survey designed by the researchers was based on the 47 ""Older Adult Care"" competencies developed by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing. The survey was mailed to the subjects along with a stamped self-addressed envelope to facilitate its return. Two hundred and twenty-two surveys (44%) were returned. Conclusions: A majority of the respondents were comfortable with their assessment skill knowledge of individuals aged 65 years and older in all areas except those related to cultural/ethnic items. Over half of the respondents were only ""somewhat comfortable"" with knowledge of management of Alzheimer's disease, delirium, dementia, neurological problems, polypharmacy, and sleep issues. Finally, respondents were asked to rate their knowledge comfort level on topics relevant to physical and psychosocial issues of individuals aged 65 years and older. The majority of respondents only felt ""somewhat comfortable"" with their knowledge on all but one of the nine items in this category. Health promotion and disease prevention was the only item that over 50% of the respondents felt ""very knowledgeable"" about. Ninety-five percent indicated they would be better prepared to care for individuals aged 65 years and older if a didactic course in geriatrics was required in their program of study. Seventy percent indicated they would consider taking an online course in geriatrics. Implications for practice: Based on the results of this study, an online, four-credit geriatric-focused course ""Issues in Geriatric Management"" was developed. The course is required in the acute care and adult NP programs. Eventually, this course will be offered as continuing education credit for practicing NPs.

This study explored the lived experiences of older nursing home residents in Taiwan. Background. With more long-term care institutions in Taiwan, older people are more often placed in nursing homes than in the past. Increased understanding of their lived experience is essential to assess residents' needs and determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions. Design. A qualitative design was used to gain a deeper understanding of the lived experiences of older nursing home residents in Taiwan. Methods. Focus groups, followed by in-depth interviews, were used to gather information from 33 older residents at eight nursing homes in northern Taiwan. Participants were asked to describe what was important to them and what impressed them most in their daily lives in the nursing home. Participants (24 females and nine males) were on an average 75.3 years old. Verbatim transcripts of audiotaped focus groups and interviews were analysed by thematic analysis via ATLAS.ti software. Results. The core theme of older residents' nursing home experience was 'a temporary home to nurture health'. This core theme was reflected in participants' descriptions of their overall life in the nursing home as a temporary experience to nurture their health. Their everyday experience was characterised by four subthemes: highly structured lifestyle, restricted activities, safety concerns and social interactions. Relevance to clinical practice. Our findings may enhance policy makers' and healthcare providers' understanding of the lived experience of older nursing home residents, thus guiding the evaluation and development of nursing home services to improve residents' lives. For example, residents with the same characteristics could be placed in the same room or same floor, thus increasing their interactions with other residents. Residents' interactions with family members could also be developed using the Internet or mobile telephones. © 2008 The Authors.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-44949225934,1,1,0,

Design and method: Qualitative interviews were used to examine the perceptions of 10 young event riders who had made a transition to regional level. Interviews were based on the developmental model [Wylleman, P., & Lavallee, D. (2004). A developmental perspective on transitions faced by athletes. In Weiss, M. (Ed.), Developmental sport psychology. Morgantown, WV: Fitness Information Technology] and the model of human adaptation to transition [Schlossberg, N. (1981). A model for analyzing human adaptation.

Basics of qualitative research: Techniques and procedures for developing grounded theory (2nd ed.). Beverly Hills, CA: Sage] and Patton, M. Q. [(2002). Qualitative research and evaluation methods (3rd ed.). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage]. Results and conclusion: Five categories have been identified (motivation for the transition, perceptions of the transition, sources of stress, support for athletic development, post-transition changes), which follow the process of transition as experienced by the athletes. Consistent with research, parents and peers were important at this stage, often prompting the motivation to make the transition, which was facilitated by considerable social support. Riders made considerable sacrifices during these adolescent years, and development in other areas (such as academic and social) was affected by this commitment, suggesting a risk for identity foreclosure at this formative time. Young athletes should be encouraged to develop a rounded identity to minimize the risk of foreclosure and the associated negative effects at retirement. Further within-career transition research is needed in order that programs can be designed which facilitate athlete development, mitigate negative influences, and minimize talent loss. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Design/methodology/approach - The methodology consists of: cross-search of literature towards the elaboration of a theoretical map; and collection of data involving semi-directed interviews followed by a thematic and statistical analysis of the textual data. Findings - Management's knowledge of social and relational knowledge, especially those of ageing workers, appears to be scarce, thus resulting in ageing workers being perceived as surpassed by technological and scientific progress. This conception deprives the company of an important source of knowledge capitalisation. A model relevant to the evaluation of company practices related to inter-generational aspects of knowledge management should include six basic dimensions, namely: management philosophy (a managerial style favouring projections and proximities), strategic analysis (knowledge, memory and learning strategy), organisational analysis (information management system and knowledge creation process), operational analysis (places of socialisation), competencies (relational and communicational know-how, individual memory and capacity of judgement), and the role of ageing personnel (activation of organisational and human resource networks). Research limitations/implications - Further validation is required across an enlarged population, with the aim of operationalising the observed concepts within a practical evaluation guide of company practices related to inter-generational aspects of knowledge management. Originality/value - By centering the analysis on highly qualified ageing individuals, the authors discerned a phenomenon showing that even within highly technological contexts knowledge management is far from systematically integrating those recognised a priori as carriers of knowledge.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-41949103341,1,maybe,0,

Lack of energy, ""anergia,"" is a possible central feature for identifying, evaluating, and treating elders with health-related problems in quality of life. Methods. A survey was conducted on a randomly selected stratified sample (N = 2130) of three ethnic groups of community-residing elders in a defined urban geographic area: the Northern Manhattan Aging Project (NMAP). The participants were Medicare beneficiaries living north of 150th Street in Manhattan. The criteria for anergia were based on the presence of the major criterion ""sits around a lot for lack of energy"" and any two of six minor criteria. Self-reports were gathered using a computer-assisted, rater-administered interview (the Comprehensive Assessment and Referral Interview; CARE) covering: function (basic activities of daily living [ADL] and instrumental ADL [IADL]); features of geriatric syndromes such as self-rated physical health, depression, pain, respiratory distress, trouble sleeping, cognitive impairment, and cardiovascular syndromes; social isolation; and healthcare utilization. Short-term (18-month) and long-term (6-year) mortality were derived from the National Death Index. Results. Three hundred eighty-six people (18% of the sample) met criteria for anergia. Anergia was more common in women than men (22% vs 12%, p &lt; .01), in unmarried than in married persons (21% vs 13%, p &lt; .001), and with advancing age. People with anergia used more hospitalizations, office visits, emergency room visits, and home care services and, had higher mortality rates. In multivariate analyses, the following factors had independent associations with anergia: female gender, impaired physical function and IADL, depression, pain, respiratory symptoms, urinary incontinence, hearing difficulty, feeling dizzy or weak, and social isolation and disengagement. These factors could be the initial candidates for clinical investigation of anergia of undetermined origin. Among people with anergia at baseline, 31.3% (n = 121) had persistent anergia and 33.9% (n = 131) recovered over a follow-up period of 18 months. Conclusions. Anergia in multiethnic older adults is associated with a range of clinical symptoms and diseases, with extensive health services use, and with increased mortality.

The literature on history-making as a restorative process has focused on mental health, reversing negative representations of indigenous people in mainstream histories, and using Native histories to reclaim land and rights. In 2004, the Tule River Indian Tribe of Central California initiated an innovative history project to engage tribal elders in contributing historical information about themselves and their families for preservation by the Tribe. Theories and methods from postcolonial scholarship, anthropology, and occupational therapy (and its academic discipline occupational science) focused the Tule River Tribal History Project on providing meaningful and enjoyable activities - creating family trees, a tribal photo archive, interviews with elders, social gatherings and community discussions, and a website. The products were made available to participants in digital and printed formats. Copies have since been archived by the Tribal Council and also made available for tribal use at the Towanits Education Center on the Tule River Reservation. Pre-test and post-test survey data indicate: (1) the tribal elders' high valuation of the history-making activities; and (2) the positive impact of the program on social integration and spiritual well-being.

Method: The study had a randomized sample (n=4278; age: 75-105) stratified in four age groups. Factor analyses were performed to investigate the factor structure of the instrument, and convergent and discriminant validity was assessed by correlation between summary scores and by means of various measures (such as symptoms and ADL). Mean scores and Cronbach's alpha were computed for the total sample and for each stratum. Respondents and non-respondents to SF-12 were compared regarding various measures. A multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify determinants for respondents/non-respondents. Results: Mean scores in the total sample were 37.5 SD 11.9 for the physical component summary score (PCS) and 50.3 SD 11.5 for the mental component summary score (MCS). Both PCS and MCS decreased significantly with higher age. The instrument showed acceptable convergent/ discriminant validity and Cronbach's alpha, but the factor solution did not follow the intended structure of the instrument. Completion rate for all 12 items was 85.5% in the total sample, and the characteristics of non-respondents to SF-12 were higher age, being female, living alone, living in special accommodation, being worried about health, being in need of help with activities of daily living, reporting fewer symptoms, and having a smaller social network than respondents. Conclusions: The instrument generally showed acceptable validity and reliability, except for its factor structure. Furthermore, new determinants for non-respondents of SF-12 were found, such as type of living conditions, being worried about health, and social network. © 2007, Editrice Kurtis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-38549097322,1,1,0,
Rosentraub M.S.,Invisible jail: Providing housing and transportation for the elderly and disabled,2007,"Invisible City: Poverty, Housing, and New Urbanism",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84906387370&partnerID=40&md5=a407a82550d119e18a58b271b7567ecd,"In this chapter we look at how barrier-free and affordable housing and transportation services for elderly and disabled persons have generally not been developed.1 As we show later, very few books on housing address the considerable and important housing and transportation needs of the disabled and elderly. Here we will attempt to make this an important issue for progressive planning and housing. The elderly and disabled are often prevented from participating in employment, health care, shopping, social, and recreational activities, as well as exercising their freedom to live independently. Historically, our society has placed great emphasis on the institutionalization of elderly and disabled people who need assistance. This has relegated these people to environments that inhibit the development of selfsufficiency and community integration (Rosen, Clark, and Kivitz 1977). In many instances, terms or phrases used to describe these populations were developed to justify their exclusion from the larger society. For people with mental retardation, the words ""moron,"" ""imbecile,"" and ""retarded"" have been used. Each term creates its own stigma, which actually encourages people's isolation from society by its non-disabled and non-elderly members (Sarason and Doris 1979). There have always been calls for more progressive policies with regard to the habilitation of elderly people and those with disabling conditions. However, in most instances, these demands were made by a limited number of academics and social reformers. In the 1970s, however, the pressure for programs and policies that were intended to integrate handicapped and elderly people into society reached a new pinnacle. Political and economic factors, together with research findings suggesting the possibilities that exist for people with handicaps, have created a demand for more communitybased and socially integrated programs and policies. At the political level, court decisions that ruled institutions unfit required public action to develop community-based programs for many disabled people (see, for example, Lelsz v. Kavanagh, U.S. Court of Appeals, 5th Circuit, 85-2485 and 86-1166, reported January 21, 1987). The monetary costs of institutionalized programs, even in the face of lawsuits arguing the existence of inferior care, continued to rise and created another pressure for the development of alternative programs. In addition to these factors, older people and the disabled are more vocal in their support for independent living arrangements that take advantage of technology and innovative support systems. Their goal of being free in urban environments is actually made attainable as a result of a combination of housing and transportation design modifications and creative housing programs. In 1990, President George H. W. Bush signed into law the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which was seen as a civil rights victory for the disabled, many of whom are elderly. Disability is defined in the law as ""a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity."" As the population grows older, there is an ever-expanding need for more available slots in nursing homes for those people who are either unable to take care of themselves or have families who are unable or unwilling to take care of them. As it currently stands, there is a nursing home crisis in this country due to bed shortages and deplorable conditions that will continue to worsen in the years to come. In spite of this situation, legislatures around the country have turned their backs on this segment of the population, truly making them invisible. To a very real extent, the issue of a physical disability has always been a function of the state of technology. For example, without the advent of eyeglasses and hearing aids, many productive workers and family members would have to be considered disabled. Technological advances in transportation have also made it possible for individuals with limited physical strength to maneuver extremely large vehicles and aircraft. In a similar fashion, advances in wheelchair design, computers, and the construction of homes and buildings create the potential to make many people who were once disabled and dependent able and independent. The entire question of disability and dependency for the majority of people considered handicapped can be related to the application of existing technology. In recognition of the possibilities that exist, several groups have called for the development of accurate databases to describe existing housing and transportation problems that can thwart independent living for the elderly and disabled people (Harlow and Rosentraub 1984). A group of concerned citizens and public officials in Houston created a multi-institutional task force in 1985 to examine the state of housing and transportation for the elderly and the handicapped. The task force would develop plans and programs for improved social integration and access for all Houston citizens. This task force included members from the Area Agency on Aging, Harris County Community Development Agency, Houston Center for Independent Living, Housing Authority of the City of Houston, Sheltering Arms, City of Houston Planning and Development Department, Houston Metropolitan Transit Authority, Houston City Council, University of Houston, Texas Southern University, and the University of Texas at Arlington. This task force initiated a research project to assess the needs of disabled and elderly persons. The study involved interviews with more than 1,640 Houston/Harris County area residents who had special housing and transportation needs. This comprehensive study revealed certain facts with the potential of having a major impact on housing and transportation policy in the years ahead. The research also was passed along to Congress and the first President Bush in their debate concerning passage of the ADA. © 2008 by the University of Texas Press.

To investigate the psychological and social effects of the robots, each subject was interviewed, and their social network was analyzed. In addition, the activities of the residents in public areas were recorded by video cameras during daytime hours (8:30-18:00). For physiological analysis, residents' urine was obtained and analyzed for hormones 17-ketosteroid sulfate and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids. The experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the ethical committee of the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology. The results indicate that interaction with the seal robots increased their social interaction. Furthermore, the urinary tests showed that the reactions of the subjects' vital organs to stress improved after the introduction of the robots. © 2007 IEEE.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-35348921191,0,1,1,

A comparison group of 26 participants (similar in all major respects) was engaged in other activities. Both groups were administered measures of physical functioning, life satisfaction, depression, loneliness and self-control at pre- and post-intervention four months later. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants who finished the computer course. ANCOVA was employed for controlling the effects of control variables and pre-intervention differences on participants who completed the activities. Results showed a significant improvement among participants in the intervention group in all measures except physical functioning, whereas deterioration in all measures was detected in the comparison group.

Method: To determine the effectiveness of the experiment in terms of reducing loneliness, 15 older adults were interviewed three times: shortly before the start, two years later and immediately after termination of the experiment, while their loneliness scores at zero and post-measurement were compared with those of a control group. Results: Both the participants and the control persons experienced a reduction in loneliness over time. However, the reduction was only significant for the intervention participants. Moreover, the changes in loneliness were significantly greater among the participants compared to the control persons. When looking more in detail, the effect of the experiment was only significant regarding emotional loneliness and among the highest educated. Findings of the qualitative research enabled us to understand the mechanisms through which the intervention helped alleviate loneliness. E-mail was found to facilitate social contact. Furthermore, the computer and Internet were often used to pass the time, taking people's minds off their loneliness. Unexpectedly, the intervention also improved people's self-confidence. Conclusion: The decline in loneliness is likely to be greater if persons under more favorable circumstances are selected and if more social functions of the Internet are used. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548823536,1,1,0,

The Internet is used primarily as a handy tool to obtain information rather than for developing online relationships. Second, weak tie relationships that develop as a result of face-to-face interactions in computer club meetings facilitate the exchange of information among members.

This pilot study evaluated the perceived oral health quality of life (OHQOL) of elders who used a mobile dental program in urban, suburban, and rural ADHC settings. Pre- and post-treatment interviews were conducted to evaluate OHQOL using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). ADHC records were used to obtain demographic, medical history and medication data. Following initial dental examinations and consent, dental treatment was provided at each ADHC. Of the 138 elders screened at three ADHCs, pre- and post-treatment data were obtained on 76 subjects following their treatment (mean four months later). The group's members were mostly female (64.5%) and Caucasian (71.6%). Their mean age was 76.8 (+/- 9.8), with an average of 12.4 teeth (34.2% edentulous); 67.7% were on Medicaid. On average they had 5.5 chronic diseases, hypertension being the most common (67.1%); 44.8% had a neurological disorder or dementia. GOHAI scores were generally high both pre- and post-treatment, reflecting high physical and psychosocial OHQOL and low levels of worry. GOHAI scores were correlated with chronic diseases; the more chronic diseases an individual had, the lower his or her total score pre- and post-treatment (r=-.24, r=-.26 respectively, p<.04). The more dental treatment needs an elder had, the lower his or her GOHAI (r=-.23, p<.05). Elders with more teeth reported higher GOHAI pre- and post-treatment (r=.36, r=.37 respectively, p<.002). Paired t-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment GOHAI scores revealed significant improvements in overall GOHAI (p<.001), and on two dimensions: physical (p<.005) and psychosocial (p<.002). The findings support the importance of providing on-site access to dental services in order to maintain the general OHQOL of frail elders, more specifically in the areas of physical and psychosocial well-being.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-34748925162,0,1,1,

Attention is given to the circumstances under which such migration takes place, including the role parents play in the process and the extent to which the implications of migration for the parents are taken into consideration. The analysis relies primarily on open-ended interviews conducted in 2004 with older age parents with migrant children in four purposely selected rural communities that were studied ten years earlier. Our findings suggest that migration of children to urban areas contributes positively to the material well-being of their elderly parents who remain in rural areas. Negative impacts of migration on social support, defined in terms of maintaining contact and visits, have been attenuated by the advent of technological changes in communication and also by improvements in transportation. Phone contact, especially through mobile phones, is now pervasive, in sharp contrast to the situation ten years earlier when it was extremely rare. Much of the change in Thailand in terms of the relationships between rural parents and their geographically dispersed adult children is quite consistent with the concept of the 'modified extended family', a perspective that has become common in discussions regarding elderly parents in industrial and post-industrial societies but rarely applied to the situation of elderly parents in developing country settings.

Recent rapid increases in mortality among lower socioeconomic groups in eastern Europe suggests that socioeconomic factors are powerful determinants of mortality in these populations but the more proximal factors linking the social conditions with health remain unclear. The HAPIEE (Health, Alcohol and Psychosocial factors In Eastern Europe) study is a prospective cohort study designed to investigate the effect of classical and nonconventional risk factors and social and psychosocial factors on cardiovascular and other non-communicable diseases in eastern Europe and the FSU. The main hypotheses of the HAPIEE study relate to the role of alcohol, nutrition and psychosocial factors. Methods and design: The HAPIEE study comprises four cohorts in Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Lithuania; each consists of a random sample of men and women aged 45-69 years old at baseline, stratified by gender and 5 year age groups, and selected from population registers. The total planned sample size is 36,500 individuals. Baseline information from the Czech Republic, Russia and Poland was collected in 2002-2005 and includes data on health, lifestyle, diet (food frequency), socioeconomic circumstances and psychosocial factors. A short examination included measurement of anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, lung function and cognitive function, and a fasting venous blood sample. Re-examination of the cohorts in 2006-2008 focuses on healthy ageing and economic well-being using face-to-face computer assisted personal interviews.

Purpose: This pilot research tested whether a 12-session, coping improvement group intervention delivered via teleconference technology could improve life quality in 90 middle-age and older adults living with HIV/AIDS. Method: This research used a lagged-treatment control group design. Forty-four HIV-infected persons 50-plus years of age participated in a coping improvement group intervention immediately after study enrollment, whereas 46 individuals received the intervention after their time-matched immediate treatment participants completed the intervention. Participants completed self-administered surveys that assessed depressive and psychological symptoms, life-stressor burden, ways of coping, coping self-efficacy, and loneliness. Results: Outcome analyses indicated that, compared to their delayed treatment counterparts, immediate treatment participants reported fewer psychological symptoms, lower levels of life-stressor burden, increased coping self-efficacy, and less frequent use of avoidance coping. After receiving the intervention, delayed treatment participants reported greater coping self-efficacy and less psychological symptomatology, life-stressor burden, and loneliness. However, the intervention demonstrated little ability to reduce depressive symptoms in this sample of HIV-infected older adults diagnosed with depression. Conclusions: Although findings from this research suggest that telephone-delivered, coping improvement group interventions have potential to facilitate the adjustment efforts of HIV-infected older adults, more rigorous evaluations of this intervention modality for this group are needed. © 2006 by The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33745962811,1,0,1,middle age

Somatic disease may induce functional disorder of brain, and generate psychiatric symptoms due to the change of psychological and social environment. The proportion of depression in elder people based on the chronic somatic disease is much higher, and thus the fatality of them increases. Objective: To investigate the influence of single antidepressant, and therapeutic alliance of psychological and drug treatment on the rehabilitation of patients with elderly chronic somatic disease complicated with depression. Design: Randomized and controlled grouping experiment. Setting: Department of Senile Disease of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology. Participants: Totally 10 2 patients were hospitalized in the Department of Senile Disease of Tongji Hospital Affiliated to Huazhong University of Science and Technology from March 2000 to January 2003, and all the patients had sleep disorder to a different extent, and suffered from symptoms of heart and alimentary tract which could not be explained as organic diseases, and chronic pain or systemic symptom. Their score of Zung scale was > 40 points with average of (48.83±4.15) points. The patients were randomly divided into the drug group (n=46) and the combined treatment group (n=56). Each patient had more than two somatic symptoms in the two groups and more than 81.0% of them had three somatic symptoms. Methods: According to the different primary diseases in patients of the two groups, regular treatment was given routinely. Oral thymoleptics fluoxetine of 20 mg/d 5-hydroxyltryptamine reuptake restrainer with 20 mg/d was administered, the dose of which could be added to 40 mg/d according to the pathogenetic conditions. At the beginning of the administration of oral antidepressant drugs, the patients in the combined treatment group were given the effective psychological direction immediately, which included: 1 The focal point of depression and fear was identified, and the comfort and psychological aid were given to reduce the anxiety. 2 The basic knowledge related to the disease was supplied, and the pathogenetic condition and the prognosis were told to the patients objectively. The family and society were encouraged to learn the rehabilitative skill and improve their self-care ability of daily life. 3 Demand of patient was satisfied as far as possible, and the family and society were encouraged to give the patients adequate psychological support and life support. The patient and the family were assisted to establish favorable communication. The feeling of loneliness and isolation was reduced, and the sense of safety was increased. The depression status and the quality of life of the patients in the two groups were evaluated before the treatment and at 2 and 8 weeks after treatment with the Zung scale and the Spitzer quality of life index score (QLI), including 5 aspects: Activity, daily life, health, support and perspective. The highest score was 10 points. The lowest was 0, and the higher the score, the better the quality of life is. Main outcome measures: The results of the Zung scale and the QLI score evaluated before the treatment and at 2 and 8 weeks after the treatment. Results: The treatment of the patients in the two groups was all finish ed and all of them entered the result analysis. 1 The total points of Zung scale in the drug group and the combined treatment group at 2 weeks after the treatment indicated that there was significant difference in comparison with those before the treatment (41.12±2.60, 48.83±4.15, t =10.67, P<0.05); (40.88±3.43, 49.03±4.21, t=11.24, P<0.05). There was not significant difference in group comparison. The total points of Zung scale at 8 weeks were significantly decreased (36.11±2.87), (30.71±3.62), and there was significant difference in comparison with that before the treatment. The combined treatment group was better than the drug group in group comparison at 8 weeks after treatment. 2 there was no significant difference of QLI score at 2 weeks between the drug group and combined treatment group before and after the treatment (5.47±1.33, 5.32±1.04, 5.55±1.18, 5.27±1.35). The QLI score of drug group and combined treat merit group at 8 weeks after treatment began to rise 7.21±0.13 and 8.83 ±0.32, respectively, and there was significant difference in comparison with those before the treatment, and there was also significant difference in group comparison. Conclusion: The positive and effective combined therapy of anti-depression significantly improved the somatic symptoms of patients, no complications appeared, and most patients presented optimistic attitude to the prognosis of the primary disease. To identify the depression of elder people in earlier period is very important to promote rehabilitation of the primary disease.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33747419990,1,1,1,

Setting and subjects: Respondents (n = 8881) were community-dwelling older people (65 years and older) living independently in New South Wales, Australia, randomly sampled to participate in a computer-assisted telephone interview conducted during 1999-2000. The response rate was 71%. Responses to a food insecurity questionnaire item were collected along with sociodemographic information, living arrangements, lifestyle and self-rated health. Univariate analyses and logistic regression modelling of factors for reporting food insecurity were conducted. Results: Approximately one in 50 older people reported experiencing food insecurity in the previous 12 months attributable to inadequate finances. The analyses revealed that those at risk can be identified as more likely to report poorer health, limited financial resources, not owning their own home and living alone. Gender and age differences were also evident. Conclusion: While only a minority of older Australians reported experiencing food insecurity attributable to inadequate finances, such people are at higher risk of malnutrition and associated morbidity. Food insecurity is an important public health and equity issue in older people that can be addressed through implementing appropriate income and social support policies. © The Authors 2006.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646469359,1,1,0,

This trend should be quantitatively and qualitatively verified with ad hoc studies. The information is particularly relevant for Academic Institutions where medical students and residents in occupational medicine are trained. Objectives: To analyse the trends of clinical diagnoses and health surveillance activities conducted in the last 15 years by an Italian Institute of Occupational Health, and to gain information on the most relevant topics to be taught in academic program and to be addressed with future research. Methods: Data sources were represented by the computerised registration of a) diagnostic activities and b) health surveillance programs, conducted by the Institute of Occupational Medicine of the University of Brescia, a highly industrialized area in Northern Italy. The observation period was from 1990 to 2005. The health surveillance programs regarded workers pulled from an iron foundry, a veterinary institute, a health departments for the assistance of elderly subjects, a nursery schools and a municipal department for road maintenance. Results: Diagnostic activities were conducted on 9080 subjects, who had been referred for suspected occupational disease. The diagnosis of occupational disease was confirmed for 3759 cases. Multiple diseases were diagnosed in 1554 subjects, yielding the total number of 5721 occupational diseases. The most frequent diagnoses accounted for allergic skin disease (23.4%), followed by pneumoconiosis (20.4%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (15.9%), noise hearing loss (7.1%), musculoskeletal disorders (6.9%), respiratory allergies (6.9%), cancer (5.9%), miscellaneous (6.4%). When limited to the last quinquennium, the analysis showed a definite increase of muskuloskeltal disorders, cancer, and, although at a lesser extent, diseases due to psychosocial factors. The analysis of the health surveillance programs regarded 1207 workers, and showed that various non occupational diseases caused limitation to individual work fitness. The most frequent conditions were musculoskeletal disorders (65%) and skin diseases (14%). Conclusions: The results from these two investigations are important not only for the didactic program run by the Institute, but also because they indicate the most relevant topics to be addressed with future research, at least at a local level.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-38349148299,1,0,0,

DESIGN: A 7-year follow-up of an age-homogenous cohort. SETTING: Community based. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred ninety subjects aged 70 at baseline and 77 at follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported sleep domains and a comprehensive assessment of health variables, including psychosocial, physical, and functional factors, at ages 70 and 77. RESULTS: GSS was found to be poor in 25% of subjects at ages 70 and 77, with an estimated average annual remission rate of 7% and an annual incidence of 2.4%. Poor GSS at ages 70 and 77 was significantly associated with difficulty falling asleep, awakening feeling tired, two or more nocturnal awakenings, and taking sleeping tablets. Significant cross-sectional associations were found at age 70 and 77 between poor GSS and poor self-rated health, general fatigue, depression, dependence in one or more activities of daily living, and low level of physical activity. In a regression analysis, risk factors at age 70 for subsequent poor GSS were loneliness, depression, poor self-rated health, economic difficulties, back pain, obesity, and prior poor GSS. The only significant long-term association was between poor GSS and poor self-rated health. GSS did not influence mortality data. CONCLUSION: Poor GSS in older people is common and chronic. Its chief determinants are loneliness, depression, poor self-rated health, economic difficulties, back pain, and obesity. It predicts poor self-rated health but not increased mortality. © 2006, Copyright the Authors.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645065146,1,1,0,

Design and Methods: After receiving signed informed consent from each participant, we randomly assigned 66 caregivers to an Internet-based intervention or to a no-intervention control group. The intervention group received computers and training in order to access a password-protected Web site with links to information, e-mail, and threaded discussion. Unique to the Web site was a video-conferencing link that supported caregivers' participation in a 10-session, manual-guided psychosocial support group, followed by 12 additional online sessions facilitated by a group member. Participants completed health-status and stress-response measures at baseline and 6-month follow-up. Results: Content analysis of archived video sessions showed (a) reliable adherence to the manual-guided support-group intervention and (b) online group discussion themes similar to those in face-to-face caregiver support groups. Analyses of stress-response outcome data showed significant between-group differences, with the intervention group experiencing a decline in stress compared with an escalation in stress for the control group. Implications: Despite the limitations of this pilot study in terms of limited sample size and 54% dropout of control participants at 6-month follow-up, the results provide preliminary supportive evidence for a technology-based psychosocial intervention for family caregivers of individuals with neurodegenerative disease.

Three strata result from the interaction of patients' financial status, the presence or absence of bothersome pain and psychosocial problems, and their confidence with self-care. A majority of ambulatory patients generally fall in the first stratum. More resources are required in the 2 remaining strata to attain patient-centered, collaborative care. Because the planned-care management strategy is behaviorally sophisticated, it is likely to be more efficient and effective than strategies based on concepts of disease management that focus on either a single disease or groupings of patients who are ""high utilizers"" of healthcare. We conclude that modern technologies and related approaches make resource planning for patient-centered, collaborative care feasible and desirable. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749342110,0,1,maybe,

Activity reports and alert notifications were sent to professional caregivers who provided care to residents participating in the study. Diagnostic use of the monitoring data was assessed. Nonmemory care residents were surveyed and assessed using the Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) instrument. Pre- and post-installation SWLS scores were compared. Older adult participants accepted monitoring.

Material and methods: three lines of investigation were developed: a) qualitative research to analyse early retirement in Asturias, which employed the techniques of in-depth interview and group discussion, b) group workshops for individuals taking early retirement from the mining industry, and c) a register of a questionnaire about interests. Results: there are certain aspects to early retirement from mining that were viewed as highly positive, for example, better health and safety. However, demands also arise caused by a lack of personal skills to enable reorganisation of a new rhythm of daily life, as well as the absence of a social role. Some of the needs identified were related to the individual (preparation for coping with a new situation, training to acquire skills leading to healthy, meaningful occupation). Others were more at the group level, such as the need for collective meetings and for roles that involve social acknowledgement. The interests detected (training, leisure time and voluntary work) were grouped as follows: new technologies, social communication, social support, handicrafts, health, environment and tradition.

Method. - Based on existing data, service provision, number of professionals working in services, funding arrangements, pathways intocare, user/carer involvement and specific issues are reported. Results. - In Madrid, mental health services are organized into 11 zones/areas, divided into 36 districts, where there is a mental healthoutpatient service with a multi-disciplinary team. Home treatment and psychosocial rehabilitation services have been developed. Specialist programmes exist for vulnerable client groups, including Children and Adolescents, Addiction/Alcohol and Older People. The Madrid Mental Health Plan (2003-2008) is regarded as the key driver in implementing service improvement and increased mental health and well-being in Madrid. It has a meant global budget increase of more than 10% for mental health services. Results of the first 2 years are: an increase in mental health staff employed (17%), four new hospitalization units, 50% increase in places for children and adolescents Day Hospitals, 62 new beds in long care residential units, development of specific programmes for the homeless and gender-based violence, a significant investment in information systems (450 new computers) and development of best practice and operational guidelines.

Discussion - Unlike some European countries, public mental health service is the main heath care provider. There are no voluntary agenciescollaborating with mental health care. Continuity of care and coordination between all mental health resources is essential in service delivery. Increased demand of care for minor psychiatric disorders, children and adolescent mental health care, and implementation of rehabilitation and residential facilities for chronic patients are outstanding challenges similar to those in other European capitals.

Along with social deprivation, the rural communities in China retain many Chinese traditions that involve high levels of social supports. Studying such a population might offer insights into the cause and prevention of depression that may be applicable in developing and developed countries. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, household-based, community survey in rural China, we aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for depression among older people who had a low income (mean annual per capita income of about US $280) and high social support in 16 villages in Anhui Province. Participants included 754 men and 846 women aged 60 years or older. Depression was diagnosed using the Geriatric Mental State and the Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy. Risk factors, collected from the standard questionnaire and physical measurements, were examined in a stepwise multiple logistic regression model. Results: The prevalence of depression (world age standardized) was 6.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8%-7.3%). Of all persons, 1374 older persons (85.9%) living with family members. Depression was significantly and independently associated with female gender, low family income, lack of social support, relationship problems, poor health status, and adverse life events in the past 2 years. The risk of depression increased in those eating meat less than once a week (multiple-adjusted odds ratio, 2.20; 95% CI, 1.20-4.03), not watching television (odds ratio, 1.76; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-3.00), and having undetected hypertension (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.05-3.01). Conclusions: Older people in rural China have a lower risk of depression than those in Western countries. Low socioeconomic status showed a ""dose-response"" relationship with depression, and social supports were much more common, which were protective for depression. Further exploration of Chinese culture and tradition may yield universal insights into preventive factors for depression in older people. ©2005 American Medical Association.

Pilot objectives were: 1. To determine the feasibility of postal multidimensional frailty screening instruments; 2. to identify the need for home visits to elderly. Methods: Main study: The main study concerns a randomized controlled in primary care practices (PCP) with 18 months follow-up and blinded PCPs. Frail persons aged 75 years or older and living at home but neither terminally ill nor demented from 33 PCPs were eligible. Trained community nurses (1) visit patients at home and assess the care needs with the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care, a multidimensional computerized geriatric assessment instrument, enabling direct identification of problem areas; (2) determine the care priorities together with the patient; (3) design and execute interventions according to protocols; (4) and visit patients at least five times during a year in order to execute and monitor the care-plan. Controls receive usual care. Outcome measures are Quality of life, and Quality Adjusted Life Years; time to nursing home admission; mortality; hospital admissions; health care utilization. Pilot 1: Three brief postal multidimensional screening measures to identify frail health among elderly persons were tested on percentage complete item response (selected after a literature search): 1) Vulnerable Elders Screen, 2) Strawbridge's frailty screen, and 3) COOP-WONCA charts. Pilot 2: Three nurses visited elderly frail patients as identified by PCPs in a health center of 5400 patients and used an assessment protocol to identify psychosocial and medical problems. The needs and experiences of all participants were gathered by semi-structured interviews. Discussion: The design holds several unique elements such as early identification of frail persons combined with case-management by nurses. From two pilots we learned that of three potential postal frailty measures, the COOP-WONCA charts were completed best by elderly and that preventive home visits by nurses were positively evaluated to have potential for quality of care improvement. © 2005 van Hout et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-26444489161,1,1,1,

Using a sample of 15 workers ages 52 to 67 and a qualitative interview methodology, the authors determined that retention of employer-provided health care benefits may be a critical factor in encouraging older workers to remain on the job. Further, workers in this sample highly valued the opportunity for positive social interaction on their jobs and indicated that more flexible work schedules would be one change the employer could make that would have the most immediate impact on their decision to retire. They also said that more money, more recognition/appreciation, more autonomy, and more opportunities to develop skills and knowledge would potentially keep them on the job longer. The authors conclude with a discussion of implications for practice and research. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008862742,0,0,0,52+

The study compares 10 elder computer participants and 10 nonparticipants by means of open-ended interviews. Three primary themes emerged from the interviews. The first concerns the different conceptions of old age held by the cyber-participants and the nonparticipants, and in particular, differing views on learning capacity in later life. The second is related to the varying conceptions of time in old age, and orientation to the past or to the future. The third theme relates to the way in which the elderly persons involved in the virtual world relate to their computer, attributing human qualities to this new addition to their social network. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The effectiveness of the 'Vulnerability to Abuse' Screening Scale (VASS) in predicting three year health outcomes was investigated among women enrolled in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health, now known as Women's Health Australia. Methods: The sample comprised a cohort of 10,421 women aged 73-78 who completed the 1996 and 1999 postal surveys (attrition rate 19.5%). The Time 2 sample had a small bias towards lower risk for elder abuse at Time 1 and better health on SF-36 and self-rated health. The VASS is a 12-item self-report measure with 4 factors: vulnerability, coercion, dependence and dejection. Results: Overall, physical health (PCS) declined while mental health (MCS) increased over the three year period. Decline in physical health was predicted by only the dejection factor, but not by factors which seem to more directly measure abuse. The predictive validity of the VASS for three year mental health outcomes was given partial support. Three of the four VASS factors (dejection, vulnerability, and coercion) predicted decline in mental health at the univariate level, however, after adjusting for confounders, only one VASS factor (dejection) independently predicted decline in mental health. Conclusions: While the VASS shows some promise as a marker of health risk in older women, only the dejection factor proved consistently predictive of declining health status. Further research is needed to determine longer term predictive validity of the scale and to gain a clearer picture of how abusive experiences impact on older women's health.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-3042718475,1,1,0,

Although a substantial number of studies have identified the prevalence of depression experienced by older adults living in the community and the factors that may precipitate this depression, few have focussed on depression in older people who attend day centres. Consequently, there is no literature suggesting how depression in this population may be psychologically managed. Aims. The aim of this paper is to present the results of a pilot study investigating the incidence of depression in people attending a London Age Concern day centre, and its associations with perceptions of handicap, loneliness, social support networks, satisfaction with social support, and satisfaction with life. Methods. A quasi-experimental, cross-sectional pilot study was conducted with attendees at a London Age Concern day centre between November 1998 and January 1999. The day centre manager selected a convenience sample of 24 of 156 participants. Inclusion criteria were that participants must attend the day centre regularly and be over or equal to 65 years of age. The exclusion criterion was known psychiatric illness. Participants were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State-Automated Geriatric Examination for Computer Assisted Taxonomy, which identifies caseness of psychopathology and includes a loneliness subscale, and completed the Satisfaction with Life Scale, Social Support Questionnaire and London Handicap Scale. Results. There was a higher level of depression in this day centre setting than that found in other community-based studies. There were the expected significant associations between depression and loneliness, and depression and satisfaction with life. However, unexpectedly, there were no associations between depression and social support, or depression and handicap. Conclusions. The study has several limitations. However, the high level of depression and significant relationships between depression, loneliness and satisfaction with life may indicate that the social function of day centres is not meeting expectations. This suggests that there could be a role for community mental health nurses in offering psychosocial interventions to alleviate some of the distress experienced.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-1842841754,1,1,0,

Among these, we can point out, for instance, the extreme poverty and violence in their different modalities. Nowadays this seems an accepted form of social coexistence. For many inhabitants in the world, it has become part of daily life; and it seems that we have learned how to live with it, or rather, how to survive with it. In our daily lives, there seems to be a violence acceptance and tolerance which appears to be strongly allowed by cultural values which consider it as a valid and even natural way to manage conflicts. These values can become standards that reinforce men's domain over women, children and the elder. In addition, they may hold up the use of excessive force towards citizens on behalf of ""governability"" and the confrontation between groups with ideological, economic or political differences. In this violence-tolerant context, there is a kind of violence which is aimed specifically at women due to the inequal relationship between men an women maintained by gender roles existing in our societies. By socializing men and women as contraries, only one group holds up the power, thus generating the conditions and reproduction of violence that, in the case of women, frequently crosses the border of sexuality. Sexual violence is a mostly masculine form of violence that works as a mechanism which limits and impedes the development of women in public settings. The lack of information and the silence around this kind of violence contribute to keep it hidden and minimized, for what erroneous beliefs have been generated regarding their causes. This type of beliefs are known as ""rape myths"", and they have been constituted mainly as a research line in the United States and Canada. The objective of the present work is to show the construct's validity and the Acceptance of the Violence and Rape Myths scale's reliability in a sample of university students. Method: An evaluative comparative, transversal, ex post facto study was carried out using an intentional non-probabilistic sample of 300 university students from three different departments, 40% of them where male and 60% female from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). The instruments used where Velicer's Violence Acceptance Scale (38) and the Scale of Acceptance of Myths of Violation built up taking as a base the eight original items of the scale of Burt (5) and 4 of the scale of Struckman-Johnson (32). Results: The general measurements of the Violence Acceptance Scale reactives show an inclination to disagree with the use of violence as a way to solve conflicts but, at the same time, it shows a tendency to agree with ""the use of military violence in international interventions"" and with ""the necessity of manufacturing weapons"". In the case of the Rape Myth Acceptance, it was appreciated that the general means where slightly superior, with the higher ones displaying a propensity to agree with the statement ""when a woman uses short or tight clothing, provokes harassment"". The factorial analysis came out with the following outputs: The Violence Acceptance Scale gave evidence for three factors (general alpha=.83). Factor 1 corresponding to the ""family violence acceptance"" dimension (α=.89). Factor 2 ""violent disciplinary strategies acceptance"" (α=.71). Factor 3 ""military violence acceptance"" (α=.67). The Rape Myth Scale came out with two factors (alpha general =.85). Factor 1 corresponding to ""the woman's culpability"" dimension (α=.82). Factor 2 corresponds to ""invulnerability/culpability"". Invulnerability implies beliefs sustaining that raped women deserve such assaults if they have behaved ""inappropriately"". Culpability justifies the reasons by which a man can not be raped and puts blame on men who are raped (a=.80). In the other hand, the intra- and inter-correlation between the scales dimensions demonstrates a greater acceptance of the violent disciplinary strategies and a significant association with the acceptance of family violence. The acceptance of family violence was the dimension more closely associated with a woman's culpability and a man's invulnerability beliefs. That is to say, that those who consider acceptable to beat their couple or child, have a tendency to blame women for their own rape and believe that men can not be raped at all. The acceptance of violent disciplinary strategies is associated, in a lower level, with women's culpability and men's rape invulnerability. Military violence acceptance nearly correlated with women's culpability but it did not correlate at all with men's vulnerability. Discussion: This is a study on a very common current issue, which is nevertheless relatively unknown in our country. Because of that, it is necessary to consider it as the beginning of an entire investigation line. This work has been made with a very specific and non-representative sample which prevents us from making generalizations. However, given the severity of the violence problem in our country, we consider that this first contribution could open new lines of research in terms of validation of instruments regarding the matter. The Violence Acceptance Scale showed well-defined dimensions as the one for family violence acceptance. The violent disciplinary strategies dimension reflects a kind of education used throughout history. The acceptance of military violence is evident as a form of institutional violence, which uses justification mechanisms that in many cases coerce some groups against others. The Rape Myth Scale obtained the first dimension, named ""raped women's culpability"". The second factor, ""men's rape invulnerability"", formed a dimension that reports a fake belief that man can not be raped. It is appropriate to say that military violence obtained the highest acceptation mean; such outcomes reveal the need to make further research on this particular subject. It is also necessary to do more exhaustive research on these topics, assuming that violence its not perceived as an isolated incident or set of practices, but rather as norms that are accepted or not depending on the context. A change is urgent in order to stop violence becoming customary in our societies. To accomplish that, human and material resources need to be mobilized so that a campaign against all kinds of violence can be developed to transform such events into ones that would not be tolerated by any society or culture.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-10944236069,1,0,0,

RESULT: The health related characteristics which involved body mass index, mental status, use of assistant devices, perceived health, concern of health, and social support were different among the groups and more aggravated by aging. Health behaviors and health problems were also significantly aggravated in the old old group. The self-care levels measured by ADL, physical activity, and self-care ability scores were also significantly decreased in the old old group.

Method: A representative sample born during 1901-02 was examined at 70, 75, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 90, 92, 95, 97, 99 and 100 years of age, another during 1906-07 was examined at 70 and 79 years of age, and samples born between 1922 and 1930 were examined at 70 years of age. The study includes psychiatric examinations and key informant interviews performed by psychiatrists, physical examinations performed by geriatricians, psychometric testings, blood sampling, computerized tomographies of the brain, cerebrospinal fluid analyses, anthropometric measurements, and psychosocial background factors. Results: Mental disorders are found in approximately 30% of the elderly, but is seldom detected or properly treated. Incidence of depression and dementia increases with age. The relationship between blood pressure and Alzheimer's disease is an example of how cross-sectional and longitudinal studies yield completely different results. Brain imaging is an important tool in epidemiologic studies of the elderly to detect silent cerebrovascular disease and other structural brain changes. The high prevalence of psychotic symptoms is an example of the importance to use several sources of information to detect these symptoms. Dementia should be diagnosed in all types of studies in the elderly, as it influences several outcomes such as mortality, blood pressure, and rates of depression. Suicidal feelings are rare in the elderly and are strongly related to mental disorders. Conclusion: Modern epidemiologic studies in population samples should be longitudinal and include assessments of psychosocial risk factors as well as comprehensive sets of biologic markers, such as brain imaging, neurochemical analyses, and genetic information to maximize the contribution that epidemiology can provide to increase our knowledge about the etiology of mental disorders.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0742321809,1,1,0,

DESIGN: The Atlanta Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies and Intervention Techniques, a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with three arms (TC, BT, and education (ED)). Intervention length was 15 weeks, with primary outcomes measured before and after intervention and at 4-month follow-up. Falls were monitored continuously throughout the study. SETTING: Persons aged 70 and older living in the community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 200 participants, 162 women and 38 men; mean age was 76.2. MEASUREMENTS: Biomedical (strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, body composition), functional instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and psychosocial well-being (Center for Epidemiological Studies for Depression scale, fear of falling questionnaire, self-perception of present and future health, mastery index, perceived quality of sleep, and intrusiveness) variables. RESULTS: Grip strength declined in all groups, and lower extremity range of motion showed limited but statistically significant changes. Lowered blood pressure before and after a 12-minute walk was seen following TC participation. Fear of falling responses and intrusiveness responses were reduced after the TC intervention compared with the ED group (P=.046 and P=.058, respectively). After adjusting for fall risk factors, TC was found to reduce the risk of multiple falls by 47.5%. CONCLUSION: A moderate TC intervention can impact favorably on defined biomedical and psychosocial indices of frailty. This intervention can also have favorable effects upon the occurrence of falls.

Data are derived from 2,285 married older adults (born between 1903 and 1937) who participated in face-to-face interviews for the Dutch survey on 'Living arrangements and social networks of older adults' conducted in 1992. Childhood and adulthood SES were indicated by the father's and own level of education and occupation. Multivariate analyses showed that SES in adulthood has more impact on network features in old age than father's SES. People with low lifetime SES or with downward SES mobility had small networks, low instrumental and emotional support from non-kin, but high instrumental support from kin, when compared with the upwardly mobile or those with high lifetime SES. The level of education was a better indicator of network differences than occupational prestige. It is concluded that obtaining a high SES during life pays off in terms of having more supportive non-kin relationships in old age. The small networks and less supportive non-kin relationships of low-status older adults make them more vulnerable to situations in which kin are unavailable or less willing to provide support. This study underscores the distinction between types of support and types or relationships in the SES-network association. Further research on the social pathways of socio-economic inequality in health and wellbeing should take these distinctions into account.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141906224,0,1,0,

These attitudes were compared with their identified needs by an occupational therapist and in relation to perception of social engagement, loneliness and overall contentment with life. From a sample of 102 participants who were interviewed using a standardized procedure, 53 persons were included in the study. The results indicated that attitudes among elderly people towards social and occupational engagement and change have a greater influence on their rehabilitation status than their disability as indicated by their health condition and limitations in activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living. The elderly people who accepted rehabilitation were more able, and were better equipped and better supported with assistive technology, than those who declined rehabilitation. Rehabilitation needs that the occupational therapists recognized were not always shared by the disabled elderly people, for several reasons; one reason of particular importance was the elderly person's attitude towards change and social engagement.

Excessive prescribing, imperfect therapeutic adherence, treatment modifications after hospitalization, and oversized drug packages result in home storage of leftover drugs, resulting in a waste of healthcare resources. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients aged ≥75 years hospitalized for >24 hours during a 6-month period in an urban teaching hospital in Switzerland were eligible for inclusion in a study collecting sociodemographics, medical, functional, and psychosocial characteristics. Six months later, a research nurse visited the patients at home and recorded the names, number of tablets, and expiration dates of all open or intact drug packages, and the doses actually taken. Acquisition costs of these drugs were computed. RESULTS: One hundred ninety-five patients were included (127 women; mean age 82.2 ± 4.8 y, range 75-96). They had a total of 2059 drugs (mean per patient 10.3 ± 6.7, range per patient 1-42), corresponding to a total cost of (US) $62 826 (mean per patient 322 ± 275, range per patient 10-1571). Self-reported drug intake was regular for 36% of the drugs (46.5% of total costs) and occasional for 11% (6.1%), whereas 35.7% (30.1%) had been stopped during the last month. Cardiovascular drugs amounted to 36.6% of the drugs and 55.5% of the costs. None of the patients' characteristics was significantly associated with a greater number of drugs and higher costs. CONCLUSIONS: Drugs stored at home by elderly patients were worth about $320 per patient. Only about one-third of these drugs were regularly taken.

The subjects were a convenience sample of people aged 65 or older who were recruited from a retirement center in the south of Taiwan (N = 42), and a control group of elderly living with their family (N = 33). The Tennes see Self-Concept Scale (TSCS) was used to measure self-concept. The Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire-Chinese Version (MFAQ) was applied to measure the function of activities of daily living. A total of 37 subjects from the retirement center group and 28 subjects from the home group completed these questionnaires. The data were analyzed using SPSS/PC software version 10.0. After multiple linear regression analysis, the results showed that he elderly residing in the retirement center had significantly lower Personal Self and Family Self scores. The variables of ADL, sex and subjective well-being had effects on the total self-concept. Female elderly individuals also revealed significant higher scores than males in the subscales of Moral-Ethical, Family Self, Social Self, Identity, Satisfaction Self.

This paper examines whether measures of psychosocial disability used with those of cognition are more useful than measures of cognition alone, particularly in early dementia. A measure of cognition and two instruments of caregiver burden, used as routine clinical outcome measures of three types of Old Age Psychiatry dementia services, were examined. All cases with dementia in a memory clinic (MC; n = 149), a community mental health service for older people (CMHT; n = 120) and a specialist dementia day hospital (DH; n = 118), in one NHS district were followed up at 12 months. Measures of cognition (MMSE), behaviour, caregiver coping (Problem Checklist; PC) and caregiver mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; HAD) were taken at baseline (MC, n = 48; CMHT, n = 113; DH, n = 55) and at follow-up (MC, n = 35; CMHT, n = 34; DH, n = 23). At baseline, all three groups had an average MMSE score of 'mild impairment' but measures of behaviour and caregiver burden showed subtle between-group differences. At the 12-month follow-up, cognition remained stable in all groups, but the frequency of day-to-day problems increased and caregiver mood deteriorated in families receiving DH support. The use of psychosocial measures of disability in conjunction with those of cognition, are important in the definition and longitudinal measurement of intervention and support in early dementia.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-12244252730,0,0,1,

On this sense, the new technologies, such as computer science, have become a basic tool of our society, and the elderly, without no doubt will be able to benefit from it. The objective of the present work is to know what the elderly think about themes related to computer science and internet, as well as their capacity of accessing to new technologies, and the knowledge that they have about them. Methods: A standarized interview has been made, it's self designed, to a sample of 105 elderly people living in the city of A Coruña. Results: Although most elderly people don't have a personal computer neither have worked with a computer application, would like to learn more about this field. When they are connected to internet they do it from social and/or educative centres, not having great problems neither in its handling or navigation. Conclusions: It's necessary to promote the use of computer science on the elderly people, since in a future it can constitute an essential tool in the intervention on inherent problems to aging such as isolation or loneliness among others.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0043195353,1,1,0,

This randomized controlled trial assessed the psychosocial impact of providing Internet access to older adults over a five-month period. One hundred volunteers from four congregate housing sites and two nursing facilities were randomly assigned to receive Internet training or to a wait list control group. The pre & post measures included the UCLA Loneliness scale, modified CES Depression scale, a measure of locus of control, computer attitudes, number of confidants, and overall quality of life. Participants received nine hours of small group training in six sessions over two weeks. Computers were available for continued use over five months and the trainer was available two hours/week for questions. At the end of the trial, 60% of the intervention group continued to use the Internet on a weekly basis. Although there was a trend toward decreased loneliness and depression in intervention subjects compared to controls, there were no statistically significant changes from baseline to the end of trial between groups. Among Internet users (n = 29) in the intervention group there were trends toward less loneliness, less depression, more positive attitudes toward computers, and more confidants than among intervention recipients who were not regular users (n = 19) of this technology. Most elderly participants in this trial learned to use the Internet and the majority continued to use it on a weekly basis. The psychosocial impact of Internet use in this sample suggested trends in a positive direction. Further research is needed to determine more precisely, which older adults, residing in which environmental contexts are more likely than others to benefit from this rapidly expanding information and communication link.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036687838,0,1,1,

In Spain, there are no reliable data about the impact of pain in general population. The aim of the study was to estimate the prevalence of acute and chronic pain in the Spanish general population. An epidemiological observational population-based cross-sectional study was carried out by means of a telephone survey. Multistep stratified quota-adjusted sampling was performed with people aged 18-95 years. A computer-assisted questionnaire was administered, covering physical pain symptoms, site, frequency, perceived cause, therapeutic measures and interference with daily life activities. There were 11 980 useful contacts, with 5000 effective interviews (42% of useful sample). Of the interviewees, 29.6% (95% confidence interval, 28.3-30.8%) reported having had pain the day before (women, 37.6%; men, 20.9%) and 43.2% the week before. Most common pain sites were lower extremities (22.7%) and back (cervical and lumbar levels) (21.5%), followed by head (20.5%). Frequency of pain increased with age, reaching 42.6% for people older than 65 years. Among people complaining of pain during the last day or week, duration of symptoms was higher than 3 months in 54% (chronic pain), representing 23.4% of the Spanish general population; most common causes of chronic pain were arthritis, rheumatism and migraine. Regarding treatment, 61.7% of people complaining of pain said they were taking drugs. Source of drug treatment advice was a physician or a nurse in 66.4% of cases and self-prescription in 29%. It is concluded that pain, particularly chronic pain, has a high prevalence in the Spanish general population and a significant impact on occupational and social relationships. © 2002 European Federation of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036392138,0,0,0,

The central question is whether this change in the location of care from the psychiatric hospital to district-based services has benefited the patients. The objectives of this review are to examine the evidence on which an answer to the above question might be based. Method: Much of the relevant research comes from the 13-year programme of the Team for the Assessment of Psychiatric Services conducted in London, but other research will be reviewed as appropriate. Results and conclusions: Long-stay, non-demented patients, including the elderly, enjoy a better quality of life in the community homes compared with the psychiatric hospitals. Public attitudes constitute an obstacle to social integration into the healthy community, but can be ameliorated with local educational programmes. The provision of work has been unsatisfactory, but the development of social firms holds some promise. Patients with dementia receive better care in community nursing homes compared with hospital wards, according to their relatives' opinions, backed up by observational studies. The part of the service which is most unsatisfactory is the admission facilities. This is due to a variety of causes, including a failure to plan for the admission needs of discharged long-stay patients, the virtual absence of rehabilitation units in the community and an inadequate provision of a range of sheltered accommodation. However, these problems could be resolved with adequate investment in innovative facilities.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034856393,1,0,0,

Although depression has a recognised association with stroke, the role of 'silent' cerebrovascular pathology associated with carotid stenosis and peripheral vascular disease remains unexplored. Methods. Four groups of 25 community residents aged 65 and over were recruited, comprising first anterior circulation stroke, carotid stenosis accompanied by transient ischaemic attack, peripheral vascular disease and a non-vascular control group. All participants were interviewed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD] (including a modified version) and Geriatric Depression Scale. DSM IV criteria for major depression and measures of handicap, social support and physical illness were also administered. Head computerised tomography (CT) scans were performed on stroke patients to examine the relationship between lesion location and depression. Results. One hundred patients were interviewed. Stroke patients were more likely to live in a nursing home and had less social support than other groups. Mean scores on the modified Hamilton and Geriatric Depression Scales were higher in stroke and carotid stenosis groups than controls. Patients with stroke did not show a higher prevalence of DSM IV major depressive disorder than those with carotid stenosis. There was no relationship between the presence of lesions affecting the frontal/subcortical system and prevalence/severity of depression. Limitations. Small numbers, mortality of stroke patients in hospital, possible selection bias in the control group and use of a previously unvalidated depression rating scale all limit the study. Conclusions. A possible role for carotid stenosis in the pathogenesis of depressive disorder is suggested. Larger studies incorporating brain imaging may be required to examine the mechanism of this association more closely. The use of a shorter version of the HRSD in older people with cerebrovascular disease may warrant further exploration.

In a 3-month randomized prospective trial, telecommunications terminals were installed in the private residences of computer-illiterate persons, 65-years-of-age and older, providing visiting nurses the opportunity to teach computer use with three different training methods. The control group had similar weekly nurse visits, but no computer terminal use. Pre-posttests using the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale and the Geriatric Depression Scale compared change in self-esteem and depression scores of computer-use clients with the scores of the control group clients. Interactive computer use, alone, did not significantly change scores. Compared to the control group, however, there was a significant change toward improved self-esteem and depression when interactive computer use was accompanied with weekly nurse computer training. Weekly training with a significant other, as a substitute for the nurse trainer, significantly improved self-esteem scores but not depression scores. Interactive computer use was not associated with decreased self-esteem or increased depression. Attitude changes and responses to the particular telecommunication service used in this study were mixed, suggesting future research should be based on improved telecommunication systems with access to programs that have greater practical application to the needs of elderly clients.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035287163,0,1,1,

Methods: Focus group interviews were conducted with 14 physicians of varied specialties and 12 patients with arthritis from Oxford Health Plans. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed. Analyses were performed by using text processing programs from the Unix computer operating system. Common themes were identified and summarized. Results: Physicians and patients agreed that pain and loss of functioning were the most important problems patients with arthritis faced and that arthritis was incurable. Both agreed that doctors need more time to discuss individual concerns with their patients. More information about diet and exercise and strategies for reducing social isolation were needed. Doctors and patients disagreed about the value of nutritional supplements, joint replacement, and referrals to specialists. Disagreement also existed regarding the belief that pain was an inevitable part of the aging process, and with respect to the use of drug and surgical therapy. Conclusions: Areas of agreement and disagreement were discussed. Collaboration and negotiation were identified as constructive responses to conflicts between physicians and patients. Patients need to be taught self-care strategies to minimize the impact of arthritis on their daily lives. The specific continuing education needs of physicians involved training in exercise, nutrition, occupational and physical therapy, prescriptions, and alternative medicine. Copyright (C) 2000 by W.B.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional observational. SETTING: Urban PCC (metropolitan area of Barcelona). PATIENTS: Users > or = 65 of a PCC between 01/11/97 and 31/01/98. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A random sample of 114 people was chosen. The MGA protocol was used to screen disorders in: hearing, vision, mobility, affective state, cognitive state, social support, functionalism of the instrumental activities of daily life. The clinical histories provided age, sex and information previously recorded on these disorders. 102 people were surveyed (participation: 89.5%). The MGA enabled more problems to be detected, with the difference very marked in some cases such as visual disorders: 55.9% (46.2-65.5) with MGA and 23.5% (15.3-31.8) with CH. There was poor concordance between MGA and CH. For example, neither the 73.3% (54.1-87.7) of the hearing disorders detected with the MGA, nor 94.1% (71.3-99.8) of the cognitive deterioration detected with the MGA had been previously recorded in the CH.

This article summarises the trend towards briefer screening instruments, and the integration of mental health screening with other assessments. The study aimed to validate a single question depression screen which had previously shown adequate sensitivity and specificity in a new context: a multi-faceted assessment instrument used by nurse practitioners within a community sample of over 75 years olds. The GMS-AGECAT computerised interview assessment was used as a 'gold standard' to determine the accuracy of the depression question in this new setting. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients were screened by their own nurse practitioners, of whom 100 consenting patients underwent a further interview with a research assistant using the GMS-AGECAT. The prevalence of depression was 30%, the sensitivity of the question was 67%, and its specificity 60% (compared with 88% and 71% previously). Responses indicating disability and loneliness were more closely correlated with depression than the depression screen itself. Relevant factors may include: the derivation of the question, the effect of a different sample, altered reliability when used by multiple interviewers, differing patient expectations, and the wording and context of the question within the multi-faceted screening instrument. Depression screening questions need repeated validation when used in different contexts. Patient and staff expectations may influence how screening instruments are used in practice in a way that may also alter reliability. Further studies are needed to establish the causes of loss of validity when screening approaches are used in new settings.

Aims: To identify such risk factors. Method: Over 5200 older people (≥65 years), randomly selected from Liverpool, were interviewed using the Geriatric Mental State (GMS) and the Minimum Data Set (MDS). The computer- assisted diagnosis AGECAT identified 483 cases and 575 sub-cases of depression and 2451 with no mental problems. Logistic regression was employed to examine factors relevant to caseness. Results: In multiple logistical regression, odds ratios (ORs) were significantly high for being female (2.04,95% CI 1.56-2.69), widowed (2.00, 1.18-3.39), having alcohol problems (4.37, 1.40-2.94), physical disablement (2.03, 1.40-2.94), physical illness (1.98, 1.25-3.15), taking medications to calm down (10.04, 6.41-15.71), and dissatisfaction with life (moderate 4.54, 3.50-5.90; more severe 29.00, 16.00-52.59). Good social networks reduced the ORs. If sub-cases were included as controls, the statistical significance was reduced. Conclusions: Age was not associated with depression in later life whereas gender, physical disablement and dissatisfaction with life were. The sub-cases shared many risk factors with cases, suggesting that prevention may need to be attempted at an early stage.

Design - The study is based on questionnaire data from the Adolescent Health and Lifestyle Surveys of 1985, 1987, and 1989. Setting - The whole of Finland. Participants - A representative sample of 8355 adolescents. The response rate was 79%. Measurement and main results - The relation between social mobility and health related behaviours among 16 and 18 year old young people was studied. The measure of social mobility was based on a combination of the social class of origin and achieved social position measured by the present educational status, educational attainment, and labour market position. Three mobility groups were constructed: the downwardly mobile, the upwardly mobile and the stable. Health related behaviours in an upwardly or downwardly mobile group were compared with a stable group from the same social class of origin by calculating relative risks (RR). RRs were assessed by calculating age and sex adjusted rate ratios approximating a Mantel-Haenszel estimate. In logistic regression analyses the independent effects of the social class of origin and the achieved social position were investigated. Most of the nine behaviours studied (smoking, alcohol use, heavy intoxication, coffee drinking, tooth brushing, consumption of sweets, lack of physical exercise, choice of bread spread, and consumption of milk) were related to the direction of mobility so that health compromising behaviours were more frequent among downwardly mobile and less frequent among upwardly mobile young people than their stable peers. Achieved social position proved to determine health related behaviours more strongly than class of origin, thus emphasising the way education facilitates both health values and behaviours as well as the future social position. Conclusions - The close relation between social mobility and health related behaviours is concluded to be a part of an explanation of social class differences in health observed among adults.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033034430,1,0,0,

DESIGN: Randomized intervention study. SETTING: General community. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-seven community-dwelling men and women (63-82 years old) who walked independently and described themselves as healthy. INTERVENTION: Thirty-minute exposure to the subconscious reinforcement of either a positive or negative stereotype of aging while subjects played a computer game. MEASUREMENTS: Pre- and postintervention measures of gait speed and percent swing time (the time spent with one foot in the air during walking). Health and psychosocial status were also evaluated. RESULTS: Significant increases in walking speed (9% ± 2%; P < .001) and percent swing time (percent change: 1.1% ± 0.4%; P = .023) were observed in subjects who received reinforcement of positive stereotypes of aging. Gait speed and swing time did not change in those who received reinforcement of negative stereotypes of aging. The observed improvements in gait were related to the positive intervention, but were not related to age, gender, health status, or psychosocial status. CONCLUSIONS: Stereotypes of aging apparently have a powerful impact on the gait of older persons. Interventions designed to enhance perceptions of old age may prove beneficial in helping to improve gait and functional independence among older persons.

Consequently, identifying environmental and behavioral factors that enhance or protect the health and functional capacity of older adults is an important goal. This study investigated the extent to which social interactions and physical activity can protect older adults from the declines in functional ability that typically occur with age and the extent to which they buffer the negative effects of widowhood on physical functioning. Data were from the Longitudinal Study of Aging, a six-year follow-up of over 7,000 respondents in the 1984 National Health Interview Survey. Using individual growth curve models which examine the effects of predictor variables on change over time, this study investigated how physical activity, social interactions, and widowhood are related to the rate of change in functional health over a six- year period. Results suggested that physical activity and social interactions each exerted independent effects on functional decline. In addition, physical activity and social interactions buffered the effects of widowhood on functional decline, especially in men who died before the end of the study. Results suggest a need for health promotion programs to encourage both physical and social activities in the elderly.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030823725,0,maybe,0,

Design and setting - A cohort of elderly people aged 65 years and over living in Settsu city, Osaka was followed for 38 months. Data on the history of health management, disability scores, and psychosocial conditions were collected in October 1992 by interview during home visits. Subjects - Of the 1491 people randomly selected from the computerised sex-age register at enrollment, 1473 were contacted and responses were obtained from 1405 (95.4%). They constituted the study cohort. Follow up was completed for 1325 (94.3%) (154 deceased and 1171 alive). Measurements and main results - From the analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, female sex, younger age group (65-74 years), use of health checks, use of basic health examination and/or cancer screening, use of daily preventive health practices, less disability, taking part in social activity, and finding life worth living were univariately statistically significantly related to survival. The estimated survival rates were highest in those with regular health checks or daily preventive health practices before 59 years of age or both basic health examination and cancer screening. From the Cox proportional hazards model, use of health checks and use of daily preventive health practices remained as statistically significant factors associated with survival, controlling for other factors such as sex, age group, medical treatment, disability scores, and psychosocial conditions, and these hazard ratios (not used v starting at 59 years) were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.25, 0.66) and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.30, 0.88), respectively. Conclusions - Health management efforts such as health checks and daily preventive health practices may increase survival in the elderly.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031007220,1,1,0,

DESIGN: The Atlanta FICSIT (Frailty and Injuries: Cooperative Studies of Intervention Techniques), a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial with three arms (TC, BT, and education [ED]). Intervention length was 15 weeks, with primary outcomes measured before and after intervention and at 4-month follow-up. Falls were monitored continuously throughout the study. SETTING: Persons aged 70 and older living in the community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 200 participants, 162 women and 38 men; mean age was 76.2. MEASUREMENTS: Biomedical (strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, body composition), functional (IADL), and psychosocial well-being (CES-D scale, fear of falling questionnaire, self- perception of present and future health, mastery index, perceived quality of sleep, and intrusiveness) variables. RESULTS: Grip strength declined in all groups, and lower extremity range of motion showed limited but statistically significant changes. Lowered blood pressure before and after a 12-minute walk was seen following TC participation. Fear of falling responses and intrusiveness responses were reduced after the TC intervention compared with the ED group (P = .046 and P = .058, respectively). After adjusting for fall risk factors, TC was found to reduce the risk of multiple falls by 47.5%. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate TC intervention can impact favorably on defined biomedical and psychosocial indices of frailty. This intervention can also have favorable effects upon the occurrence of falls.

In a sample of 35 older people with stroke, 20% had either moved into a nursing home or had died within 1 year of an initial interview. The remaining 27 older people were interviewed twice, at 1-year intervals. Comparisons were made to determine changes over 1 year for measures of health, functional status, and psychosocial status, as well as ownership, usage, and satisfaction with assistive devices. Three case studies are presented to illustrate how these older people use assistive technology in coping with the effects of stroke and their other chronic conditions. © 1995 Aspen Publishers, Inc.",Article,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029113856,0,maybe,0,

We used a scale on Burden of Dietary Therapy (BDT) that consisted of 7 questions (calorie restriction, dietary balance, regular dietary habits, restriction of favorite food, restriction of amounts of snacks, restrictions when eating out, burden of total dietary therapy). The sense of burden was rated from 1 (never burdened) to 4 (heavily burdened) for each question and the alpha coefficiency of the BDT scale was 0.80. Women, relatively younger elderly patients, hyperglycemic patients, or tablet-treated patients had higher BDT scale scores. The lower the positive family suport scores and the higher the negative social support scores, the greater was the BDT score. High BDT scores were significantly associated with low PGC moral scales (p≪.001).

In this model, limited mobility is considered a necessary but not sufficient element in risk of recurrent falls. Three other domains, attitudinal, social, and environmental, are proposed to influence fall risk only in persons with impaired mobility. Prospective cohort study. Veterans Affairs Ambulatory Care Service serving rural and urban central North Carolina. Male Veterans aged 70 or older (n = 306) were monitored prospectively for falls. At baseline, 159 screened as high‐risk mobility status and 147 as low‐risk mobility status. The primary outcome was recurrent falls. The mobility screen used for risk assignment defined immobile as unable to sit without support for 60 seconds, mobile and stable as meeting criteria for normal ambulation and stair climbing, and mobile but unstable as those who met neither of the above criteria. The high‐risk subjects were further assessed in their homes for mobility in more detail, attitude toward risk, social supports, and environmental status. Other data included demographics, functional status, diagnoses, and medications. Recurrent falls occurred in 37 (23.3%) high‐risk subjects and seven (4.8%) low‐risk subjects (relative risk = 4.8, confidence interval 2.5 to 9.6, P < 0.001). Within the high‐risk group, the probability of recurrent falls was significantly affected by degree of impaired mobility (P < 0.001), attitude toward risk (P = 0.005), and environment score (P = 0.03). A simple mobility screen can identify elders at increased risk for recurrent falls.

The principles of geriatric assessment, including the advantages and disadvantages of using quantitative instruments for multidimensional evaluation, are reviewed. The findings of a recently published meta-analysis on comprehensive geriatric assessment are discussed and its policy implications addressed. The meta-analysis includes data of 28 controlled trials comprising 4959 subjects allocated to one of five CGA types, and 4912 control subjects. Original investigators provided additional unpublished data from published reports to supplement the data base of this meta-analysis. The combined odds ratios of outcomes in CGA-assessed patients versus control patients were obtained by pooling data from individual trials with a multivariate logistic regression approach. The combined odds ratio (95% confidence interval) of home survival at 1 to 4-year follow-up was 1.7 (1.2-2.3) for inpatient geriatric evaluation and management units, 1.5 (1.1-2.0) for post-discharge home assessment services, and 1.2 (1.1-1.4) for preventive in-home assessment services. Based on these research findings, the establishment of interdisciplinary units with staff trained in multidimensional geriatric assessment for inpatient evaluation and management of frail elderly patients, is recommended. In addition, research to improve geriatric assessment technology and promote its integration into primary care has a great potential for disability prevention and nursing home use reduction in older persons.",Conference Paper,Scopus,2-s2.0-0028771714,0,maybe,maybe,

We investigated the clinical correlates with SIP scores in a cohort of patients with lesser degrees of renal dysfunction recruited from an academic general medicine practice (mean calculated creatinine clearance, 25 mL/min). Of 603 eligible patients with chronic renal insufficiency (CRI) defined as a serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and a calculated creatinine clearance less than 50 mL/min on two occasions more than 6 months apart, 360 (60%) agreed to participate. These patients were primarily elderly (mean age, 69 years) black (83%), women (69.2%), with an average of 6 years of education and a household income of $400 to $800 per month; 92% had hypertension and 57% had diabetes. The SIP was administered in-home by trained interviewers. Independent variables included demographic data, education, income, and medications (via interviewers), vital signs taken by a renal nurse, and diagnostic test results and diagnoses from patient’s computerized records. The total SIP score was the dependent variable, and its physical and psychosocial subscales were also investigated. Variables with univariate correlations with total SIP (P < 0.05) were included in a multiple regression analysis. All variables with a multivariable P value less than 0.10 were included in the final model. The mean SIP score was 24.5 ± 15.6, higher than that found in patients on dialysis. Significant (P < 0.05) independent correlates with higher SIP scores (greater disability) were lower educational level and income, prior diagnoses of coronary artery disease and stroke, and lower serum albumin. Borderline correlations (0.05 < P < 0.10) with higher SIP scores were found for white patients and women, the diagnoses of congestive heart failure and osteoarthritis, and lower serum sodium. The effect of these variables was found mostly in the SIP physical subscale. No effect of generally used measures of renal function (blood urea nitrogen [BUN], creatinine, creatinine clearance) was found. Patients with CRI are significantly disabled even before the development of ESRD, but in this population, the disability is correlated mostly with socioeconomic and comorbid conditions, not renal function. This model may help identify a subgroup of patients who would benefit from intensive outpatient management to improve function and prevent morbid events. © 1993, National Kidney Foundation.

Information from the depressed group's initial and further interviews was compared with a control group (which excluded cases of affective or organic mental illness). Univariate analysis yielded three factors that were significantly associated with the development of depression 3 years later: a lack of satisfaction with life; feelings of loneliness; and smoking. Multivariate analysis confirmed their independent effects and revealed 2 further factors attaining significance: female gender and a trigger factor, bereavement of a close figure within 6 months of the third‐year diagnosis. Some other factors traditionally associated with depression, such as poor housing, marital status and living alone, failed to attain significance as risk factors. Copyright © 1992, Wiley Blackwell.
