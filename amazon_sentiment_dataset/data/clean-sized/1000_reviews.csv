This product is better then most. Now I am sure if you want to pay over$100.00 for a monitor it MAY be better but for the price and what I need it for it works GREAT!!!! I love the choice of channels and that if the baby is sleeping I do not have to hear static and hope I can hear if he is chocking. If the baby moves this monitor picks it up. Also the light indication is a plus.Great monitor! I would recommend this product,0,0,0,baby

"The emotionally healing benefits of orange oil and lavender become immediately apparent when you apply this to your scalp. If you can find someone to give you a head massage with this product, then you can truly relax. If applying this yourself, it works well as an at home hair treatment to nourish the hair follicles and promote healthy hair growth. You will also notice your hair becoming stronger and retaining a much deeper shine. The essential oils in this product help to activate micro-circulation which may cause a slight tingling and warming of the scalp. Leave this in for about 5-10 minutes and then wash your hair as normal. You may find you need less conditioner when using this product. Many hairdressers will use this product when giving a conditioning head massage and that is where I first found out about this product. I bought my first bottle the day I had the massage. I was that impressed and I keep buying this product. ~The Rebecca Review",0,0,0,beauty
"On Salon: ""The ridicule doesn't bother you?Shirley replied:Not at all, I'm amused by people who think I'm a nutcase. I even help them write the jokes! I just insist that they're funny. If they're not funny, I think a humiliation."" Shirley started her book GOING WITHIN with the quote ""the person who knows how to laugh at himself will never cease to be amused."" p.181 ""There are no coincidence in life. All is harmonious and has meaning and follows the laws of cause and effect."" Archangel Ariel comes with the scent of sweet vanilla to Shirley on p.166, part of my number and more directly on p.136, weaving the ending of my review for FwG, Shirley wrote: ""Why am I concerned (about mosquitoes)? It was because I didn't want to die from being bitten. I knew that was ridiculous. But I didn't like the idea of them sucking my blood. I laughed to myself. Maybe that came from a vampire past-life experience."" p.113 ""Some of the most cruel and torture-loving have returned as dogs; however, that fate is extremely rare. They return to haunt the same sites to test the honesty of humans."" On 2004-1-9 Kite's first case of trance with her soul or her god, which to Kite is nature, I had access to everyone Asharic record. I found that Mao Zedong is a dog & Hitler is in love with a beautiful girl at that time. From unconditional love I understood that Mao chose the hard fast path to experience & learn unconditional love first hand as Shirley's latest book ""Out On a leash"". Mao and me shared the same `water snake' Chinese zodiac sign. p.109 Shirley wrote ""when Palme [Swedish prime minister a.k.a. Charlemagne, first emperor of France] died, I was devastated. John the Scot continued, `The greatest form of love is to allow the consequences that accrue from another's own free will.'"" Same as saying let them be free to choose and experience the consequences, which is part of unconditional love or let it be. Since I grew up in Paris & did remember my first introduction to incarnation was from an elementary teacher there. Until April 1996 when I realized from John Hogue's Pyramid prophecy and accepted my incarnation as Osiris in a flash [Lisa, who this time around faked pregnancy by me. is an incarnation of Iris and why I spent $100,000 buying her a penthouse]. Thereafter understood I can be all incarnations, like all dreams. I know that Roland is one of my incarnation from the French poetry Song of Roland. When 10-year-old, I imprinted a picture of Roland blowing his horn in the rear of Charlemagne's army & it was posted on top of the wall outside by my teacher.  Shirley only mentioned that I killed the giant Moore thus creating her possibility of having an affair with Charlemagne. It seems that Shirley never met Roland, so we both can create the possibility to meet in this lifetime and to love each other unconditionally. On 2001-3-6 [my number again] I found out mom broke her hip in Weihai. I chose Kite to be mom's second round-the-clock caretaker at the hospital and she was willing to come from Beijing. There Kite asked me 2 questions: Will I continue to love unconditionally and do I unconditionally love myself? The former I answered yes, the latter yes and no. Toward the end of April Kite had 3 dreams. First she was choosing between me and her then boyfriend. Second she chose me and third that I kissed her. I spontaneously declared that I will make her 3 dreams happen in reverse. They did. Later I kissed her on the forehead, while in the back of the minivan cab to the airport, picking up my sister. Then we spent 3 wonderful nights exploring our bodies without orgasm and talked until daylight. We fornicated on our 4th night. So Kite chose me and confided that she was willing to engage me only since I became destitute from Lisa by closing shop and unconditionally.  In May we both went back to Beijing for 3 days to move our things to Weihai. On the last day, she was walking around with her boyfriend like a zombie and he even got Kite in bed to produce baby [Kite aborted one fetus with him the year before]. On the last minute, Kite saw through his controlling lies & jumped on my cab to the Beijing train station back to Weihai. Whew! that was indeed a close call in her choosing again. The first time I went back to her parents' mud-made home in the middle of China for the whole October, I got Kite pregnant by impregnating her twice. My first child Bobby 14 years was conceived the same way. In January 2002, while Happy was taking care of mom, Kite and me with a fracture front heel-bone for a whole month, I chose to fell in love with Happy, who is younger than Kite by 4 years. Happy joined our shop at 16 in 1999, dumped into my care by Kite. Happy is the only junior high-school graduate who became a computer hacker and I increased her stipend from 500rmb to 2500rmb for one month. Then decreased it again, because she didn't have the persistence to continue hacking. Happy told me last year that she experienced every kind of feelings from my roller-coaster ride in 2000. I have been courting Happy since January 2002 and Kite spent one year before realizing that she can accept Happy unconditionally too. In 2004 Happy had 2 abortions with a boyfriend. Happy was willing to confide in me only and I realized that she was choosing to very gently let her boyfriend go, by giving him the gift of more love-making. I made the decision to bring our 2 year-old Imagine back for her and her mom to take care in Beijing in October. I saw the year before, Happy was in unconditional love only with Imagine. She chose to tell me the whole truth about all her male relationships. I told her about all mine the year before. This year Happy is 22 and in May I kissed her on the cheek for the first time and she burst out crying. 2 weeks later, I suddenly felt and chose to stand completely naked in front of Happy. Happy chose to hide herself under the blanket. I was surprised that she didn't tell me to get out. So I played this for more than half-hour, until the spell was broken by a phone call. Next day I chose to lift 86lbs Happy onto my lap. While I padded her back up and down, Happy laid softly like a bird in my arms with her head on my shoulder & her long hair before my nose. This arrangement was broken by the arrival of a friend. Next day 2005-5-22, Happy walked in & I hugged her standing up. She put her head on my shoulder like yesterday. I told her I had no pants like the day before. In less than a minute, she kissed me long on the mouth and to my eternal surprise extended her hand to caress my manhood. I laid her down on the bed and undressed her. Happy told days later that I was the most tender man she knew and that she felt like going to bed with me when she was 17 when I was too lonely. After I left with Imagine in June, Happy chose to have a one-night stand with a very tall American aged 40, and the fellow wanted to pay her cash. Naturally Happy didn't accept and she learned a lot from that encounter. Since then she can average one new boyfriend per week and she chose one young male to go to bed with. Until I returned to marry her? Naturally with unconditional love, there is no need for marriage. Kite and Happy both know that I invited them to live by my side as with my right and left arms.

"I found Mr. Cristol's book a great read.  It provides an engrossing fictional account of Israel's attack on USS Liberty during the middle of the Six Day War.  The author does an excellent job of portraying highly skilled and experienced Israeli fighter pilots as being dazed by the ""fog of war"" and thinking they saw a high-speed, enemy destroyer when in fact, it was a slow-speed, WW2 cargo type ship -- laden with antennas.Mr. Cristol's description of only two aircraft making several attack passes at the front of ship, and firing only 30mm cannon in few second bursts, followed by two others attacking from the rear with a couple of napalm bombs, while flying at 600 knots, makes you feel like you're in the pilot's seat.  Unfortunately, the fictional elements of this account don't hold up as well as others because photographs of attack damage clearly show the ship was hit from the front, side and rear by many rockets and 30mm cannon; i.e., the attack involved more than four aircraft, and rockets were the primary weapon.  Nonetheless, it's a good piece of story telling.The torpedo attack is well explained too.  While reading about how seasoned Israeli Motor Torpedo Boat commanders confused the modern looking USS Liberty with an old Egyptian horse carrier, I almost came to believe it was possible.  Both vessels were cargo type ships and they both had a bow and stern.  The author's treatment of this phase of the attack is a brilliant work of fiction.I highly recommend this book to anybody who may be interested in reading a fictional account of the USS Liberty Incident",0,1,0,books

"The authors of Blogging for Business, Shel Holtz and Ted Demopoulous, did an excellent job of standardizing the process of blogging and creating a book that I'd like to refer to as a `blogging bible' for anyone participating in the blogging experience.  As the buzz about blogging has taken off, Holtz and Demopoulous do a great job of simplifying the entire blogging process.  In fact the subhead for their book is a great summary - ""Everything you need to know and why you should care.""  I'm glad this is the first book I read on the subject of blogging because Holtz and Demopoulous did a wonderful job of describing the business benefits of why blogging should be on your radar screen.  The first couple chapters of the book cover the blogging basics that anyone interested (or knowledgeable for that matter) in blogging should understand before getting into the benefits.In a way the book serves as an instruction manual about how to set up a blog as they go into nice detail about the various services and functions available.  I was able to set up my personal blog by following chapter 8, ""How to create a blog - step-by-step.""  As I mentioned earlier, this is definitely a book that I've referred back to as I encounter anything new or confusing this blogging world that we're in.Three of the last four chapters focused on the topic of promoting and measuring the results of your blog.  Based on personal experience with blogs, I would focus most of your time reading and re-reading these chapters.  As Holtz and Demopoulous mention throughout the book, the biggest challenge of blogging is getting noticed by others by understanding the `behind the scenes' process for promoting your blog.Blogs, podcasts, vlogs (video blog) and other forms of `new media' are definitely worth consideration - especially from a business perspective.  Blogging for Business is a great starting point for anyone interested or curious to learn more about this new influential world.  ",0,1,0,books
"The book Yellow: Race in America Beyond Black and White to me is blatant and apparent proof that the Asian political voice has been hijacked and is fully rampant with an anti-white, anti-American viewpoint.  While I do not think the mind of Mr. Wu is reflective of the vast majority of Asians in America, his scripture is about as proof-positive as I have seen that while white Americans (European Americans) have fought hard against segregation for decades under a naïve spell for the benefit of minorities, Asian politicians as well as university professors of various minority races are actually promoting the philosophy and indoctrination for racial separatism.  The idea of racial equality is apparently not what elites like Frank Wu have in mind:  the condemnation of America and the same people who created pro-Asian immigration laws from the middle 1960s - whites -- is.  Far beyond equal rights for all, this new anti-anything-for-the-sake-of-it viewpoint, which airs in Yellow is nothing like what Martin Luther King, Jr., and the many other former civil rights activists were promoting.  The mindset of the author in this book (Frank Wu) is hyper-eccentric, seemingly hateful, dangerously irrational, and anti-establishment with no clear objective other than dissent for destruction.  To learn about the new form of hatred that a growing radical Asian intellectual base and other minorities are brewing, browse this book",1,1,1,books

"Ehrenreich is the kind of journalist I despise. One who thinks her insights are so important that it doesn't matter how much she inconveniences others to make her point.She constantly drones about how difficult it is to find housing on the wages blue color workers earn.  The market is to tight, that oftentimes one has to use a huge percentage of one's pay to stay in hotels while looking for apartments.  Does that stop Ehrenreich from competing for those coveted apartments?  Of course not.  She has to do her research, and she is the only reliable subject she can find to satisfy her curiousity.  If jobs and apartments are so hard to come by, then leave those jobs and digs for the people who so desparately need them.  There is nothing one learns from Ehrenreich's experiences that one couldn't have learned from professional interviews of blue color workers.  But that would have taken away Ehrenreich's righteous indignation.  Don't encourage this kind of writing.  See it for what it is. Gratuitous research that could have been easily conducted without firsthand experience.  And that while doing it, some very needy people were out of work and living in substandard housing conditions",1,1,1,books
"Though not for the impatient, this companion to Lattimore's translation of the Iliad is quite accessible to the non-specialist. Difficult passages are explained by making reference to archaelogical and linguistic evidence, other ancient texts (including the scholia and the Odyssey), and recent research on the transmission of oral literature.The reader is thus better able to place this seminal literary work in its proper context. Willcox helps us understand the cultural, political and human forces that shaped the Iliad during the centuries it was an oral poem, and the slight variations it probably underwent once committed to the written word.Overall, an outstanding work of scholarship.",0,1,0,books

Each chapter is authoritatively written in clear, approachable language.  Reflected in the chapters is a high level of professional and scientific discipline without a hint of academic arrogance.

The chapter authors, each a recogonized expert, obviously paid attention to the others' writings.  Each author provides a complementary piece of the puzzle while avoiding repetition.

"	I bought Don Debelak's book,  ""Bringing Your Product To Market In Less Than A Year"" because that is just what I wanted to do.  I applied for a patent on my new and better method of doing something that was long overdue for improvement.	I read the book and made a list of questions to ask Don, or one of his staff.  Before approaching him, I visited his website, dondebelak.com  and viewed everything clickable.  At his site, I was glad to see that he offered three different methods through which he, or a staff member could assist me. I chose the most reasonable, by e-mail, as that way I have all the good info at my fingertips. The other options are by phone, where I'd have to remember everything they explained to me.  The third choice is having one of his staff members visit my place of business, which is my home. 	I phoned and asked for Don.  I explained what I was trying to do, and told him I had just finished his most recent book, and that I needed help, preferably by e-mail.  He said ""fine"", and asked a few questions.  Then he stepped me through what he saw as the best way to describe the invention, and we talked about the business plan, and what category of venture capitalists would be most interested in this type of invention.	The next day an e-mail laying out the next steps that needed to be taken and how to go about it was in my email box.

"You may have read numerous books on World War II, but Irmgard Hunt has written an account from her viewpoint of growing up in Nazi Germany in the town of Berchtesgaden.  She describes conflicting opinions held by family members regarding Adolf Hitler and her confusion as to who and what to believe.  Was he Germany's savior or a monster to be feared?  School became something she hated due to pro Nazi teachers who indoctrinated the students and abused their authority with unnecessary corporal punishment.  One of her classmates was the son of Albert Speer while another was the son of the executed Fritz Sauckel.   Irmgard describes an experience of a fanatical pro Nazi teacher who insisted she get up in front of the class and state how proud she was that her father gave his life in the war for the Fuhrer.  Another of her teacher's appeared to be a kindly woman who gently asked whether or not one of her relatives was supporting the Fuhrer.  She hesitated in answering, but then lied that he doesn't talk about the situation.  She later found her teacher was an informant for the Gestapo, and shuddered as to how close she had come to consigning him to a concentration camp.  She also relates her uncomfortable experience of sitting on the knee of Hitler in addition to her fear of allied bombings and wondering how the Americans would treat her family members once they invaded Berchtesgaden.  This book is told from the viewpoint of a child and the fears and conflicting thoughts she had regarding the war.  The book also includes a picture of Hitler's Berghof after it was bombed along with a picture of the Eagle's Nest sitting on top one of the mountains.  The author also speaks of her beginning to challenge her mother's beliefs.  The war became tiresome and Irmgard realized she had been robbed of a significant part of her childhood.  This book is a quick read, but whether you are a grizzled veteran of World War II books or a neophyte this is a book that gives you the war from a different viewpoint ( a child).  ",0,1,0,books

Having worked in intelligence for over two decades myself, I can attest that the deep human challenges of intelligence operations during peacekeeping and peacemaking operations remain insufficiently met by our own or other intelligence bureaucracies.  It's not a matter of failure, but of (too often) mediocrity and inadequacy in the clinch.  Intelligence systems that are still haunted by the legacies of Cold War hardware and, worse, Cold War thinking still have not adapted adequately to our grave new world. We're learning, but perhaps not quickly enough. Steele, especially, has campaigned boldly in the cause of using open-source material to supplement classified data--and, in some cases, to supplant it--and we may expect powerful results wherever his advice is taken to heart.  Overall, this is a valuable, useful, thoughtful book one can strongly recommend both for professionals in the field and interested citizens.  Well done",0,1,0,books

"A true visionary of the highest calibar, Ms. Amidon has once again blessed the world community with a working masterpiece.  This book is a must read for anyone responsible for developing sustainable strategies or policies for countries, organizations or world regions.  In a world that appears to be in chaos and spiraling out of control, this work serves to bring understanding and insight necessary for the development of progressive and sustainable change. In essence, Ms. Amidon  not only makes it clear that such changes warranted, but she delivers the hope that they are possible.The requisite courage and leadership to initiate and execute such change, must be brought to the table by the bold and earnest practicioner.  There is after all, only so much a book can do.

"This is a beautifully written memoir by one of our best Chicana writers.  Seizing upon Roland Barthes's writings on photography, Cantu reconstructs her childhood on the U.S./Mexican border, teaching us that the border  itself is an artificial barrier.  This is a moving story of an American  family that has worked hard and sacrificed much.  We can only hope that the  rest of America will recognize sooner than later the enormous contributions  to U.S. history made by Mexican Americans",0,1,0,books
"Pre-K. This lovely book by Lewis Kim is about Harry, a stuffed elephant. The author has written another Harry story called `My Friend Harry'. This book can be viewed as a sequel to that title. This is about Harry when James, Harry's owner, is not around. Harry's problem is that he cannot fell asleep. When Harry has trouble sleeping, he tries everything to make himself sleepy. He reads bedtime stories, cleans up the room, runs, and even jumps. Still unable to go to sleep, he becomes worried. His friends, Lulu, the sheep and, Ted, the teddy bear help Harry out. Finally, Harry fells fast asleep.Done with colored pencil and pastels, Kim Lewis's illustrations are soft and dreamy. Yet they are realistic enough so they lure us to touch them to see whether we can feel Harry and other friends' fluffiness. The story is a soothing and heart warming bedtime story. It encourages sleep for everyone who reads it, even for readers who are not yet sleepy. When you finish reading this book, you might want to peek at the stuffed animals in children's room to see if those toys are talking, moving around, and making themselves busy. I would highly recommend this book to readers in preschool to kindergarten. This charming book could make toddlers happy, too.",0,1,0,books

"A member of the Petersburg elite himself, Count Leo Tolstoy had mastered the polish and sophistication at 18 that most around him had still not mastered later on in his life, when he had excluded himself from their buzzing circuit. It isn't any wonder that he was already focused on spirituality at a time when some of his more fashionable contemporaries were espousing a near-totalitarian socialist-geared egalitarianism. Tolstoy the spiritual revolutionary consumed Tolstoy's later life. Tolstoy the artist must have been in a groove all his own when writing War and Peace.The entire 1000+ page novel, while examining the principles of war and of peace separately and alternately, comes to spiral around a particular unlikely star-crossed couple. Awkward, red faced and obese, more wallflower than party favorite, more saint than brave soldier, that Pierre warrants the notice of the precocious charmer, Natasha, at all is a miracle in itself. More precocious than wise, Natasha has too many choices open to her. She is the dazzling flower in the room that every bee is surruptitiously eyeing, all but Pierre, that is. And this becomes a peripheral sign that he is the more deserving of her in the end. Having met my own Natasha some years ago, Pierre and Natasha's strange central developing story, amidst all the life of 19th Century Russia, hit home for me. Feminazis and other Marxist-influenced theorists have often branded Tolstoy as a sexist and anti-progress for choosing and espousing the early Greek-inspired Christian spirit and Christian values of his conscience, rather than embracing the fashioable socialist views of a Turgenev, et. al. Some have even accused him of being reactionary and conservative. Tolstoy was a maverick and a social reformer of some weight. He took on the Russian Othodox Church and the elite of society and told them what he thought of them. Ghandi read his THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN while sitting in a colonial British prison before going on to eventually win India's freedom from colonial Britain, rendering the modern Britain a moral inferior by the end of the ordeal. Turgenev never impacted the modern world in an even remotely significant way compared to this feat. Feminism has not impacted sufferage for women, nor does it impact contemporary culture. Tolstoy: 1, Socialist/Marxist-Feminist fanatics: 0. Tolstoy worked to make equality a reality for Russian peasants by writing serious essays that examined the nobility and values adhered to by peasants, and contrasting them to debauchery and self-destructive tendencies of the culture of the elites of his day and circle. I can't say that Tolstoy's values are always my values. But he understood Christianity better than most Christians before or after him ever did or ever will. He recognized Buddhism as being essentially Christian in HIS sense of Christinaity. He abored idol-worship, in the sense of reality wearing the masks we assign to it, to our own detriment and ultimate undoing.The sweeping, masterful narrative powers of Tolstoy come through in many of his books and short stories, but War and Peace is his ultimate masterpiece because it contains so much, and still coheres in the priciples that seem to self-materialize for us as they did for Tolstoy. One of the best ""philosophical"" fiction I have probably ever read, right up with Journey to the End of the Night and Dostoyevsky's best works",0,1,0,books
"Unfortunately, this book misses the mark and is of little value.  Some of the information on the making of the documentary might be of remote interest to those interested in such things but the author is too enmeshed in the politics of the present and therefore fails to shed light on the past. For that reason, this book will probably have more value many years from now as people look back at the politics of the battlefield in the 1990s but even with that, it is limited as it lacks objectivity. My hardback edition has nice maps on the inside covers and a nice layout of photographs but that is hardly a reason to buy this book. For those interested in Indian primary source accounts on the Little Big Horn as a means of better understanding them and the battle, see the following:W.A. Graham, THE CUSTER MYTH, a classic, no Custer library is complete without it.Greg Michno, LAKOTA NOON, c. 1997, an excellent effort at bringing about a coherent synthesis of testimony and matching it to a plausible timeline of events.

"These ""tell all"" books about Jehovah's Witnesses are absurd.  As one of Jehovah's Witnesses I sometimes meet people we have read and believe this trash.  It is always the same.  The information about the structure of our organization is more or less accurate, but the way it works is completely misrepresented.The matter of blood transfusions is an example.  The Jehovah's Witnesses I know sincerly disapprove of blood transfusions and view attempts to force a (to them) morally repugnant therapy on them as a violation of their human rights.If Mr. Reed really claims that 9000 Jehovah's Witnesses a year die as a result of refusing blood transfusions, then he is a fool.  They have been receiving excellent and highly effective care, including major surgery and treatment in cases of acute blood loss, for decades now.  We are now seeing methods first used to treat Jehovah's Witnesses being hailed as the ""gold standard"" for the treatment of all patients.Articles in medical journals are a much more balanced source of information than books by disgruntled former members.  (...)  One excerpt:Of the 498 patients the centre [at Our Lady of Resurrection Medical Center in Chicago] admitted in 1 year, 5 died. Indeed, mortality rates at a few other centres appear to be remarkably low. Dr. David Rosencrantz, a urologist who runs a large bloodless program in Portland, Oregon, told Justice Horace Krever in December that his centre hasn't lost a patient even though it has treated 500 to 700 patients annually since it was founded 4 years ago.

"Tim Powers is one of the best writers in speculative fiction ever, but I think he bores easily. Each book is in a totally different world view. Except that everything that could be is. I always wish he would write more stories in each world but no. No trilogies here. This is the consummate pirate book. A tale of the end days of piracy in the Carribean with vodun and magic thrown into the mix. With the absolutely great concept that magic is a resource that can be exhausted in time. Like all of his stories there is a feeling of being in a dream out of control. I kept feeling that there was always something more; something I could almost see. . .but never quite. Everything is major, world changing events portend and the characters are fully realized and strong in will and intensity. Intensity is the pace to the end. What a great story, but then pretty much everything Mr Powers writes is that. Get it, read it, enjoy",0,1,0,books
"Maurice Castle is working for the Secret Service. In this bizarre profession, he has to deal with leaks, security checks, tensions and suspicions. As Maurice approaches retirement, he realises that some of the decisions he made in the past are now having very serious consequences. In this beautiful novel, the reader discovers what the life of a secret agent is like: he is lonely, isolated and becomes almost neurotic. Greene lays bare a machine, the Secret Service, which overlooks Maurice's subtle and secret motivations that impel him. The characters are beautiful, full of tenderness, excitement and doubt. Mr Tim Pigott-Smith's performance as a reader of Graham Greene's &quot;The Human Factor&quot; in this audiobook is truly stunning. His voice is very pleasant and his vivid reading adds a further dimension to this already excellent novel",0,1,0,books
"Gordon Fee has written an easy to read version of his larger work ""God's Empowering Presence: The Holy Spirit in the Letters of Paul.""  Recently, I read and reviewed Frank Macchia's book ""Baptized in the Spirit: A Global Pentecostal Theology"" and as much as I liked Macchia's work, this book by Fee is in some ways at least, better.  I like Macchia's work on tongues and their meaning, but Fee really does an excellent job of showing the continuity and discontinuity of the Church who is the Israel of God and the nation of Israel in the OT.  On page 50, Fee has a great chart that shows how that we are living in an already/not yet eschatalogical framework.  Fee takes great care to show that the most important thing for the Church to get hold of is that we are the eshatalogical people of God and the Holy Spirit is the down payment on and fortaste of that future which is the come.  He deals with Paul and is an excellent interprter of Pauline theology.  Fee does not dismiss the importance of the Spirit in Paul, but shows how that, although, Jesus is the center of Paul's thought, it is the Holy Spirit that is driving this life in the Messiah and that give energy and freshness to the revelation of Jesus.  This is an excellent work.  I recommend this for everyone Pentecostal or not.  I believe that a popular audience could probably read this book and benefit from Fee's great and scholarly insight",0,1,0,books

While this little book can't say everything about software requirements, the breadth of techniques, tips and advice it does contain, are quite astounding. It is process neutral and puts together in one place many different techniques and practices.It really does cover requirements techniques, practices and principles from A to Z. Chapter 1 provides an Overview of Software Requirements. Chapter 2, Setting the Stage, discusses vision statements, glossaries, and risk mitigation strategies; Chapter 3, Elicit the Requirements, talks about facilitated workshops, exploratory prototypes, focus groups and user task analysis (among other techniques); Analyze the Requirements, Chapter 4, covers everything from Process Maps and Business Rules, to State Diagrams,Use Cases, Personas, and Dialog Maps; Specify the Requirements, Chapter 5, gives nuts and bolts advice on how to structure a req'ts doc and write functional and non-functional req'ts; Validate the Requirements, Chapter 6, explains peer reviews, user acceptance tests,and operational prototypes; Manage the Requirements, Chapter 7, covers change control policies and requirements attributes; and Chapter 8 discusses Adapting Requirements Practices to Project Types.

"The original Alice was and is of course an undisputed classic of both children's and English literature in general. What more can one say about Alice?On the other hand, while growing up, I never connected with Alice all that much.  Of course I was acquainted with the stories, but Alice was never for me a beloved favorite.  But one thing I have always loved personally (and even more as an adult) is WORDPLAY.  Martin Gardner helpfully providing the original versions of the poems and recitations (which every Victorian schoolchild no doubt knew very well, but are less well known today!), plus his remarks about historical contexts of things, shows you just HOW clever Carroll was really being.  Of course Alice can stand on its own and always has, but having Gardner's thorough and extensive commentary to help you know where all the jokes really are lets you enjoy it on a new and deeper level.  (As has been pointed out, far from being the occasional little footnote, Gardner's commentary occupies just about as much space in the book as the original text does!)Just for one example, I am still amazed whenever I open this book and see in the commentary the reproduced portrait of the actual historical figure who was the inspiration, visually if nothing else, for The Duchess.  (A noble lady whose nickname, if I recall correctly, was ""Old Pocket-Mouth"" and was said to be the ugliest woman in history. If anything, Tenniel toned her down a bit for his character drawing!)Anyway, summing up my comments on the commentary, Gardner's insights have in a real way brought me around to Alice, and that all the more joyfully for my being a bit late to the tea party.Now, this edition finally combines and concatenates the commentaries from The Annotated Alice and More Annotated Alice, so that they are all conveniently in one place.  This is really the ideal presentation I think.  The only thing that is lost by this confluence is that, in the original More Annotated Alice, Gardner took the opportunity of a second volume to use illustrations from another historical Alice artist.  In this combined edition, they stuck exclusively with the well-known illustrations of Tenniel.And, if you still needed any other purchase justification, The Definitive Edition is a very beautiful book, a very nicely bound hardcover with a handsome gold-embossed jacket.  Definitive Alice was one of the nicest holiday gifts I have ever received (when my cousin and her husband selected it from my Amazon Wish List a few Decembers ago, to my surprise and delight) and I still treasure it",0,1,0,books

I have noticed an annoying trend when a Jew reviews books by author such as Israel Shahak. Those reviewers almost always refer to the author as ""self-hating Jews"". How unfortunate that they don't have a better argument! What the Israelis are doing to the Palestinians now violates the old maxim that two wrongs don't make a right.

"Sasha Kagan's ""Country Inspirations, Knitwear For All Seasons"", the latest inspirational offering from this well-known British knitwear designer, does not disappoint. 	Using the beautiful countryside around her rural Welsh home for inspiration, Ms. Kagan has created an exiting collection of  knitwear.  There is more than enough variation among the design offerings  to delight even the most jaded home knitter. 	Ms. Kagan's stated aim is  to interpret the seasons for knitters from Summer's full-blown roses to  Winter's leaves and berries.  Good full body shots of sweaters on  attractive models with close-ups of interesting details are interspersed  with photos of her botanical inspirations, making an effective  presentation.  Delightful line drawings accompany most of the designs,  adding to the general creative air of this book.  You feel as if somehow  you are getting a private peek into the designer's personal  notebook.   	 The book's layout is both clear and colourful, pairing well-designed charts  with helpful keys that provide just enough colour and stitch detail to make  the actual knitting of these seemingly complex designs manageable.  Helpful  construction and stitch diagrams are provided where necessary, allowing the  knitter to tackle unusual stitch or construction techniques, without the  help of full-body charts.  (There are knitters who find too much chart  reading confusing.) 	Ms. Kagan's ""Country Inspirations"" are divided  into 5 sections: Roses, Autumn Leaves, Meadow Flowers, Forrest Fruits and  Cottage Gardens, with several different designs included under each  heading.  The shapes of the sweaters vary and clever pattern or stitch  details are added to Ms. Kagan's signature colourwork motives, resulting in  a sophisticated mix of both knitterly design and fashionable style.  It is  nice to see this kind of complex knitting paired with a sense of  contemporary style and shape, rather than the more usual boxy  drop-shouldered styling often seen with complex colour or pattern knitting.  	I liked the combination of simple intarsia designs with stitch and texture  patterns, creating complex looking garments that are really simpler to knit  than is apparent from the rich end result.  If you don't feel like knitting  a whole sweater, but are still inspired by the Welsh countryside, there are  several afghan and pillow designs that will allow you to try out the  combination of colour and stitch pattern without having to worry about  complex shaping. 	The inspiration Ms. Kagan gains from her surroundings  in Wales and the delight she experiences from a colourful piece of  handknitted goods comes across in this collection.  Even if you never knit  a single design, as actually charted, this book is well worth owning for  its inspirational qualities and delightful presentation.  I suggest you add  it to your collection of knitting books, now",0,1,0,books
"This is a great book for a variety of ages of children. You can start by reading the little ones this book because there is only one word or label per page, such as ""hill"" or ""snowman"". So the ones who are impatient can keep flipping those pages fast as you read! When they get older and learn to read it's a great book to start with, because they can match the word with the picture in the book. And at any age it is fun to examine the gorgeous illustrations. Not only do many of the objects reappear from one page to another, but if you are paying close attention you can watch the progression of the seasons. I loved this book so much I bought it as a gift for a friend, and now we are both hooked on all books with Alison Jay illustrations",0,1,0,books

This is one of those rare books whose message is not only important, but presented in a format that is easily understood.  Creveld's message does help put wars like Iraq into proper context.    I would compare this book (of the same topic) with others like James Dunnigan (of How to Make War fame) or books by Peter Drucker (who write books about management, but can also be applied to war).

"Granted this book is pretty thin (140 pages) and there are much better treatments out there.  Even so, any book that correctly points out we are in the midst of a massive unsustainable housing/credit bubble deserves more than 1 star. I'm giving this 5 stars just to counter-balance the clueless Realt-whore troll's comments above.  And by the way, the banks (and mortgage lenders, Realtors, appraisers, etc.) DO make money re-selling homes in down markets as well as in bull markets.  One of the biggest reaons why we're experiencing a housing bubble right now is because the MBS (Mortgage-Backed Securities) & CMO (Collateralized Mortgage Obligations) markets have removed virtually ALL RISK for the mortgage lenders.  Banks today are little more than loan ORIGINATORS, who sell off the loans to Fannie MAe, Freddie Mac or a private REIT, who in turn bundle them into MBS/CMO paper.  These get sold off to institutional investors (mutual funds, FCBs, etc.), who in many cases are unaware of the risk these securities represent.If you're a bank and basically carry NONE of the risk of default for any of the loans you issue, why WOULDN'T you make as many risky loans as possible to anyone with a pulse?  You get your fees and then you pass off the loan to some sucker's 401k plan. We're going to be experiencing the nasty consequences of this scenario very soon, as this bubble unwinds",0,1,0,books

I don't really care for courtroom dramas and my husband finally cajoled me into reading A Painted House by promising that there was not a single courtroom scene to be found.  And right he was.  This story was touching and fast-paced.  It was enjoyable along the same lines as To Kill a Mockingbird (the only courtroom story I've ever enjoyed) in its background and overall feel.  I didn't like the ending - not because it wasn't good and not because it didn't flow with the rest of the book (a lot of novel endings these days seem rushed and thrown together) but because it's not the way I wished it would go.

"I normally wouldn't respond to a review of my own book, but I couldn't let this one go.  ""Mark Twain"" wrote this: ""The focus of the book seems to be how to try every snake oil solution first, add in a lot of prayer and then seek help from qualified ABA therapists.""  If Mark actually read the book, he would have seen that the FIRST therapy that we did was ABA!  As a matter of fact, within minutes of getting our diagnosis, I was on the phone with an ABA professional.  He also would have seen that the very FIRST therapy I present in the book is ABA, and the FIRST appendix I have is a list of ABA professionals around the world!  I believe that ABA is key and it was the foundation of our treatment.  After doing ABA for quite a while (and seeing excellent results from it), we learned that we needed to address underlying biomedical issues within our son's body AS WELL.  That is when we began researching dietary and biomedical interventions.  I now believe that ABA and biomedical interventions help each other.  ABA was a great way to teach our son, while the biomedical treatments addressed his physical issues, which in turn allowed ABA to work even better!  When I wrote this book, I had two main things in mind.  I wanted to give parents hope for their child when faced with the diagnosis of autism, by showing them what happened with our own son.  I also wanted give them practical help by presenting treatment options available so that they could make informed decisions for their child.  ABA is a fantastic therapy, and I recommend it highly, but there are other things that are benefiting children as well, including dietary and biomedical treatments.  There is hope and there is help!",0,1,0,books
"Imagine playing a high stakes poker game with a very special deck. You are dealt cards picturing the following places: (A) corporate headquarters, (K) flea market, (Q) megachurch, (J) paramilitary group and (J) power broker's club. Only one card marks the soul of America but only the dealer knows which one. Ante up. Abraham King's new novel, The Soul of America from Savannah's Seedtime Press takes place at all those locations. Faces populate each location, like cards in a promising poker hand. The ideas found in the locations are the real characters that King develops. They are born, grow, use resources and compete with each other. They can be stimulating, exciting, compelling, consuming, cutthroat, vicious, domineering and vengeful. Readers will recognize them easily. We live among them every day. Sometimes, they define who we are and sometimes, they consume us. Always, they affect our lives and the less we are aware of them, the more treacherous the effect. Aware or not, we are the purveyors of the ideas that King characterizes. If we are to get control over the meanings of our lives, however, we must first understand the priorities we have accepted. Awareness, then, is the theme of the novel. King gets us there not with a preachy polemic, but with exaggeration that is simultaneously hilarious and pathetic. Like a social histologist, he magnifies the idea-characters until they become bigger-than-life, so big that we can't escape their existence in our own priorities.There is a story line with suspense compelling enough to drive readers to the climax, but the surprising climax drives us right back to the text. Have my friends and I fallen for this or that idea? Where else have we gone wrong? Where are we going wrong now? What are our alternatives? What are my alternatives? It's as if you called King's bet by reading his novel. Then after exposing your life through the memories it evoked, you wait for him to lay down his hand. At the end, there they all are: the corporation, the market, the church, the fringe clique and the plutocrats. Read `em and weep...and laugh...and have a great hilarious and insightful romp through King's book.",0,1,0,books

"FRA ANGELICO may be a museum catalogue for the current exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, but it is also one of the more impressive historical documents on this important painter and his influence on the world of art in the library today.  The book is a masterwork of scholarship and visual examples of this 15th Century artist.Words fail in describing the degree of integrity of scholarship of the contributors. Under the curatorial guidance of Laurence Kanter the museum has gathered seventy-odd paintings, drawings and illuminations from books by Fra Angelico, and then to add to the dimension of the great master's influence, they have added some fifty works by his students and disciples.  While Fra Angelico shines in his extraordinary sense of detail and representational art in a period when art was flattened decor and just entering the blossoming of the Renaissance, the works included by his pupils are quite staggeringly beautiful.  Some would say comparison to the master is unfair: history offers another vantage, that being the concept that the truly great teachers enlighten their pupils to exceed the teacher's creations!While the visual components of this fine book are incomparable, the various written sections by not only Laurence Kanter, but also by Pia Palladino, Magnolia Scudieri, Carl Strehlke, Victor M. Schmidt, and  Anneke de Vries not only inform - they also read like a novel of the life and times in 15th Century Florence. In every way this is a magnum opus that represents well the Museum's exemplary exhibition of the work of Fra Angelico.  Highly Recommended.  Grady Harp, October 0",0,1,0,books
"This book has many strengths, from the credentials of the experts included to the variety of the topics they have chosen to write about. For some of us, the words ""Improve Your Life"" are frightening because there is, of course, so much work to be done. David Riklan's book is accessible, though, for each topic is short, sweet and pragmatic. If you're a writer, turn to pages 384-386, where you'll find Kelly Robbins' thoughts about using your words to focus on your life's challenges. If you're struggling with relationships, John Gray has some excellent advice on page 266. I especially like Shirley Cheng's ""Dance With Your Heart"" essay on page 350 because it presents such a positive approach to life. When it comes to titles, Alan Cohen's ""Mistake Salad,"" is especially apt, and the words that follow are a great story with a thought-provoking question about the role of mistakes in our lives. Each of the essays in the book presents a bite-sized idea that, when pondered, makes for a very filling and nutritious meal",0,1,0,books
"""Time Regained"" is a dark ending to the ""In Search of Lost Time"" cycle, as Proust, sickly like his fictional narrator, unknowingly nears the end of his own life but senses its imminence.  France, like the most of the rest of the world, is now a very different place.  The Dreyfus affair is receding into the past under the shadow of the new war that has descended upon Europe, with Germany having ravaged Belgium and threatening to destroy London and Paris.  Many of the people with whom Marcel has associated throughout his life and whom we came to know so intimately through the pages of his chronicle are now dead, whether by disease, accident, old age, or the war.  Those among the living  include the Baron de Charlus, who sympathizes with the Germans and frequents a hotel that serves as a male brothel; Bloch, who has de-Judaicized his name and has assumed an English chic; and Odette and her daughter Gilberte, the latter now herself a mother, who have not so gracefully weathered the effects of aging.   Marcel himself is now an adult of at least middle age, and, as far as he is concerned, still no closer to achieving his goal of becoming a writer as he was in his youth.  He has, however, started writing articles and comes to realize, as he reflects on the course of his life, that the intricate web of contacts he has made can serve as grist for his literary mill, should he decide in his waning days to take up a pen and make some contribution to letters.  And, of course, over the past four thousand pages that is exactly what his author has done.  Marcel muses on Time (capitalization intended), memory, and dreams as necessary elements in the creation of art, a product of so much personal pain and suffering that death can seem like a welcome reprieve.  Judging the novel as a whole now that I've finished all six volumes, I affirm that there is nothing like it, or even close to it, in literature; like ""Moby Dick"" or ""Don Quixote"" it resides in its own impenetrable legendary world of oneness.  In my review of ""Swann's Way,"" I compared Proust to Henry James, but I see now that I was way off the mark.  James writes like he's throwing his weight around, imperiously demanding intellectual respect and forcing his reader into submission with his intentionally inscrutable compositions; Proust's prose, conversely, calmly and warmly invites the reader into Marcel's society and caresses him with the most delicate sensations and deepest emotions.  Proust is closer to Henry Adams than he is to Henry James, but even this attempted juxtaposition is buffered by a wide margin. Proust's style is so ornate that it is the most difficult of any writer's to describe, yet paradoxically there is nothing affected about it; he is quite possibly the most unpretentious writer in literature.  He never tries to impress the reader with his erudition, even though he evidently has much, or make himself out to be something he's not; one gets the sense that what he writes is exactly what and how he thinks, as incredible as that seems.  He uses humor without trying to be a comedian, sorrow without trying to be a tragedian.  He is employing language simply to illustrate life and the world, and I think language has no higher calling than that.  ",0,1,0,books

"Orphaned Lucy Wickwright is the long-suffering maidservant and involuntary co-conspirator in the madcap exploits of her mistress Pauline, heiress to the Barony of Cant. However, their relatively carefree childhoods are rapidly nearing an end. Amid ominous rumblings of discontent and even revolution, Lucy finds herself caught up in plots against Pauline and the gum-chewing aristocracy of Cant, and must decide where her loyalties lie.Intelligent and well-written with an original premise (the premodern barony of Cant, tucked away in the creases of modern maps, which allows for modern incursions such as chewing gum and t-shirts), _The Secret of Castle Cant_ is a very promising first novel. The author's strongest suit, in my opinion, is the fact that he, like the best authors for young readers including J.K. Rowling, obviously respects the intelligence of his readers and doesn't write down to them. His ""footnotes"" and other references to the ""history"" of Cant also suggest that this world has not just been casually thrown together but carefully developed in his mind.Pauline and Lucy develop a wonderful friendship that outweighs their original class differences and, while spoiled, Pauline is portrayed sympathetically and is obviously in the process of changing to a better, less thoughless person by the end of the book. Lucy is fiercely loyal and, while her methods for avoiding trouble without strictly lying may be deplored by some parents, her use of them is certainly realistic (I know I did it), and is unfortunately in common use by many adult public figures these days. My only criticism is that boys close to the heroines' ages seem to be portrayed as either stupid or arrogant, but I hope that can be remedied in the next book.Altogether an enjoyable book, and I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel",0,1,0,books
"This is a great book. It is a lot less technical than the Science of Mind textbook. It is comprised of several essays that are all written in a very ""down-to-earth"" style and each essay can probably be read in about 10-15 minutes. Now, just because you read the essay, don't think for a minute that now you know what Ernest Holmes is talking about because it will take you the rest of this life to apply his incredible ideas and magnificent insights. I'm sorry to disillusion you about the spiritual path. The Spiritual path is not a path of words; it is a path of dedicated application and every day presents its opportunities as well as challenges and that is a very good thing.I believe that the Living Spirit of God is everywhere present; that everything I see in the world of form is a creation of the Divine. Now I can say this with relative ease and for the most part I really do feel with all my heart that this is True and in my times of prayer and meditation I really KNOW that this is True and then I blow out the candles, roll up the meditation mat and go out into the world of effect and BAM! Before you know it I am bombarded with the world...Oh, crap...you mean I have to live this spirituality stuff out?All the sudden I am presented with the challenge/the opportunity to live out my ideals or give in to what is right in front of me. Do I judge righteously...in other words use my mind in the ""right"" way and see behind the appearances or do I allow myself to get sucked up in the world of effect. Bare in mind(and heart) that nothing upset God...Heaven is still very present within me but am I willing to rise up in consciousness or am I going to descend into the depths of hell? Hell is any situation where we feel separated from Spirit.Living out your Spiritual Truth is the name of the game. Books, tapes, lectures, classwork, that's all supplemental, but the test is everyday living. Like that old zen saying, ""Before enlightenment chop wood, carry water. After enlightenment, chop wood, carry water."" I'm not saying that I am completely enlightened by any stretch, but I am saying that now that I have been exposed to Spiritual Truths now I have the glorious opportunity to practice them. I can no longer stick my head in the sand and ""pretend"" that I don't know because now on a certain level of things, I do.This book will help you apply your Spirituality in wonderful and beautiful ways. My advice to you would be to take a particular essay and just work with that one essay for a few days or even a week. Underline things that you reasonate with, journal about those ideas, ask yourself how can you apply this in your every day life and then watch your world transform into something new and beautiful. Remember, the Light of God is always present but by purifying our minds, our hearts, and our souls we are coming into a deeper understanding that it is and it has always been and it will always be right where we are.I bless you on your journey and know that all is well",0,1,0,books

Borrowing from architecture, geography, urban planning and sociology they demonstrate how infrastructure, mobility and urban life are intertwined in messy, fragmented configurations.  Splintering Urbanism illustrates the increasingly segregated city, describing the unequal access to infrastructures of energy, information and transport - where providing corporations `cherry pick' the most potentially profitable users.  The books major value is its integration of a corpus of diverse theoretical and practical approaches to the urban.  This book is likely to reinvent the imagining of the city for academics, planners and architects alike",0,1,0,books

"The author who dared dissect Maya Angelou's poetry--and find it short on literary quality--is teaching us how to analyze text. Francine Prose analysis prose as she takes the reader on the same journey writers must take every day: examine every word, every sentence, and every paragraph. We listen to the music of the writing as it is being composed note by note. Along the way she gives permission to break some rules of writing--but only when the words end up reaching a higher goal of conveying a meaning to that lapse.A wonderful, strong book, that should be the cornerstone of any writer's library, but one that is well-recommended for all lovers of literature.",0,1,0,books

"Window Seat: The Art of Digital Photography & Creative Thinking is a photo documentary of a business trip taken by Julieanne Kost from the window seat of the airplane as she shares her personal innermost thoughts,, fears, triumphs, weaknesses and her passion for photography.This book isn't a how-to on digital photography or Photoshop, as the title may lead you to think, but it will stand out among photography books for the shear brilliance of photography within its pages.The first section,The Art of Creative Thinking, describes just that. With Kost's 18 point perspective, she explains how she works and helps open one's mind to the tools, goals, progression, and success one can obtain with the medium of photography through exploration, discipline and control.The center section, Window Seat, is her portfolio of airplane window seat photography. It is filled with nearly 80 pages of creativity. She captures each subject perfectly and though does not explain the digital or Photoshop process she uses, she shares a sequence of images and why they were chosen for the book.I see color palettes and gradients. I tried once to convey perceptions of time, starting with dawn--cold, crisp, gently, awakening--moving into daytime--bright mountains, green farmland, blue water glistening, light performing a circus act through 15,000 feet of cloud layers--and finishing with sunset--a perfect gradient of white, yellow, orange, red, purple, blue, deep blue, even deeper blue, and the darkest black you can imagine. This is almost like covering an entire day, but it doesn't work if you leave one place, fly for 14 hours, and arrive the same day somewhere else just two hours later. (Maybe I've just discovered another wrinkle: our assumptions about time expressed through the concepts of morning, day, and night.) (pg. 81) The Appendix is where Kost shares how she uses some of the digital photography tools and which she likes best. This section gives a broad view of imaging techniques.If you're looking for a how-to book on digital photography or Photoshop, Window Seat is not for you. But if you're looking for a fascinating concept of images, insight into streamlining your digital sight, and letting your imagination run, then, Kost's book will do exactly what she wanted.The photograph, on page 90 and 91 that adorns this small passage below is a brilliant picture of earth and sky mixed.. . . I wanted to walk out on the wing of the plane to look all around. (pg.91) At a quick glance, to this reader, it looks like an image of a human heart and arteries. That pretty much explains my feelings of Window Seat: Kost has taken to heart her love of photography and used every artery available to produce a book that will not only open an artist's eyes to the beauty of photography, but will also give that artist a taste of what it's like to capture what no one else sees.",0,1,0,books

"As we continue to pave over the beauties of our world and turn them into concrete wastelands, it is good to think back what life was like 150 years ago before we began the process of destruction in earnest.W. H. Hudson, the naturalist, is revered in Argentina, where they refer to him as Guillermo Enrique Hudson and name streets and towns after him. In simple and stately prose, he writes about his boyhood as one of several sons in an English family that ran an estancia on the Pampas. Despite several failed attempts to school him, he managed to pick up one of the best educations available: by using his eyes and ears to study nature. His skill in language, which is considerable, came from reading his father's books on his own.Whether writing about ombu trees, plovers, snakes, lightning storms, rheas (Argentinian ostriches), or his neighboring ranchers, Hudson brought a whole world to life with this book. Hudson published FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO in 1917 while he was living in England -- around the same time that a Frenchman named Marcel Proust was following where that elusive taste of madeleines led him in REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS PAST, and around the same time that World War I was destroying a whole way of life. As he writes in the book:""It is difficult, impossible I am told, for any one to recall his boyhood exactly as it was. It could not have been what it seems to the adult mind, since we cannot escape from what we are, however great our detachment may be; and in going back we must take our present selves with us: the mind has taken a different colour, and this is thrown back upon our past. The poet has reversed the order of things when he tells us that we come trailing clouds of glory, which melt away and are lost as we proceed on our journey. The truth is that unless we belong to the order of those who crystallize or lose their souls on their passage, the clouds gather about us as we proceed, and as cloud-compellers we travel on to the very end.""FAR AWAY AND LONG AGO is perhaps one of the greatest autobiographies ever written. Although I finished reading it several days ago, I am still feeling its afterglow and get this itch to re-read passages from it. This is, indeed, a book that will withstand several readings.",0,1,0,books

"This has become the most consulted cookbook in our household. My Iranian partner loves to cook and he regularly spoils our guests with beautiful Persian dishes overwhelming them with the variety of colours and flavours of his home country. The beauty of Iranian food is in the diversity of flavours. Fresh herbs, aka sabzi are served with most meals.  The ways of cooking eggplant are stupendous and once you serve the eggplant dip to your friends or enjoy a fresh herb kuku - an omelette made with an amazing amount of fresh herbs you will wonder why you haven't always eaten persian food. Iranian cooks don't use djheera, chiles or other spices often used in Middle Eastern/Arabian food  - ie if you own books on Moroccan/Lebanese/Egyptian, Israeli/Turkish/Greek cuisine some of which are closely related  buying this book will add a totally new dimension to your collection, with few overlapping recipes. Iranian food is not hot the spices bring out aspects of the single dish components that will wow you. Saffron is used a lot and fresh herbs find their way into everything, I recommend you plant your own if you plan on cooking a lot of Iranian food.This exquisite book celebrates Iranian culture and food, it contains many recipes, beautiful pictures and information on ceremonies, poems and lists of herbs and vegetables, listing both the farsi and English names, which is helpful when seeking ingredients. There is only one problem  - the times given to prepare the meals are generally wildly optimistic, ie where the author states 40 min preparation time, you will need A LOT MORE, but then cooking Iranian food the Iranian way (my partner makes 5 different dishes when we have one couple over.........) is time consuming and not for the hurried, ie tie your apron and prepare to relax in the kitchen",0,1,0,books
"Anyone who wants an inside look into the often-disturbing culture of inner-city policing should not hesitate to purchase this book.  Mr. Juarez writes candidly and courageously about the problems and conflicts of law enforcement, but he also writes a moving account of his own personal journey.  Stories of the author's upbringing in a working class, inner-city Chicago neighborhood are heavily drawn upon as Jaurez comes to analyze and ultimately question the morality of the entire criminal justice system, from the beat cop to the courthouse to the national agenda of the War on Drugs and War on Crime.  The power of this book lies in the author's ability to take a sophisticated, broad view of the institutional prejudices of the American criminal justice system while providing deeply personal, and jarringly unfiltered accounts of life on the street.This book is brutally honest and pulls no punches as it provides specific details of the underhanded practices of crooked cops: framing suspects, violent abuse, violent intimidation, theft, bribery, and vandalism.  The book also details what seems like the very routine practice of falsifying reports to cover-up the offenses listed above, justify an unlawful arrest, or to guarantee a conviction.  Mr. Juarez takes pains to emphasize that the overwhelming majority of the victims of such crimes are impoverished minorities.  He even details how policies are emplemented specifically to avoid targeting middle and upper-class offenders.Even though the officer exposes what seems to be widespread corruption and an institutional bias against poor minorities, I found it very fair.  Juarez in no way exempts himself and provides numerous accounts of his own misdeads and his complicity in not speaking out when confronted with other officers' criminal acts.  He also provides many examples of honest, hardworking cops and seems to conclude that the biggest problem facing criminal justice lies less with the individuals that make up the system than with the system itself.As said in the title of this review, this memoir reads like a page-turing novel.  Even given the disturbing details of misdeads and injustice, there were strong elements of an uplifting nature in this memoir as well.  The author's own personal journey is inspiring and admirable.  If only more of us had the courage to take an honest look at ourselves and the shortcomings of the  institutions that surround us, we would find our culture in a better place.  One can only hope this book might inspire others to that calling",0,1,0,books

"There is an Anton Corbijn photograph I fell in love with years and years ago: U2 - circa The Joshua Tree - in stark black and white are standing in front of an old dilapidated garage door that has been covered with a huge painting of an american flag and a woman holding an infant above her head, mouth agape.  One isn't quite sure if the woman is about to devour the child or sing it a lullaby.It's a gorgeous piece and I was truly amazed and thrilled to find it within the pages of this massive tome.From new fangled baby band (playing any & every little hole in the wall that was willing to book them), to full fledged arena & stadium filling ROCK STARS, U2 is a band that has stretched themselves and their soulful soundscapes across two decades, going on three!Anton Corbijn, master phototographer and friend to the band that he is, was there to capture it all: a snowy Sweedish video shoot for ""New Year's Day""; traipsing through a deserted goldmining town in Bodie, California, in search of good shots for The Joshua Tree; hanging out on the roof of The Million Dollar Hotel in Los Angeles (which would later become the film of the same name and location); Adam, Larry, Edge and Bono looking lovely in evening gowns (yes, as in dresses; for the video shoot of ""One"" in Berlin); Bono armwrestling Nelson Mandella (and loosing!); and a wonderful series of photos of ""the sons and the fathers"" where each band memeber's dad was photographed with his son and his respective instrument.Anton's handwritten commentary is full of personal thoughts, anecdotes and fascinating background that makes for hours of leisurely page-turning, reading and enjoyment.If you are a U2 fan, an Anton Corbijn fan, a fan of rock history, or a fan of great photography: this book was made for you.  And if, as Bono once said, ""Rock and roll stops the traffic!"", then this big beautiful book of Rock & Roll's finest, will simply stop your heart..",0,1,0,books
"I was very surprised to see just one review on Amazon of this wonderful biography.  This is the first review I have written here.  I always check out what readers have to say about books I have read or intend to read.  So I was really looking forward to a lot of stimulating feedback.  That being said, I guess I will put in my two cents.  This truly is the story of an American woman.  And that is why I think it is so relevant to every woman living in American society today.  Wagner-Martin does an exemplary job of illustrating how the genius and talent of woman can become neutralized through the weight and burden of early conditioning.  Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald was a creature screaming and yearning to differentiate herself from the overpowering presence of her talented and lauded husband.  The awful tragedy is that this intense passion to become her own person was so grossly misconstrued as mental illness.  It is tough reading.  My heart so went out to Zelda.  Yet I can't help but recognize that woman today still has an uphill battle in a society that has yet to relinquish it's paternalistic tendencies and endemic misogny.  I can't recommend enough this amazing study of a woman so ahead of her time, yet so crushed under the force of circumstance.  The one hopeful note I can offer is that from it women readers can feel galvanized to act as individuals independent of convention and impulse and need and rise beyond the circumscribed roles imposed upon us.  If only Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald, as well as that tragic icon, Marilyn Monroe, could have lived long enough to see how far we have come in the battle for the rights of woman.  But we have these beautiful women to look back upon to recognize the distance travelled.  I guess that is something to be thankful for. ",0,1,0,books

"Despite what you may think when staring at this novels 600+ pages, `Seven Types of Ambiguity' is an easy read.  Telling a very intricate story through the eyes of seven different people, the reader is never bored and is never lost for everything and everyone is in perfect symmetry even if their opinions on matters differ drastically.  Elliot Perlman's writing style is magnetic, for while it's quite detailed and sophisticated it's never over the readers head.  As far as his writing is concerned, it is one of the novels biggest draws as well as one of its only deterrents.  The problem lies within Perlman's decision to keep every narrator sounding the same as the one who came before him.  Angelique, the kind-hearted prostitute, uses the same language as Simon, the advanced literature teacher, and that just doesn't make much sense.That said, the story itself really stresses the fact that almost every action and or motive attached is in it of itself very ambiguous.  You have the same series of events, the same situations, told and retold by seven different people and the ambiguous fragments of these humans lives become clear as day.  The story for the most part revolves around four people, Simon, Anna, Angelique and Joe.  Simon is a former teacher who at one time fell in love with Anna.  They've long since separated and Anna has been married to Joe for a few years.  They have a six-year-old son Sam together.  Angelique is a young prostitute who falls in love with Simon, and Simon, while not `in love' with her loves her in his own special way.The novel opens with Simon's therapist Alex speaking with Anna, pleading with her to do all she can to save Simon.  You see, Simon, in an attempt to unite himself once again with Anna, kidnapped her son only to be turned in and arrested.  He claims Anna gave him permission when clearly she didn't but feels that Anna will save him and they can again be lovers.  Caught in the middle of this fiasco though are Angelique and Joe.  Joe and Anna's marriage was already on rocky soil (Joe frequently visited Angelique) and now it's even more unstable.  Through the eyes of these five, as well as a business partner of Joes and a final narrator of whom I won't broach (the final part of this novel is so important to the brilliance of this story that I fear mentioning it in any way shape or form could potentially ruin the whole experience) we see not only the effect that this event has had on the parties involved but also who these people got in the predicament that lays before them.  Each of these characters is vastly different yet similar in so many ways.  They all suffer from the same insecurities and they all fail to read each other properly.  They take each other for granted, they trust each other too much and they tend to assume the worst in one another when it's obvious they are drawing the wrong conclusion.  Each person is willing to create a lie and stick to it in an effort to convince themselves of what they really want to believe.The most interesting of these characters though lie in the suffering spouses so-to-speak.  Joe, while not literally suffering since he in it of himself is not the exemplary mate, is torn to pieces by the prospect of his wife having an affair, and when he finds out that the other woman in his life, the woman he confides in and trusts implicitly (Angelique) is also associated in an intimate way with Simon he begins to unravel.  His narration is probably the most enthralling and absorbing.  Angelique though is probably the most sympathetic and relatable of the seven narrators.  She's kind-hearted, compassionate and real and while she battles with her love for Simon and her frustration in his determination to have the one woman he doesn't belong with we, the reader, and drawn to her and in essence fall in love with her ourselves.  By the novels end you'll be flabbergasted that Simon ever wanted to sacrifice his relationship with Angelique for that other woman.`Seven Types of Ambiguity' is fantastically written and engrossing from start to finish.  Its 600+ pages fly by.  I personally cringed at the thought of starting this novel, for the task at hand seemed almost too daunting, but much to my pure delight it really was an easy read.  I really have nothing but admiration for this masterpiece, and if it weren't for the one minor flaw I mentioned earlier I would say this was a perfect novel, but that flaw in itself is no where near enough for me to complain.  Don't hesitate to open this book, whether it be for the sheer size or the college vocabulary, for this novel stands alone as one of the most satisfying reads I've had the privilege to experience",0,1,0,books

"""Will the warrior drain your light?""--- The Prophecy of BaneIn ""Gregor and the Prophecy of Bane,"" Gregor is surprised once again to find himself heading deep under New York, to the Underland. His little two-year-old sister, Margaret (""Boots""), has been spirited away and he learns that the Underlanders believe that rats wish to kill her --- hoping to cause Gregor's ""most essential part"" (his heart) to die before he can kill the Bane. The Bane is a vicious white rat, who Gregor is supposed to be prophesied to kill.As Gregor undertakes a new journey, he learns many new and startling things about himself and faces great loss. But in a story where nothing is as it seems, Gregor finds that little can truly be known before the fact and hope can be found when one has reached the depths of despair. He also meets many new allies, such as Twitchtip and Howard and discovers things he never knew about old ones, such as Luxa and his bond, Aries.I found this to be another moving edition in the series and I think it's a wonderful story for those who enjoy series such as ""Harry Potter."" I'm a fan of Suzanne Collins, having seen her television writing work for such programs as ""Little Bear"" and ""JoJo's Circus.""

"Against the Gods is a fantastic book for people who love to read the history of risk, dating back as far as to the greeks. Bernstein's passion to the topic makes it a clear 5 star book. And he's passions shows on almost every page. Example: if you are just interested in the Markowitz formula, don't buy this book. But if you wanna read that Markowitz's methodology is a synthesis of the ideas of Pascal, de Moivre, Bayes, Laplace, Guass, Galton, Daniel Bernoulli (especially since he's had the same nationality than me) and von Neumann & Morgenstern. Furthermore, that Markowitz's methodolgy draws on probability theory, on sampling, on the bell curve and dispersion around the mean, on regression to the mean, and on utility theory. If this history is what interests you, this book is for you (if not only for the great title & book cover) ",0,1,0,books
"What can I say? It's the absolute best, must have book for ANYONE who has even a slight interest in Astrology. I've been an Astrology enthusiast for over 10 years now and even though my level is more in the intermediate to advanced range, I still find this as an invaluable, handy reference. It perfectly ""walks"" you through this fascinating, yet complex science in a simple and easy to understand format. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to go beyond those fun, yet very general and vague daily horoscopes you find in the paper. It even includes a mail in offer to get your own chart done! (At least my old copy does, not sure about the new edition)This book will help you understand and interpret your chart to give you an enlightening and informative understanding of yourself. It includes chapters that explain and interpret the meanings of all the twelve houses, the signs and their characteristics, the planets and their rulerships, even meanings to all possible aspects of your natal placements. I really wish I had this book when I first developed an in-depth interest in Astrology. Again, A MUST HAVE FOR ANY ASTROLOGY ENTHUSIAST!!",0,1,0,books

"This book is a must-read for elementary school teachers and would make good reading for parents of young children and perhpas even teachers across the board.  Too many of our reading programs in this country are put together in a rather random and haphazard way, even though NCLB is trying to remedy this situation.

"Not just ""there I was in a whiteout"" stories, although those are in there.  The sixteen pieces represent attempts on Everest back to the Twenties when Mallory disappeared.  They are in chronological order, which is helpful because many of the writers refer to past history in their work.  All but three are excerpts, but as always, carefully chosen so that you enter and exit the work without feeling confused.  There are selections about the early exploration of Everest and then a detailed third-person account of the first ascent in 1953.  Geoff Tabin writes about the dynamics of an expedition and the labor that goes into making even an unseccessful assualt on the mountain.  Willis puts an interesting spin on the idea of ""survival"" by including two interesting accounts - one explaining why the previously strong bond between Messner and Habeler didn't ""survive"" after their 1978 triumph without oxygen, and a first person account by Maria Coffey, who after losing Joe Tasker to the mountain traveled ther with Peter Boardman's widow to find closure for her own ""survival"".  And there are the epics: Venables' near fatal overnight bivouac on the mountain, Anatoli Boukreev's rebuttal of ""Into Thin Air"", which cast him in a poor light, an account from Lene Gammelgaard, a less-known participant who nearly died that brutal night in 1996, and my favorite - an emotional yet self-effacing first-person story of that same disaster by Michael Groom, one of the guides, who reflects not only on his own near-death, but the helplessness of a guide who could not save his clients: it was he (among others) who walked away from Beck Weathers and left him for dead.  So all in all a great read on many aspects of Everests history, and if mountaineering gets your blood going, don't overlook the earlier series volumes""Epic"", ""High"", and ""Climb"", all packed with riveting tales of death and survival from mountains around the world",0,1,0,books

The governemnt takes her  from her home and forces her to live with several other women with very  differnt backgrounds from one another.

"that I've ever read, anyway!  Being in my late teens in the late 70s i managed to catch the last few fleeting pre-aids years described in this book.  On the first reading i was just stunned by the beauty of the writing, and like many people i suppose, i recognised many of the characters.  Andrew Holleran obviously knew this world intimately, and even though much of the novel is rather painful and sad observation, it's a beautiful and real pain and sadness that many of us who lived through that period still feel from time to time when recollecting.  Don't get me wrong though, it's hilariously funny too.  There's alot of humour to be found in the madness of the club scene of the time, the drugs, the sex, the total abandon.  I'm throwing my head back even now and singing Patty Jo's ""Make me Believe that you Love Me""!  Edmund White doesn't say this is one of his favourite gay novels for nothing!

The test of any children's book is its  reception by actual children, and &quot;Commander Toad and the Space  Pirates&quot; gets full marks there. It has been requested so many times by  my 5- and 3- year-old siblings that I can now recite it from memory.

"Davenport and Harris have followed up their influential HBR article with a well thought out, clearly communicated and detailed analysis of how companies will really compete in the future -- by using what they know to take the right actions throughout their companies.  Davenport and Harris call these types of companies analytical competitors and they look at the world differently and produce significantly different results.Analytics is becoming a requirement in every industry as customers have choice and companies face increased competition.  They define analytics as ""the extensive use of data, statistical and quantitative analysis, explanatory and predictive models and fact based management to drive decision and actions"" This may sound like an academic book.  But Davenport and Harris go well beyond hyping a new idea to provide dozens of practical examples from companies we all know.  This blend of explaining a new way of competition using practical examples from proven companies makes this book a must read for business people.The book breaks down into chapters that discuss each aspect of becoming an analytical competitor. Chpt 1: The Nature of Analytical Competition describes how companies can consistently beat the market by knowing more and doing more with what they know.  This chapter ties analytics with competitive strategy in a way that goes well beyond traditional market-ese.Chpt 2: What makes an Analytic Competitor provides a detailed description and checklist of attributes that these leading companies share.  The interesting point is that the examples range across industries demonstrating that Chpt 3: Analytics and Business Performance looks at how this technique drives top and bottom line growth.  This chapter demonstrates that analytics is more than just a good idea it's a good idea that business professionals should get their heads around.Chpt 4: Competing on Analytics with Internal Processes connects information with the capabilities that form the basis for competitive advantage.  This chapter dispels the myth that analytics is purely a marketing tool for customer segmentation and messaging. Chpt 5: Competing on Analytics with External Processes focused on how companies use information for partnering and collaboration with suppliers.  This is particularly critical to companies as many outsource and create relatively `uninformed' partners.Chpt 6: A Road Map to Enhanced Analytic Capabilities connects these benefits with specific stages and actions required to become an analytic competitorChpt 7: Managing Analytical People proves that Davenport and Harris have investigated, thought through and are providing practical advice as they address key leadership and management issues that arise when information becomes an integral part of operations.Chpt 8: The Architecture of Business Intelligence clarifies a stumbling block for many who think of analytics as just something they can buy as part of their BI solution.  Its not and understanding the architecture and difference is something that separates those who buy tools and those who compete with their capabilities.Chpt 9: The future of Analytical Competition highlights future issues and how analytics will shape markets as people, devices and activities become smarter. There are few books that you want to read from start to finish and fewer that you recommend to peers.  This book is both.  So read this to get ahead of the competition and stay there. ",0,1,0,books

I am not in the field of psychology and was intrigued to learn  the extent psychologists have gone through devoting their lives to find answers to the human condition. It is extremely rare that I read a book from front to back and return to review it. Lauren Slater writes to the reader in a simple way sharing many points of view and demonstrating her respect and compassion for life. Her attention to detail exemplifies how much her heart was put into this book while working diligently to remain objective and factual. She includes the observations made by the psychological community causing the reader to question the validity of experimentation because what may appear obvious is often open to question with valid opposing points of view from the psychological community; a very difficult feat.

Uncle Silas lived up to all the rave reviews I had read of it before purchasing the book.

"This book reminded me of the great Christian classic by Bunyan The Pilgrim's Progress.  Armed only with the scroll (the Word of God), this young squire must slay the dragon and rescue the lantern for his kingdom.  The scroll is the light for his path, his sword to slay the dragon, and the tool to see clearly in the darkest of times.  While others pursued the treasures of this world, the young squire held fast to the treasure of God's Word and was victorious in his quest.  The book is based on one of my favorite verses in Scripture, Psalm 119:9, ""How can a young man keep his way pure?  By living according to your Word.""

This book is an excellent survey of the Old Testament.  Baylis traces each book of the Old Testament in its own theological development of how Jesus is to be the coming Messiah.        I highly recommend From The Cross To Creation for college students looking to understand the Old Testament because Baylis' writing style is smooth and easy to read.  I also recommend this book to seminary students as a scholarly work because Baylis' footnotes are extensive and provides for wide-ranging supplemental research.        As such this book makes a wonderful Bible study.  I have used Baylis' work in such a fashion with a college group and his insights were well received.

"Abel's Proof takes an interesting approach to mathematical writing. The author places all mathematical formulas and derivations in boxes that are separate from the flow of the text so you don't have to do the math if all you want is a knowledge of the history of this era in mathematics. The author does a great job of explaining this history, covering the story of the factoring of polynomials in general but focusing on the unsolvability of the quintic. Abel's life of poverty is covered in detail. There is a lot of mathematics, if you are interested, including how to factor a cubic polynomial and Abel's proof of the unsolvability of the quintic. I found the math somewhat hard to follow but worth the effort of doing so. I found Abel's story to be very sad. The book is worth reading just for his life story alone.",0,1,0,books
"""Second Guessing God"" by Brian Jones shows how to live a purpose driven life rather than tell how in ""The Purpose Driven Life"" by Rick Warren. Not that I am knocking Rick.

"Lora Arduser & Douglas Brown have clearly struck upon the key components one must consider when opening a Bed & Breakfast. The initial chapters cover some of the more complicated financial considerations prospective operators should address when getting started: site research, local/federal laws and regulations, bank financing and real estate options - such as buying an existing B & B or starting from ""scratch"". Practical ideas are not forgotten and are also presented;  such as visiting neighboring B & B's for comparison research, considerations regarding appropriate d?cor, recommendations on preparing a guest services policy, hints on picking a memorable name and ways to establish a presence on the Internet. This handbook also comes with a CD-ROM that is extremely helpful for those more comfortable using generic templates and check-lists designed by professionals; surely a consideration when there are so many demands on ones time during the start-up process. These include personnel forms, purchase orders, food facility compliance checklists and guest ledgers. Other worthwhile chapters touch on topics often left out of similar resources - researching phone systems, attending to landscape details, establishing house rules and kitchen safety.

"Louise Glï¿½ck explores the complex relationship between God, humans, and the natural world with startling emotional depth in The Wild Iris, her sixth collection. Far from the strained and occasionally awkward lines and language of her previous books, these poems strive for and usually master an elegant lyricism in the imagined voices of wildflowers; of God manifest in wind, light, and changing seasons; and of a woman who struggles to find evidence of God while laboring in a garden in a cold climate. In poems most often titled ""Matins"" and ""Vespers,"" the human voice expresses fear, frustration, and love, while ""checking / each clump for the symbolic / leaf"" in the garden and entertaining the apprehension that God, the addressed ""you"" of these poems, ""exist[s] / exclusively in warmer climates...."" Plants, most often wildflowers, counter these prayers, presenting a view more eternal for the accelerated brevity of their lives. Glï¿½ck's gift in these poems is a capacity for lyric eruption coupled with emotional restraint. The voices are passionate but never hysterical; plants and God chide humans, as in the poem above, for their apparently willful ignorance, but the criticism never reads as self-pity. These poems grapple honestly and successfully with questions of ultimate reality, not sheering away from critical self-assessment nor veering into a merely postured piety. They sing and praise and renew with successive readings",0,1,0,books

"Very few literal endeavors can be placed on the same scope as The Tale of Genji.  Regarded as the first ""true"" novel ever written (in Japan's Heian era) and admittedly, one that has stood the testament of time and the effect it can have on the mercurial minds of readers taste.  After you get over the overwhelming length of the book, you are greeted with a novel that incorporates the subtle beauty of Japanese prose, superstitions and intricacies of that period, an ambitious romantic in Genji, who's epic sense of love can be compared to Casanova.  Born into the highest echelon of society and revered for his unnatual beauty, Genji suffers a fulfilling yet tragic, childhood.  These happenings undoubtedly led to his behavior which spans a multitude of women, illegitimate children, and a *spoiler* tragic death.  The book can be complex at times with the prolific metaphors that are casual only to those of East Asia at this times (such as the common reference to the purple lotus).  The beautiful poetry can be abstract to those who aren't familiar with Heian era prose and the story itself in this translation, can be inconsistent and ""downplayed"" at times that belies the integrity of the original Japanese source.  I enjoyed the book however.  It'd be hard to recommend to most people since most wouldn't have the aptitude to read a book of this caliber.  It is irrefutable that this book is a classic and one of the best of all time.(Hope you liked it Mrs. Atcher",0,1,0,books

"I just read this book recently after a long and torturous 40 year search for the ""truth."" It is like I have dogged Dennis' every step to finally arrive, in my understanding, at what he so simply expresses in this charming book. His list of references looks like the line up in my bookcase. As I read the book I witnessed myself sighing a series of quiet ""yeap, yeap,..., yeaps."" I was neither elated nor frightened by what I read, rather I was overtaken with an attitude of resigned recognition of the undeniable and blindingly obvious - like it or not, how else could it possibly be? I wondered what I would have felt if this were to have been the first book that I had read on this subject. I can't say for sure but my guess would probably have been either total dismissal or recoiling fear - in both cases my ego would have been running for its life. I think this because about 20 years ago I had both reactions when I first started to understand the real implications of realisation or enlightenment - no ego, no future, no past - no me! So what can I say to you about it? I don't really know, but if this is the first or the last book that you read on your search, what I can say is that you will, sooner or later, if you are serious, be forced to sigh in total resignation. As you go around and around the block you will have no choice but to finally admit that you will have to leave the block to parts unknown to ever have a hope of satisfying your insatiable thirst, and it will be the very last thing that you would have expected or hoped for but there it is - neatly and clearly summarised in Dennis' book. Do yourself a favour and just read it all the way through even if you then drop it and turn away from it for the next twenty years, you will be back one day and you will be glad. And then you will need and want to read, ""I AM THAT"" by Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj",0,1,0,books

"Some of the psychiatrists or psychiatrists in training that have reviewed this book are sadly influenced by the ideologies and pressupositions of their industry. The fact is, science has never proven that there is such a thing as a non-organic mental illness. The reason why people behave the way they do and have a variety of symptoms is far more complex than ""they are lacking some serotonin."" Most psychiatrists have already bought into the myth of chemical imbalance as CAUSATIVE of illness. Deep down they have to know this is a leap, if they are truly honest (the human mind is too complex to reduce to single neurotransmitters). Glasser and others have pointed out this leap for years. It is in the best interest of the patient to be honest with them and to genuinely help them get better and live better lives, not just hand them a prescription and say, ""See you in a month.""

"In this clear, concise, and well-written book, Alland provides his readers with a measured, thoughtful and compelling critique of historical and contemporary theories about the supposed genetic basis for group (i.e., racial) differences in social achievement and intelligence.  Alland begins by providing the reader with a refreshingly accessible treatment of evolutionary theory, Mendelian genetics, and their relevance to current discussions about the social construction of race. As a professor of cultural anthropology who also has substantive training in physical anthropology, Alland is able to problematize taken-for-granted assumptions that reify and naturalize racial categories with recourse to faulty understandings of natural selection, heritability, and speciation. His convincing explanation of race as ""a flawed concept"" helps to ground his critique of its usage in biased scientific and pseudo-scientific studies (by the likes of Carlton Coon, Arthur Jensen, Cyril Burt, Leonard Jeffries, J.

Rushton and others) that purport to 'prove' (i) that there are statistically significant differences in intelligence between racial groups (for Burt, the IQ groupings were class-based) and (ii) that those differences are due to genetic (and not environmental) factors. With a careful reading of these highly publicized studies and their epistemological presuppositions, political biases and methodological flaws, Alland undeniably shows that these attempts at operationalizing, geneticizing and racializing intelligence say more about the political interests of these scientists than anything else. What makes this book so useful (I have advised some of my colleagues to think about including it in their courses on the anthropology of race) is that Alland is able to show the linkages between and among seemingly disparate spheres: afrocentricism, social constructionism, genetics, evolutionary psychology, physical anthropology, linguistic ideology, archeology and fossil-naming, biological determinism, culture of poverty arguments, sociobiology, and even census-categorization. Alland illustrates  just how all of these fields/spheres have a role to play in the international drama that is irrational racial thinking.  Moreover, Alland takes these scientists and their theories seriously enough to carefully delineate why environmental explanations still offer the most compelling ways to understand group differences in social performance",0,1,0,books
"From 1933 to 1945, the Reich Chamber of Culture exercised a profound influence over hundreds of thousands of German artists and entertainers. Alan Steinweis focuses on the fields of music, theater, and the visual arts in this first major study of Nazi cultural administration, examining a complex pattern of interaction among leading Nazi figures, German cultural functionaries, ordinary artists, and consumers of culture. He gives special attention to Nazi efforts to purge the arts of Jews and other so-called undesirables.",0,1,0,books
"For me, William Styron has written the standard from which to draw the historical novel. I say draw because an historical novel is just that; a novel. But even while the reader knows this, historical novels always seem to provoke some response framed by the light of a current outlook. This is ironic because the main attraction of historical novels (at least for me) is the escapist type pleasure that is found by immersing oneself in another world and time. This is the writer's accomplishment. William Styron does this in language and in pace so artfully that his book remains on my shelf. I keep 'The Confessions of Nat Turner' for its enjoyment and inspiration",0,1,0,books

"Seriously, at a certain point when I was around 18 or 19, this was my Bible, or my Little Red Book - I and a handful of friends (Warhol died at about the same time) took every syllable here very, very seriously.This is kinda funny to me now, but it's a great book still, a truly unique cultural artifact.  Warhol - as always maintains the trademark deadpan aloofness here, which had a few odd purposes beyond simply looking cool:  there were rare instances when he'd drop his guard and a hint of social relevance would enter the frame, which did run contrary to most of what Warhol did, here especially.  Doing so would turn art into something didactic, and - as a joke doesn't work if you have to explain the punch line, art flops if you have to lead your viewers, or readers, by the hand into your meaning.  Thus Warhol's stylish glibness and affected cool served a brilliant purpose - it made demands of everyone who came into contact with it.Here we have Warhol's epigrams - spread out like some artboy approximation of 'Quotations From Chairman Mao Tse-Tung,' all about equally quotable, useless, devoid of literary merit, yet (unlike the leaden and ideologically bankrupt Chairman) also stylish and memorable, even at their most zoned out. The other great method behind Warhol's facades is here as well - the same impulse that turned canned soup into the artworks of a once very, very poor 2nd-generation immigrant's child (if you were going hungry, Campell's soup would in fact become, and possibly remain, a beautiful thing, and we all know that beautiful things are and always will be one of the most fitting of subjects for art).  These cryptic sayings and jottings all seem constructed to get us all to see the small stuff for what it is, and learn to appreciate it for that.Warhol was like Elvis - all things to all people.  And about as maddening, contradictory and semiotically intriguing as Elvis.  This slim little book is one of his strangest and most  magnificent achievements. -David Alsto",0,1,0,books
"This collection consists of three novels -- &quot;Vandover and the Brute,&quot; &quot;McTeague,&quot; and &quot;The Octopus&quot; -- and a series of essays.The novels are all grim, compelling stories. Another reviewer's remarking on the similarity between &quot;The Octopus&quot; and Zola's &quot;Germinal&quot; is apt. Unlike that reviewer, I found &quot;The Octopus&quot; most compelling. This is a grand tale with numerous subplots. The central theme is the struggle between the railroad (the octopus) and wheat farmers. I found it difficult to put down. And I found myself tearing up at points, somewhat disconcerting as I read most of this on BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit). All three novels are set in California with a least some if not most of the action taking place in San Francisco. These stories are excellent reads if you're not too squeamish",0,1,0,books

"I'll always have a special place for the earlier books, especially 'Anne of the Island', but nothing is unmatched to 'Anne's House of Dreams'.I always have a certain problem when reading Anne books. Although I enjoy the plot and characters, I resent the melancholy, wistful feel to it everytime Anne goes into a new chapter of her life. There was the last chapter of the first book; 'A Bend in The Road', where the simple description and mood of the scene was so heart-wrenching that I almost cried. 'Anne of Avonlea' was just as sentimental as the previous book, with Anne realizing she cannot turn back time to when she was eleven. We, as readers feel the impact too. We have come to love each and every one character in Avonlea and we cannot stand to watch the years go by and be forced accept that the people are changing. 'Anne of the Island' cured that depressing tone slightly by bringing in cheerful college life but still retained the usual Avonlea village scenes into it. A romance brewing between Gilbert and Anne also helped distract readers from getting too upset about Anne growing up and leaving her childhood days forever. But nevertheless the proposal scene at the last chapter brought up those suppressed feelings out once again and left us smiling a bittersweet smile at the closing descriptions of the book.But in 'Anne's House of Dreams', we are introduced to a whole new atmosphere. No longer is Anne running dreamily into magical forests and delighting in fairy brooks, listening to the whispers of the trees or playacting as a Fair Maiden with her childhood friends. The fairy-tale, static forests of Avonlea are replaced with a vast sea, salty breezes and spicy scents of seagrass in the air. Whereas the previous books were stuffy and melancholic, this book is wonderfully refreshing and light. Instead of feeling that everything is going to end (growing older, beloved characters dying, leaving Green Gables and Avonlea), we find ourself anticipating Anne's new life as a married woman. And the plot construction! I've never read an Anne series with a plot so tight and focused. The twist at the end concerning Leslie's husband was the cream of the crop, and I've also enjoyed the beautiful life-story of Captain Jim. Even Anne and Gilbert are involved into this snug plot, they are mostly the benefactors of the events: Gilbert's idea to cure Leslie's husband and Anne's idea to have Captain Jim's life-story written down.On the other hand, I would complain that there weren't many scenes of the old characters; save Gilbert (duh) and Marilla. It's as if Anne is losing contact with her old life, which makes me a bit sad. I was dying to know more about Davy, Diana, Paul Irving, the Pyes, and even Charlie Sloane. I would love the series more if Anne remained in Avonlea and raised her family in the midst of the atmosphere that we have come to recognize and cherish. What's the use of getting us attached to the 'Lake of Shining Waters' and 'The White Way of Delight' and 'Lover's Lane' and 'Hester Gray's garden' and 'Dryad's Bubble' if Anne was going to move away and leave all those memories behind? Blame it on Gilbert. (kidding)I finished reading this book with a heart-warmed feeling in my heart for the first time, it seemed more appropriate as a beautiful closure to the series. It should have ended here instead of dragging along until she fades away to become a secondary character in the next three upcoming books",0,1,0,books

"This is my favorite cookbook.  I have had great success with everything I've made from this cookbook! The recipes are widely varied (plenty of breads, meats, sides, desserts, and vegetarian options) and healthy.  While Weight Watchers does have slighly lower fat recipes, I feel these recipes have more flavor and are more fulfilling.  My guests are always shocked when I tell them dinner came from this cookbook - low fat does not mean lacking in taste! (tastes great and is filling) ;)I got this book when I was first married, and have used it almost weekly since.  It was great for me starting out, because it contains tips for beginning cooks, kitchen basics with essential kitchen tools, the recipes had common ingredients, and there is a subsitution chart in the back! (invaluable, especially when we still had dial-up internet access!)  It has a fair amount of pictures, though not one for each recipe.

"I never was keen on tackling auto electrics, so when car manufacturers began introducing  electronics, then computers, the eyes glazed over, and new car purchases were limited to pre -1976 models.  Then, while browsing, a book about my automotive twilight zone was offered.  It was described as understandable by trained monkeys. (or words to that effect.)   I knew that sub-contracting the electricals for my three planned &quot;clubman&quot; sportscars would stretch the budget.  I needed help.  The table of contents looked good, the editorial review looked promising, then my discovery that the author lived a localtelephone call away decided it for me.  If I couldn't understand his book, the author could hardly deny a plea for assistance.  I ordered a copy.  Good move!   After a short read, all my forebodings melted away.  Following the book, I sorted out the bats-nest of under-dash electricals in my work-truck with ease.  It looks a professional job, and I actually understood what I was doing and enjoyed doing it.  The book paid for itself many times over on that one job.  Instead of dreading the prospect, I'm now impatient to design and fabricate the wiring looms for my Toyota 4A-GE powered Locosts.  The &quot;black-boxes&quot; sprouting forests of wires no longer un-nerve me.   There are sections covering every aspect of such a project.  The required information is well-indexed, and is presented clearly and concisely.  When I first flipped through the book, I was almost overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information.  I soon discovered that it is one of the best reference books (of any subject) I have ever seen.  It is only necessary to know what you want to do, not how to do it.  Use the extensive index to find part of your project, and when you have a question, it will be the key to a cross-reference to the next step.  Wire gauges, fuse ratings, component specifications and limitations, safety requirements, sensors, diagnostics,...all are comprehensively dealt with in jargon free text that you and I (and trained monkeys and politicians probably) will find easy to follow.  Want to see for yourself?  Search the title, click on the &quot;table of contents&quot;.  Impressive.   I never did have to call Mr. Munday for help, but I called to thank him and ask how he was able to write such a perfect book.  He is a professional  freelance Technical Author  who writes  Technical Manuals, User Guides, Instructions, etc on almost any technical subject  to make them comprehensible forthe layman.(and trained monkeys and politicians)  His hobby is hot-rodding.  I can't recommend his book highly enough, it really is a &quot;must have&quot; for anyone working at  any level on automotive electrical or electronics,...from the dead-set novice like me, to the professional technician",0,1,0,books
"I read this book in one sitting; it was so riveting that I could not put it down.  The book covers a variety of events during World War II but the main focus is on Dachau and its liberation by the 45th Thunderbird Division of the Seventh Army. New information about the liberation of Dachau debunks some of the previously published accounts and describes the heroism of the Thunderbird Division.  At a time when Holocaust denial is rampant, this book tells the true story of the atrocities committed at Dachau. The author based his book on eye-witness accounts by American soldiers. There are also old black and white photos, never before published. This book should be required reading in every school in America.",0,1,0,books
"This is probably my favorite novel of all time, and one of the few which I read regularly.  While some might describe this as a no-nonsense Western, I disagree.  It completely transcends the genre in the same way and with the same purpose as _High Noon_.  In fact, I would call it the inverse of that story, for it is really about the cost of cowardice instead of the rewards of courage.  Sadly, the central character is no Gary Cooper.  This book contains larger truths about our frailness in the face of danger and, more importantly, the repercussions which follow the fear and pain into other generations and places.  What happens can easily be extrapolated into other circumstances which happen to everyone everywhere.  I recommend that this book be read for it's enthralling narrative and be appreciated for its universal theme.",0,1,0,books

These two books has been misleading lots of astral projection learner.If you want to get a book to see what are the mistake concept that Robert Bruce has, then get this book.But any people with basic astral projection skill will know, that is Robert Bruce's more of mind-imaginary skills.Many people has natural ability to astral project, all you need is the right pointers.

"In the first book of the series, ""Coyote,"" Allen Steele told us how the captain of the first interstellar colonizing ship, Alabama, smuggled prisoners-of-State (intellectual dissidents oppressed by a right-wing authoritarian government) on board, and they stole the ship, reached Coyote, a moon of a planet named Bear, circling 47 Ursae Majorus.  In ""Coyote Rising,"" things have gotten complicated.  On Earth, people are running out of living space, the government has shifted to a ""Collectivist"" (a variant of socialism) authoritarianism, and technology has advanced to produce ever-faster ships.  The result:  the original Coyote colonists get a series of unwelcome visitors from Earth, flee the original colony to form a new colony on a neighboring island, and a civil war begins to brew.As with the first book, this one originally appeared as a series of novellas in a science fiction magazine.  While there are still traces of disjointedness, from turning a series of novellas into a novel, the mild discontinuities did not interrupt the flow for me.  There is a larger cast of well-developed characters here, including the introduction of Savants (cyborgs with downloaded human minds) and a religious mutant.  The terrain of Coyote is well-described, as are the human interactions, and there is plenty of action.  The fauna of Coyote does not seem adequately developed (i.e., there should be more animal species).Thanks to the friend who sent this to me, Jan Dierckx, I found this book gripping and thoroughly enjoyable.

However, too many ridiculous scenes and caricatured main characters put me off.  Singer's best passages are those pertaining to the horse's personalities, as someone else mentioned.

" James Baldwin's stories are more like poetry, describing painful circumstances as dreamy metaphors. I felt myself pulled away from the story a few times to ponder what Baldwin is expressing through this story, for example he writes something about not choosing your friends or who you love, just as you don't get to choose your parents. He forces you to stand in the shoes of each character, feeling as though you were naked, because the message, for me at least, is clear. If people would allow themselves to feel total honesty with themselves, then perhaps the way they are choosing to live their lives would be completely, way over on the opposite end of the spectrum then what is actually real. No sexual orrient, race, religion. Just looking inside yourself and saying &quot;yes&quot;. And if you think I'm just getting to romantic over a story, still read this book.

"If, like me, you have been disappointed by the Jessie Stone series, this book will be a pleasant surprise. Up to this point, Jessie has been an underdeveloped character - his books have seem to have been back-burner material and second-rate effort by Parker.This one is different - and it is not a Spenser clone (like Sunny Randall)! Stone is working on two crimes at the same time and Parker paces them well so that the first crime (a rape at a local high school) comes to a resolution just as the second crime (a set of serial murders) finally starts to get interesting. No giant car chases or dramatic speeches as this book winds down, but it is satisfying nonetheless.The only complaint I have is Parker's insistence on having dysfunctional romantic relationships dominate Stone's personal life (we love each other but we just can't marry each other because that would stifle us, but we are faithful to one another just like we were married, blah, blah, blah...). This is just like he has done with Spenser, Sunny Randall and Phillip Marlowe. Geez, give it a rest",0,1,0,books

"Tragic yet hilarious, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; is a bitter frolic through the lives of homosexuals in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Opening with a stunning 50-page play, the farce continues to sing throughout the remaining  pages. The ill-fated sojourns of so many characters are detailed, but  always with a willingness to see the humor within the suffering of men who  seek pleasure despite the risk of punishment by a tyrant and his faithful  firing squads. A nice piece of political commentary aimed at the seat of  Castro's olive-green pants, &quot;The Color of Summer&quot; reveals the  leaks in the dictator's &quot;air-tight&quot; oppressive regime, leaving  Castro at the center of ridicule.

The hearts and minds, the patriotism, of citizens of countries marginalized in today's studies, are experiences that Furst invites his reader to witness.He introduces characters that are gallant in their simplicity and simply dutiful in their gallantry. There is no preparation for this story. A reader need only relax, turn pages and let the arcane history of a period absorb him or her.In my own indulging in historical intrigues, I have experienced no one but Furst who can bring readers into this milieu. He accomplishes this with a guile even more mysterious than his characters. This reader finds himself a pilgrim in Furst's tour, not wondering how did I get here, but enthused to find where he and his characters are going to take me on the next page.In my mind I know it's fiction, but in my heart, I believe I'm there and then",0,1,0,books
"As a futuristic tale Feed reads as a weak prediction of what might be, but understanding this future world is really an allegory for the present human condition rests my doubts.The characters inhabit a world largey created for them, their perceptions, interests and, ultimately, their values maintained and shaped by the Feed.  The Feed is a neural implant installed into a person's brain during early childhood, typically before all major brain regions have matured.  Humans are thus networked as nodes (or terminals) on a distributed computing system run by mega-corporations, irreversably fused with their feed implants.We explore what happens when people are separated from the Feed and how people choose to relate to reality.  This is not breaking new ground, but the delivery has style and wit.  I hoped the author would develop more elements of the story, such as the Coalition of Pity or the cause of the lesions.  But the story only lacks depth if compared to novels for well-read adults - keeping it clear is a wise strategy for a young adult novel and, with that audience in mind, it rates 5 stars.I'll be picking up more titles from this author and plan to have my children read this book when they're in high school",0,1,0,books

"I kept hearing about these books because ""Spike"" from Buffy reads them but didn't really know why else I should care.  Then I saw the show on SCIFI.  Then I found out the author lives in the town next to mine.  I thought maybe I should read one.  Well the one has gotten me hooked and I'll be plowing through them all I'm sure.  I too compare them to Harry Potter mostly for the magic and wizards but Harry is a lot more fun than Harry Potter.  I love the series but I like the books better.  I understand the changes they made for the series but the books are as usual, much richer and more complex.  Who knew that all the names you've ever heard for Werewolves meant different kinds?  Harry did or he found out from Bob.  The character of Harry is a wonderful throw back to nice old fashioned guys who want to protect women and do the right thing, he just also happens to be a wizard.  I like that in this book you find that there will be something evil that is in the background and will be showing itself as you go forward, it gives you a reason to keep reading, aside from the books just being a lot of fun to read.  I hope Harry stays around for a good long run, I'll be waiting for each new adventure",0,1,0,books

"The author first challenges today's Christian education methods, conventional Sunday school and catechetical instruction, which in his eyes have almost failed its purposes for three reasons: 1) content is irrelevant to people's real lives. 2) Students are not engaged in true dialogue and learning. 3) Individualistic pedagogy fails to embrace community learning. Church life in its entirety should be formational instead of informational. The author argues that Christians should learn to perform Christly gestures rather than simply gain historical facts and other people's theological ideas. When Christians value Christly gestures, practice them in the church community, and learn to live them out in the real life with the help of Holy Spirit, transformation happens. Christly Gestures reshapes the very meaning of Christian education, exploring what the form and content of Christian learning would look like if local churches truly saw themselves as the body of Christ.Another point I like about his book is that it equally emphasizes on the formation of spirit, mind, and body, and contends for a deep unity of body and mind, of thought and action. In fact, as Brett discovers, the formation of human body receives the least attention in the fields of religious education and theology. The cons: this book claims to write for lay leaders and local Christian educators, but its writing style, complex theological discussion, and short of practical examples make it more suitable for students and teachers of religious institutions than for Sunday school teachers.",0,1,0,books
"If you haven't read The Good Fairies of New York, and especially if you are a New Yorker, or a New Yorker at heart, stop reading this right now, and immediately put your name on the Amazon.com pre-order list ... The Good Fairies have found their way back home to Amazon.com and to NYC, and everyone around the world is overly excited by the news! I have been addicted to Martin Millar for over ten years. I was one of the lucky few to have purchased a copy of The Good Fairies of New York before it became an out-of-print statistic. Martin has a talent for twisting the logic out of reality, and making you believe his tales are not mere inventions of his fragmented mind, but instead are actual events. The Good Fairies of New York will make you a believer, if not in fairies, at least in Martin's belief that they exist. The Good Fairies is not a child's fairytale, but instead a tale that includes fairies. Martin's forte is writing about characters that are flawed (some physically flawed, all emotionally flawed). Although Martin brings a refreshing childlike innocence in his approach of character development, his books are very adult orientated. He is not afraid to tackle serious subjects using a perverse sense of humor to lighten the mood when life becomes too grim. The Good Fairies will take you on an emotional ride that you will want to re-experience over and over. All of Martin's books should have the following label ... Caution: be forewarned that all it takes is one book to become a Martin Millar junkie",0,1,0,books

"Walzer's historical approach to examining just war theory is, I think, the most useful way to understand morality in war. That is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations. Walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here; he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying, if not prescribing, moral norms from which the rules have been extracted. Be forewarned, he does not cut the reader any slack. This book requires some serious attention to the author's train of thought.  Just war theory has two categories: the justice of going to war, and the justice of fighting once in a war. Walzer's discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere. In doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service. His logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war. One of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that ""all is fair in love and war."" That is the path of least moral resistance (or as Clausewitz would say, ""friction""), yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers. What is amazing from the discusion is the realization that Walzer knows he has to attack that age-old notion, something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected.  Yet it remains a prevailing idea for many.  Originally coined by the Romans it seems (Walzer quotes them, ""In war the laws are silent""), they themselves were self-consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the Greeks and Carthginians.  The book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone.Some make the mistake of thinking Walzer is a pacifist--far from it.  On the otherside some critics find his argument about ""supreme emergency"" a moral failure and a cop-out.  The case of Nazi Germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency, one where normal rules may be relaxed, if ever so little, because of the especially pernicious nature of state-sponsored genocide.  The same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to Islamic terror. In contrast Walzer does not see Imperial Japan, for instance, as having represented a supreme emergency, and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified. Readers may want to compare his view to Paul Fussell's perspective in the essay ""Thank God for the Atom Bomb.""Significantly for current events, readers interested in the distinction between pre-emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here. The US attack on Iraq was and still is often justified as pre-emptive.  That impulse on the part of the neo-conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects, I think, a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy. There is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of ""pre-emption."" Michael Walzer's well-thought distinction between pre-emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and Islamic radicalism, and it clearly shows why the Iraq war was a moral mistake from the start, regardless of its practical success down the road, if we are fortunate enough to see that. The moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt America long into the future. The fact that Iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre-emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco.  Where one fails to recognize the moral high ground, one is doomed to moral failure. Walzer was vocal about the run-up to war in 2003, and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the Iraq invasion; they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world's police force",0,1,0,books

"In Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview J.P. Moreland and William Lane Craig offer a comprehensive introduction to the study of philosophy from a Christian perspective. In their broad overview they seek to introduce readers to the principal divisions of philosophy, including: ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, the philosophy of science, and the philosophy of religion. They write with their characteristic clarity and insightfulness. Their arguments are clearly outlined, and they present competing theories with fairness and accuracy.A graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary, Dr. J. P. Moreland is currently the Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, in La Mirada, California and a fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture. He has written, edited and contributed to over twenty books with publishers ranging from academic presses of Oxford University Press, Routledge, and Wadsworth to the more Evangelical presses of Zondervan and InterVarsity Press. Among Dr. Moreland's books are Christianity and the Nature of Science, Scaling The Secular City, Does God Exist? (with Kai Nielsen) and Philosophical Naturalism: A Critical Analysis. He has also published more than fifty articles in journals such as Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, American Philosophical Quarterly, MetaPhilosophy, Pacific Philosophical Quarterly, Southern Journal of Philosophy, Religious Studies and Faith and Philosophy.A graduate of Trinity Evangelical Divinity Schools with M.A. degrees in Church History and the Philosophy of Religion, Dr. William Lane Craig earned his advanced degrees at University of Birmingham and the University of Munich.  Dr. Craig is the Research Professor of Philosophy at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, in La Mirada, California. He has written or co-written more than twenty books, including: The Kalam Cosmological Argument, Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom, Theism, Atheism and Big Bang Cosmology and God, Time and Eternity. He has published articles in philosophical and theological journals such as The Journal of Philosophy, American Philosophical Quarterly, Philosophical Studies, Philosophy, British Journal for the Philosophy of Science, Modern Theology and Religious Studies. Dr. Craig is also a fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture.This text is geared toward the new student of philosophy or Christianity who has a limited background in the issues at hand. For a very reasonable price, this is a good source of information best suited for graduate students or lay readers with rhetorical sophistication. Some of the articles can be quite advanced, employing a daunting vocabulary, but while this might make for a challenging read, it will only aid students in expanding their knowledge. Moreland and Craig's writing is concise, yet very thorough. The work is extremely well organized and chapters flow perfectly as each section compliments the next. Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview is one of the best introductory texts on philosophy written in quite a while. The textbook is comprised of six sections; the introduction discusses philosophy and the basics of argumentation and logic. The next segment, Epistemology, covers rationality, the problem of skepticism and rival theories of truth. Issues such as mind-body dualism, as well as human freewill vs. divine predestination, are addressed in the third chapter, Metaphysics. Philosophy of Science is the fourth chapter and has a nice summary of the scientific method as well as the integration of science and religion. Part five, Ethics, deals with the basic questions of morality, virtues and ethics and contains a comparison of relativism with absolutism. Philosophy of Religion and Philosophical Theology is the last section covering arguments for the existence of God and the possibility of miracles.This important new book is a guide intended for use as a textbook in courses on philosophy of religion. It aims to bring to the student the very best of explanations and arguments on important topics in the field. This text is a great reference tool emphasizing the Christian perspective; it offers some first rate introductions, explanations and provides the reader a list of suggested titles for further study. The only downfall, if you could call it that, is the fact that this text written from a decidedly Christian point of view. This should come as no surprise give both Dr. Moreland and Dr. Craig are known as contemporary Christian apologists. Someone who is looking for a text that is a collection of viewpoints or all inclusive in its approach may be disappointed with the authors' presentation. Yet in spite of its slant, it would make an outstanding primary text for an upper division undergraduate or graduate course in philosophy of religion. Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview would be a valuable addition to the library of anyone who is interested in the subject of philosophy or Christianity.",0,1,0,books
"I am not a mountain climber but this book kept me spellbound.  The author did a very good job maintaing objectivity, although it was clear that greed and competition between the two climbing groups was the main reason this disaster happened:  neither man wanted to back down from the mountain and give up his quest to be first at the summit, they had become oblivious to the incoming storm.  This cost several climbers their lives.The author was also quite good at describing not just the event, but also the terrain (trash all over the mountain crevaces), the sherpas, and even a personality profile of every climber on the quest.  In the end we all cheer for all of them to make it, even when we know that some won't.The hardest part to read was the last chapter, when Krakauer went to interview the climbers after the event. Krakauer's other books are just as good, namely ""Into the Wild.""  He certainly does a very good job researching his topics.I read this book in one night because I couldn't put it down",0,1,0,books
"""Symbiotic Planet"" may sound to the average reader like just another attempt to ""classify"" life on our little Earth. This would be an error.

"John Lennon regarded IN MY LIFE as one of his most important songs. A long poem about the favourite spots of his childhood had gone in front of it. The lyrics remind to the amazing poem of THE OLD FAMILIAR FACES of Charles Lamb [1775-1834], which John possibly knew via the widespread anthology PALGRAVE's TREASURY. It starts: I have had playmates, I have had companions... "" sounds rhythmically like ""There are places I remember / though some have changed, some forever ...""

"When I first finished The Waste Lands and picked up Wizard and Glass, I was ultra-excited to continue on with the series.  Then I read that Wizard and Glass was basically one huge flashback about Roland's life before the Dark Tower became his sole motivation.  When I read that, I almost considered skipping the book entirely, and just reading a summary in the argument in the next book, but now I am really glad I didn't do that.Wizard and Glass starts out immediately following where The Waste Lands left off.  Roland, Eddie, Susannah, and Jake are aboard Blaine the mono, and they are about to engage in a riddling battle to the death.  Blaine the mono is a really cool character, and I was a little sad to see his story cut short.  Once Blaine has been dealt with, the ka-tet arrives in a version of Topeka, Kansas that has been ravaged by the Superflu.  The ka-tet moves through the abandoned town and eventually starts to catch glimpses of a huge green palace in the distance.  But before they get there, the group palavers one night, and Roland tells them his story.Roland's story is largely a romance between he and a girl he meets when he and his two friends (Cuthbert and Alain) are sent out west by Roland's father.  Roland and Susan fall in love with each other, but their love is forbidden, of course, and meanwhile, Roland is losing focus on what is really important in the Barony of Mejis.  There are a group of men trying to use the town's resources for John Farson, the Good Man, to wage war on the rest of the world.Wizard and Glass is a very long, very in-depth love story at its heart.  Sure, it's got action and suspense and gore, but the meat of the novel is devoted to fleshing out Susan Delgado and the love she shares with Roland.  Obviously, she weighs on Roland's heart all the time, and King wants the reader to understand why.  In my opinion, the reason that the novel is so well done is because of King's patient writing style, and his ability to demand patience from his readers.  The whole book is basically a build-up to about 50 pages worth of climax, but still, once you get there, the previuos 400 pages are all worth it.This novel, I can tell, is where the series might start to go off the deep end.  But that's ok.  The weird situation at the end is still exciting, and it makes you want more.  So as long as there are answers at the end of this, I'm loving the ride",0,1,0,books

"If you're looking for balanced, cool-headed, well-argued case against Social Security reform, this is not your book. If you want a partisan diatribe that is about as worthwhile as the anti-Social Security &quot;propaganda&quot; that Mr. Skidmore describes, then you've found your  tome. (Curiously, in the author's narrative &quot;propaganda&quot; suddenly  becomes skillful or ingenious &quot;rhetoric&quot; when its used in support  of Social Security; never mind that the program has functioned like a  multi-billion dollar campaign fund for the Democrats). This book is  essentially an elaborate ad hominem attack against anybody who would dare  question the sustainability of current entitlement spending on the elderly.  The author attributes all reform proposals to the right-wing; never mind  that several respectable individuals whom no one would call reactionary,  including Brookings economist Henry Aaron, former CBO director Robert  Reischauer, former SSA chief actuary Robert Myers, and Urban Institute  senior fellow Eugene Steuerle have also suggested reasonable,  non-privatization proposals to slow the rate of entitlement spending.  Skidmore's arguments against any reform are poorly constructed and rely on  a very narrow range of evidence and expertise. He offers straw man  refutations such as a cranky letter from an Auburn professor in USA Today,  of all places, that is hardly representative of mainstream thought. There  are truly bizarre counterarguments: he suggests that projections of  increasing life expectancy must be bunk because the human race is not  immortal. There are downright falsehoods: he claims that the  &quot;relevant&quot; number concerning welfare state spending is the total  dependent population--ignoring the fact that the average elderly dependent  costs far more money than the average child dependent, and that money spent  on the latter is an investment in a future worker while supporting the  former only contributes to consumption. The author is also either  completely ignorant or disingenuous when he discusses the program's  financing. Like many of those who claim a &quot;crisis&quot; in the system,  Skidmore misleadingly focuses on the program's long-term &quot;trust  fund&quot; balance. Even if the economy will do far better than is  projected, as he argues, Social Security will eventually not be able to  support itself on payroll taxes alone and it will have to redeem its  &quot;assets&quot;--translated, this means that general taxpayer revenue  will be necessary to subsidize benefits, increasing what current workers  are paying into the system. He is correct to state that the increase in  Social Security spending will be only 1-2% of GDP, but Medicare will add  much more to that and the real concern is entitlement spending as a  percentage of the federal budget. There is legitimate concern that general  revenue transfers to entitlements plus interest expenses will crowd out  funds for everything else--from education to infrastructure to defense to  programs for the non-elderly poor. Skidmore makes the downright silly  argument that we should just hike up the interest rates on the bonds that  Social Security holds--where the hell does he think this money is coming  from? As the late Herb Stein mused, we could simply &quot;credit&quot;  Social Security with the money to pay benefits for the next trillion years  if we wanted to, but this would simply be an accounting gimmick. Yet this  is what Skidmore endorses when he enthuses over Clinton's &quot;plan&quot;  to &quot;save&quot; Social Security by shifting debt even further down the  timeline. Predictably, Skidmore says that if trouble should arise, we  should simply raise taxes (in his eyes, raising the retirement age is a  dastardly benefit cut). In his glorified history of the program, Skidmore  doesn't bother to mention how Democratic Congresses routinely ignored  scheduled payroll tax increases and instead continued to hike up  benefits--thereby increasing the level of payments that are considered  necessary. Research, such as that done by Daniel Radner (1993) and Michael  Hurd (1989) show that the elderly are at least as well off as the rest of  the population, even though the elderly poor generally have no means to  escape their poverty. Yet Skidmore dismisses the idea of targeting relief  to this group, instead relying on the liberal shibboleth that attributes  Social Security's political success to its &quot;incorporation&quot; of the  middle class, which is really just a roundabout way of saying that people  tend to like the government when the government sends them checks. (He also  conveniently fails to discuss that the program's political support revolves  around a few carefully promoted fictions--see the Rothstein article in  reference below). Social Security and Medicare have been successful in  helping lots of people, there's no doubt about that. But we should not  ignore the fact that the program was created in different time for a  different world, and has grown into something far larger than what was  originally contemplated. Longer life spans, less working years, greater  health--these are all things to be happy about, but they also signify a new  reality that books like this one will not help us to understand. Far better  books on the subject include Aaron &amp; Reischauer's Countdown to Reform,  or Steuerle's Retooling Social Security for the 21st Century. Even if  you're skeptical of privatization, as I am, see the work of Martin  Feldstein or William Beach of the Heritage Foundation (Beach's plan DOES  account for disability, and he has answered critics of his methodology). I  found this book repeatedly frustrating, even maddening at times, for the  author's intransigence and even dishonesty on several issues--a for more  earnest discussion of the liberal standpoint is Richard Rothstein's  &quot;When We Practice to Deceive&quot; in Dissent (Fall 99). In sum, this book is alternately dim-witted,  disingenuous, omissive, and petty. It's hard to believe that a supposedly  reputable academic could put out such an unillimunating piece of tripe like  this. This is one of the worst books on public policy that I have ever  read",1,1,1,books

"Cherie Calbom has written the book I have been waiting for.  Because of my concern about nutritionally sound weight loss and wholistic health, I wanted to have a book that encompassed each of these areas.  As a biologist who has pursued health and nutrition for most of my life, I've tried many of the popular diet programs throughout the years. Many of them work for a while, yet do not provide long-term health benefits or are damaging to the body over time.  I was introduced to the benefits of coconut oil before I read this book, and they are indeed wide-ranging---coconut oil added to the diet increases health and wellness. However, most of the people I have coached need a clear path to run on.  This book provides that pathway by giving clear instructions that can work for anyone, regardless of where they started or what they know.  The book has a programmed pathway to effective weight loss, as well as instructions on how to restore the body to the health we were all created to enjoy. Many people I know have reported excellent results after only a short time, not only with weight loss, but also with increased energy and a sense of well-being. For those with atherosclerosis, liver congestion, high cholesterol, or other serious problems, Cherie's Phase II Liver Cleanse can help the body restore health when properly followed.  The book is fun to read, has great recipes, plus guidance for overcoming obstacles to weight loss, including emotional issues. I was especially impressed with the sections on blood sugar imbalances, thyroid problems, and candida, which have been a challenge for me personally as well as many of the people I coach. I highly recommend it.",0,1,0,books
"For years I have wanted to read a comprehensive history of this period, which is far less well covered than the Renaissance and Enlightenment.  To cover a gap in my knowledge, I believe that this is a near ideal text for a variety of reasons.  The reformation, the author proves, must be taken into account in order to understand the world today. First, the author evokes the context from which the Reformation sprung:  directly from the Renaissance, with its scholarly questioning of the essential texts and the intellectual world that it opened up.  But there was also the aging feudal model, which aristocrats were trying to preserve as the modern state began to emerge with the consolidation of power of the absolutist monarchies, taking away their independence of action; this created a natural pool of allies for opposition to the Papacy, which tended to naturally support the divine right of kings (with many exceptions, of course, as this is over-generalising).Second, in an incredible feat of ongoing exposition, the author explains what people were believing/thinking at the time and how this released the violent passions that shook Europe and led to uncountable deaths.  This is a realm completely alien to me, who was brought up entirely without religion - it is whether the faithful believe that the eucharist actually embodies the blood of Christ, symbolises it, or is a papist-inspired blasphemy; whether a baptism should be at birth or later in life; whether a person can be saved by redemption in Christ's forgiveness, is innately predestined to God's kingdom, or is granted it by faith (and ritual) alone; the nature of Mary's divinity or lack thereof; etc.  People were executed and burnt alive for one opinion of the other, and the author explains why and how.  This was by far the most interesting and surprising part of the book for me:  it proves how much ideas mattered then, not as a mere epiphenomenon as we tend to view it today, but an actual motivator for choice.Third, MacCulloch does not shrink from explaining how these ideas were used in the political context of the time, across Europe but also in the new world.  This makes for extraordinarily dense reading, from why Ferdinand and Isabelle ejected the Jews from Moorish Spain as they liberated it in 1492, to Queen Elizabeth I's struggles to consolidate power in England, to the unsuccessful military campaigns of the prince of Transylvania to take over Poland.  In particular, he explains why Martin Luther allied himself with rebellious princes against the peasant uprisings, which were ruthlessly smashed:  he needed their protection and they needed his ideological independence, in spite of the peasants' taking inspiration directly from Luther's preachings.  It is a dazzling historical tour that whets the appetite for more, which I cannot do justice to here in such a succinct charaterization.  MacCulloch demonstrates how religious concerns intertlaced into many of the powerplays that one knows about, such as Louis XIV's attacks on the Netherlands.Finally, the author examines the impact of the Reformation, not only on daily life, but as a grand historical movement.  It is here that in many ways the most can be learned about how the various christian churches (and entire cultural identities) evolved and adapted into their present forms.  For example, the US is portrayed as an embodiment of the protestant ideal in a new geographical context, which supposedly explains the far higher identification of its citizens with the church today than their paradoxically more laic counterparts in such catholic countries as France and Italy.  He even looks, in what I interpreted as an existential psychoanalysis, at the psychology of fundamentalism, with pointed observations about the post 9/11 world.  This too stimulates me to delve deeper into Muslim history and contemprary religious movements.If I have any criticism, it is that MacCulloch covers such a vast and sweeping movement that the reader can get lost in the details about who did what and believed what.  But then, that is the nature of the subject and I do not see how he could have done otherwise without oversimplifying things.Warmly recommended as a great and deep reading experience.  ",0,1,0,books

"Who is Paulton and why did Maturin want to visit him?  Who were the ""men and women on the lists?""  Who is Padeen and why is Maturin so particularly concerned about him?  Is Padeen also known as Coleman?  Why would O'Brien give us a hundred pages with nothing more than the sights, sounds, and smells of Botany Bay, unconnected to any story line?  What did O'Brien feel he contributed to the story with the addition of the island children to the story?  If the essence of the writer's craft is to create and maintain tension, to keep the reader riveted, to entertain, to inform, then even the most avid O'Brien fan must admit that The Nutmeg of Consolation falls short.  I will admit that I found some of the Aussie argot amusing, as when we learn that ""purple dromedaries"" translates as ""little, small, bungling pickpockets.""  But trudging through the final chapters alongside colorless protagonists, I am sure that the reader will be as happy as are the protagonists themselves by the prospect of returning home.

"I recommend -- five stars up, ""Lincoln's Assassins: Their Trial & Execution."" For this genre, Swanson & Weinberg have set a new standard of excellence.  It is about events that occurred after the assassination and burial of President Abraham Lincoln.  While the plot may be morbid for some - nonetheless,  it is enticing for anyone searching for truth, justice, and a good-old-fashion read. The writing is vividly done, the photographs are mesmerizing,  and the documentary evidence: overwhelming in presentation and abundance.Those who study numerology might find it interesting that James Swanson and President Lincoln were born on the same day. Like many successful entrepreneurs, Mr. Swanson discovered at an early age, his passion in life.  He started collecting artifacts about President Lincoln when he was ten years old.Since becoming an investor in many companies, I know the importance of mergers, compatibility, and symbiotic relationships. Consequently, it was amusing to discover Daniel Weinberg has been the owner of a book store for more than thirty years that specialized in books dealing with President Lincoln.Even though the events took place more than one hundred thirty years ago, the authors have compiled evidence and supporting materials in a way I could still feel the suspense, drama, and intrigue that was evidently experienced by those living during this historical period. Napoleon Bonaparte once said:  ""A picture is worth a thousand words.""  If you accept this premise, you will love this book as there are scores of photographs (along with eloquently done text) that help the reader form a compelling, and coherent analysis of events that transpired more than one hundred thirty years ago.Chapter four is the beginning of the conspiracy trial, which was unprecedented in so many ways. Presided over by President Andrew Johnson - it was initially going to be conducted in secret. At the last moment, compromises were made to allow selected people to attend.  The book reads like an episode of ""24 (the television hit). Each page is tantalizing, breathtaking, and thought-provoking. One of the eight facing execution was Mary Surratt. The human drama, suspense, and turmoil involving her part in the plot, kept me riveted, intrigued, and captivated.  The book is exceptional and has my highest recommendation.Reginald V.

"BEHIND THE SCENES WITH COUNT OLAF appears to be the typical behind the scenes movie book. However, once you begin reading the pages and looking at the pictures, you realize it's not. The whole concept behind the book is that Count Olaf has ""edited"" the original BEHIND THE SCENES BOOK. The dialogue that is supposed to go with the pictures is often covered over what appears to be scratches of paper and tape that are written on, explaining what Count Olaf wants you to know. It's a cute sight gag, usually only seen in books for young children. However, for anyone who knows anything about THE SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS, you know that the gimmick fits perfectly into the general tone and theme of the books and upcoming movie. There are lots of photos from the film and a few surprises for those who haven't seen the movie yet and who have only read the books.

"Prior to this biography on Dante, R. W. B. Lewis had established himself as one of the leading authorities on Edith Wharton and had also written a book about Florence.  Although he is not widely acknowledged as a Dante scholar, this brief volume is testimony to his obvious love for Florence's greatest poet.  Unlike many brief biographies of great literary figures, this is a remarkably balanced account of Dante's life and career.  Given the strictures on what can be covered in a small number of pages, other biographers of other writers often focus on an individual's life to the near exclusion of all else, or on the greater cultural context of their work, or on a discussion of the writings, ignoring the writer's world and life.  Lewis strikes a marvelous balance between explaining the historical-especially the political-context for Dante's life, in detailing the significant biographical moments that informed his career (including most of what we know about his limited encounters with Beatrice), and the development of his art.  Lewis's skill in refusing to neglect any significant aspect of Dante's life and work is laudable.Lewis's narrative progresses chronologically on a number of parallel levels.  He reverts on several occasions to Dante's genealogy, on the political situation in Florence in the conflict between the Ghibellines (who favored the claims of the Holy Roman Emperor in Europe) and the Guelphs (who favored the Pope and later split into the Black and White Guelphs, Dante being associated with the latter), Dante's platonic adoration of Beatrice, the development of Dante's poetry, Dante's role in the government of Florence, his eventual banishment from Florence, and the composition and content of his COMEDY.  I was especially encouraged by the number of theological figures who were crucial to Dante and essential for understanding the theological structure of the COMEDY.I do have a couple of minor criticisms.  One is that Lewis isn't always as sharp in his exposition as he clearly is capable of being.  There are also some curiosities, such as his comments near the end identifying Robert Penn Warren as ""the most complete man of letters of our time,"" a good if not great writer whom I believe will be largely forgotten in as little as twenty-five years (one wonders if Warren and Lewis were close friends).  There is an annotated biography, but most of the secondary works Lewis discusses are either out of print or not readily available, while many key contemporary texts dealing with Dante are omitted, such as Freccero's THE POETICS OF CONVERSION.  And how could any discussion of translations omit Singleton's, which is easily one of the highpoints of Dante scholarship in the past half century?  Two other small complaints:  no index and no chronology of Dante's life.  My own feeling is that there is never justification for not including an index in an academic book; the omission sharply reduces the book's usability.  Even in a short biography a chronology is useful, allowing one to make rapid comparisons between the various events in a writer's life and their work.Nonetheless, for most readers of Dante in English, this brief biography will serve as a superb introduction to both Dante's life and his work",0,1,0,books
"Issued in May-June, 2006, ""Morro Bay (Images of America)"" by Roger Castle and Gary Ream for The Historical Society of Morro Bay, is a very welcome and important addition to the limited printed information available about the history of Morro Bay, CA, a California central coast treasure.  This is a must-have volume for local residents and others interested in Morro Bay history, along with the earlier classic 1982  ""Morro Bay's yesterdays: Vignettes of our city's lives & times"" by Dorothy Gates and Jane Bailey.

Mason is a riveting tale that relates the natural human need for redemption through a story that realistically depicts the complex interrelationships between love, friendships, trust, and courage.Harry Feversham, a young man who finds himself born into a historic family of proud British military men, wants nothing more than to be free of such a heritage. Whereas his forefathers fought and died with great courage, Harry is petrified of risking his life for his country and mentally labels himself a coward. Nevertheless, he has little choice but to follow in his father's footsteps. When Harry's regiment is finally summoned to go to war in the Sudan, Harry's fear of his own cowardice overcomes his fear of his father, and he accordingly resigns his commission. Once three of Harry's closest companions uncover the reason for his decision to resign, they decide to each send him a single white feather to signify his cowardice.What ensues is a story of Harry's heroic attempts at redemption, not only from his friends and from his father, but also from the girl of Harry's dreams, who, being present at the time Harry receives the feathers, adds her own to the original three.Throughout the exciting events and plot twists of The Four Feathers, Mason presents to readers a reality of human emotions and impulses which cannot draw comparison. The characters of The Four Feathers explore the complexities of humanity, loyalty, friendships, love, courage, and justice in such a fashion that each reader can relate to in his or her own individual way, making each turning of the page even more personal and captivating than the last. The three most primary characters of The Four Feathers, Harry, Ethne Eustace, and Jack Durrance, become involved in a triangle of love, loyalty, and misleading each other about how each feels about the other two in order to try and preserve these traits.Mason's novel, The Four Feathers, is highly recommended for all those seeking an exciting romantic adventure to capture their attention for hours on end. There is no question that Mason's work is one of the masterpieces of twentieth century literature.",0,1,0,books

"Bill Broxton is a DEA agent who has been assingned to protect Prime Minister Ramsingh of Trinidad. His superiors want the man protected, because he has been co-operating in the war against drugs. They've learned that the drug barons from the Salazr Cartel want the prime minister dead, but Ramsingh complicates Broxton's life by refusing his protection, as he believes his own justice minister can do the job.Meanwhile the drug lords have hired the international assassin called the Scorpion to assissananate Ramsingh and guess who is part of  the cartel. You guessed it, none other than that justice minister who Ramsingh is counting on for protection. Now make the mix here a bit more interesting by making the Scorpion the girl Broxton wants to marry and you really have the makings of a good story. One I couldn't put down.This book takes place in the Caribbean and Mr. Stewart uses quite a bit of sailing terms in the book, but he does it in such a way that it adds, rather than detracts from the story. It's easy to see he knows what he's talking about when he describes the scenes at sea. In addition to the convincing scene setting and description, Stewart has also painted people we care about and who seem real. I enjoyed this sea-going adventure story and I think you will too",0,1,0,books

"Blount reads Revelation through the context of African-American culture, particularly African-American church culture. Blount states that in Revelation, John is asking, ""Can I get a witness?"" and when the preacher in an African-American worship asks this, ""The preacher wants you not only to hear what he is saying but to understand and then to act upon it"" (37).In terms of literary context, Blount writes that at John's time, witness meant witness, not martyr. He sees parallel irony in the fact that just as Roman slaughter brought more witnesses, not less, the same is true for racial hatred directed at African Americans. Slaves were not permitted to have their own services; to do so was to express resistance. Blount likens the shouting out of slaves in worship to the shouting out of the slaughtered souls in Revelation (54). Similarly, Blount sees the dressing up of African Americans at worship as related to the wearing of white robes by the slaughtered souls in Revelation.In Chapter 4, Blount interprets the hymns in the Book of Revelation through African-American music. Blount sees the hymns in Revelation as helping ""John's hearers and readers to initiate such resistance on their own"" just as ""music has been a primary weapon black people have waged in their fighting back"" (93). Blount sees the hymns in the African-American church and the musical genres of African-American spirituals, blues, and rap as being created out of oppression and an active resistance against it. He sees the hymns in Revelation as arising out of the same combination of oppression and active resistance.I highly recommend this book.",0,1,0,books
"Microsoft Project receives a lot of unfair criticism from dilletantes that expect it to be as easy to use as Microsoft Word. When they try to use the application without knowing the ""whys and wherefores"", they get frustrated, and act like the poor workman in blaming their tools rather than acknowledging their own lack of skill. Help is at hand. This book is a top-notch effort that sets out best practices to make the most effective use of Microsoft Project. The author does not tediously enumerate every last feature. Instead, he lays out a sequence of best practices, chapter by chapter in chronological order, to use the tool. End of chapter summaries and exercises allow one to gain practical familiarity with using the tool. I would rate this publication better than Microsoft's own books on Microsoft Project. What I like is that the entire book was written by _one_ author. Thus, there is a certain consistency of opinion from chapter to chapter. This becomes obvious compared to the other popular Microsoft Project tome, which, depending upon the edition, has close to a dozen co-authors. The author's style of writing is a little more verbose than one would expect, but it lends a certain charm and continental color to otherwise dry proceedings. However the typesetting of the book and the choice of fonts could have been better -- it reads like a printed and bound training manual. To summarize, overlook the typesetting and buy the book. It is a great book for Microsoft Project users of all skill levels (not just for the rank beginner, but the professional as well).",0,1,0,books

"This is an extremely well done book on explaining how to make different kinds of computer systems talk to one another. The title of the book uses the term SOA which stands for service-oriented-architecture. Other terms you might have heard for the same functionality include: SOAP (Simple object Access Protocol), WSDL (Web Services Description Language), UDDI (Uniersal Discovery, Description, and Integration), XML (eXtensible Markup Language), RSS (Rich Site Summary), or Web Services. These terms are not exactly the same thing, but are terms used as part of the implementation of data transfer between systems of different types. The internet is for the transfer of information from a computer to an individual who is going to read, look at, store or whatever the information that is coming in. XML, or SOAP, or SOA, or Web Services is the standard by which two computers can talk to each other. Want to see a system actually working. Go to www.Books-On-Line.com.

This book helps to answer the questions regarding the emotional rollercoaster ride that longterm prednisone patients experience.  Medicines are explained and contraindications as well as how to live with the side effects.  Prednisone is a drug that is not kind to the body but sometimes necessary and worth the side effects when there is no other choice and this book explains why it is the drug of choice.

"This is a review of many different types of fraud. It is perhaps most applicable for a course in school. To make it more interesting in the next edition, I recommend that the author tie the fraud to the penalties and the likely liability of perpetrators, chances of getting caught, and more anecdotes about criminal cases brought to conclusion, and details about how the prosecutors operate. The (surprising) general idea I get from the book is that fraud is rampant and seldom discovered. The collection of estimates about the society-wide costs of fraud at the end of the book is fascinating, as is the history of fraud at the beginning.",0,1,0,books
"Korea was a tragedy.  What makes it such a great tragedy is that so many  men died and suffered due to the incompetence and egos of men like Douglas  McArthur who was rarely if ever under fire or understood the big picture  what he was throwing men into. Yet it was a real success of sorts as the  Koreans did want us --unlike Vietnam -- and we did succeed in keeping half  of Korea as a free democratic (such as it is) country.  Unlike Vietnam, we  bothered to listen to those we were there to help and our objectives were  highly compatible, definable and achievable.  Precisely because they wanted  to be free and not because of force of arms they were free.  The will to be  free was the real weapon, the force of arms was the means or one means to  get there.  This book gives a highly factual accurate riveting account of  what was at stake in the world, for Korea, for us, for Japan, etc. and  shows how important the actions of individuals - omissions (e.g.,  McArthur's weak G-2) and commissions (Matt Ridgway's real leadership of the  men after McArthur's dismissal) can be to the outcome in history.  The  landing at Inchon was probably the luckiest landing in history and it made  McArthur look good, but it was not the key to what eventually happened.   Read on.  You will be amazed how poor our intelligence was, how poorly  equipped in the way of weaponry and clothing our men were.  How nieve many  of our commanders and McArthur was about the greatly limited ability to use  tanks and heavy artillary (Korea is a rugged tough, mountainess country,  not the rolling hills of WWII European mainland. Korea was perfect for  ambushing and massacring larger forces. If you want the inspiring and heart  wrenching truth of Korea told in a highly readable book, then this one is  for you and all lovers of those who attempt to write accurate history  (i.e., complete, factual renderings of the key parties, feelings, actions,  and philosophies involved)",0,1,0,books

"Highlights include... (My comments in parentheses.)  Compassionate societies never create fatherless and motherless families.  A same-sex family is never the answer to a child's developmental problems.  (One way to inoculate a fatherless child from the ill-effects of not having a father is for society to have a clear idea of what a good father is.  Same-sex marriage denies even that benefit to the fatherless.) The push for same-sex families will subject generations of children to an uncontrolled, ill-advised social experiment to meet the ""needs"" of homosexual adults.  (Children will be but ""trophies"" that symbolize achievement of a certain status for anxious gays working out psychological issues---the same way one sometimes sees a luxury automobile parked in front of a run-down shack--- an ""aspirin on wheels."")  Homosexual adoption is not necessary to provide homes for orphaned children.  Same-sex marriage is not about providing rights or physical resources to children.  No child in a same-sex family would ever ask, ""Why don't we have the same rights as other families.""  Instead, they ask ""Why don't I have a daddy?"" or ""Why don't I have a mommy?""  (There are many heterosexual families looking to adopt children, but the legal system often interferes, making some children practically ""unadoptable."")  Male and female are not ""Mr. Potato Heads"" where the cores are all the same and only the externals are different.  Gender matters.Endorsements of same-sex families by professional organizations are traceable to gay activism, not science.  (Scientists are ill-equipped to deal with the philosophical and emotional arguments used by gay activists--- so they ""cave."")A common challenge of same-sex family proponents is ""how does my family situation hurt you.""  (I would use the illustration of currency.  One person counterfeiting a $20 bill doesn't appreciably depreciate a genuine $20 bill--- but an initiative to make monopoly money equal to legal tender would have enormous impact.  The push for gay marriage makes counterfeit relationships equal to legitimate ones and diminishes every marriage)Traditional marriage has huge public benefits backed up by overwhelming scientific evidence.  Homosexual marriage will have enormous, negative public consequences.  (If homosexuality were held to the same standard of public harm as smoking, there would be no public debate.  Instead, we would have attorneys general of the states bringing lawsuits that would eventually bankrupt pro-homosexual organizations.)Arguments for same-sex marriage also break down barriers to other kinds of marriage.  The first couple in line in Massachusetts for a same-sex marriage license had an ""open relationship.""  (In recognizing same-sex marriage, society will have leap-frogged over polygamy into a more radical form of sexual relationship.  Consistency will demand legalization of polygamy since it's less extreme than what will have already been accomplished in allowing gays to marry.) The debate over same-sex marriage has been poisoned by name calling.  Concerns about gay marriage cannot be reduced simply to ""homophobia.""  Many gays recognize the social harm gay marriage would bring and are therefore against gay marriage.Gay advocates conflate same-sex marriage with interracial marriage--- but saying ""I have a mommy who's a (particular race)"" is radically different than saying ""I have a mommy who's a man.""If legalized, same-sex marriage will not just be acceptable in public schooling; it will be relentlessly indoctrinated.  (Humans have a perverse impulse to ""worship"" the unnatural.) Promotion of traditional marriage will eventually be labeled as ""hate speech"" if same-sex marriage becomes legal.  We've already seen it in Sweden and in Canada.Authors: Glen Stanton is director of social research and cultural affairs, and senior analyst for marriage and sexuality, at Focus on the Family, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

He makes the argument that America's attention span has been shortened by television, among other things, and that this explains a good deal of our political history.Think about how the soundbite has limited the ability of American's to actively engage in political discussion;  how much you multitask now that you have IM and email and TV and radio and 30 seconds ads all blasting at the same time.A really intersting argument...

"Richard Overy presents a fabulous book of insights on why World War II progressed and ended the way it did, from big ideas down to critical details. Only a small amount deals with actual battles, with exceptions for three of the most critical: Midway, Stalingrad/Kursk, and the invasion of France. His focus instead is on leadership (or lack thereof), economics, logistics, air power and bombing, the fight for control of the north Atlantic, technology, and the moral implications for the Allies and Axis.Obviously, Overy cannot pinpoint a single cause or two. All the items above were major factors. Failure on a couple of them, or more success by the Axis, could have made the difference. For example, Overy hammers at Hitler for numerous major errors, re-inforcing the conventional wisdom that smarter early leadership by the Nazis could have clinched a victory or at least a negotiated settlement. Nobody will read Overy's analysis and think that the Allies' victory was anywhere near pre-ordained or a matter of time even once the Americans joined. The Allies were both lucky and good.Overy gets closer to calling for inevitable victory in the Pacific, once the US survived Midway. (His summary of Midway is excellent.) After that, the US was dominant in so many factors, other than the fanatic resistance by Japanese soldiers, that the US was almost certain to wear down Japan even while investing only 15% in the Pacific (the number used by Overy). Therefore, Overy spends the majority of his analysis on the European theater. Unlike many western authors, Overy shows how the eastern front was far larger and more critical to the outcome. He found the right mix of battle coverage (Stalingrad, Kursk, etc.) and supporting factors in how the Nazis came to the brink of victory and the Soviets pushed back through sheer will plus rapid advancements in skill and equipment. One may argue about whether Overy's credit to Zhukov and others as individuals is justified, but that would be quibbling. His description and assessment are masterful. I learned a lot about the evolving Soviet strategy and their desperate efforts, such as packing and moving manufacturing complexes to the east under severe duress, and a population enduring hardship difficult for Americans to imagine.Another favorite example highlights the American genius for mass production and standardization, in contrast to the cultural factors that influenced German technology. The Germans' well-known talent for complex technology was unrestrained, leading to equipment that was constantly changing and was too fancy, not robust enough to handle particularly adverse conditions. Whereas the Allies were able to produce huge volumes of standard (even if simple) goods, the Germans struggled with production volumes and constant breakdowns. As Overy said, ""In the end the Soviet army proved just modern enough; but German forces were too modern for their own good.""Overy's coverage of the battle for air supremacy, including the bombing of Germany and Britain, doesn't duck from the controversy about whether it was worth it. He clearly shows that the early phases of the bombing were ineffective. Over time, however, Overy concludes that the improved capabilities were effective in damaging Germany and that the air war itself, cleansing western Europe of much of the Luftwaffe, was decisive in the invasion of France and beyond.These are some of the topics Overy examines. I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in the war beyond the personalities and the battles.",0,1,0,books
"Once upon a time there was a cute, little, green inch worm hanging out on a piece of grass.  One day, a robin came up to eat him, but the inch worm talked the robin into letting him measure the robin's tail.  Being such a useful worm, the robin did not eat him, but took him to other birds so that they could have something measured by the smart inch worm.  Finally, a nightingale told the worm to measure his song or he would eat the little inch worm.  Using his little worm brain, the inch worm began measuring the song until he had inched away to safety.  This wonderful book, written and illustrated by Leo Lionni, won the Caldecott Honor in 1961.  He has taken a little worm and made the reader fall in love with it through the worm's usefulness in measuring and his cunning ability to escape the hungry nightingale.  Even though there are many different scenes, with many various shades of green on them, Lionni has illustrated the little worm in such a way that the reader can always point him out.  Children would enjoy finding the worm on each page, especially at the end of the book when he is hiding from the nightingale.  Also, we always see the story from an outside perspective; eye level with the grass.  It is as if we are another small animal looking in on the story.  The background of each page is pretty much the same.  All Lionni has illustrated on each page is the worm and the other details that are needed during that part of the story.  For example, while the inch worm is measuring the legs of the heron, Lionni has only portrayed the heron with the worm inching down its leg.  I think this technique is good for younger audiences because it helps children focus on the story and keeps their attention for more specific details.  This also makes sense because there is a small portion of text to read on each page which means the audience does not have much time to look at the illustrations while the reader is reading to them.  As for colors, Lionni has kept them realistic.  For example, the flamingo is a bright pink whereas the nightingale's colors are calmer.  Overall, the colors in the book make the readers feel at ease and calm.  The dull greens of the grass and the open, white background keeps the reader moving along at a steady pace.  It's almost as if we know that the inch worm is going to outsmart the different birds and there is no need to get over-excited.  Lionni has intertwined the illustrations and the text in a way that they are dependent on each other.  Although you could get the gist of the story by either reading the text or looking at the pictures, by having the illustrations support the text, the reader gets a more detailed, visual story.  However, Lionni leaves room for the imagination to add on to the story at any time.	Overall, I loved this book.  Lionni has creatively illustrated this cute story, making children and adults want to read it over and over again.  	If you are looking for instructional ideas, I would read this story to students in primary grades before doing a lesson on measuring.  Then I would have students measure different things around the classroom including themselves.  I would also use this book when talking about different types of art.  I would have children do a collage or make something with decoupage.  They could even re-create a scene from the book!",0,1,0,books
"Written with well-known author, Cecil Murphy, ""Touchdown Alexander"" is a moving story about trusting God and living in true obedience.

He is a child of God first, a husband and father second, and the MVP for the Seattle Seahawks third.

I've been twice, including once to see the sunrise over the mountainous gorge.

In many cases, wasted lives of people who didn't have to die and all too often impaired by the 'two beers' that all DWIs have traditionally had right before getting stopped.

"For someone like myself, who enjoys a really exciting story, preferably about a real person,one need go no further than to read ""A Hero of Our Own"" by Sheila Isenberg. Varian Frye, a not-so-ordinary American, feels impelled to leave his comfortable life as a writer and editor and go to France as a member of the Emergency Rescue Committe (ERC) and risk his life to save as many refugees (mostly Jews) as he can from the Nazis. Frye is the only American  to be honored at Yad Vashem (Israel's Holocaust Memorial) because of his work in saving thousands of Jews. If I didn't know it was a true story, I'd think it was fiction because his adventures read like a fast-paced thriller, a veritable realization of the classic ""film noir"" of the forties. In fact, I feelthe book cries out to be made into a movie which I would be happy to see. Of course some of the book's revealed facts about our own State Department trying to keep refugee Jews from entering the United States when they knew it mean certain death was quite shocking and disturbing.  However, all in all, I'd recommend the book to anyone who enjoys reading a fast-paced  book about real heros and history",0,1,0,books
"Judge Richard Posner's 'Sex and Reason' has influenced me more then any book I recently read, lead me to a complete reevaluation of what the Law is, and what it should be.In this review I wish to concentrate less on Judge Posner's approach to the regulation of sex, although we will get there, but to his general approach to Jurisprudence.  Becuase if 'Sex and Reason' taught me anything, it is that the way lawyers 'do' the Law is in need of thorough revision.From my perspective as a third year law student in Israel, most of what the Law deals with is the meaning of words.  Lawyers and Judges argue about whether or not various actions fall into various legal categories, and, particularly, about ways of interpreting statues and precedents.  The main questions are 'how should one interperate the law'?  and 'By what method does one decide which interpretation of the Law is best'?In the United States, the main 'field of battle' regarding these questions are between the various Originalist positions (roughly, those who believe that words in statues mean what the people who wrote them meant), textualists (those who believe that texts should be read to be internally consistent) and living conbstitutionalists (the ones who believe that times change and the constitution - indeed, all laws - change with the times).In Israel, the main contribution is by former Supreme Court Chief Justice and professor of Law, Aharon Barak.  By Barak's lights, statutory interpretation is not originalist, nor is it textualist (""the interpretor is not a linguist"" is his famous catchphrase - sounds better in Hebrew).  Rather, Barak subscribes to a form of Living Constitutionalism which for want of a better term I'll call contextualism (Sometimes, misleadingly in my view, refered to as 'Purposive appraoch') - Barak argues that you can learn about the meaning of laws and decisions from their wider environment - the principles, laws and mores of the society.  When faced with a legal question, Barak will strive for Harmoney not with the language of other statues, but with their intentions, so that all Law would create a single, ideologically cogent, fabric.  In paraphrasing Hillary Rodham Clinton, one may say that according to Barak, It Takes a Village to decipher a Law.I emphasises these different approaches in order to demonstrate that the criteria by which we decide whether an interpretation of the law is good are very unclear.  But accept, for the moment, that one of these goals is superior to the others, and that we can evalutate various interpretations based on these criteria; We are still left with the question of what the marginal untility of trying to improve our interprative approach according to one of these criteria is.Suppose a new study slightly imroves our understanding of the original meaning of the U.S. Constitution.  Let's say that after a great deal of historical study and analysis, professor A has improved our understanding of the meaning of a certain clause by 5 %.  Now interpretations are 5% more likely to correspond to the original understanding of the terms in question.Well, so what?  Are we, as a society, better off because we get a slight improvement in statue interpretation?  That is highly unlikely. Even if we accept that one method of interpretation is correct, that does not mean that its outcomes are good.  Indeed, it is unlikely that s study of 18th century political philosophy, or a comperative study of the spirit of law, will lead to good social outcomes.  If you accept that it will, congratulations: you have just passed from the domain of Jurisprudence to the realm of theology. From of social point of view,  imrpoving stuatory interpretation based on any of the above criteria is a huge waste of time;  a great deal of effort and resources are spent on things that will not, frankly, matter.What I glimpse in Richard Posner's 'Sex and Reason' is an alternative: Pragamtism. The alternative is implicit here; I assume, not having read any of his other books (but I do frequest his excellent Blog, written jointly with econmist Gary Becker), that this approach is developed further elsewhere.'Pragmatism', as I understand it, is about making positive statements about the consequences of various legal rules, and then chosing the best one.  This requires sound theoretical analysis (Posner, and I, see the foundation of it in economics, but in principleit can be founded on psychology, anthropology, sociology, or many other fields, and Posner used reasearch from all these fields in his book) of the situation, and especially empirical research to find if the theory holds.  Thus, a pragmatic approach to the questions of legal interpretations and doctrine requires first making positive inquiries into the subject; Only then should we make a normative judgement.An example for this kind of reasoning would be the case for the supply of  contraception to Teenagers.  In the United States, some conservatives oppose supplying sexual education and contraception to Teenagers, and promote abstinence instead (in prgrams such as ""The Silver Ring Thing"", ""True Love Waits"", and ""Free Teens"").  Reasearch, however, demonstrated that such programs rarely decrease the negative side effects of Teenage sexuality such as unwanted pregnancy and disease (pp. 270-271).  As Posner writes ""the idea that puritanism may actually increase ... unwanted births is difficult to accept, but ... only because effective puritanism... would have the oppositve effect.  A Puritan ethic that has only a modest effect in reducing the amount of teenage sex may produce more teenage pregnencies and unwanted births than moral indifference to such activity would"" (p.272).Now, in my view, this kind of analysis should be paramount in deciding legal questions such as whether government support for abstinence programs should be deemed constitutional.  Perhaps the legal rethoric allowing the government to fund such projects is powerful - but legal niceties should not obscure the underlining realities.",0,1,0,books

"______________________________________________Andy Grove, CEO of the phenomenally successful Intel Corp, is clearly worth listening to on the subject of management.  The ""Wintel"" success story is well known.  More harrowing was Intel's earlier self-transformation from making memory chips to making microprocessors.How to steer an enterprise thru a major change in its business, per Mr. Grove:  1)  Figure out if a major change is imminent.  If so, you're about to enter what Grove calls ""the valley of death"".2)  Figure out how to deal with it.  Largely (for CEOs), this involves listening to your employees & doing your homework.3)  Set a new course, sell it to your company, and stick to it.The ""secret"" to success here is identifying the oncoming crisis early & reacting sensibly.  He relates the story of Apple, a company with clearly superior products - the Mac operating system, the first good laser printer - completely missing the shift from proprietary to open PC standards, and ending up as a niche player.  John Sculley, then Apple's CEO, acknowledged this crucial mistake years later.  Groves thinks Sculley knew this shift was happening , but wasn't able to overcome Apple's ""inertia of success"".   Curiously, this was pretty much the same problem IBM had when PCs began displacing mainframes.  It's very hard for an organization to give up a strategy that has been richly rewarded in the past.In management, as in engineering, we often learn more from failures than successes.  Grove's case histories will make informative reading for anyone in business.  Not many of us are CEOs, but we'll all go thru Grove's ""strategic inflection points"" in our careers.Review copyright 1998 by Peter D.

" Supreme Bar Rvw's MPRE course is amazing. I took one of my school's ethics classes to fulfill the professional responsibility requirement & prepare for the MPRE.

Professor Lazarus does a great job of explaining the course's rather thorough outline, & does an even better job of showing how to deal with the exam's tougher questions. He is serious, but has a wry sense of humor, & a presence that is both authoritative & comforting.  The course also comes with many practice questions & well written answers for each.

I've passed it onto countless freinds, all of whom returned it to me, unfinished, scared to have it in the house with them.

"In recent years, there has been a great deal of emphasis on Polish anti-Semitism. This is despite the fact that anti-Semitism  existed virtually everywhere, and in Poland never approached the level which Jews encounted in many other European nations. Moreover, the positive aspects of Polish-Jewish relationships have been virtually ignored. Pogonowski's excellent book does much to show, in fact, how Jewish communities flourished in Poland",0,1,0,books

"The book is a polemic with carefully cherry-picked facts and contradictory evidence omitted to arrive at the author's conclusion that ""... only those few resistance fighters in the Wehrmacht who protested against extermination (of the Jews) in one way or another deserve our respect."" (page 296) Many conclusions are drawn from very scanty evidence, and an indictment of all 17 million men in the German Wehrmacht as criminals in the whole is certainly not scholarship.  The reader is confronted with many (untrue) editorial statements presented as fact: i.e. ""They (the German military leaders) had failed to grasp the significance of the fact that the countries with democratic governments had been able to defeat Germany in World War I because they were better able to motivate and mobilize their populations."" (p. 2); and ""Hopes for a more democratic kind (of armed forces), once espoused by no less a figure than Friedrich Engels, proved again and again to be illusory."" (p. 160) indicates both that the author looks favorably on Communism and that he understands that the German private soldier possessed little freedom for dissent (in contradiction to his arguments). The Soviet Union is presented most sympathetically, and even the massacre of 14,000 Polish officers by the Soviets in 1940 at Katyn was reduced to a mere 4,000 (obviously an editorial mistake), and noted merely in passing.  That upwards of 3 million German soldiers died in Russian captivity is not mentioned.  Yes, the war on the Eastern Front was waged in an especially brutal and merciless fashion, but this book adds nothing to the literature on the subject.  This book is not recommended for the serious historian, and Harvard should be ashamed of publishing this title except as a table book at the holocaust center alleging that all Germans in the Wehrmacht were bad and guilty of crimes against the Jews and humanity",1,1,1,books

"This is a book which should not be missed if you are interested in the Caucasuses in general and Chechnya in particular. It should be required reading for all students of Russian history and all counter terrorist experts who may not specialize in the Chechen situation. Gammer has written an eloquent, witty, compassionate and utterly fascinating book jam packed with cultural tidbits which make understandable the recalcitrant nature of the conflict between Russia and the clannish  Mountaineers. It is, also, unusual to encounter a nuanced understanding of the reception of Islam into Chechnya and how it has played out vis a vis the gazavat, evolving into jihad, in some sectors. One of my few quibbles would be that I would have liked more on family and gender relations though this is not to say that there is not valuable references to be found here. It seems to me that this book had to be written first but it is hoped that in the next, more space will be given to this underlying conflict. On the geo-political scale, Gammer aptly identified the problematic issue of pathological control, the desire to engineer 'peoples' lives and language' which inevitably fails. This is a stellar book which is sure to be come a classic.",0,1,0,books

"I'm glad to see a reissue of this classic in hardcover.If you are interested in bullfighting, Hemingway or Spain you should find this book interesting, enjoyable reading.It is a playful introduction into bullfighting and at the same time a reminiscence of Spain and bullfighting.The book deals with the art of bullfighting as it existed in the twenties.  That said, most of the passes, techniques, tricks, foibles he describes still exist in bullfighting as it is practiced today. And while not extremely deep on the technical side of the subject, this is the most readable of any book on the technical aspects of bullfighting I've come across.  If you want to understand the basics of bullfighting, this would be an excellent place to start.Hemingway profiles a handful of matadors.  They are all from impoverished backgrounds, basic peasant stock, that despite the fame and money they never can quite leave behind this past.  It was a much more dangerous profession then, before the advent of antibiotics when death from a septic wound was a risk from even a minor goring.Hemingway is unrestrained in his love of Spain and this shines through the book.

"I've been seriously consuming Medeival literature for about a year now after my interest was re-awakened (I found out the Mythology & Folklore shelf at Barnes & Noble is a veritable treasure trove!)  I'd never read a saga before, but the Poetic Edda had convinced me that I would enjoy anything Norse or Icelandic.  Sagas of Icelanders is a huge, bulky book.  To get a book that size at such a reasonable price was a bargain I could not pass up.  The introductory material helps put a historical perspective on the sagas and prepares you for what to expect ... then the fun starts with Egil's Saga, which is the longest and possibly best in this collection.  Other reviewers have lamented the absence of Njal's Saga here - it is published seperately and was probably too long to include in this collection.  (Based on what folks have said though, I'm going to have to get Njal's Saga.)I am now a saga addict!  I devoured this book with amazing eagerness; each story is an engrossing page-turner.  I just couldn't stop reading them.  The style is intentionally simple with an economy of words and an emotional starkness that reminds me of Dashiell Hammett.  There's no chivalric nonsense or courtly fanciness to be found here.  The storytellers do not attempt to flatter their audience or paint their characters in a more positive light.  Characters are tragically stubborn, stupid, violent, irrational, sometimes even psychotic.  They can also be strong, noble, just, independent, faithful, practical, and hardy.  The sagas have a ""just the facts"" attitude that is unique in Medeival literature.  They are also unique in being epic-length prose instead of poetry, and having secular subject matter.  I have to wonder - these monumental works, produced in the Christian era but portraying semi-historical pagan characters in a sympathetic light - how did they get written?  Who wrote them and why?  Who was the intended audience?  This is the mystery of the sagas when the indroduction refers to them as a ""literary Stonehenge.""The world of the sagas is violent.  There's plenty of killing - sometimes for no apparent reason, but usually it's an act of revenge for a wrong, real or perceived.  One reviewer with an axe to grind has condemned this book as a ""distorted view"" of Icelandic history, but I think he misses the point of the collection.  It's not meant to be an accurate history; it's a sampler of Medeival sagas.  Consider how ""accurate"" a collection of two-fisted detective novels would be as history of early 20th-century America.  Literature is supposed to entertain.  Who wants to read about Grimwald the Meek who just stays on his farm and lives peacefully for 50 years?  That's not interesting.  The sagas are about interesting people who did remarkable things.But - again, strange for Medeival literature - most of the saga characters are NOT of noble blood.  They are often members of wealthy and influential families, but seldom are they royalty.  People in the sagas are not afraid to get their hands dirty.  They make their fortunes by working, trading (and going on Viking raids.)  You won't find Romance cliche's of idle kings and queens and knights here.  King Harald of Norway shows up often, but he's certainly not presented as much more than a successful warlord, and usually a tyrant.I was surprised but not especially disappointed to find a lack of ""mythology"" in the sagas.  There's a little bit of magic here and there, and a ghost or two, but little is said of the gods and even less of nature spirits, dragons, fairies, etc.  Compared to Celtic tales (like the ones in the Mabinogion, for instance) the sagas are firmly grounded in reality.One other caution:  I found myself sometimes bewildered by the Icelandic names and I had difficulty keeping track of who was who.  Most sagas tell a story of several generations of a family, and sons are named after grandfathers, and neighbors have the same names, and after a while you're floundering in a sea of Thorvalds and Thorgrims and Thorsteins and Snorris, etc etc ... and each one of them is a son of another Thorvald, Thorgrim, Thorstein, or Snorri and you lose track of who is who.  I had to do some page-flipping sometimes to look back and re-establish who a character was and what he had done earlier.  But other than that this was a quick and enjoyable read.It's interesting, it's huge, it's affordable:  If you don't buy it there's something wrong with you",0,1,0,books
"Karr &amp; Chu write to inspire improvement in biological assesment protocols; no doubut I agree with them on this goal.  They also remind us all that the &quot;proof of the pudding&quot; is in the biological  relevance of the statistical analyses which we undertake to perform this  task.  Again, no problem.  I do have suspicions re: their rather singular  fixation on univariate compression of data to the IBI format to the extent  that any &amp; all multivariate data treatments are avoided.

"There have been very few poets with such creative mind, potency and inexhaustibleness as R.M.R.

"This is a unique and oustanding book which, for starters, points out that what most Americans think of as ""Yoga"", i.e. asana or postures, is the tip of an iceberg which began hundreds of years before, but which has had little clear explanation for Western readers.  Stephen Cope is obviously a learned scholar, and able to explain rather impenetrable Eastern philosophy in clear, concise, understandable writing, and to place it in the contexts of both centuries of philosophical thought (both Eastern and Western) and of modern psychology, fields in which Mr. Cope is clearly a master. By juxtaposing his crystal clear discussions of yogic philosophy with easy-reading examples of 5 contemporary ""seekers"", he has made the book extremely accessable to beginner and veteran yogis alike. With his unique background as a psychotherapist and ""scholar in residence"" at Kripalu, I suspect there are few if any others who could do this.If you have practiced yoga postures and found something special, you have only dipped your toe into an ocean.

"It's about 100 years since Frederick Winslow Taylor introduced the philosophy of ""scientific management"", with its offspring such as the time-and-motion study and the mythical man-month. That's about how long it takes for a big idea to soak into the awareness of managers everywhere - especially those who are more committed to looking good than to managing well.Tom DeMarco, co-author (with Tim Lister) of the magnificent ""Peopleware"", has done it again. Although ""Slack"" runs a little over 200 pages, you will probably read it in less than four hours because it is actually quite hard to put down. You will keep on thinking, ""Yes, I've seen that!"" and ""Those words ring a bell"".In the course of his consultancy practice, which has taken him into many organizations including Apple, HP, Lucent and IBM, DeMarco has noticed a lot of counterproductive management behaviour. Many acts and policies that look good in the short term lead to corporate death in the longer term. More specifically, it is always possible to squeeze out a few more percentage points of ""efficiency"" - but only at the cost of damaging morale, precipitating burnout and losing the flexibility without which sensible decisions cannot be made.Faster isn't always better. Effectiveness matters more than efficiency. People are not interchangeable ""resources"". Without challenge and growth, the best employees soon leave. Overheads are not necessarily bad. Consciously or subconsciously, we already know these things. DeMarco just hammers them home so we will never forget them again.I really have only one quibble with ""Slack"". DeMarco has no business criticising Dilbert and his fellow engineers for ""giving up"" on their pointy-haired bosses. Sure, employees have a responsibility to make allowances and go the extra mile - but the PHBs systematically abuse every extra bit of slack that anyone cuts them. That's part of the joke, of course.This is not just a book that will confirm your suspicions, and reassure you that you are not the one who is going mad. It's a simple, easily-understood message that everyone in business needs to hear. Most of all those right at the top - DeMarco says that many employees have told him, ""I wish my boss could be here now to hear you say that"".",0,1,0,books

"As management consultants in organization and compensation, as well as management book reviewers, we are all-too keenly aware that the achilles heal of leaders is very often, their inability to seek, get and properly use good advice.This book addresses this need, by presenting critical, to-the-point insights into this quintessential leadership subject. To do so, it offers a framework for advice taking and an understanding of the attributes of great advice taking. The core propositions of the author are: 1) actionable, timely and sustainable advice is essential to achieve organizational change; 2) it is the leader's responsibility to identify needs for advice and choose and use advisors wisely, and; 3) leaders must achieve the appropriate mindset to be good advice takers and master the skills to take maximum advantage of advice given them. Among the nuggets in this book are rules and fundamental principles of advice taking, the four types of advice, and the attributes and abilities of a skilled advice taker. The book offers important insights into a subject that may seem a blatantly obvious dimension of leadership, but is often neglected, poorly understood, and taken for granted. This book is a very important contribution to the essential literature on leadership. We highly recommended it all who are, or strive to become, leaders",0,1,0,books

"I once stated that the further you get away from AA, the worse the  12-steps are in new groups (CoDA, OA, and so on). This book and this  organization were created for people with psychiatric illnesses who have   chemical or alcohol abuse at the same time. I told my therapist more than  once, &quot;Look it. I do NOT want to be in a group with crazy people who  have heroin needles hanging from their arms!&quot; He replied mildly,  &quot;I don't think that will happen.&quot; Just the opposite happened!  There WERE schizophrenics and hard drug users (especially cocaine)there.  But they were REALLY nice, well-dressed, and honest. Wonderful people.  These were DRA people. And this book is our handbook. DRA believes that the  BIG BLUE book of AA states that it is alright to take psychiatric  medication. I don't know about that. But  this book is a gem. It states the  entire format of DRA. Maybe I shouldn't say this. But just between you and  me, the members of DRA seem to be members of AA as well. I'm doing both. I  have been 101 days without alcohol. How did I do it? My psychiatrist looked  me straight in the eye and told me that the combination of Valium (I'm a  Valium addict) and booze will turn my brain into mush. I REALLY hate him.  But he may have helped me more than anyone. He suggested DRA. So did my  therapist. But I fell for the cognitive therapy bit so much (SMART, RR. and  so many other &quot;test tube&quot; semanticists). My psyciatrist said that  I'm an &quot;alche who takes 'goof balls'&quot;.

"P.D. James is an amazing author.  I really enjoyed A Certain Justice.  The book was lengthy, yet very readable.  The cast of characters and their dirty little secrets are brought to life in evocative fashion.  James clearly has an immense understanding of the criminal justice system, which certainly was gained from her time as a magistrate and while working for the British Civil Service.  I notice that several reviews speak of a ""weak"" ending.  I disagree.  The ending is not only plausible, but possible.  It is always a treat, when reading one of Ms. James's novels, waiting for the first appearance of Adam Dalgliesh.  Amazingly, the story proceeds and is very intriguing before he and his murder team generally enter the fray.  Yet, one he arrives, the book then becomes very difficult to put down.  It should be noted that Ms. James introduces us to one of her most indsidious and evil characters to date.  A strong 5 star read",0,1,0,books
"A lot of American readers may be put off by the rather dryly literate writing style of this British writer, but I would urge them to stick it out for a deep and true read, with an ending that is uplifting, but as painful  and complex as life itself. As one who grew up with the benefit of an  idealistic liberal education and travelled the world widely and deeply, and  like the protoganists of this book found that the almost diefied third  world races are no less free of the capacity to do evil than white  westerners, this novel had a brave ring of truth. In fact, it is so against  the grain that I'm surprised it wasn't condemned by the liberal elites who  write most of the book reviews. A different view of the missionary  experience, as well as Mantel's classical prose and subtly unfolding plot  make an interesting antidote to the simplistically politically correct and  gimmickally narrated bestseller, Barbara Kinsolver's &quot;The Poisonwood  Bible.&quot; This is one of the few books I've read in recent years that  had something new and original to say",0,1,0,books

" Many reviewers are clearly missing the point of how CREATIVE and valuable this work is. Ngakpa Chogyam is following Chogyam Trungpa's unique presentation of Tibetan Buddhist philosphy in an immediate phenomenological, psychological style. Both Chogyams are/were concerned with NOWNESS and Consciousness, not Opaque, Irrelevent aspects of TB. Both Chogyams are very intelligent and articulate in describing the energetic tendencies of samsaric consciousness in the context of emptiness and form. You will either get it/appreciate it or you don't. Whether they are a legitimate lineage is to miss the point. Both Chogyams are artists-psychologists who are highly creative and poetic in their endeavors and controversial because of that. This work is worth serious study and reflection. Also read, 'Wearing the Body of Visions', by Ngakpa Chogyam, as well as 'Transcending Madness,' 'Crazy Wisdom,'The Myth of Freedom' and 'Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism' by Chogyam Trungpa and you will CLEARLY understand where Ngakpa Chogyam is coming from.

"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? It's violent? Yes. Is there a whole lot of cussing? Oh yeah. But is the violence and language really that gratuitous? Well the language is pretty much how people talk, like when the characters are just talking a f-word might slip occasionally but isn't that how normal conversations are? The language gets pretty rough but think of what the characters are going through. I'd be cussing just as much if someone just kidnapped me or just shot a roomful of people. And about the violence being gratuitous? Hell do you know what it looks like when someones head is blown off? Well let me tell you it's much worse in real life than in the book. So yeah it's a violent book but that justs shows how sick some of the characters are. The main characters resort to violence but never cold blooded murder. But beyond the gore and language there lies one of my favorite stories ever. The first story in this book about Jesse's family is my favorite story in the whole series.

"This is arguably John-Maynard Smith's most challenging project in popular science writing. Written along with Eros Szathmary, a chemist, &quot; The Major Transitions in Evolution&quot; is written primarily for biology  students, but can be understood by anybody with a solid background in  evolutionary theory.  How have the ways in which information is transmitted  between generations changed through time and what were the crucial  transitions that made these changes possible? One early example that  illustrates the effect of these transitions is the origin of chromosomes.  Nucleic acid strands (genes) capable of independent replication, at some  point became linked and thereafter could replicate only as a set of lined  genes (chromosomes). A new way of storing information,a new information  system had evolved. How was this transition maintained through time?  Would'nt unlinked genes which replicate faster be favoured by natural  selection over linked genes? In effect, would'nt selection at a lower level  disrupt higher level organizatins? This is a common feature of many of the  major transitions and forms the fundamental theme of this marvellous book.   In a series of chapters the authors discuss the evolutions of various level  of complexity. The chapters are arrange in a logical sequence begining with  the origin of life and moving on to successive transitions including the  origin of the genetic code, the origin of the eucaryotes, the origin of  sex, multicellularity, societies and language. The list here is not  complete. I read the book from start to finish in a sequence, but readers  with a good background in the subject could probably start anywhere  depending on their interest. For non-biologist this is not easy reading at  all, and I would imagine that even biology students will find portions  challenging. An impressive quality of this book is the constant attempt to  incorporate the pecularities of a particular system in developing an  explanation to explain its origin. A discussion on the origin of the  genetic code includes the possibilty that there could be a stero-chemical  basis for specific amino acid-codon assigments, rather than it being a  'frozen accident'. Another example is whether there is a causal connection  between haplodiploidy and evolution of sociality in eusocial insects. The  author warn against making this apparently intuitive connection, and  instead seek an explanation in split sex ratios and in some cases the  particular features of insect ecology. The highlight of the book for me was  the last chapter on the origin of language. From Noam Chomsky's work on the  structure of grammer , syntax and language and representation, to an  evolutionary explanation for its origin, this was really an informative  essay. The ever recurring argument against the evolution of complex  adapatations, in this case language, by a series of adaptive intermediate  stages, has been dealt with using examples from animal speech, the genetics  of language disorders and a section on the transitions from pigdin to  creole.  The book strikes a good balance between explaining theory and then  discussing the experimental evidence available. Wherever possible, new  experimental approaches are suggested. Finally, like any really good book  on science the authors not only bring you up to date with what has been  done, but also stress just how much more needs to be done. It is this  feature about the book that leaves a lasting impression",0,1,0,books

"While I probably would not reccommend much of Gene Edwards' reading, this book is a rare and great exception.  Edwards writes in an easy to understand style that captures the reader.  This literally was a book I could not put down.  I just read for hours soaking up what the author was saying.While it is true that Edwards does not fully present how to deal with agony, especially that caused by Christians, this does not seem to be his point in writing the book.  This work is a wonderful help in getting a right perspective before God. If you want a book on relating to other Christians or dealing with conflict, sure read another book.  But if you want something to help you deal with pain inflicted by others on a personal level, this is the book(other than the Bible, of course).  Edwards helps us to see that God is behind our suffering, while not being the author of sin (that is absurd!).  In his winsome style Edwards manages to use only one passage from Scripture (I think), but beautifully combines Scripture's teaching on the subject (see Romans 8:28 and Acts 4:27-28).  Add this book to your library and buy it to minister to those hurting.  It gives great perspective to life in general and gloriously displays the sovereignty of God",0,1,0,books
"I have recently started reading James Patterson.  I have quickly come to enjoy his work on the Alex Cross series.  That's why I chose to try this book.  What a mistake!I could not get over the fact that Patterson was attempting some form of cross between mystery and science fiction.  Obvious potential storyline (what happens to the parents of the children?) was lost for tiring character development.  It takes way too long for the villan of the story to come forward and actually play a part.  Then, when he does, not much happens.  It felt as though a quarter of the book was spent developing the feelings of two characters towards eachother and then maybe 5 chapters (out of over 100) spent resolving the problem.Due to the excitement I have had in reading the Alex Cross novels, I felt it was difficult putting this book down.  Burning eyes and constant yawning fought me as I tried to search for something to happen.  Once it did, it was over.  I have never been so glad to complete a book and put it away.  I hope James Patterson does not venture down this path again",1,1,1,books
"Talyn is a novel that will haunt me long after I've finished it.  It contains all the right elements of a fully engrossing read: excellent world-building, vivacious characterizations, and a well-paced, complex plot.The novel's world is vivid and finely developed.  There are no medieval European cliches here; Korre is a world very much of its own and unlike anything I've read before.  Talyn's love of her homeland enriched the descriptions that may have been bland and overkill if told in third person.  Instead, they are fully immersive.Talyn's narration is poignant and engaging.  The scenes in third person add much to the story, as well.  It was sometimes jarring switching between the two, but such changes were infrequent enough that they did not become distracting.  The characters were vivid and finely developed, especially the villain, who was sympathetic enough to be very frightening.Talyn is a very well-plotted novel that keeps growing on itself as conflicts get bigger and more complex.  The novel is not without its share of plot twists and surprises.  In all, Talyn is epic fantasy at its finest",0,1,0,books

This is a beautifully written, though complex tale of love, possession, hate and evil.  In this book Gemma has a murder in her patch.  It's her first big case as Inspector, and the murder is of prominent woman who had her throat cut in her own driveway.  Gemma and her new team try to put the pieces together and as they start to do that it becomes apparent to her and to Duncan Kincaid that there are striking similarities between this case and one that happened in Duncan's territory.  They get to work together to try to prove a connection.  At the same time Duncan and Gemma are combining their households and moving in together.  It should be a completely happy time for them, but they both find that this case is going to  cause tragedy to a number of lives, maybe even their own.

"When I first got diagnosed with ADD (as an adult) I believe the exact phrase ""You mean I'm not lazy, crazy or stupid?"" went through my mind.  FINALLY, there was an explanation.  So when I heard about a book by that name, certainly I had to check it out.  Once I did though, I was sorely disappointed. I have ADD, yes.  Nevertheless, I've still managed to get pretty far in life in spite of the ""handycap"" the authors of this book seem so eager to hide under. It's been a while since I read it, but I have the distinct recollection of finding some new example of a ""You can't succeed in the world because you are 'disabled'"" mentality on every page.  You can't do this, you can't do that, you've failed and you will continue to fail - just accept it. Excuse me?  I don't know about the authors of this book, but MY ADD makes me creative and intuitive and perceptive and just generally a genuinely unique and awesome person (egomania aside).  Where is this addressed?  Where are the helpful hints for harnessing THAT kind of potential?If they're in there, I sure didn't see them.  All I found were new little tricks for combatting the ""affliction"" with which I am (oh so unfortunately) beset.  Using these tricks, I can hope against hope for some semblence of a ""normal"" life they say.  Thanks but no thanks.  I'm doing pretty well so far, and I refuse to feel like some sort of mental cripple.If you, and the authors are happy considering yourself as something less than the rest of the world because of the way your mind works, feel free - this is the perfect book for you.

"There are two basic types of music fans: (1) people who like to read quotes from the members of Pink Floyd explaining how they actually put together their records and (2) people who think Pink Floyd are, whoa, a  trip. People in the first category will love this book. Unlike other  similar books, this is an actual history of record production in  chronological order. Cunningham is a talented writer. He's also a respected  producer and player himself, which means he knows just about everyone who  is anyone behind the scenes of record making, and they all seem to have  agreed to talk to him! The book is worth buying just for all the little  anecdotes, such as the time the trumpet soloist on &quot;Penny Lane&quot;  inadvertently offended John Lennon at the session, or the time one of the  world's top producers, Chris Thomas, was beat up by thugs while recording  the Sex Pistols. But it's also full of important, hard facts. The section  on Motown, for example, cuts through all the usual mythology about  everything being recorded in Detroit, and provides quote after quote from  actual participants explaining how Los Angeles session musicians (Carol  Kaye, Earl Palmer, Hal Blaine, etc.) played on many of the biggest mid-'60s  Motown hits. That's typical of the book: Cunningham does his homework.  While most writers have a hard time even explaining what a Mellotron is, he  gives a detailed history of the instrument, and its use on particular hit  records, and provides an interesting quote from George Martin about the  instrument, and figures out where the actual Mellotron the Beatles used on  &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is today. This is not the sort of  simplistic hero-worship PR that entertains the average person in the  average magazine. It's a thick, accurate, intelligent book, full of  authentic, little-known stories, told from the inside, and they're  fascinating",0,1,0,books

"Another masterpiece from Donaldson.  Pick it up and READ it.... if you like it try out his other books.      The story of Angus and Morn  continues, even more gripping and well developed than in the first book.   Like The Real Story, there is bleakness and desolation, but they only serve  to highlight the characters.  The extremes that they are forced to  experience shape them and make them believable as individuals, and make  this book very dramatic and powerful.  You are brought to understand and  care about the characters, and by the end you will find yourself looking on  to the next book.

"As a committed Progressive Jew who fluctuates between Reform and Reconstructionist affiliation, I was glad to stumble upon Michael Meyer's excellent history of the Reform Movement.  Meyer traces the development of Reform from the early years in Hamburg and Berlin to recent decisions made the Central Conference of American Rabbis.  In so doing, he explodes a number of horrific myths that Orthodox &quot;Judaism&quot; lobs at Reform: that significant numbers of Reform congregations shifted their main day of worship to Sunday; that the movement is simply &quot;watered down&quot; Judaism; that Reform Jews are simply &quot;lapsed&quot; Jews who would be Orthodox if they didn't find it difficult or knew more about Judaism.  Meyer also shows that, just as there are and have been important movements and currents within &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, there were and are many different movements and currents within Reform.  The discussions of the movement's growth and foment on German soil, and the transfer of that foment to the United States, are particularly enlightening",0,1,0,books

"At many points, J.L. Austin's How to do Things with Words reads more like a linguistic textbook than a philosophy text. Whether you count this as a benifit or a distraction will depend on your disposition (it certainly beats reading Kant), but whatever your views on the subject, the work is a useful introduction to Speech Act Theory. How to do Things with Words examines a part of language that philosophy has traditionaly ignored, what he dubs the performative utterance. There are certain instances in language where to say something is do perform the very act you say, promising being the perinial example. If I say, under ordinary circumstances, &quot;I promise to do x&quot; then I have promised to do x. Using this seemingly magical fact as his starting point, Austin goes reach profound conclusions about the nature of language and philosophy. Though the tasks Austin sets out to accomplish are largely left uncompleted (he himself admits this) the book will give you the grounding you need to pursue other works in the field, such as those of Searle or Grice.

"The third and final book in the trilogy is wonderful book. I don't think it's quite as good as the Elfstones of Shannara but it's a pretty exciting tale nonetheless. Allanon is back yet again to fight a new (sort of) evil that has showed itself with the intention of destroying the lands of Shannara. There are two main stores in this book, the journey of Jair Olmstead(?) and Brin Olmstead(?). Both are extremely interestesting and exciting. There is a ton of action but not so much that they don't have time to develop the main characters. It was awesome to see both Jair and Brin mature through the book along with Slanter, the gnome. If you are looking for an exciting trilogy that you will have a hard time putting down, if you are looking for great action, plot, great characters and a little romance then this is the series for you. All three books are exceptional!!!This series is great for younger readers as well, while there is a lot of action and battle scenes there is no swearing and no sex, implied or otherwise.

This book gives a cultic (even satanic) twist to the Decalogue (ie.  evil can masquerade as an angel of light).  It is indeed a deceptive Trojan horse filled with ""Christian Science"" heresies. According to Mary Baker Eddy, founder of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, universally known as Christian Science, Jesus could not die for Man's sins, because Mankind never sinned; Christ did not really die on the cross therefore He resurrected from non-death. Christian Science also declares that the Scriptures cannot properly be interpreted in a literal way, and thus, the truth of scripture must be spiritually discerned before its message can be applied to our lives.Therefore, this book is hiding harmful non-Christian (new thought / new age style) metaphysics and psychic interpretations behind the precepts of the Ten Commandments.  Moreover, Fox here promotes a salvation by works and positive thinking that is foreign to the Bible.For those who wrote positive reviews of this book I want to say that Christianity is not about spirits seeking and deep trances, but it is all about the finding of the only Spirit of God, deep thankfulness in sincere meditation on the Gospel of the Cross, and above all, a relationship with God through His resurrected Son, Jesus Christ who died for our sins, so that we can be saved by the grace of God through faith alone. Emmet Fox's books can indeed change your life but in a wrong direction.  The teachings and interpretations of the Christian Science are not at all Christian and are also foreign to Judaism.  This cult resembles more eastern mysticism rather than Judeo-Christian doctrines.  Also this is not at all science.  I am amazed by how its people perceive the teachings of Christian science as being enlightened and how they see themselves as being thinkers.  This is complete ignorance.  These people do not even know how to think, much less how to think critically.  They are ignorant about the doctrines of the Bible, ignorant of theological, cultural exegesis, ignorant of historical / textual criticism, and ignorant about real, genuine science.The religion of (non)Christian (non)science is theologically, philosophically, Biblically and scientifically false; its roads end in eternal damnation",1,1,1,books
"I actually prefer this novel of Anne Bronte to her sister's ""Wuthering Heights.""  However, having just read the Penguin Classics edition of ""The Tenant of Wildfell Hall"" I have to say that the ""explanatory"" notes were much more than just explanatory. Now, I know that Stevie Davies is a professor herself, but I wish she would leave the interpretation for the reader rather than giving her own in the notes. I've noticed this trend to interpret and analyze rather than just ""explain"" in recent editions of Penguin and Oxford, but this example struck me particularly. I can see how some might find this helpful, but there were places in the text when I was actually wondering to what the reference might be but found no note explaining it. Rather Davies focuses on Bronte's feminism, which, though potentially helpful, forces a certain interpretation and analysis on the reader that should be left in the introduction and necessarily leaves out other aspects of the text that Davies may or may not find interesting. I don't disagree with her interpretation; it just took a lot of the fun out of reading the novel when I would turn to the back pages and find the thinking done for me. ",0,1,0,books
"To Doug Wilhelm:Today I checked The Revealers out from our school library. I thought it was going to be just another novel about the lives and troubles of kids. But it wasn't. I discovered a message. The book you wrote is powerful, and it made me think. About how better our world could be if we just said the truth. About how bullying is not just one kid picking on another.Because bullying leaves scars. On your heart, and in your head. You begin to believe that just because this one person harasses you, your life will be miserable. And then you stop trying to stand up for yourself, to fight back.I completely agree with what Turner said about isolation. Isolation started it all. Except that I understood it in a different sense. I believe that one of the most important keys to bullying is isolation. You keep them away from their friends, just for a few minutes and they're helpless. That's the way it is in modern society. I also agree with what Elliot said about traveling in a pack and how it's safer. You straggle away from your herd of pals, and *CHOMP* the bullies isolate and destroy you, just like what you would see in a video game.Your book inspired me to try out the same project in my school. I wondered, will the results be higher or lower because it's an elementary school? Will the stories be different?I think everyone should read your book. Because they will understand it, no matter what. Your book is so inspirational, so deep that I could cry. Thank you, for writing such a good book.Doha, Qata",0,1,0,books

"This edition of the Classics of Western Spirituality series includes several works attributed to the writer of the cloud of unknowing.  These include Counsels on Private Direction, a Direction on Prayer, a translation of Dionysius the Aeropagite's 'Mystical Theology', a work on Discerning Spirits and other short treatises on the contemplative life.    As with the Cloud of Unknowing, the short works are written to help guide young contemplatives through the process of knowing God through the mystical process of 'letting go' of all concepts and images of God, the classic 'via negativa' way of mystical theology.  The Pursuit of Wisdom especially is a sequel to the Cloud, designed for the more advanced contemplation of God after the steps outlined in the Cloud have been mastered.  The author retains the same sense of balance and sensibility as he did in the cloud, and these works only reinforce his well earned reputation as one of the finest writers on contemplative spirituality in the Catholic tradition.   This edition includes some excellent notes and also an introduction to the author's thought and influences, and seperate introductions to each work",0,1,0,books

"Like most volumes in the Loeb series, the emphasis is not on word-for-word precision in the translation, but on acheiving greater readability in broader terms. Since the original text in ancient Greek is provided on the facing page, the editors assume that anyone with a little knowledge of Greek can supplement the looseness of the translation by referring to the original. And in general, the compromises made in this way are good ones throughout the series. This particular translation is one of the more succesful in the Loeb series and manages to chart a course quite close to the original while also catching the flavor of idiomatic English.",0,1,0,books

"David Goldfield does an excellent job at discussing how white southerners have justified the purpose of the civil war.  He sites examples of politicians and how they have used racial issues in their favor.  The book also discusses how southerners has &quot;changed&quot; the civil war and reconstruction so that it portrays its' people in the best light.  I have read other race/cultural books (&quot;End of Rasicm&quot; by Dinesh D'Souza &amp; &quot;America in Black and White&quot; by Stephan &amp; Abigail Thernstrom) and this book is the first one that offers a good EXPLANATION of why things occurred as they did down south.  It was also timely because of the recent comments of former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  In fact, Mr. Lott was discussed in the book regarding his speeches at meetings with the Council of Conservative Citizens.  I recommend this book because it is well written and it tells the truth about the most intriging part of our wonderful nation, The South",0,1,0,books
"I read the old edition, from the library, and it is completely one of the most fascinating books I've ever read. It was recommended as background reading for a history of Western Christianity course I took. This book is perhaps not as furnished with specific details as some would prefer, but as a comprehensive overview of the Mediterranean world in the middle ages it is extremely successful. It is true that the book focuses only on Europe and the world specifically surrounding it (North Africa, the near East, Scandinavia and some of Russia) but I think it is also arguable that we consider ""the medieval world"" to be specifically that area in light of the social and cultural history associated with the Middle Ages. Using the same map over again is extremely useful and makes the book easy to understand (producing an enjoyable flip-book effect, as another reviewer said). The text is wonderful: though dense, it is extremely easy to understand and McEvedy brings an enjoyable personal flavor to his narration. The absence of most significant landmarks on the map is sometimes inconvenient; I found myself turning to the full map in the index quite frequently. However, I feel that not cluttering the maps with excess print is probably worth the inconvenience. Throughout the book, specific people are identified by an elaborate shading-and-bordering system that, once one has adjusted to it, makes reading the maps very easy. If you are looking for an informative and fantastically compelling broad history of the middle ages, this is a most desirable book.",0,1,0,books

"If your operating system is down, you don't have access to the ""fancier"" editors available that actually have interfaces that make sense to normal people. At this moment, particularly if you are in a system administrator position, you must know vi in order to access and modify files. It is so easy to pick up vi the wrong way - usually by word of mouth from someone who has learned vi the wrong way too. This book is the best I've found that is dedicated to properly teaching you the features of the vi editor and how to use them. O'Reilly has experimented with several book formats over the last ten years. This book is what I like to call ""classic O'Reilly"". It is the same format that most of their other books on Unix tools are generally written in, and if you have their books on sed and awk or Unix Power Tools, you know what I'm talking about. If you have learned the wrong way, or if you are a bonified beginner, start at the beginning of part one. Don't skip anything. Even if you think you already know something, at least read through the section to make sure you know the best way of doing it. By the end of the first seven chapters you should be a pretty skilled user of vi. The book makes frequent use of practice exercises, answers common questions, and gives advice on what to do when you encounter common problems. By the time you finish you'll even be writing ex scripts and modifying C/C++ code in the vi editor without accidentally inserting all kinds of control characters that will drive programmers crazy once ""the real editor"" is back on line.Part two starts at chapter eight and concerns itself with all of the various extensions to vi that are available via the four most popular vi clones available when this book was published. You do get some enhancements such as multi-window editing and even GUI interfaces by using them, but the cost is an increase in the confusion factor that this book tries to clear up as much as possible. If you are not planning on using a vi clone, you may want to just file this section of the book away in case the subject ever comes up.Part 3 consists of several useful appendices. Four of the appendices are still useful, but the fifth, on vi and the Internet, is a bit dated. I highly recommend this book if the vi editor is in your future, and if you have system administrator duties, believe me it is. You might also want to invest in the very handy ""vi Editor Pocket Reference"" by the same author. I have mixed feelings about that one. Everything is there in a concise format, but until you get used to it, information can be hard to find.",0,1,0,books

"There are several reasons why I dig Sarah Vowell and this book, Assassination Vacation.  For one, Vowell is an unapologetic history geek.  She is willing to go the extra mile to see the place where an assassin experimented with hippie style free love in the 1800's.  She's willing, no enchanted, with the idea of visiting some obscure site where Robert Todd Lincoln once fell on the railroad tracks.  She goes the extra mile so we don't have to, see?  But for me, that's just it.  I do want to go that extra mile.  I am also a history geek, and Vowell's book brings out the Nerd Nerdy McNerdington in me, wanting to visit all of these out of the way, unheard of trivial places just like she does.  Secondly, she does a really good job of telling a story, as I believe all good teachers must do, and she does it in a witty, eloquent, sometimes verbose, definitely tangential way that I find endearing.  Most history students in the world would rather do anything else than read about some 1800's dead people, but Vowell has the talent to make those stories come to life.Finally, there's the history she reveals, most of which the average Joe would never have known.  I won't include the spoilers here, but I have taught for 15 years, have a college degree in history, and was unaware of many of the details of Presidential and assassination history to be found in her book.Toss in a somewhat macabre sense of humor and a striking resemblance to Wednesday Addams of Addams Family fame, and you have the makings of an entertaining weekend",0,1,0,books
"With this excellent book, Robert Jastrow has written a good, easily understood overview of the Argument for Design from the perspective of cosmology. He first presents the reasons why there is a consensus among scientist for the Big Bang theory and an expanding universe (particularly convincing is Penzias/Wilson's radiation from the cosmic fireball). The universe is not only expanding, it is doing so at a controlled rate that allows for intelligent life (a bit faster start would have lead to rapid expansion, slower leading to an early collapse). He then leads the reader to the obvious questions raised by the new cosmology; who did it and why. Why did the Universe begin in an explosion? Did the Universe exist before that moment? Why does the Universe seem designed for life and for man? A nice extra is the final chapter by Steven Katz; Judaism, God and the Astronomers. He argues that Judaism permits freedom of ideas, and that interpretation of Biblical texts is a long tradition. He quotes Maimonides, saying that the writers of Genesis used metaphors, ""in order that the uneducated may comprehend it according to the measure of their facilities and the feebleness of their comprehension; while the educated take it in a different (i.e., allegorical or nonliteral) sense."" Other nice extras include the many historical photos as well as an index",0,1,0,books

"This is one of the most marvelous (in all senses of the word) reading experiences I've had in a long time.  Thomson's book was originally published in the 1950's, but had fallen out of print and was resurrected through the efforts of Seamus Heaney, a friend of the author's who also provides a very helpful introduction.  As a child, Thomson became fascinated by legends of seals who transform themselves into human beings (or vice versa), and in pursuit of this interest he traveled into remote areas of Scotland and Ireland where these legends were still part of the living folk tradition.  But in the 1940's the tradition was dying out:  the educational system pressured children to speak English rather than Gaelic, and listening to the radio had superseded traditional entertainments such as storytelling.  Thomson's chapters depict a way of life that was already disappearing;  he conveys not only the stories themselves but the entire &quot;flavor&quot; of the storytelling -- the people who tell them, the phraseology they use, their audiences, and the smoky cottages and fishy seaside shacks where the stories are told.  His summary of the seal legends is fascinating, but the greatest pleasure of the book, for me, was its evocation of the world in which the legends arose.  I can't recommend this book highly enough.

&quot;Towards A Poor Theatre&quot; by Jerzy Grotowski is probably the most important book written on acting since Stainslavsky's three famous character books. There is so little known about Grotowski and many people have tried to fake his work and people need to read the man's original words. Grotowski's vision of theatre has had the greatest effect on me more than any other person in theatre. He saw acting as a Holy experience where both the actor and spectator were transformed after the performance. Grotowski expanded from where Stainslavsky left off and drew his ideas everywhere from modern art to religious rituals to primitive theatre.

I have no children of my own and I own both the board book and the paperback edition of this book because I love the illustrations and the rhythmical quality of the text. As someone who has professionally worked with children ages 2-12, I find that this kind of text is invaluable to early readers (ages 2-7).  Children can easily pick up on the patterns in the sentences and begin developing many pre-reading skills (like being able to identify the left to right movement of written sentences).  To find books that your young child will want to read over and over again is a jewel in their literacy development.

I also knew though, that this book was NOT to be informative of what a military, or Navy wife was to expect of military life and having a husband in the service.  It's her personal experiences and feelings that she had during one of her husbands many deployments.  Nowhere on the book does it say that it's an informative book.  I would have to say it was quite comical, and there were points that had me in tears. I thought it was a wonderful book, not informative, but a personal look into Mrs. Smiley's life during a deployment.

"Hardcover books are these days just glued together masses of paper. Some results: the binding isn't durable, the pages don't open well or the binding breaks if you make them open well (would you like to pay 20 to 40 bucks for something that doesn't last you more than one reading time, if that (depending on how well you want the pages to open), and isn't very comfortable to read in any case? Modern publishers seem to think that you would). However, there are a few exceptions, the Night Shade Books editions of Dunsany's Jorkens tales constitute one such happy exception.This is the third and last volume, and is accompanied by a foreword written by Michael Dirda. Dirda mentions Dunsany's early biblical flavored tales, and says that he always tires of their utter artificiality after a few pages. I found that statement curious at best, as Dunsany has himself stated that he grew up with the King James Bible, and that consequently the style of the King James Bible was long the only style which came naturally to him.Otherwise the contents of this book are excellent.

I found my Co-Worker weeping at her station talking with another Co-worker as the other women told her to please stop crying her life is not over and she can change the things she has said and done before the lord come for her. it touched so many personal issues in our life. I realized after we read this book that we all had unholy soul ties. We where able to find a way by prayers in the book to be freed from the unholy ties. with the guidelines the author gave to banish them out my life forever! This book will set you free from a lot of excess baggage we carry in our lives. Now I need to order 2 more books for my Co-workers as they wish to have one each so they can take it home with them to help the people they love change their lifes before it it to late.,0,1,0,books
"""Cats and humans have been friends for over 6,000 years. Since the time of the Egyptian pharaohs, the relationship has been one of mutual reciprocity...Indian folklore even suggests that cats taught us the practice of yoga. As the story goes, when a young prince was frustrated, anxious, and unable to find inner peace, he fled to the forest, where he met a cat that taught him the art of tranquility and the main elements of yoga."" ~IntroductionIf you enjoy having pictures of cats on your desk, now you can enjoy 313 pages (Sat/Sun on same page) of photographs that can be flipped over and placed at the back of the plastic frame (with an easel you attach after it arrives) as the days change. Each cat presents a different mood, from playful to mesmerizing, innocent to adventurous. This truly displays a wide range of cat behaviors and moods. Each ""card"" or cat picture is printed on coated paper so these pictures could be reused later in scrapbooks or on presents or framed if you find one you especially love like the two kittens found in an amusing predicament while trying to climb vines to get to a birdhouse. There are black-and-white and color pictures, full-grown cats and adorable kittens. Yes, there is a cat ignoring you with its back facing you and a kitten dreaming over a huge bowl of milk, sure to inspire new adoption longings. A few of the cats seem to be art collectors or at least show a great appreciation for posing in front of wonderful furniture or art. One cat looks like it is laughing and quite a few are blissfully lost in a catnap. Makes a kitten mommy's heart purr. So many beautiful kittens and loving cats. I must say that when I do Yoga, Princess Meesa (my constant companion when home to the point of wanting to sleep on the desk while I'm typing) loves to join me and maybe she is just approving of what she thinks she has taught me. She especially loves cat pose because then she can walk underneath me. The introduction is only one page, but each day has a quote or comment about cats and already I've learned so many things even before the year has begun. Like on Friday the 13th, there is a picture of a cat sleeping and it says: ""Hormones required for kittens' growth are released only during sleep."" There are also quotes by famous people who have spoken about their love for cats and there are a few health tips. ~The Rebecca Review ",0,1,0,books
"I so enjoyed this series and couldn't wait to get to the next book.  I read all of them in order and was so pleased to find a series and heroine I was really excited about.  What a let down.  However, I persevered, read this book and went all the way to Cerulean Sins.  Now, I understand the negative reviews and other remarks by disappointed readers and fans.  I do not mind sexual influence when it adds to the story, character, whatever.  But, this is down right ridiculous.  I mean, give me a break here.   It was one reviewers opinion that the author refuses to listen to her fans opinions, I hope that is not the case and the plots get back on track and off the current story lines. Because I miss the original Anita and her stories",1,1,1,books

"""Coming into the Country"" is a classic that every visitor to Alaska should read.  But the first two sections can be skipped by most people.  Section one, ""The Encircled River"" is about the Kobruk River, and section two, ""What they Were Hunting For"" is a funny tale of the defunct effort to establish a new Alaskan capital city.Section three, titled ""Coming into the Country"" describes the people and region of Eagle, population 100 plus a loose scattering of rural homesteaders.  The time is the late 1970s when Alaskan lands are being divided up into national parks, native american, state, federal and private lands.  McPhee seems to have interviewed about everybody in Eagle to get a cross section of views -- most of them anti-government and libertarian. He probes deep into the Alaska psyche by simply recording what people told him.    What of the homesteaders?  I admire their individuality and hardiness -- but their bulldozers and airplanes seem incompatible with living simply in the woods.  Someone once said that the greatest boon to homesteaders was food stamps; thus their lifestyle is more than a bit artificial and dependent upon there being very few people inhabiting large areas of land.  On the other hand, do the ""posey sniffers"" (as they call environmentalists) have the right to dictate to Alaskans how they conduct themselves and what they do with their land?  Would New Yorkers on Fifth Avenue resent Alaskan advice on the management of Central Park?  The struggle between the environmentalists and the Alaskans continues to this day.  In the little town of Wrangell last summer, the Greenpeace ship ""Arctic Sunrise"" paid a call and was promptly slapped with a summons for violating environmental laws.  Greenpeace fled the scene, but was convicted of failing to have an ""oil spill prevention plan,"" which seems a serious omission by an outfit that protests oil spills for a vocation.   I'd like to see an update of McPhee's book.  What's happened to the homesteaders he interviewed?  I suspect that most of them have long since abandoned their cabins and returned to civilization, possibly to be replaced by a new group seeking the solace in the wilderness that is the goal of both homesteaders and posey sniffers, each in his own way.  This is a good book of objective reporting which both groups can enjoy.         Smallchief             ",0,1,0,books

"I know this area is for reviewing the book Brokeback Mountain and not the film, but I had to respond to another reviewer's comments about the movie. I found my way to this page because I was so moved by the film I wanted to read the story upon which it was based. I am pretty picky and tough to please when it comes to both books and films, I'm not particularly liberal, and I rented this movie with no expectations beyond that it was a quirky little ""gay cowboy movie.""IT BLEW ME AWAY. I watched it three times. I can't remember the last time a film affected me like this. It stayed with me for days, mostly thanks to Heath Ledger's haunting portrayal of Ennis Del Mar. This is truly one of the best performances I've ever seen on the screen. This movie cuts to the heart as much because of what is not said between characters as what is said. It has startlingly few gay love scenes, and even those are nongratuitous and brief; in fact, the two male leads have more sex scenes with the women characters than with each other. There is more ""gayness"" in an average episode of ""Will & Grace.""I never doubted for a minute that Jack and Ennis were in love, it's in every gesture, every look, and the fact that they continue to see each other for over 20 years despite the risks involved. Remember that men especially in those days were conditioned not to express their true feelings, even when it didn't involve a social taboo. The Jack Twist character only solicits prostitutes because he yearns to be with Ennis but can't. He like Ennis is a homosexual man living in a time and place where he is forced to deny that reality and live a lie. If he was only looking for sex, he wouldn't drive hundreds of miles just because he learns that Ennis got divorced. He is even willing to leave his family to be with Ennis.Calling this a ""gay cowboy movie"" does it a great injustice. I don't think Ang Lee could have done a better job. It deserved to win the Oscar not because it's ""politically correct"" or it tackles a controversial subject, but because it's brilliantly written, directed, and most of all acted. If you haven't seen the movie yet and maybe are hesitating because you think it will make you uncomfortable, see it and you won't regret it. And if you're like me and had thought of Heath Ledger as a pretty-boy actor who did costume movies, you're in for a rude awakening. This film is one of the best I've ever seen, and I can't wait to read the story",0,1,0,books

"From a skilled architectual photographer one might be surprised to find the legal brothel as the subject of this elegant collection. First, the movies have created quite a different image of brothels. As opposed to the pleasure palaces of Victorian Chicago or the upstairs at the saloon, the real brothels of today's Nevada are mostly double wide house trailers singly or in groups (since in the beginning they had to be mobile because of changing zoning ordinances). The excellent large format images shown are not girly pictures and in fact there almost no human figures to be seen. Rather they are a demonstration of a part of America seldom seen and even less understood..The economics of brothels is not well studied. Naturally owners are intent on the greatest possible profits from the least investment. Since the women work on a piece work basis (no pun) it is difficult to increase the throughput of the operation. To construct a spledid brothel is almost a conflict in terms. Instead, brothels are constructed as a compromise in tastes. What is the minimum place attractive to clients who by definition are unsophisticated but that will not affect business? The women in turn concoct their living-working rooms intended to demonstrate their own taste or lack of it. For all the housewives with their fanatasies of escaping their bloated husband and being paid for those services thy have contributed in the past, the alternative of those clusters of double wides may be sometimes attractive.Hursley has captured a lonely and wistful collection of images that are classic Americana. I urge you to read the companion book, ""Brothel"" by Alexa Albert to form your own conclusions",0,1,0,books

More to the point, I work entirely with other RF engineers and every person I showed this book to shuddered and began spouting off profanities at it. Although the book does start out simply enough, the chapters tend to give only a brief overview of the material. The real trouble starts when you try to work the problems at the end of each chapter.

"I had spent the past several years informally studying Stirling engines, and this book vastly improved my understanding of the workings of this kind of engine in the course of a week. Stirling engines are known for their great efficiency, but the one historic difficulty preventing the widespread deployment of these engines is power density. (Stirling engines tend to be far larger than other less efficient engines of the same power output, so much so as to have been impractical for many applications. . . until now) The challenges to the development of a power dense Stirling engine are examined one at a time, and explained in both common terms, as well as formulas and equations, though admittedly, some of the text was rather hard to understand without a great deal of effort. This is understandable; this book is, after all, aimed at engineers.The book comes in two parts: chapters 1-4 are by Theodor Finkelstein, and cover a pretty detailed history of air engines, including the Ericsson engine, and the Stirling engine and its variants, from their invention and early history through the beginnings of what Allan Organ calls the ""dark ages"", a period of about 50 years when virtually no work was done on this kind of engine. Allan Organ authors the book from chapters 5 through the end, and covers the rebirth of the Stirling engine in the 1930's through the present. His approach is a lot more technical, and relies much more on equations and other technical explanations.If you are a casual hobbyist, or simply investigating Stirling engines without a background in mechanical engineering, I still recommend this book. Do not let the equations intimidate you; get as much out of the rest of the book as you can. This book offers the collected understanding of many years of research into the cause and effect behind the operations of this class of engines, and if you are willing to work to understand it, you will find this book to be very helpful to your research",0,1,0,books

"I got this book when I started having problems with my 4-yr old. He's pretty compliant most of the time, but recently started testing my limits. I was perfectly aware that the problem was with my techniques, not with my child. I just knew that I wasn't getting my message across to him, but didn't know what to do.  Reading this book I learned that I was on the right track, but having problems with determining good consequences and following through with them consistently.  This book gives very detailed examples of mis-behavior and many ideas for consequences.  It also has several ""what if"" scenarios for those times that the discipline process does not work as expected (which happens to me a lot).

"The blackout story continues in the second book in the Restoration series. The town is beginning to adapt to an lifestyle without electricity. It is like living in the middle ages again, with the people having to discover new ways to survive. The Banning family has managed to create a semi-comfortable life in this new world. They have food, will soon have water, shelter, and most importantly each other. However not everyone has it this lucky, as the reader is introduced to a group of siblings trying to fend for themselves without their mother. The two groups clash with a battle about what it takes to truly survive in this new world.Reading about the filth that the children had to live in made me really uncomfortable at times. It's really amazing how we take just a working toilet for granted. This book pretty much explains survival of the fittest. Only the people who lived in communities where there was some sense of order was able to live a semi-normal life while others were forced in extreme poverty and disarray. At times I sided with the children because they were just trying to survive, but then I'd side with the Bannings because they had worked hard for their food and didn't deserve for it to get stolen. It was really scary reading about how people will take advantage of others in desperate times, even children just to get food or other supplies. Aaron, even though sometimes his actions were wrong, had the right intentions for his siblings, putting his family first before everything. I felt that was such a parallel to Deni in the first book, she put everything but her family as her primary focus. The only thing I found irksome is that everyone forgives each other really quickly even for doing terrible things to them. I just felt it a little unreal in such a time like that. Other than that, this was another thrilling read, another deep thinker of a book. Looking forward to when the next book comes out",0,1,0,books
"There's a lot to like about this book.  It's a quick read with a strong message you can't miss.  By learning about the 3 levels of forgiveness and the steps to achieving them you'll be able to get rid of your grievance story (which the author claims everyone has) that is holding you back most in life.  There are even some health benefits like lowering blood pressure and stress levels.  The thing I liked about it was the author didn't just say, ""Hey, you need to forgive people"" - True, I learned that as a kid.  But he gives the specific steps he used to teach the group that went through his clinical study how to forgive.  The author gives 10 Principles of Forgiveness.  Here are the first five:1. Accept that life is not fair and that others may play by a different set of rules than you do. 2. Stop blaming others for your circumstances.3. Understand that you cannot change the person who hurt you; you can only change yourself. 4. Acknowledge the anger and hurt that some unpleasant or even harmful even is causing you.5. Reframe your story of hurt--your ""grievance story""--by placing the hurtful events in a broader context than your current point of view.There are five more principles, but you get the idea.  The new clinical research the author did for the book seems to have paid off.  The steps he suggests can be a painful (you have to review things that make you angry), but the results are powerful.  Overall, it's probably one of the most useful books on forgiveness around.  Other good reads on the topic are Lewis Smedes book called ""Forgive & Forget"" and Redford Williams book called ""Anger Kills"".  But the clinical study behind this book makes it stand out.Finally, if you're thinking of buying this book you might like to know that the author gives some exercises / activities at the end of each chapter.  Some are better than others.  I liked the Anger Test from chapter 3 and the Grievance Story Toxicity assessment from chapter 5.  The author even gives an amusing parable about forgiveness at the beginning of the book called ""Drop the Rock"".One more thing, there's a discussion guide in the back of the book.  For each chapter there are 8-10 questions that could be used to get people talking about the things covered in the chapter.  Probably a useful tool if you run a support group or some other kind of small group.",0,1,0,books

Please keep in mind that this may not be the book for you if you are mainly interested in looking at nude pictures of women who look like playmates, models, and cover girls.

"This book tells the story of the greatest biographical masterpiece in the English language. In the course of it we learn to appreciate the skill, dedication, persistence  and great art of Boswell. This is Sisman's description of Boswell as he wrote the life  : ""The story of Boswell's life as he wrote the epic Life of Johnson is itself an epic: in the process Boswell experienced an extraordinary degree of exhilaration and depression, pride, humiliation, confidence, doubt, satisfaction, hurt, loneliness, disillusionment and grief."" A man of great ambition, Boswell had little to show for his efforts at the time of Johnson's death. Writing the biography ""was his last hope of achieving anything worthwhile.""But Boswell through his great diligence, his careful noting down of the words of his great friend, his artful reshaping of much of what he heard, his willingness to tell not simply of virtues but of faults, his ability to present the whole man, succeeded in giving the world the picture of the Great Cham which attracts and moves us to this day. Gruff, easily made irritable, but capable of incredible kindness, always fierce and fast in his remarks, tremendously knowledgeable, a loyal friend, the master maker of the Dictionary, Johnson is presented by Boswell as a fully rounded character. Sisman gives the background to the lives of these two giants of English Literature. He focuses on Boswell's preparation for the work and his ongoing method of execution. He reveals in details the way one great masterpiece of world- literature was made by someone often derided by those of his own time.",0,1,0,books
"Plot?  Not ""what plot?"" although the plot sometimes seems a bit beside the point in an Alexander McCall Smith novel.  In this latest of the Sunday Philosophy Club novels, Isabel Dalhousie is struggling with her feelings for her younger friend Jamie and the ethical questions this relationship raises.  She finds herself wondering about the relationship between two relative strangers, wealthy American Tom Bruce and his younger, possibly gold-digging, fiancee Angie.  We find ourselves welcomed to the fascinating mind of Isabel as she works through romantic and practical dilemmas.  I didn't like the first book in this series as much as I like all of the books in the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency series.  However, I've liked each subsequent entry better, and this one is the best yet.  If I have a cavil with this novel, it's that Isabel's thoughts about her romantic interest--and her somewhat irresponsible actions--don't quite ring true for such a mature and worldly woman.  As I have the same reservations about M.C. Beaton's heroine Agatha Raisin, and Beaton is a woman, I won't attribute my feelings about this to Smith's being a man writing from a woman's point-of-view.  Perhaps I'm just a hard-headed (-hearted?) realist, and other readers will believe that love can turn any woman into a misty-eyed romantic.Regardless of that doubt, I still highly recommend this book.  As with all Smith's books, it's all about the journey.",0,1,0,books
"Charles Haddon Spurgeon was born in 1834 and was converted at the age of  16.  By the age of 17, he was already adept enough in the Word of God that  he was called to shepherd one of the  local churches.  During his lifetime,  he published over 1900 different sermons.  Each was original and  thought-provoking.  Those who have read his sermons know that each message  was filled with the Word of God and sought to bring honor and glory to  Christ alone. The teaching done by Spurgeon in these 28 lectures is a skill  that has almost completely vanished from among pastor-teachers today.  This  443 page book reflects just one reason why he was called, &quot;The Prince  Of Preachers&quot; and &quot;A Master Pulpiteer.&quot; Spurgeon's teachings  and messages will go on in Christendom as being revelant to any age in any  decade.  The ministerial student will do well to study these lectures and  seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit in applying them to their ministry.   The experienced minister should also take the time out of often hectic  schedules to study what made this &quot;Prince of Preachers&quot; a prince  among preachers. No minister should ever be able to find fault with this  classic.

The courtly aristocratic Go master playing against the much younger more modern challenger lets us see in microcosm the change in Japan from the pre-war aristocracy to a more egalitarian society. Kawabata is careful to show good and bad sides of both these individual Go players. Much is lost and a little is gained in this transistion for Japan. That is the impression Kawabata gives in this narrative of a late 1930s Go championship game. This novel is mostly non fiction and is told in a light aesthetic style. In reading this I am reminded a little of the 1972 Fischer vs Spassky Chess match in Iceland. I was a teenage novice chess enthusiast at the time and the reports of the many disagreements kept me glued to the nightly news. The disagreements in this Go match of course were nothing to compare to that famous Chess match. The author was covering this Go match for a newspaper and he was on the scene as an eye-witness, because of this the narrative carries a sense of reality not often found in fiction. Quite simply a mesmerizing read",0,1,0,books

This classic hymn has been illustrated by Mary Morgan in a way that really brings the meaning of the words to life.

"      This is my first ""taste"" of one of the Stern's books, and the read was a fast, wry, humorous journey into the back roads of America and its roadside eateries. The Sterns venture deep into rural areas where probably many Northeasterners  have not dared to tread, and they do it with grace, aplomb, wit and a sincere and mutual appreciation for kitsch of all kinds (including unusual Americana only available in prison gift shops), and for genuine down-home, regional, American fare. I fully appreciated being the recipient of the Stern's tried and true methods for scouting out outstanding food. If I am ever on the road, off the beaten path, I will certainly take the Stern's advice. If I happen to spot  a giant pig or cow (which signifies the specialty of the house) on the roof  of the eatery, and if said pig or cow is dressed in a tuxedo and carries a walking stick, I will pull over immediately, because there is an excellent chance that there are untold gastronomic treasures hidden within, just waiting to be consumed and never forgotten. The book provides a glimpse into rural America and a way of life that is foreign to many, including myself. It is a glimpse into towns with less than a population of 500, towns whose inhabitants are so isolated from one another that farmers' wives depend on the ""radio homemaker"" for helpful hints and to satisfy their need for some kind of daily human contact and connection, towns whose inhabitants look forward all year to the state fair where they can show off their preserves, pies and livestock, with roomy overalls being the preferred mode of dress to allow for expansion which will result from the requisite sampling of the delicious, carb-overloaded foods typically featured at these events,  towns with cafes where personalized mugs are hung, waiting for their owners to fill them for their daily cup of Joe, and where everyone really does know your name and the number of dairy cows you have. I find it refreshing that the Sterns have turned dining-out snobbism on its face, and they have elevated the status of American roadside dining. Yes, the Sterns have dined at Lutece and Four Seasons, but they would much prefer to dine at a rib joint in Tennessee, marveling and fully appreciating the wonder of a menu with barbeque sauce hardened and aged in the corners. Although I would never eat the fat and cholesterol-laden food they adore, where everything seems to be fried and smothered in gravy or sugar, I thoroughly enjoyed traveling down America's back roads with the Sterns",0,1,0,books

"""They Poured Fire On Us from the Sky""  is a deeply moving account of the many years of wandering endured by three of the lost boys from the Sudan.  It is an inside look at war from a child's point of view; a quick read, yet a difficult one, because of the severe hardships these young children experienced over such a long period of time. Our book club was touched both by the simplicity and intimacy derived from the first person accounts and by the strong values conveyed--lessons on resilience, family, loyalty, and determination.This is an excellent choice for a book club, and also for older students (high school level). There is much to discuss. Educators especially will find the book a good read, since even as they are nearly starving to death and wrought with disease, these young boys placed a top priority on becoming educated",0,1,0,books

It is an excellent story, well told, with all the realities of a different culture in a different situation than USA children.  However, it is painted with the strokes of deepest, realistic love that a family can have.  This is a great story to teach and talk about the struggles of families everywhere, the world and it's differences, and the importance of character ""no matter what"".  It is the book my second graders yearn to read on their own and therefore is a super motivator.  It is rich in geography",0,1,0,books
"Having built over 20 rooms in our audio post production business over the last 25 years. I have bought every studio construction book from Jeff Cooper, Alton Everest, Philip Newell, Peter Grueneisen and others. This is a great addition to my library. Rod Gervais compliments the other books by bringing the topic up to date for the year 2006. While some of the construction tips are a bit expensive for a small (no) budget bedroom studio, he does show you how to build an nice mid level studio. Gervais, covers a lot of area from room isolation, air conditioning systems, even shows detailed step by step procedures for building a hypothetical basement studio. He also lists several suppliers like Auralex and Real Traps who offer many newer cost effective solutions for home studios, many of these suppliers were not around when some of the ealier acoustics books were written. He also links to his website and provides XLS files for calculating diffusor well sequences and other acoutic calculations.Again no one book covers all things, still that is why I feel it important that you should read everyting you can on the subject.  I also wish he'd go more in depth in how he built the new Power Station room (he could write another book on it). Still in IMHO a nice addition to any amateur studio builder's library",0,1,0,books

"During the Summer of 1966 an electronics genius accidently stumbled into the intelligence business and virtually over night became a legend within the halls of the FBI, CIA, and intelligence agencies all over the globe. This book is the memoirs of Martin L. Kaiser, known also simply as ""Marty"". His little black boxes has brought down entire governments or administrations, and even almost 40 years in the business his products are as revered and sought after as Holy Relics. For the first time ever an insider who supplied classifed bugs for decades comes in from the cold, and exposes the soft underbelly of corruption within the CIA, NSA, and FBI. Hollywood has even produced two movies about this quiet genius without actually mentioning him by name. But now the governments secrets are out of the bag, and this book lays them bare. The book is filed from cover to cover with explicit details of how the intelligence agencies operate, how they buy their toys, how their little games are played, and what happens to people to expose corruption.The author also discusses his consulting work for everal movies including ""The Conversation"" and ""Enemy of the State"", both of which are based on his life.

The viewer is soon swept into their world, a  world where you are challenged in 112 minutes to listen for the crickets,  smell the oppressive heat, taste their mom's cooking, and revel with them  as they grow up sensing for the first time changes in themselves and their  surroundings.  Mieko Harada the actress who plays the twin's mother won the  equivilent of an Academy Award for this portrayal.  Many of us remember her  as the villianess in Akira Kurosawa's RAN, what a different part this time.   This film is highly recommended as an escape to another time, our lost  childhood.

"The two films in this set are definitely worth watching. The hilarious antics of Roland Young, Billie Burke and their supporting casts make these a must-have for Film Noir buffs and car fans alike!In Topper, Roland Young plays quiet bank president, Cosmo Topper, who alongside his wife, Clara (Burke), lead their quiet, highly scheduled life. On the other side of NYC, George and Marian Kerby (Cary Grant and Constance Bennet) live it up, every hour on the hour or until the manager kicks them out.After a boring board meeting, George puts his foot down once too often and send himself and Marian off the road and into Limbo. In a quest for the important Good Deed that they lack, they decide to help their friend Topper out of his rut, turning his life, and marriage, on its ear!While Young steals every scene from Grant, the uniqueness of this movie wouldn't be possible without the one uncredited star of the film, the Painted Jezebel, the Kerby's 1936 Buick Roadmaster roadster. This one-of-a-kind Bohman & Schwartz creation is the focal point for much of the film's important scenes: the wreck, Topper's rebellion against his wife and his discovery of the Kerbys, and the scene at the end. The car was one of the best examples of mid-'30s coachbuilding, and reflects the flash, style and vibrant youthfullness of the Kerbys perfectly.While the Buick gives way to a Mercedes in Topper Returns, the cast makes up for it in a slightly non-canon sequel to the first film. This time, Cosmo gets a visit from another lady ghost, who earlier got him in hot water with Mrs. Topper (again!). Her insistant request to find out who killed her leads him to the suitably frightening Carrington house just down the road. Along with his chauffeur, Eddie (played by Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson of Jack Benny fame), they explore the grounds to find out whodunit. Later, Mrs. Topper and the maid, Emily, end up looking for Cosmo in the midst of the murder investigation.While Mrs. Topper is unusually ditzy in this film, it adds to the nuttiness of the story greatly. Anderson lends his sharp wit and inimitable style to the cast, providing much of the comedy scenes, which compete with Joan Blondell and Billie Burke's characters. While vastly different in feel to the original, it's a good film nonetheless, with an exciting and amusing chase scene at the end, where Blondell's ghost ""drives"" Topper's Benz in pursuit of the villain",0,0,0,dvd

"Well, let me first start by saying, if you're a Viking and you're coming to see this movie, stay on your long-ship and wait till you get to Newfoundland. Maybe Chronicles of Narnia will be out by then.I had high hopes for this, do to the cover, but let me inform you that these are not the heroes we witnessed in the 13th Warrior. They're more like the casting leftovers from the 200th warrior on back. With their accents and constant use of the names Thorston, Swen, Eric, etc....they come across as the cast of BH 90210 at a Renaissance faire. I guess that's to remind me, that they are Vikings.The plot of the movie is the same as Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"", except that it's Norsemen and not a cute little animated European town.The lead female character: Freya (Bell) doesn't want to marry the leading young male warrior, who is going on a Viking land grab mission with the king. All though her hand maiden (Ingrid), fits the bill for a Viking female or a lead singer in ABBA, the lead girl would be better served playing a role in a Viking/redneck sacking of a trailer park.The armor worn by the warriors (see Pauldrons), appears to be a cross between something out of Warhammer 40k and the Oakland Raiders. Their greaves are authentic leg warmers with attached steel plates.The weapons, swords specifically, appear to be genuine.....if the Vikings sacked monasteries and sea side villages with wooden practice swords painted in a metallic tint! The swords had a visible cutting edge of ¼ to ½ inch thick. Maybe these Vikings rode in the ""small"" long-ships....?Freya wears more mail than any other member of the cast, and during the close up of her encounter with the Viking/turned beast, you can see that it's plastic and doesn't conform to contours as real mail would due to its' weight.The beast appeared to be the evil twin from Army of Darkness dressed up like the leader of the Wendo chieftain in the 13th warrior.Don't get me wrong, this film did have a good quality, it helped my 22m old daughter fall asleep before the end of it. That doesn't happen often...must have been the fairy tale concept of the flick.So if you're sitting around one night, and have nothing to do, get Disney's version of Beauty and the Beast.

"I can't believe I never reviewed The Silence of the Lambs yet, simply because it is in my top 10 favorite movies ever made. Despite my father's best efforts to keep me from seeing it when it released, I still got my chance and I still love this movie like no other in my collection. I've always been fascinated with serial killers and this movie fueled my fascination even further. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I can only assume you've either been living in a cave this whole time, or you were too young to watch it when it came out. Either way, if you're one of the few people on this planet who has not yet watched it, go now. With so many reviews covering the plot, I won't go there, but if you like thrillers and serial killers and you've never seen this, you won't regret it. It's one you should own, not rent.

"""The Gathering Storm"" was a good bit better than what I expected.  I thought Robert Hardy's portrayal of Churchill in ""The Wilderness Years,"" some 20 years ago, could not be topped.  Albert Finney has proved me wrong as his is as good if not better.  Of course, the storyline is frustratingly similar.  The premise is that over 90% of the British public are opposed to war with Germany in the 1930's.  Many actually sympathize with the Germans for what was seen as unfair terms of the Versailles Treaty.  British political leaders pander to the mood of pacifism with one exception:  Winston Churchill.  Churchill stands alone in his concerns for the Nazi war machine as it is built up in the mid-30's.  British pacifists adopt a program of appeasing Hitler and his Nazi gangs with the inevitable result. Weakness invites agression as we've seen in our own time and soon the British face what they wanted to avoid most: World War II.The story begs for a sequel and we hear one is now being formulated, to include Albert Finney as Churchill.  Let's hope the other main stars are brought back, as well. Kudos to HBO for actually making movies for thinking adults.  Shows like this are few and far between.

"When they told me that someone named Tim Sullivan wanted to remake Herschell Gordon Lewis's classic 1964 gross out ""Two Thousand Maniacs,"" I knew I needed to sit up and pay attention. Who is this Sullivan guy? And why does he think he has the stones to remake a classic H.G. Lewis pukefest? It takes a lot of gall to mess around with a Lewis flick. He is, after all, the Godfather of Gore, the guy that made all the blood and guts flicks we see today possible. You wouldn't have a ""Hostel"" without ""Blood Feast"" and ""The Wizard of Gore"". It was Lewis that made it possible to put eye gouging, arm tearing, and tongue ripping--to cite just a few examples--up on the silver screen for all to see. The effects rarely looked convincing, not on the zero budgets Lewis worked with, but the results had an impact on audiences. People loved the shock value, Lewis made money, and other filmmakers started using blood and guts. Unfortunately, as the years passed, Herschell Gordon Lewis quit making movies and drifted into obscurity. Then DVD arrived and introduced his work to a new audience. And then came the inevitable remake...""2001 Maniacs"" starts by introducing us to a group of foul mouthed, obnoxious jerks known to horror aficionados as ""cannon fodder"". Yep, that's right. We don't have to care that much about these trashy young kids because we know that they exist solely to die painful, cruel, and bloody deaths. Spring Break bound students Anderson (Jay Gillespie), Cory (Matthew Carey), Nelson (Dylan Edrington) meet up with Ricky (Brian Gross), Joey (Marla Malcolm), Kat (Gina Marie Heekin), Malcolm (Mushond Lee), and his girlfriend Leah (Bianca Smith) when they get lost in the middle of Georgia. Yeah, they're going to Florida for fun and sun, but they ain't going to get there after receiving questionable directions from a hick gas station attendant (played by Travis Tritt). Instead, our heroes wind up in the little town of Pleasant Valley, and just in time to attend the Guts and Glory Jubilee. Oh yeah! The folks living in this town seem friendly, if not a little odd around the edges, but our Yankee visitors are dumber than a box of rocks and don't seem to sense the danger. Too bad for them. You see, Pleasant Valley has a grim little secret, a bloody and gory secret.If you've seen Lewis's original film, you already know the secret of Pleasant Valley. It involves the Civil War and plenty of revenge against the hated Yankee invaders. And since our youngsters come from up North, they're going to experience Pleasant Valley's kindness up close and personal. Mayor Buckman (Robert Englund), his son Lester (Adam Robitel), Granny Boone (Lin Shaye), the adorable Peaches (Wendy Kremer), Harper Alexander (Giuseppe Andrews), and the other townsfolk are not about to let our guests leave town without a heaping dose of that famous Southern hospitality. A few examples are free room and board, lots of booze, and plenty of lovin' for both the boys and the girls. Other acts of kindness include drawing and quartering by horses, acid hidden in a moonshine jug, musical numbers, cannibalism, castration, crushing, kissing cousins, skewering, stabbing, and general all-around maiming of the human form. These Pleasant Valley folks sure know how to welcome visitors! At least when the bloodshed finally abates after the horrific conclusion to the Guts and Glory Jubilee, two of the kids escape to tell the world about the horrors they have witnessed. Or do they? One thing's for certain--there's a sequel coming soon to a grindhouse near you!It's refreshing to see a remake of a classic horror film that really works. H.G. Lewis should really enjoy Sullivan's ""2001 Maniacs"". It's got everything the original had while adding new charms to the story. It's campy as all get out, it's got gore oozing out of every pore, and it's got black humor to spare. Even Lewis's music from the original makes an appearance here, as does the idea of a roving band of minstrels telling us what's happening through song. Sullivan goes above and beyond Lewis's original script, however, when he injects his version of Pleasant Valley with lots of politically incorrect killings and humor. Nothing is sacred in ""2001 Maniacs"" as the movie skewers everything from bestiality to race relations without pulling punches. About the only thing missing from the original film is the barrel with nails gag. You won't miss it too much, however, as plenty of other interesting stuff keeps you occupied. For example, casting Robert Englund and Lin Shaye as the two main baddies in Pleasant Valley was a stroke of genius. They camp it up with wild abandon. Then there's Christa Campbell as the Milk Maiden. Even Eli Roth shows up in a cameo instantly familiar to anyone who has watched ""Cabin Fever"".The DVD version of ""2001 Maniacs,"" brought to us by the folks over at Lionsgate, is excellent. We get the uncut version of the film in pristine glory, an audition reel, an alternate opening with John Landis, a few deleted/extended scenes, a handful of trailers, an amusing making of featurette covering most aspects of the production, and a couple of audio commentaries. One of these commentaries features Robert Englund in all of his hilarious glory, so definitely give that one a listen. Yes sir, you can't go wrong picking up a copy of ""2001 Maniacs"" today. It's rude, it's crude, and it's an instant classic. I'm so happy Tim Sullivan made such a magnificent tribute to the great H.G. Lewis. I'm also hoping the sequel lives up to this film. And remember: The South Will Rise Again!",0,0,0,dvd

"I am glad &quot;Ms. 45&quot; is back on the shelf, because for a long time it was hard to find, certainly up here in Canada. This film is superior to &quot;Driller Killer&quot; in every way except for the lead track. Nothing touches the live performance of Tony Coca Cola and the Roosters playing The Grand Street Stomp. It is quite obvious in &quot;Ms. 45&quot; that that is not the sound of a trumpet. Anyway, for those who don't dig this, you can't tell me you can diss it. This, his second film, is night and day between &quot;Driller Killer&quot;. What an obvious improvement. I was hoping that the DVD wouldn't be Vanilla and have at least a directors commentary. &quot;Driller Killer's&quot; commentray is legendary. And while you could chalk this up as being the female version of &quot;Death Wish&quot; there are some elements here that make it a true horror flick. For all those who liked &quot;Eating Raoul&quot;, this is a must see. Suspension of disbelief is an obvious exercise here, but you won't be disappointed with it if this is your thing.

"Based on the Alan Hollinghurst novel, the BBC television series ""The Line Of Beauty"" unfolds through the eyes of Nick Guest (Dan Stevens). Nick, a middle class student studying Henry James at Oxford, is invited by his friend Toby Fedden (Oliver Coleman) to stay at his family's posh home in London's Notting Hill. Nick is swept away by the Feddens' prestige and affluence, and as he becomes enamored with the family, he's seduced by money, power, and sex into the moral void that surrounds the Feddens. Ultimately this is a tale of the 80--Thatcher's Britain, the corruption of the wealthy set, racism, homophobia, classism, and the sceptre of AIDS.Gradually Nick is absorbed into the Fedden home and becomes a permanent fixture. Although the Feddens on the surface appear to be a glamourous family, their elegant lifestyle, antique stuffed home, and perfect manners shield a great deal of ugliness. While Nick is ostensibly treated as 'one of the family,' there's always an implication that he has a social role to play. As a personable, unattached gay male, he makes up the difference at dinner parties by escorting single women, and he's also expected to be a caretaker of hostile lithium-plied daughter, Cat (Hayley Atwell). Gerald Fedden (Tim McInnerny) is a prominent Tory M.P. who's slated for a glittering career in the party. Pompous, hard, and ambitious, he hides these traits with a blustery joviality and a true talent to diffuse even the most explosive situation. Mrs. Fedden, Rachel (Alice Krige) is the perfect politician's wife--elegant, poised, but also content to stay in the background, and if there's anything ugly in her life, she copes by ignoring it.While everyone knows Nick is gay, it's a subject that's largely ignored and never discussed. Nick has a relationship with a lower class, bicycle riding black man, Leo (Don Gilet), and also with Wani Ouradi (Alex Wyndam), the Lebanese heir to a gigantic fortune. Wani, like most of the gay men in the Fedden's filthy rich set, is firmly in the closet, and he accepts the fact that he leads a risky double life. With Wani's money and influence, Nick establishes a glossy magazine and even toys with a film script for ""The Spoils of Poynton.""Nick is an amazingly hollow character, and it's no accident that he's a Henry James scholar. Nick, as the outside observer of the wealthy set, is the perfect Jamesian character. As a hanger on of the smug, self-satisfied filthy rich, he's half in love with the power and affluence of the upper crust, and he's also an observer of their troubling, tainted and poisoned morality. One of James's themes is that love is often in competition with power and aesthetic beauty. In ""The Line of Beauty"" power is the overriding element in all relationships, and this is something Nick--a class outsider--fails to realize until the very end. Directed by Saul Dibb, with a spectacular cast, stellar acting, and marvelous sets, ""The Line of Beauty"" exceeded my expectations. While on one level, it explores Nick's moral dilemma as he navigates life with the decadent, rich and powerful set, on another level, the plot is heavily influenced by the master, Henry James. It was delightful for this James fan to drink in the themes and the moral dilemma of Nick--a man who basically knows he should make a moral stand but subsumes his morality to the affluence and power of those who use him--and in some cases--even despise him--displacedhuma",0,0,0,dvd
"Tonight I watched Romeo and Juliet again, this time with two of my granddaughters.  I have seen it with my parents, with my wife and three children, and now with my grandchildren. I attended the movie in Washington, in Boston, and in Albany, NY many years ago.  This version has become part of my life, as have its stars, Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn.  Why I have not reviewed it before, I do not know.This Royal Ballet version of Romeo and Juliet is so fine, so spectacular, so moving, and so incrediblly beautiful that in my opinion there is no other ballet that can compare with it.  First there is the poignantly tragic love story of Shakespeare. Add to it the hauntingly expressive, classic-yet-modern music of Prokofiev.  Stir in Kenneth MacMillan's sensitive and exuberant choreography.  And as the supreme touch, have it danced by the most exhilarating male dancer who every performed, in partnership with the most delicate and vulnerable ballernina of the past century.  Here you have the masterpiece of all masterpieces.  A ballet that puts other ballets to shame with their weak plots and lack of emotional substance.  My two favorite scenes are the balcony scene, and the scene where Romeo dances with a lifeless Juliet.  The first exudes love and passion, as Nureyev and Fonteyn are transported by their new-found love to a height beyond all measure.  In the second, your heart freezes and you strain to hold back tears as Romeo tries to coax the life back into Juliet by dancing with her limp but still graceful form. There are no touchingly valid moments such as these in any other ballet I have seen.The superb costumes are worthy of a Zefferelli production, although this is not one, of course.  The scenery is adequate but not impressive.  But most important, all the dancers communicate a vitality that is convincing and contagious.  The swordplay is amazing in its complexity and realism. Tybolt's death and his wife's grief are overdone with just the right touch of modernity.  But mainly, Nureyev and Fonteyn bring each scene they dance into brilliant flower.  And when they dance together something of the mystery and tragedy of their two very different lives comes to the surface and animates their performance, giving it a realism that communicates their deep emotion for each other.This is heartfelt and heart-wrenching art. When it finishes, one is exhausted and drained, but also inspired and delighted that this one-of-a-kind performance was recorded so that one may enjoy it over and over again. ",0,0,0,dvd

"""Winnie the Pooh ABC's"" is an original Winnie the Pooh story designed to teach rhyming, words and letters. Rather than straight, rote learning, this is presented in the form of a half-hour adventure. Things all get started when Christopher Robin introduces Pooh to a book of rhymes about the characters in the Hundred Acre Woods. Christopher Robin lets Pooh borrow the book and soon Pooh and all of his friends are learning about rhymes, words, reading and the alphabet, with some help from wise old Owl.One of the major complaints about this movie seems to be that it only introduces a few letters. If this is a concern for you or your child, then I recommend making sure you get the DVD version and not the video. It has a wonderful special feature that goes through the alphabet thoroughly, having the characters teach each letter in both upper and lower-case and associated words. Adults will probably get bored with this pretty quickly, but it'll be dead useful for your kid(s). There's also an ABC song with scenes from ""The New Adventures of Winnie the Pooh"" that's quite worthwhile.Overall, if you want your kids to learn the alphabet, or just wanna see another good Pooh story, I'd say you can't go wrong with this, especially if you get the DVD version. Also included on the DVD version is a Fast-Play option and previews for movies such as ""Mulan II"" and ""Pooh's Heffalump Movie,"" as well as the original trailer both this and the 123s video / DVD.Was there anything else I wanted to say?

"They were one of Hollywood's all-time legendary couples, both on screen and off; producing celluloid magic in the four films they made together between 1943 and 1948 as much as by their off-screen romance, which in itself was the stuff that dreams are made of. He was the American Film Insititute's No. 1 star of the 20th century, Hollywood's original noir anti-hero, who in addition to the AFI honors bestowed on his real-life persona also played two of the 20th century's Top 50 film heroes (""Casablanca""'Rick Blaine and this movie's Philip Marlow); epitome of the handsome, cynical and oh-so lonesome wolf, looking unbeatably cool in dinner jacket, trenchcoat and fedora alike, a glass of whiskey in his hand and cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth; and endowed with a legendary aura several times larger than his physical stature. She, despite a 25-year age difference his equal in everything from grit and toughness to mysterious appeal; chillier than bourbon on the rocks, possessing more than just a touch of class whatever her role; and long since a bona fide AFI movie legend in her own right.Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall met on the set of Howard Hawks's 1944 realization of Ernest Hemingway's ""To Have and Have Not,"" where an obvious chemistry quickly developed between 45-year-old veteran Bogart, who had just scored two of film history's greatest-ever hits with ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""Casablanca"" in the two preceding years, and the sassy, exciting 20-year-old newcomer who possessed the maturity and sex-appeal of a woman good and well 10 years her senior. They were reunited two years later for this adaptation of Raymond Chandler's first Philip Marlowe novel ""The Big Sleep"" (1939), based on a screenplay written, like that of ""To Have and Have Not,"" by William Faulkner and Jules Furthman, together with Leigh Brackett (who had not participated in scripting the Hemingway adaptation). By the time the movie was released in 1946, Bogart and Bacall were married.Reprising Bogart's noir gumshoe role with a character not unlike Dashiell Hammett's Sam Spade in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" the movie ""The Big Sleep"" is as infamous as Chandler's literary original for its labyrinthine plot, which reportedly even the author himself couldn't completely untangle (nor did he care to). The plot is essentially faithful to Chandler's novel, from which it takes much of its dialogue; albeit streamlined and with some changes made to fit Bogart's physical characteristics, and eliminating or softening a few scenes considered unfit for display to a moviegoing audience in the 1940s. The story begins when Marlowe is hired by wealthy old General Sternwood to handle a blackmailing attempt involving gambling debts incurred by Sternwood's younger daughter Carmen (Martha Vickers) (whom the detective has already met when she literally threw herself into his arms upon his entry into the house, sucking her thumb and coyly telling him ""you're cute""). After his interview with the dying general in the latter's hot and humid orchid house, a disheveled Marlowe is summoned to the rooms of the general's older daughter Vivian (Lauren Bacall), who tries to worm out of him the purpose of his engagement and who, as Marlowe quickly concludes, has more than a minor hidden agenda of her own. Soon the detective is up to his ears in the classical film noir brew of murder, damsels in distress, shady characters and a world where nothing is what it appears to be, and where he'll be able to consider himself lucky if he gets out alive -- yet, he is determined to see the case through and will neither be bought off by money nor by sweetness and seduction.Looking back at the movie and its stars' almost mythical fame, it is difficult to imagine that, produced at the height of the studio system era, it was originally just one of the roughly 50 movies released by Warner Brothers over the course of one year. But mass production didn't equal low quality; on the contrary, the great care given to all production values, from script-writing to camera work, editing, score (Max Steiner) and the stars' presentation in the movie itself and in its trailer was at least partly responsible for its lasting success. Indeed, the release of ""The Big Sleep"" was delayed for an entire year - and not only because its first version was completed around the end of WWII and Warner Brothers wanted to get their still-unreleased war movies into theaters first, but also, and significantly, because Lauren Bacall's agent convinced studio boss Jack Warner and director Howard Hawks to reshoot several scenes to better highlight the sassy, mysterious new star Bacall had become after ""To Have and Have Not."" And it certainly paid off: ""The Big Sleep"" firmly established then-22-year-old Lauren Bacall as one of Hollywood's new leading ladies, and even more than her first film with Humphrey Bogart laid the foundation for the couple's mythical relationship.Bogart and Bacall would star together two more times after ""The Big Sleep"": In ""Dark Passage"" (1947) and ""Key Largo"" (1948). But of their four collaborations, the first two -- and in particular, ""The Big Sleep"" -- remain unparalleled for their secretive, shadowy aura, tight scripting, snappy dialogue, cynicism and underlying seductiveness; due in equal parts to the story crafted by Raymond Chandler, its adaptation by Faulkner, Furthman and Brackett, Howard Hawks's masterful direction and its starring couple's irresistible chemistry. After three failed marriages, after having produced on-screen magic with Mary Astor in ""The Maltese Falcon"" and, even more so, with Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca"" (and although he would go on to star in such memorable pairings as next to Katherine Hepburn in ""The African Queen"" and Audrey Hepburn in ""Sabrina""), Humphrey Bogart had finally met his match -- and while his and Bacall's marriage was painfully cut short by the cancer to which he succumbed in 1957, the magnetism they created on screen will live on, and nowhere more brilliantly than in ""The Big Sleep.",0,0,0,dvd

"""a descent into oneself, a way of using the mechanism of the dream without sleeping, a crooked candle, often mysteriously blown out, carried about in the night of the human body."" ~ Jean CocteauBlood of a Poet is surprisingly captivating and encourages the viewer to remain completely attentive by capturing surprise in every moment. Who would think a ball of snow would destroy a human life or that a mouth could transfer from a painting onto a hand like a sensual stigmata. As a man struggles to comprehend his newly found ""life-giving"" force, he kisses a statue into life and then becomes a voyeur in a world of bizarre occurrences after splashing through a mirror, a scene that made me laugh with surprise. Here, decorative angels climb down off walls, walk across ceilings and housekeepers sigh in frustration. The violent scenes are more like scenes from a dream and in black-and-white, the effect is rather mild and the suicide seems to be unsuccessful. The idea is more about the artistic look of the black blood than the actual death of the individuals. It is very experimental in nature and more art than death. Recently while watching a set of music videos directed by Anton Corbijn, I did notice a direct correlation between this movie and a 1984 music video where a hand (complete with faces instead of just lips) follows a woman and people try to step through mirrors. It could have just as easily been inspired by Alice in Wonderland, but I have my sneaking suspicion ""Blood of a Poet"" has inspired more than a few music videos. The beginning of this movie seems to stay in your mind for a few days as you consider the meanings and symbolism. Due to the realistic portrayals (sets are all fairly uncomplicated), this is surreal, but in a very down-to-earth way. ~The Rebecca Review ",0,0,0,dvd

"I can sum up my reaction to this DVD in one word - smile.  That's what I found myself doing throughout this wonderful performance.  Perhaps Carly's voice is not quite what it used to be, but that was never her attraction.  It is now, as it has always been, her uncanny ability to touch our hearts and give us all an intimate insight into the depth and breadth of her perception and emotion.  I loved the old standards from the Moonlight Serenade album, mixed with her own pop hits.  But I think my favorite part was the acoustic set where she sat down with just one guitar player, plus her own, and the backup singers, including her daughter, Sally Taylor.  Carly's duet with Sally on the old fifties song, ""Devoted To You"" was enough to bring tears to your eyes.  My only regret is that I was not there on the Queen Mary II, to witness this memorable event.  Thank goodness someone had the foresight to capture it for the rest of us.  ",0,0,0,dvd

"Although it takes liberties with the plot of Charles Dickens' classic, David Lean's 1948 version of OLIVER TWIST brilliantly captures the darkness and desolation, as well as the grotesqueness and humor, of its source.  John Howard Davies as Oliver is the picture of angelic innocence.  His underworld nemeses include Alec Guinness, the most repulsive Fagin imaginable; Robert Newton, perfect as the murderous Bill Sikes; and the teenage Anthony Newley, an intense and authentically Cockney Artful Dodger.  Kay Walsh is excellent as the doomed Nancy, though I personally would prefer a more youthful depiction of the character.  With its vivid cast and masterful direction, Lean's stirring yet unsentimental OLIVER TWIST is surely one of the finest films ever made of a Dickens novel",0,0,0,dvd

"Dolph Lundgren has finally done it! He finally decided to school his enemies at, well, a school! Yes! A genius indeed, Dolphage played an ex-soldier named Sam Decker who taught at a less-than-continuation school where cussing is the only language the kids know and girls are pregnant everywhere. &quot;Detention&quot; is so bad, it's good! Stereotypes have never been used this much, but the director achieved major insult to teens. Decker wanted to quit since he finally realized that High School High was below him and that the kids stunk, but the principal demanded that he stay and watch one, final detention class. Pity. A group of maniacs who dressed like Billy Idol took over the school and 'locked down' the school property. Of course, the movie went into &quot;Under Siege&quot; mode and Decker became a one-man army. The children band together and unite! A girl goes into labor, a wheelchair bound teen goes into a flurry and manages to outrun a motorcycle, another boy lives his self-fulfilling prophecy of actually getting courage to fight back and the whole gang construct this metallic/spike/shield thingy and fight bad guys in the gym!

"Reasons to own this set:First: Patrick McGoohan. A young Patrick McGoohan. If that isn't reason enough for you to run out and seize this set, you are made of tougher stuff than I. Women want to be with him, men want to be him (wait, that's Austin Powers...still....) Second: the screenplays are absolute marvels. Even though these are half-hour episodes, the writing is tight as can be. These seem like full-length films. You can't take your eyes off for a second as the action is nonstop. Third: these period pieces, filmed at the height of the Cold War are the real spy genre. John Drake (McGoohan's character, later transformed into Secret Agent) is the cool, ""I don't do wet-work"", get the job done action man. It was reported that McGoohan turned down the job of James Bond because the Bond role required jumping in and out of beds and doing a lot of killing; John Drake rescues damsels in distress, not dames in a state of undress. We ration out watching McGoohan trudging around Portmerion-as-Italy or on location in some other places and it never, ever palls. For Prisoner fans, this is a must-have as a precursor to that iconic series. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for all fans of spy drama",0,0,0,dvd

"It all started with John Malkovich. Me seeing the movie I mean, not the film itself. I was scanning through Malkovich's filmography and saw this film in their. I had heard of the film, but had no idea what it was about but I checked it out. Malkovich is close to top billing, but his role is really small...Having said that, this was an amazing film. Truly a work of art. The movie stars Sam Waterston ('Serial Mom') playing Sydney Schanberg, a New York Times columnist who heads to Cambodia on the brink of war. Bombs have been dropped, labor camps have been set up and Schanberg wants to write about all of it. When he gets there he meets Dith Pran (Haing S. Ngor, who won an Oscar for the role), who becomes his friend and interpreter. Malkovich plays Schanberg's photographer Al Rockoff; His role is brief, but he leaves his mark. After Schanberg's war entraps himself and his fellow journalists, Pran saves him from being executed but is himself placed in a labor camp. The script is based on a New York Times article by Schanberg called The Death and Life of Dith Pran. When I saw that, I figured this would be a rather depressing story. Truth is, the film is quite uplifting. The choice to use John Lennon's ""Imagine"" for the final scene was perfect. Anyway, back to the synopsis...Schanberg is back in New York, while Pran slaves at the labor camp. Schanberg has no idea whether Pran is alive or dead, but doesn't give up on the idea of one day reuniting with his friend. Most films that take place in this setting, I'm not a big fan of. I'm not saying I didn't like these films, but movies like The Constant Gardener and Beyond Borders are a bit like this movie. Although, for the record, this film is way better. Having said those last two things I was surprised that I liked this film. Whether you're a fan of these kinds of movies or not, you need to see this. It's an important and uplifting movie, that no one should not see.GRADE: A",0,0,0,dvd

"This DVD series was way more than I expected. The beginner's DVD is a great introduction to Salsa dancing. You truly do learn the basics. You'll start off with counting, rather than dancing, so you'll understand the basis on which salsa movements are built. After that, you'll dive right in to learning the basic Salsa step. It does take a while to imprint into your brain--and the instructors know that--so there's plenty of time allowed for repetition. Once you learn that, you'll move into doing some basic turns and by the time the first DVD is done, you will have learned a couple dance routines. What's also nice about the DVD is that there are actually two instructors; One who teaches movements for the leaders and one who teaches movements for the followers. Because of this, it's a great DVD for couples or friends who would like to learn to Salsa.",0,0,0,dvd
"The Secret Service, Gerry Anderson's final Supermarionation series, sounds so odd that it might put off fans, but that would be a pity. This 13 episode series combines numerous Anderson trademarks, with both Supermarionation and live action, in a daring and delightful show. British comic Stanley Unwin voices Father Unwin, a priest (or is he?) and secret agent. Factor in Matthew Harding as the faithful operator, a shrinking ray, and the good father's odd eccentricities: talking in an offbeat language called ""Unwinese,"" driving a 1919 flivver, and you've got the makings of a quirky Anderson classic. For some reason the opening recalls the British cult series, The Prisoner, with all sorts of other ""anglo echoes"" throughout. As a fitting finale to Anderson's Supermarionation series, The Secret Service is last but not least. ",0,0,0,dvd

For those who wish to protect their children from images of violence, be warned, there are fairly graphic depictions of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.  My personal opinion is that depictions of violence are everywhere, and these depictions at least have the benefit of conveying, in a manner that mere words cannot, an important aspect of world history",0,0,0,dvd
"While many might feel that the term ""Sphaghetti Western"" connotes a type of substandard Western with low - production values and poor acting, I was pleasantly suprised with this title.  Eastwood and Van Cleef were credible in their roles, the plot was solid (although a little fantastic) and the settings were breathtaking, although clearly not filmed in the United States.  Whoever was behind the camera definitely had an eye for the natural beauty of what, to the more casual observer, might seem to be a manifestly desolate landscape.  Van Cleef performs his role so well that this series of movies seems to be tailormade for him.  Eastwood, while his performance seems somewhat stereotypical and unidimensional, is still superior to many of the actors of his day who played in westerns and some of the actors of our day.  All - in - all, this movie is definitely one that merits being added to your collection. ",0,0,0,dvd

"I've been a devoted pilates practicer for over 6 years, and was somewhat sceptical about any kind of workout that tried to turn classic pilates into a more aerobic-type exercise. Still, I had an Ellen Barrett DVD (Self Sleek and Slim) and liked both the workout and instructor (she's extremely personable and has impeccable cueing), so I thought I would give this DVD a go. I'm very happy to report that I love it. I think Ellen does an excellent job at applying pilates exercises to a standing and mat workout that makes you sweat. I love the feeling of simultaneously stretching & stengthening my body while also burning fat. And even though the routine moves at a relatively slow pace, as other reviewers have pointed out, the use of weights really gets your heart going. I'd rather move at a steady pace and do the moves properly (that's a pilates principle!) than flail around at a frantic speed, as is the case with so many workouts. Many people seem to think that unless it's really fast paced, you're not getting a good workout--and that's totally wrong. I should add that I've always found weight training boring and have avoided it, so I'm very happy to have found a way to incorporate some into my workout. I also think that people with no pilates background can probably do just fine with this DVD, but you'd probably get more out of it with even some rudimentary instruction in pilates. I would recommend the Stott videos (also all excellent) starting with the beginner Pilates Mat workout. I work out 4-5 times a week, and have been using this DVD at least 2 times a week for 6 weeks now. I still look forward to it.  Highly highly recommended.",0,0,0,dvd

"I recently bought this radio, primarily for my car, but also got the home dock. It was easy to set up and install both types of kit. Unfortunately, the sound quality was very poor in both configurations. The FM modulator for the car was pretty close to hopeless. It only has maybe 10 channels. I found one that was free, luckily. But even with a clear channel, the sound had a terrible hiss, that went up and down in volume at apparent random even when everything was stationary. The occupied channels actually worked about as well (still lots of hiss)- except when the underlying channel broke through. Even disregarding the hiss, the sound quality on the music was not very good.    I thought the problem was probably with the FM modulator, so I tried it in the home dock, connected to a *very good* home hi-fi system. The hiss was gone, but the sound quality was completely unacceptable. For whatever reason, this particular receiver doesn't like the compression artifacts very much. Satellite radio quality is, AT BEST, about like an average MP3, with highly compressed signals (some channels better than others). This receiver seemed to exacerbate the effect, and it sounded a lot like a tin can and string ""telephone"" most of the time. It was vert irritating very quickly.    The form factor (about the size of a modern walkie-talkie) was fine, and pretty easy to fit in the car. It also seemed to be pretty solidly built.

I have seen other reviews where it stopped working, but it is well worth it to give the unit a second chance as it makes computer life so much easier--it has for me.

"I bought my Mom one of these because as a frail old lady she just can't handle a big thick plush terry towel.  She *adores* these microfiber towels!  However both she and I agreed that this particular size is just barely big enough to wrap around the head, and I happen to have a rather small head for an adult.  However we had just been discussing the sorry state of our kitchen towels, and how perfect this particular one would be right down to matching our color scheme.  (Caveat: The color of the actual towel is a hint more 'dust roseish' than the rich orangeish color shown on the Amazon webpage.)  I find that I like having a seperate towel for my hair but this size just doesn't quite make me comfortable and it would have been useless when my hair was waist-length.  So when I can afford to buy more of this particular size, they will be used in our kitchen",0,0,0,health_&_personal_care

"My sister saw the TV ad and ordered the Miracle Blade III Set. Now I knew the said ad and when she told me I was amazed that she once again used TV shopping to buy cheap products who are no good. What can one expect for that price, it's just too good to be true so people should use common sense and be suspicious. And think about the costs of all these TV ads worldwide, they have to calculate that into the price too so one can imagine how much the actual production cost must be; no wonder they let them manufacture somewhere in China!So the Set arrived and my sister used it often and was pleased at first. I'll admit the blades are razorsharp, be cautious when using them at first, but that's about it. After about 4 or 5 months they start to rust and they get dull too. Logos are falling off and they look terrible. The customer support is just plain awful; they didn't respond to several emails and when my sister tried to phone them she couldn't reach anyone besides the answering machine!!! In the end we didn't even try further to use the so called ""lifetime warrant"" and diposed the set.Stay away from Miracle Blade, do yourself a favour and buy a real quality set, there are plenty around (I won't mention a name) and for 200$ you get a solid set which will really last for a lifetime.Oh, and to other addicted online shoppers: please do some research on the Net before you pick up that phone and place your order.

Whether you are making a cup of tea or a pot of tea, the infuser is easy to use, easy to clean-up.The one big DOWNSIDE is that the company selling the infuser did NOT include THE LID - - it was missing from the shipment.  In spite of this deficiency, the infuser itself works great - - and since I seldom let my tea sit for very long after making a cup, the lid is not essential ..although it would have been nice to have in view of having paid for it.

"This is indeed a large pot, but I have found it extremely useful and use it at least once a week.  I didn't want a large number of pots and pans, so I looked for versatile pieces.  We are just 2 in our household right now, but I bought this size mostly because it will be even more useful for the future - a family, company. I use it to cook many things that I start on the stovetop and finish in the oven.  For example, to brown chicken pieces on the stovetop, add herbs, ingredients, etc, and bake it in the oven.  The heavy tight fitting lid keeps the steam locked in and the food moist. I bake entire chickens in it when I am short on time (skin isn't very crispy, though)- it really cooks a whole 4-lb chicken in about half an hour at 450 degrees with the pot and oven preheated. Works great with chili, soups, beans, tomato-based sauces, even jams. The cast iron heats slow and holds heat in - I don't burn anything in this.  Clean-up is so easy",0,0,0,kitchen_&_housewares

"I ignored the negative reviews. What I got myself was a huge pain! This thing is a terrible vaccuum. It vaccuums dust and sand- if you go over it twice. It does NOT vaccuum Kix, Cheerios, Goldfish, dried Play-Doh, corners, under low clearance furniture, along edges of walls or cabinets... I was so disappointed. I usually use a Shop Vac with a wide brush floor attachment. I wanted something that would do 2 jobs at once and save me time. It took me twice as long to vaccuum. If an object is too large to suck up you are out of luck. Here is why...*The debris on the floor has to be able to fit in the same narrow opening that sucks up the water. *The rubber edging is set too low to the floor and pushes or flings larger objects ahead of it. If you go over it backwards you hit the first problem stated above.*The suction is not great enough to pull debris from edges and corners.In addition, the water and dry dirt end up in the same container unless you wish to clean out the container twice. The filters clog easily if you have pets. The fluid runs out quickly. The brushes are weak and ineffectual on thicker grime and spots, a hidden jelly stain or a drop of congealed juice for example. I did notice that the water method sucked up more dirt then the intended dry method. It does clean, I had dirty water as proof, but this product leaves too much behind. I was very bummed and it was a hassle to return because I live 25 miles from the store. I wish that I had accepted the negative reviews. I hope other readers will learn from me and not the hard way like I did! There really is no better way than a broom or a good cannister vaccuum to get dirt and there is a reason that the mop is still #1 after all this time! ",1,0,0,kitchen_&_housewares
"I consider myself a serious aquarist with a setup that cost me over $3000 for my overly spoiled Koi and fancy goldfish. I recently moved from Pennsylvania to New York City where the water quality is not nearly as friendly toward goldfish nor consistent coming out of the tap and so I find myself testing the water many times in between scheduled water changes from the tank as well as the faucet.I can't stress enough how convenient it is to dip one of these strips and be done with all the testing in one shot, but also consider that the liquid tests are not much more economical.Each strip costs around $0.20, and with 5 tests all done within about a minute.Even if you are doing the regular liquid 'drop-tests' for Ph, Nitrate, and Nitrite, those tests typically run at best $0.15 ($0.05 per test), and you're looking at a few minutes for each individually. I personally got tired of rinsing the tubes and leaving them somewhere to dry. But, I would also gladly spend a penny per minute to not have to go through all that",0,0,0,kitchen_&_housewares
"This 'personal' teapot is such a joy to look at as well as use! The handle is very user friendly and very generous in its proportion but not too much to look out of scale to the pot's body. The lid's knob is the best I've ever encountered - no more slipping out of your fingers. It is a flat design with slight indents to really get a grip, and the trademark triangular shape makes an art statement to the roundness of the body.As for the Aubergine color - beautiful! This shade of purple is  not garish or gaudy, but very classy and rich looking. Though the picture shows a shiny finish, it is matte but definitely has a wonderful luster and is not dull by any means. The tea pours out in a nice arc from the high position of the spout, another small joy if you like waterfall features.What's NOT to love about this cute teapot. You'll enjoy looking at the pot as much as you'll enjoy your tea experiments. By the way, this teapot's bigger version is just as wonderful and has a very ingenious ceramic tea infuser that attaches into the lid for easy use - now is that cool or what?!",0,0,0,kitchen_&_housewares
"Sports Car International is, by far, the best automotive magazine currently being made. This is the magazine that Road and Track, Car and Driver, Motortrend, Automobile, and all the others wish they could be. This magazine is a little more pricy and it only comes 6 times a year, but that does not diminish its excellence. This magazine has far fewer subscribers than the big names, but that doesn't stop it from consistently having the most beautiful photographs, the best writing, and the least ads. While the big names have endless pages of advertising, SCI has few. Also, this magazine is one of the most focused ones on the rack. You won't find Honda Civics, Cadillac Escalades, or any other crappy vehicles. The magazine reviews more than sports cars alone, but they do an excellent job limiting the coverage to &quot;sporty&quot; cars. The variety is also overwhelming. If you subscribe to Motortrend, you might get 3 or 4 sporty cars in one issue. The very first issue I bought had reviews of the BMW M Coupe, the Ferrari 360 Spider, the Ferrari 365 GTB/4 Daytona, the Aston-Martin Vanquish, the Aston-Martin DB4, the Porsche Carrera 4, and others.

"We finally get more Seger on a greatest hits C.D. Most of these songs are his lesser known hits, with a couple of exceptions. I'm not nearly as famliar with these songs, so no individual reviews on these. Songs like Understanding, Katmandu, Her Strut, Sunspot Baby, Fire Lake, and Rock And Roll Never Forgets have never gotten their due. They're all great songs by a great artist and it's just so nice to see them on one C.D.Also included on this are The Fire Down Below, Beautiful Loser, Shame On The Moon, Shakedown(From Beverly Hills Cop II), and more. This includes a duet with Martina Mcbride ""Chances are"" from the movie Hope Floats. He includes three new previously unreleased songs. The previously mentioned Shakedown which was originally on the soundtrack from the Eddie Murphy vehicle, Chances Are, and Understanding. Seger, like I said in my review of the first greatest hits, sings songs that move you. He's written a lot of songs that many people can symbolize with. American hits from a Michigan artist. People seem to under-appreciate Seger. That is a shame. HE's a great artist with a great sound. Great music, lyrics, and messages. Just sit back and listen to his music and you will not be disappointed. Well worth the money. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. Get IT",0,0,0,music
"There is a reason this recording is the best selling jazz album of all time. The music is magical - I loved it when I was a teenager in the early 70's (despite being a ""rock"" fan), and it's still special 35 years later. I highly recommend getting the pure CD format. This disc is not a pure CD - it is a special new format called DualDisc, with ""CD Audio""* on one side, and DVD video content and 5.1 audio on the other side. Seems like a great idea, a great way to get people to buy CD's instead of downloading them. NOT! Notice that asterisk next to ""CD Audio""? There is a warning on the outside of the disk that it does not comply with the strict CD-Audio format, and it may not play on some CD or DVD players. If that was the only problem with this disc I say fine - the risk is worth the possible reward.  But no. Despite the added content of the DualDisc format with various extras, the DualDisc format is treacherous, very treacherous. If you want to play this ""CD"" (DualDisc - CD side) on a computer, on a Windows machine it installs a small hidden piece of software on your machine altering the driver for your CD or DVD drive reducing the CD/DVD's functionality. I have not yet been able to reverse the damage this disc has done to my machine's software despite reading many posts about methods to do this. I never agreed to any software installation (I never would have), and yet my CD/DVD drives have lost the ability to do DMA. And to add insult to injury, the DualDisc - CD side will not play on my computer - I cannot even listen to it where I spend many hours a day. Outrageous.  I've wasted so much time on this DualDisc that I haven't had the time to watch the DVD side content. Unbelievable that I paid for this abuse - this is the way the publisher Sony/BMG - Columbia treats a legitimate customer?

"Ok that title's kinda cheesy but I really don't care! Anyway, hi! I'm a sophmore in high school and we recently just wrapped up out fall musical ""The Music Man."" When I auditioned I had heard of it, but I had no real clue what it was about. I had the pleasure of playing Maud Dunlop...one of the Del Sarte Ladies. I fell in love with this musical from the start, and I just wanna tell you all about this wonderful soundtrack. So sit back and I hope you enjoy reading this review!Main Title/Rock Island/Iowa Stubborn 9/10 - The main title is basically just an instrumental of a few of the songs. Nothing special, but a good listen. Rock Island has to be one of my favorite track just because it's so much fun to listen to. The audience enjoyed this ""song"" every night during our performances. Iowa Stubborn is also fun to listen to. It can also get stuck in your head very easily. It's just one of those upbeat numbers that gets the musical going, but it is fun.Ya Got Trouble 10/10 - Wonderful! One of my favorites! It's just so well delivered and so funny. Our Harold Hill disappeared one practice, came back after about 15 minutes and had this entire song memorized! He was very good at it. It's a very enjoyable song...one of the best in the musical!Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind Me Saying So 10/10 - I can't really say why I love this song, but there is just something about it so appealing. I absolutely love Marian's mother in this song, because she's just so bluntly funny. I also love Shirley Jones and her voice is just beautiful! A very fun song to listen to! I always had fun watching it when we rehearsed or performed.Goodnight My Someone 8/10 - Ehh...It's not a bad song, but kinda slow and dragging at times...by any means it's not horrible or anything it's very beautiful and wonderfully sung, but it can be boring in some spots. Otherwise very good and not a bad listen.Ya Got Trouble/Seventy-Six Trombones 9/10 - Great...I especially love the line ""Billiard parlor walls come a-tumblin' down!"" This is definitely the most famous song in the entire musical, and it's easy to see why. It's very energetic and very addictive. It so much fun to listen to and if you listen to the band behind the singing, they sound absolutely excellent!Sincere 9/10 - Gorgeous...It's not my favorite quartet song, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's very beautiful and just takes you away when it begins to when it ends. Beautiful!The Sadder But Wiser Girl 8/10 - Not a bad song, but not the best. I do, however, enjoy the line ""I smile, I grin, when the gal with a touch of sin walks in."" It's a very addictive song, but a little too short if you ask me. Still a good listen, though. Pick-A-Little, Talk-A-Little 10/10 - I'm not giving this 10 outta 10 because it's my song, but because its so hilarious, and the quartet do and excellent job! I don't know what it is about a bunch of old women singing ""Pick a little, talk a little cheep cheep cheep..."" over and over again, but it's just so funny! I can just picture them pecking around resembling chickens to a T. It's a great song! I fully enjoy hearing Mrs. Shinn saying ""BAL-ZAC!"" It's so funny! One of my favorites!Marian The Librarian 9/10 - Love it! Very addictive! If you ever get a chance to watch this scene it the movie, take it! It's quite possibly the best scene in the entire film! The song is very enjoyable and quite funny when you listen to the words. I got to do a bit of a tango in our production. It was one of my favorite scenes. I also enjoyed how much rejection Harold was getting but he pressed on. Another wonderfully delivered song!Being In Love 8/10 - Again...Eh...I prefer ""My White Knight"" to be honest with you. This isn't my favorite song, but it's still beautifully sung thanx to Shirley Jones. Its a bit faster than you'd expect, but it's still not quite as enjoyable as ""My White Knight."" Still, not too bad.Gary, Indiana(Prof. Hill) 8/10 - This song is alright, but I get tired of hearing about Gary, Indiana, because I live in Indiana and Gary ain't all that good. I also quite enjoyed Winthrop's version a bit better. Also, it's a bit short. Still, it's okay for a listen once in a while.The Wells Fargo Wagon 10/10 - I love this song for some odd reason. I'm not really sure what it is, but it's just one of those songs you just like. It's just got that addictive sound to it that you can't get out of you head. Winthrop is just adorable! It's a definite favorite!Lida Rose/ Will I Ever Tell You 10/10 - Beautiful!! Absolutely beautiful! This is my favorite song by the quartet! It's so gorgeous! And ""Will I Ever Tell You"" is just as equaly wonderful. It's probably my favorite Marian solo. I love how they compliment eachother so well. I love listening to it so much! Our quartet was very talented and got standing ovations everynight. I highly recommend this track!Gary, Indiana(Winthrop) 9/10 - I think I enjoy this so much because of how cute Winthrop is! It's adorable! If it weren't for him I don't think I'd enjoy this song so much. It's a fun track!Shipoopi 10/10 - The best song in the movie and on the CD! You can't hate it! It's kinda like ""We Go Together"" from Grease...You could hear it over and over and over again and still love it every single time. It's just so energetic and fun. We had the most fun performing it everynight! This was everyone's favorite song! Simply awesome!Till There Was You 9/10 - My second favorite Marian solo, because it's just so gorgeous! I remeber hearing this in the movie The Wedding Singer and I didn't realize it was the same song until a month into rehearsal. It's a beautiful song. I enjoy it everytime. I remember our last night of performing the musical when Marian was singing this and out footbridge broke! it just crack in two pieces! it was hysterical! Anyway, this is a very good song! I love listening to it so much! Props to Shirley Jones, once again!Goodnight My Someone/Seventy-Six Trombones 8/10 - It's more relevent to the story than the soundtrack, but I like it because it's when Harold finally realizes he's in love and it's just really enjoyable.Seventy-Six Trombones 9/10 - This is basically just the closing number, but it's nice to just be able to enjoy the band without having to listen to all the singing. Then near the end they bring in the entire company and it still sounds wonderful. I think it was a great idea to open and close the sountrack with this song. It's just a great song!All in all this soundtrack is and excellent listen! I highly recommend it to anyone who thinks they would enjoy it! You will! I'm very happy to have been a part of this musical and I had a wonderful 2 months rehearsing for it! It was a wonderful experience! I hope you enjoyed reading this and I'll now let you get back to you lives! I also hope you enjoy ""The Music Man."" It is truely one of the greatest American musicals! Goodnight my someone, goodnight!~Your Haunted Angel",0,0,0,music

"Ornella emerged in the music/ international scene in the magical decade of the sixties, the decade that Europe produced the best female singers, like Mina, Milva,Nana Mouskouri,Patty Pravo etc. She is the perfect product of her generation, and I am sure that if she was a given a chance to start all over again, she would sing the same songs. Her voice is melancholic, rich in subcontext, full of experience. In this particular album, recorded in 1986, she collaborated with some of the best musicians in the easy listening/jazz field, like George Benson, Herbie Hankock, Steve Gadd, Gil Evans, Michael Brecker, Ron Carter, in order to record the old standards that her generation created, like Il mondo,poesia,ancora,aria,canzone per te, e penso a te,la voce del silenzio etc. She created an atmosphere of deep,bittersweet melancholy, and all that you want to do is switch off the lights, take a big glass of drink and listen.",0,0,0,music

"As a major fan of Vaughn Monroe, I was very pleased with &quot;The Very Best of Vaughn Monroe&quot;. I found the remastering excellent and the selection of songs to be a good representation Vaughn's recordings. One  problem I did find with this collection is that the represented version of  &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot; is not the original 1941 version rather a  1945 re-recording with strings. The 1941 version seems to never be  re-issued and I would like to have had it represented with Vaughn's early  songs on this CD. I have all of these recordings on either 45's or 78's and  for the first time I have discovered how wonderful the Vaughn Monroe  Orchestra really was without all of the surface noise included on the  original 78's.Vaughn Monroe was a huge star from the Big Band Era well into  the early Rock years,who could forget Vaughn's Twist version of Bye, Bye,  Blackbird? It is really sad that Vaughn has so little to represent him on  CD. Hopefully we will see more recordings appear with the same quality as  this CD",0,0,0,music
"Of all the albums the Jacksons released after they departed from Motown, this is probably their best work (with Destiny a VERY close second). A masterpiece, this album will definitely take you back to the days of REAL music by REAL, talented musicians. All of the tracks are great, but the ones that stand out the most are ""Can You Feel It,"" ""Lovely One,"" ""Everybody,"" ""Heartbreak Hotel,"" (one the best songs ever made in my opinion) ""Time Waits For No One,"" and ""Walk Right Now."" If you are an MJ fan, or a Jackson 5 fan, or just a fan of original, REAL music, by real, talented musicians and songwriters, this is an album you should definitely invest in. I purchased this months ago and it still gets daily play from me.",0,0,0,music
"Not sure if you like Slowdive? This collection of songs, unlike most compilations does a wonderful job of showing you who this band is. In other words, If you don't like this collection you probably do not like Slowdive. This is Slowdive at there best, While it does lack a few great songs, overall it is pretty amazing. If you do like this set a lot, as a huge Slowdive fan I recommend hunting down all the CD's and EP's you can find. It may be difficult but if you like this material you will love just about everything you hear by Slowdive. In all my searches I have not found another band that even comes close to being as amazing as Slowdive. Most fans of Shoegaze music will tell you My Bloody Valentine is the best of the genre, while they are the originators of this style, Slowdive has perfected what they started. I am a big MBV fan but they just do not touch Slowdive. I highly recommend this album for new listeners of Slowdive, and also long time fans, as there is a lot of hard to find material on this album, and a live peel sessions version of Golden hair that will give you the chills. This music is so good it, it almost doesn't seem human. If your looking for more material by slowdive I would highly recommend these other albums:1. Souvlaki (My Favorite)2. Pygmalion (Out of print, but worth trying to hunt down. Try Ebay)3. Just for a Day (not represent that well on this compilation)4. Blueday (Also out of print, but this collection has most the songs)While Slowdive sadly no longer exists, most of the members have some great side projects, but none are quite as amazing as Slowdive. Check out The Monster Movie, Neil Halstead, Mojave 3, Rachel Goswell. Get this CD and get into the greatest, underated band ever!(P.S. Souvlaki Space Station is the best Song you'll ever hear!",0,0,0,music

"If you are new to Teena Marie, then this is the must-own compilation.  Old-school devotees of our ""Lady T"" already know what is up with this CD.....it's ""Nirvana"" or ""Meca"" for the Teena Marie fan.Lady T's power is timeless, full of emotion, soul and groove.  Teena Marie is prolific in her writings and stylings.  Her creativity shows through in writing, arrangement and vocal styling.  She is unique.  No other artist can bring to the table what she does.  If you listen to her 80's hits, you will hear early hip-hop.  She offends noone with her musical selections, and includes everyone.  Whether you prefer rythmn and blues, latin soul, classic soul ballads, or tricked-out funk guitar, you are invited to the party. Required listening is ""Portugese Love"".  If your hips don't start to rocking, and your love doesn't start to rise up in your throat, then you are in a coma.  Passion and desire are unbridled in this gorgeous track. If you pine for a lost love, I don't suggest you listen to this cd, because you will only intensify your pain.  She speaks your pain in every note, because she has felt its intensity herself.  Lady T is colorless.  Although she said on American Bandstand in the 80's that she was the ""White Queen of Soul"", I beg to differ. I like to call her ""Angel of Soul"", because she rises above and beyond this world with her ethereal voice and emotion.  While Aretha Franklin is grounded in rock steady solid emotion, Teena Marie takes you to flight with her expressions. ",0,0,0,music

"It's difficult to talk about Chris Thile and not think back to the Chicago Tribune concert review that called him ""A force of nature with a flatpick; To say Thile is as staggering a talent as has ever come out of bluegrass would be too limiting--few have emerged from any genre that compare with Thile's brilliance."" I couldn't agree more.  There are scant geniuses walking the earth today who can even approach Chris Thile's combination of ""gift"" and work ethic.  He could have stopped when he was 12 and still be thought of as the world's pre-eminent mandolinist for the remainder of his life.  Lucky for us, he didn't stop.For this project Chris gathered other musicians who are undisputed masters of their instruments: Bela Fleck on banjo.  Jerry Douglas on Dobro.  Bryan Sutton on guitar.  Stuart Duncan on fiddle.  Edgar Meyer on bass.  At the moment I can't imagine a collection of string musicians with more virtuosity.  They get turned loose on 12 of Chris' original compositions.  The results are spectacular.  All instrumentals - this collection covers a wide range of material.  Some hot and spicy bluegrass breakdowns.  Some slower pieces.  All good.  Get it",0,0,0,music
"When I was growing up THE 3 WORLDS OF GULLIVER was one of my first films that I became enchanted with when I started making the transition from cartoons to live action movies. One thing that always stood out in this movie was the music. When I listened to this recording it really brought back memories. I really like Bernard Herrmann's scores that he wrote for fantasy films. The Royal Scottish National Orchestra did a fine job on this recording. I think what sets this recording apart from Herrmann's other fantasy scores was that he was able to develop music for the different fantastic settings that Gulliver was confronted with, yet he always reminded us musically of Gulliver's love of country and his fair lady in these various interludes. Joel McNeely seems to have captured Herrmann's intent ever so fervently and reverently",0,0,0,music

"Newport Jazz Festival, 1956, a bunch of rich white folks, being in style go to a jazz festival. They obviously were very timid and unaware of Duke Ellington and his men, and they give some soft golf claps in the beginning while the announcer is announcing Duke and his men. The band then goes on to perform, a very dark and chilling version of ""Black and Tan Fantasy"" with Cat Anderson, Quinten Jackson, and Russel Procope giving great performances. Next follows a passive but nice version of ""Tea for Two"" played by Willie Cook in a Clifford Brown tone. Then the band goes on break for quite some time due the fact that key members are missing and have not showed up yet. Then we go on to Billy Stayhorn's ""Take The A Train"", then the first main course, ""The Newport Jazz Festival Suite"". This was not completly finished by Ellington/Strayhorn as it was played this night. And it is played with passion, even if it is not perfect. Some great soloist strutt thier stuff- Jimmy Hamilton, Clark Terry, Ray Nance, ect. Then the great baritone player, Harry Carney (who was with duke since the 20's) plays an decent rendition (He usually played this better) of ""Sophistcated Lady"", then a terrible vocal take by Josh Grisham on ""Day In, Day Out"". Next in the second main course, ""Dimuendo and Crescendo in Blue"", every that needs to be said about this has already been said. Then this crowd, this stiff and boring crowd get going. Screaming for more, Duke gives them his all time great soloist, Johnny Hodges. He plays beautifully on ""I Got It Bad"" and ""Jeep's Blues"". The crowd is still getting more and more crazy, and after ""Tulip and Turnip"", Sam Woodyard solos on ""Skip Deep"" and bring them to the edge again. They end with a few bars of ""Mood Indigo"" with the crowd screaming for more. I understand that a near-riot seems like nothing in Rock - n Roll terms today. But these people aren't drunk and pointlessly unruly like rock fans (I been to concert were people are moshing and a band is still setting up, which proves that this Rock-n-Roll energy ain't nothing), these people were takin away by this music. As much as they wanted to be boring and hardly cheer, they couldn't help and had to scream. For one night, improvised music was appreciate",0,0,0,music

"I've recently become a huge hitchhiker's fan and, after seeing the new movie, felt that I had to have the sound track.  I really bought it because I love the banjo laden ""Journey of the Sorcerer.""  Like most of the songs, though, I wish it were a longer version.  While all of the songs are really well done, most of them are 2 minutes or less.  This is not so bad when you listen to them straight through, since there is a detectable theme to the soundtrack.  Sometimes you can't even tell that the song switched.  Only if you want to listen to one particular track is the length a problem.  You get just a taste of the music and then the son switches before you can get really into it.  This is only a minor detail, however, when you consider how great the soundtrack is on whole.  I'm glad that they decided not to put a whole bunch of sound clips on the album.  Not that this is always bad, but isn't the dialogue what the movie is for?  In summation, this is a great album for anyone who enjoyed the music while watching the movie, and the extra songs that did not appear in the movie are also great",0,0,0,music
"Elton John's first GREATEST HITS album is almost as great as his second, but it contains a few songs that are either drab (the opening ballad, ""Your Song"") or totally hokey (""Honky Cat"", ""Crocodile Rock""). Nevertheless, there is much great stuff here, including ""Rocket Man"", a beautiful ballad about husbandhood, the hard-rocking ""Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting"", which provided the prototype for a lot of 80s hair bands, the Marilyn Monroe tribute ""Candle In The Wind"", the glam-rock anthem ""Bennie And The Jets"", the let's-get-back-to-reality song ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"", the paean to perseverance ""Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me"", and ""The Border Song"", whose references to Moses inspired me to go to my parents' house for Passover, despite various family issues.

YMCA featured in the movie of the same name and was one of Village people's greatest hits. Boogie Oogie Oogie went Billboard Top 5 in 1979.

The things that make Ja Rule, Jadakiss, and Jay-Z platinum sellers are conspicuously and completely absent from this record. (Remember records?)

"This is Todd Snider as I remember him - at the head of the Nervous Wrecks touring with the Bottlerockets on the stage at Mississippi Nights in St. Louis - where I first saw him and where I keep him in my mind's eye.  He opened for the BRox there - local favorites got to close the show (which was cool enough by itself, but it gets better).  Now, I don't mean that this is a live recording - it isn't.  It is smoothly recorded, and professional in every way (as it was his last major label release, btw).  But the damn thing growls, like he used to do live - it has an immediacy that the others lack.  The material is performed with real enthusiasm.  Songs like ""Rocket Fuel"" and ""I am Too"" actually breathe fire, and ""I am Too"" features the best verse ever written in the United States, in any song, ever (you figure it out).

"For a dead man, Frank Zappa can still put out some astonishing music. This latest effort from the Zappa Family Trust is a collection of smoking guitar solos from the master of the guitar himself. Mostly recorded with his legendary 1988 touring band, Trance-Fusion sports some riveting dramatic guitar work supported by rock-solid fusion rhythm work by a big band that is nothing short of spectacular. People like to dismiss Frank Zappa as a weirdo who sings smutty songs with bizarre musical changes, but the reality is different. His guitar playing is out of this world, unlike anything else being put to CD these days, and the sound of these live recordings is lush, bountiful, and extraordinary. You can feel Terry Bozio's kick drum pulsate through your body, and hear every player's work sizzle upward through the potent brew of notes, and everything fits nicely into a jazz rock fusion framework that soars above all the current musical competition. I know this review sounds overly effusive. But if you enjoy guitar music supported by outlandishly expert musicians, then Trance-Fusion needs to be a part of your collection. NOW.",0,0,0,music

"This is a great and comprehensive collection of the folk music of a little-know Scottish singer who released two albums (both covered here - the second quite superb) in the early seventies and then disappeared for the next thirty three years.Heavily influenced by the great Joni Mitchell with a twist of Joan Baez, but also with an British sensitivity more popularly found in Sandy Denny and Nick Drake, Shelagh was developing so rapidly between her first and second albums that she has to join the great line of ""what if?"" artists who showed so much promised but were then silenced one way or another.Shelagh was another drug casualty. However instead of meeting her demise she fled back north to Scotland after a bad acid trip in London left her hallucinating for three weeks and with a voice that sounded ""like a cat being strangled"". She cut all contacts with her associates. ""Suddenly, I had to get out. My disappearance wasn't at all conscious. It was a coping mechanism:  self-preservation."" Thereafter she led an anonymous urban life from home, followed by years of living rough in a tent with her partner, crossing the highlands and islands of Scotland and staying close to nature. ""I love the lifestyle"" claimed Shelagh last year.For the mystery was finally solved in 2005 after a Scottish newspaper, The Scottish Daily Mail, printed an article on the mystery folk singer prompting Shelagh herself to appear out of nowhere ""to let everyone know I'm safe and well"" and to give us the second half of the story. For full details check out: www.btinternet.com/~blackvelvet/ if the page is still there. Anyway a bucket of royalties awaited her (perhaps of no interest) and she reported that she is writing songs and enjoying music again, voice restored.Msytery solved. Happy ending? Hopefully the lady herself, now 57, truly has been happy in her wanderings. We will still never know what riches of glorious singing we have missed, whatever may happen now. So get a hold of this excellent and (I understand) complete collection of her recorded work. The second disc has the whole of ""Stargazer"" which would be the price on it's own.

"This CD is perfect in my opinion. The recording is perfect, the pitch is perfect, the tempo is perfect, and the track selections are perfect. I think the album samples Beethoven's most remarkable pieces of work from his early years to his death. I have heard many recordings of the Ninth symphony that was just executed poorly; which is a shame because it is such a powerful piece. However, this album does it superbly. Sir Georg Solti and Murray Perahia did an amazing job with this album. The album just flows really well from one piece to the next evoking a vast array of emotions along the way. Beethoven is timeless and forever will be. There is no comparison even to this day. This a wonderful tribute to the artist. ",0,0,0,music

"""Close to you, I will always stayClose to you, though you're far awayYou'll always be near As though you were here by my sideNo matter where - in my dreams I'll find you thereClose to me, sharing your caressCan't you see you're my happiness?Wherever you go, my heart will go, tooWhat can I do?It only wants to be close to you."" ~ Close To You ~ Al Hoffman/Carl Lampl/Jerry Livingston""Close To You And More,"" recorded in 1956, is one of the finest and my absolute favorite Sinatra recordings of all-time. The choice of material is very impressive and his interpretations are flawless, heartfelt, sincere and so true to the lyrics of each song. This is another one of great collaborations with a fine arranger and conductor, Nelson Riddle. To me, Nelson Riddle was truly the best of all Sinatra arrangers/conductors for he had proved that he could master his craft on any recordings he handled, be it with a full orchestra or a small ensemble like the classically-influenced Hollywood String Quartet (husband and wife Felix and Eleonor Slatkin, Paul C. Shure and Alvin Dinkin). Mr. Sinatra, a classical music lover himself, heard the beauty and elegance on how the quartet played and fell in love with the quartet and in the process developed a close friendship with the Slatkins.With fifteen nostalgic songs to listen to, this magnificent CD is bound to mesmerize and move you starting off with my top choice here, an achingly beautiful song, ""Close To You"" followed by one of Johnny Mercer and Gordon Jenkin's gems, a longingly sentimental ""P.S. I Love You,"" down to  heart-rending tracks, Jimmy McHugh and Harold Adamson's ""I Couldn't Sleep A Wink Last Night"" and Edward Redding's ""The End of a Love Affair.""Mr. Sinatra's gentle and affectionate treatments of Edward Heyman and Oscar Levant's ""Blame It On My Youth"" and a gem from Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, ""It's Easy To Remember"" are so sublime and perfectly covered. ""Your sweet expressionThe smile you gave meThe way you looked when we metIt's easy to rememberBut so hard to forgetI hear you whisper, ""I'll always love you"" I know it's over and yetIt's easy to rememberBut so hard to forget.""Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin's musical treasure, ""With Every Breathe I Take"" is also one of my favorite songs of all-time. ""I think of you with every breath I takeWith every breeze that wanders byAnd your name is a songI'll remember the long years through.""And yes. . . Frank Sinatra is like a song, a song we'll always remember the long years through.With my heartfelt recommendation. A must-have to any Sinatra buff. ",0,0,0,music
"I saw Carole King on the Living Room Tour, and I am so glad I did. It was just her, the piano, her longtime guitarist Rudy Guess, and Gary Burr, a very talented guitarist, singer and songwriter in his own right - in a ""living room"" kind of setting. That's it - just the three of them. This CD brings it all back - ""Where You Lead,"" with Carole's daughter Louise Goffin, the rocking acoustic ""Jazzman,"" the ""Gerry Goffin/Carole King Medley"" (LOTS of wonderful songs included - some I didn't know they had co-written), a great acoustic version of ""Smackwater Jack,"" and a haunting ""Now and Forever,"" which makes me cry every time I hear it. The only one missing here is ""Been to Canaan,"" which she played the night I saw her, but otherwise, it's wonderful. No matter what some of the other reviewers here say, this is a great way to hear and see any musician - without the full band, in their living room, where it all begins.

"You know I am hard pressed to find a single musician who sounds like Tom Waits. Sure, he borrows elements from all sorts of places, from light jazz to down and dirty blues and everything that resorts in between but no one actually sounds like Tom Waits, and that's the genius of him.""Alice"" is my favorite Tom Waits record that I have heard thus far and it will probably be hard to top in my mind. ""Alice"" is a dark and depressing record in every way that that can be seen as good. It is like a journey into the head of a madman, but unlike most records of its type it never actually leaves you out.This is also Waits' most consitant record which makes sense since it is the soundtrack to a play from the early ninties. The songs don't seem to tell a story of any sort, but they all keep a certain mood and texture even though not any two songs sound a thing alike.What can you expect to get from ""Alice"" you maybe thinking to yourself if you have yet to hear it. Well, jazz band trios playing vaudville music on trash can with an inebreiated carney barking in the background after one too many cigarettes is the best way I can think to descrbie it even though it doesn't explain the record very well. ""Alice"" shifts from a cool, smooth Tom Waits voice that is reminscent in the best of ways of Leonard Cohen on tracks like ""Alice"" and ""Flowers Grave"", a truly flawless and beautiful song, to a demented bark that will keep your kids up at night in terror like on the strangely absurd yet brilliant ""Everything You Can Think Of Is True""(which features the finest line in Waits' catalog: ""And fishes make wishes on you""). The music that backs him in perfectly calm and gorgeous, all violins and cellos and guitar played with a perfect minimalistic approach that is a breath of fresh air from all the over produced, lifeless ""music"" that people listen to today.I hardly ever give records five stars because most records don't deserve it. Even great records by great artists rarely deserve five stars, which in my mind means flawless, amazing and top of its genre in every way: music, lyrics, feel, pacakging etc. And ""Alice"" fits that bill to a T. It's one of the most beautiful, frightining, interesting, surreal and amazing records I have ever heard and should be considered essential listening by every one who can come in contatct with it.Hence, a truly classic album. The ones that remind you why you love music and make you want to create your own. And that is ""Alice"" and Tom Waits in a nutshell",0,0,0,music
"Dru Hill's Enter The Dru was the CD that pushed the group to the fore front of the R&B game. The first single released from the CD, the up-tempo How Deep Is Your Love feat.Redman was a hit single but it was the slow jams that made this CD work. The singles These Are The Times, The Love We Had (Stays On My Mind) and of course the sentimental Beauty are all classic slow jams. Enter The Dru also featured some very strong album tracks including I'm Wondering, Holding You, I'll Be The One and What Are We Gonna Do.

"I can still hear some hiss and tape imperfections on good vibrations. It did'nt matter to me Vibrations still sounded loud and clear and for the best part cleaned up from the original master tapes. I like the extra tracks alot. This cd is simple and sweet and sounds great despite old original tape defects. I dont believe their ever was a stereo recording for vibrations. I enjoyed this cleaned up mono version of good vibrations and besides if their was a genuine stereo original recording of vibrations from circa early to mid-1966 I think it would have surfaced by now. Besides I think mono recordings sounded better to Brian Wilson because I beleive he is deaf in one ear. Enjoy this cd ep it may one day go double or triple what it costs now. Produced for a then staggering $100,000 Good Vibrations was the exclamation point to Pet Sounds in the fall of 1966 as the Beach Boys really stuck it to the Beatles. Due to these Beach Boy releases in 1966 the Beatles would have their greatest year creativity wise in 1967 as they would answer there well armed rivals  with Pennylane, Strawberry fields, and of course Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band. The Beatles created masterpieces from Revolver to their last magnum opus Abbey Road. My honest opinion (and this might offend Beatle and rock fans in general) 'Pet Sounds"" and ""Good Virations"" were the blueprints to all Beatle recordings from 1966 through 1969. I respect the Beatles for their writing and musical creativity. I really feel that the Beatles were so amazed by ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Good Vibrations"" that with their releases from 1966- 1969 the Beatles really tried to capture the sound of ""Pet Sounds"" and ""Good Vibrations"". There is no argument from me, the Beatles did create masterpices from 66-69 but honestly, never matched the sound of ""Pet Sounds"" and Good Vibrations"". If it were'nt for Brians over indulgences post Pet Sounds as the song goes God Only Knows what the Beach Boys could have accomplished for the rest of the psychedelic 1960s. Man I'll tell you there has been nothing before or after that sounds like ""Good Vibrations"". Brian Wilson is the man, the one man who made the Beatles and Sir George Martin realize that they to could be surpassed in talent, let alone by one man and that one man is BRIAN WILSON................",0,0,0,music

"The world of show business is not a place where shrinking violets bloom.  On the contrary, it is known for bombast, opportunism, and egos larger and more gaseous than zeppelins.Consequently it is rare indeed to find an act featuring two prodigious talents who have chosen to share billing equally.  This extraordinary gesture of selflessness is indicated by the word - AND - which links the two names.A small handful of examples comes to mind where two geniuses are paired.  The Captain And Tennille, of course, The Fluorescent Leech And Eddie, and the late lamented duo, Wayland Flowers And Madame who, tragically, died simultaneously.Add to this distinguished list the names, Sam And Dave.  These powerhouse singers, who secured their place in history with a few hits covered by shabby second-stringers, simply define everything that is good about R&B.

"       Hi people. Metamorpho has had a busy day - reflecting mostly. Anyway children - before all this technology hit and digital sound bytes infiltrated everyone's craniums- we actually had some purity to the music. If you've been following my reviews - when we last left Metamorpho - someone gave him a free ticket to see Simon and Garfunkel at Carnegie Hall.  Essentially this program was pretty much the same- as presented here as being at Philharmonic Hall. But who can quibble? I do remember distinctly coming away with amazement that they could be so mesmerizing by utilizing only vocals and one guitar.  And the audience REALLY listened to them! And it was all real!     These tunes are essentially from the beginning of their career.  It is amazing how good Paul is on guitar and practically makes you forget the embellishments that were added in the studio. You have the angelic voice of Art Garfunkel perfectly juxtaposed against Paul's vocals.  The enunciation, the precision, the timing of the harmonies is about as perfect as you can get.  One can see easily the effect that The Everly Brothers had on them.  This live recording is a pure joy.  It reminds us that - at one time - we didn't have the need for alot of musicians when the material was this good. Dylan also was able to weave his magic this way. But, everybody plugged in electric guitars and things became different. Mind you, Metamorpho is fine with all this because it is transition and progress - but isn't it good to hear this nugget, that preserves a moment in time which will always be precious?      You can see what songs they do under the song select on this page.  What I will say is that they are sung expertly and you will be stung by the sheer beauty of the balanced harmonies. It is good to have them both - forever preserved in their prime. Believe me people, if Metamorpho had been given more tickets back then, I would have gladly brought you along. But, since that didn't happen, just imagine yourselves sneaking into New York City with me to see this. Close your eyes, put on this c.d., and you are there! You see them, don't you? Artie and Paul on stage with just a chairstool, microphones and a guitar. Metamorpho is proud of your efforts to tune in to the collective unconcious! Alright Alright.

What should have been a madcap tunefest, is a lugubrious, plodding mess, thanks to Lucy. Not her fault, she was totally wrong for the part. But Warner Bros. and Jack Warner had a history of ruining film musicals in order to cast big names. Think Roz Russell in Gypsy, Audrey Hepburn in My Fair Lady, Vanessa Redgrave in Camelot. They wanted to cast Cary Grant (who flat out refused, and threatened not to see it) in place of Robert Preston in The Music Man. All talented performers, usually dubbed, but lacking something that the originals had. Think of how perfect My Fair Lady would have been with Julie Andrews?

"Fans that just came along and think Morning View is their 2nd cd need not read this review. Nor the fans who spout ""Drive is best song ever, incubus is new right?"" True fans of incubus will appreciate ACLOTM for the transcending message of musical art it brings forth. ""From here on it's instinctual..."" applies to this album better than anything I can say. This is a somewhat return to form for Incubus after the pop sensation that was Morning View. Don't get me wrong, Morning View is a very good album indeed, inspired by the big ass house & pretty scenery of course. But nothing like the standards set by albums like Closet Cultivation or Self titled. This new album though almost conveys a sound similar the likes of ""Purple Kool Aid"" or ""Miss Bliss"" which is simply amazing. Brandon's lyrics make this album worth the price alone, songs like ""Agoraphobia"" and ""Beware! Criminal"" are right along up there with some of the best incubus songs conceived, but what else would you expect? Lyrically we've never been let down for simple ""I'm a poet and I don't know it"" lyrics that haunt the air waves and pollute music, Brandon is himself a true poet. Sure this album isn't as crunchy as S.C.I.E.N.C.E. but if you're a real fan, you should have noticed every album is in itself different. Make Yourself has no funk or screaming whatsoever. Morning View is almost a perfect picture of solitude put into sounds (except the mosh worthy ""Under My Umbrella"") so for this album to be something along the lines of a side we've never before is just the way it should be. This album seems to experiment with Brandon's falsetto a little bit more than previous albums and Mike's guitar playing is a little more ""out there"" with his amazing guitar solos and strange robotic/fuzzy distortion. The new bass player is fitting for the band as well. ""He plays the drums!?"" which is what you'd say if you recently saw them on tour. But his funky style gives incubus back it's ""roots"" somewhat and is the perfect addition to this seemingly perfect band. Jose is modestly godlike on the drums as always and DJ Kilmore is all into funky ""robot factory"" sounds in this one which is pretty sweet aside from the space sounds of Make Your Self and S.C.I.E.N.C.E. This DvD is ""Priceless"" to say the least, just for the live performances alone, not to mention Brandon's injury (as portrayed by Jose). All in all any real fan will appreciate this work of art as whole, for it sits atop the shelf with the rest of incubus's stunning and original releases. I'm a death metal head and I can't even deny the talent incubus spews forth with every album. They aren't the poped out ""NU Metal"" or even heavy metal, too crunchy and boundless to be funk.

"People should face the facts: BHS hit their creative peak in the 80s with ""Locust Abortion"" and ""Rembrandt Pussyhorse"". It's a miracle none of them died of a drug overdose or wound up comatose vegetables and you can only run as fast and as hard as they did for so long before you tire out.

But I think that was a product of the chaotic, drug-induced flavor of the band at that time, and the guys are middle-aged now. Leary is mostly producing and the BHS went through years of exhausting lawsuits. You can't expect them to do the carnival-style concerts and Gibbytronix stuff forever. I really don't like techno at all, but I do like this CD a lot. It's got a feel to it. It's far and away better than the wretched ""Electric Larryland"" and feels like it has the BHS stamp on it. The songs have a nice texture. Admittedly, the lyrics are silly in places, but lyrics have never been a BHS strong point. with their early stuff you usually could never even UNDERSTAND the lyrics because Gibby was mumbling them through a megaphone. This is good stuff and it has some real beauty and seems to represent a more mellowed out Surfer period. Some of the stuff is pleasingly weird even though the CD has no real menace to it. But I think the menace came from the Surfers being young and insane. They're not so young anymore.",0,0,0,music

"I've always been a fan of Incognito and its lead singer, Baltimore's own Maysa Leak.  Her solo debut was a fine CD, but her 2000 effort, ""All My Life"" raises the bar even higher.  It's such a shame that she isn't getting more attention, because she's certainly one of the finest soul singers around.  Here, the disc seamlessly blends jazz, r&b, and soulful house, all of which are set to Maysa's sultry voice which exudes an effortless grace.  Those who are familiar with Incognito's work will find plenty to savor here.  From the positive vibe of the opener, ""Got to Be Strong,"" I was hooked.  The album is surprisingly consistent, with no filler tracks or lackluster tunes.  In addition to ""Got to Be Strong,"" my favorites are the jazzed-up ""Mirrors,"" the anti-drinking message of ""The Bottle,"" ""Earth Child,"" and the flat out beautiful title track.  The production has a stern ear for detail, capturing the right balance of sax, percussion, guitars, and bass. There are other soul records that may sell more, but you'll find few that are as exceptionally classy as ""All My Life.""  Grade: A-",0,0,0,music

"I will declare right off that I am a Frank Sinatra fan so I am a little biased about all of his recordings (I don't own Tone Poems conducted by Sinatra, but just about everything else is on my shelves). Many of his recordings are divided by tempo, there's the, ""In The Wee Small Hours"" ballad group and then there's the mid or up tempo recordings like ""Songs for Swingin Lovers"". I love so many of these albums, but this is the one I'd marry, (I've carried the analogy too far). Every song is  a fantastic page from The Great American Songbook (I've Got You Under My Skin, How About You, Pennies From Heaven, I Thought About You), the arrangements are by Riddle and he was never in better form. Love the cover and oh yeah Frank's voice. If you plan on being stranded on that proverbial desert island take your CD player and a copy of ""Songs for Swingin Lovers"" and sunscreen",0,0,0,music

"I've been ""The Beatles""' fan since my early teenage years. After the ""Fab Four"" went their separate ways, I've come from admiring Paul McCartney the most to John Lennon and then, I discovered George Harrison's ""All Things Must Pass"" and he's been the God for me since. The Quiet Beatle, ""the Dark Horse"" with his voice, his lyrics, his melodies, and his distinctive slide guitar style which ""attracts me like no other"" musician - I can't even describe what his guitar does to me. Listening to the favorite songs where George's guitar gently weeps, smiles, meditates, and talks to me personally makes me feel like standing by the ocean during the warm sunny spring day. The vibrating flowing sounds of his chords break down to the thousands golden patches of sunlight that reflect from the water surface and radiate in the air filling it with magic glow. This glow seems to reach my very soul bringing serene joy or bright sorrow.   ""Brainwashed"", sadly George Harrison's posthumous project is an excellent album with all 12 songs warm, sparkling, and melodious, some of them have been among my all time favorites since I bought the CD when it was first released: ""Rising Sun"", ""Marwa Blues"", ""Never Get Over You"", the opening song ""Any Road"", and of course, the one which gave the album its title, ""Brainwashed"". I have not listened to the CD for some time and I have been re-discovering it for the last few days. I can't get enough of it. I keep listening to the songs in my car, on my way to work and back and since it takes me 40-45 minutes of driving one way, I am able to enjoy the favorite songs over and over again. They are the songs about love, about the roads that take you anywhere, the journey of self-discovery, the look at the past and sorrow of losses - everything is in George's last album, his parting gift to us, to me. It is his last smile at the sun that he worshipped and his quiet and dignified acceptance of inevitable end, and knowledge that ""The soul does not love. It is love itself/It does not exist. It is existence/It does not know. It is knowledge itself."" ""Brainwashed"" is one of the best albums of my favorite musician whose guitar will never stop gently talking to me.",0,0,0,music

"Pretty much every thing in the Pavement cannon is worth owning. I remember this album came out and all of my friend's including myself felt like it was a huge disappointment. Well I remember a few weeks later wondering if it was such a disappointment then how come I'm listening to it all the time? I can't recall ever having an album creep up on me and blowing me away like this one did. It turns out all of my friends were on the same page because we spent the entire summer of '94 playing this one. This album is sort of a fractured, eclectic split of pop, avante garde, and rock with tongue in cheek humor.  The songs scream, twist, laugh, cry, and often self destruct. The guitar solo on Rattle By The Rush starts out sounding like Jimmy Page, and ends with the notes coming off in demolished pieces. It's the classic Pavement twist- the catchy pop song with something off putting or silly, but still the juxtaposition comes off brilliantly. I've never heard of a band take so many wild chances and land on their feet as well. The disappointment that really happened the time this album came out was the lack of interest this band got on that joke of a tour Lollapalooza put on by that Schmuck Perry Ferrel",0,0,0,music

"""Homophone"" was originally the name of a record label inaugurated in 1905, its first release being a disc by the Wagnerian tenor Ernest van Dyck. At this time Van Dyck was far past his prime, and Gregor Benko continues this tradition (that of ""singers in decline"") with his new incarnation of the Homophone name.""The Muse Surmounted"", Homophone's first offering, is an uproariously funny excursion into what I would label ""mal canto"". Each singer in this collection set her own substandard for vocal art, and each one is presented in transfers that allow the holes in one's technique to shine through. Brightly.The disc opens with an ""overture"" of sorts, a ""Carmen"" potpourri by the original Homophone Orchestra. If you like your Bizet with slap-tongued baritone saxophones and your Toreadors to boast to a fox-trot beat, this one's for you.Next in line is a certain Rosalina Mello, in a ""fado portugues"" that is rendered in a tone reminiscent of a cat in heat. She also approaches several high A's in this piece with a long-discarded vocal technique known as ""portamentissimo"". Better put Garfield outside before giving Mme. Mello a listen.Next we encounter Alice Gerstl Duschak, a long-time teacher at Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory. Benko's (excellent, I might add) program notes state that she was a teacher of Jessye Norman, and I might add that Gerstl Duschak's voice, as represented here, had no sideways.The name Betty-Jo Schramm was hilarious enough for me - before hearing the track, I could picture her in pigtail and poodle skirt. According to Benko, she was a pioneer in the early-music movement, singing the music a half-tone lower than we normally hear it today. However, she failed to cue the orchestra in on her innovation.Tryphosa Bates-Batcheller, another favorite of the producer, cut her precious few discs at the same Melotone studio where her more famous predecessor, Florence Foster Jenkins, sought to perpetuate her art. And what an art it is. She is represented with a Meyer-Helmund song and an American folk song. Edith Helena at 81 sang better than this.My favorite - at least for now - is Natalia de Andrade, a rather interesting character, who imposes upon the role of Manon a rather distinctive tritone tremolo reminiscent of the dearly departed Mrs. Elva Miller. It takes a life of its own, creating a somewhat minimalist rhythmic shift and will cause you to reach for the tequila. Perhaps she already had.Olive Middleton, beloved diva assoluta of the La Puma Opera Workshop, is represented with her beloved ""Miserere"" from ""Trovatore"" her alleged high C ringing rather clearly through the speakers.A lovely surprise was the discovery of Norma-Jean Erdmann-Chadbourne, who is in fact the ""Jenny Williams"" of the Victor ""Faust Travesty"". If you thought her final trio from Faust (sung as a duet) with her partner ""Thomas Burns"" (actually Ellis Chadbourne, listed here as Thomas Garcia - he had to change his name a lot) was simply the living end of opera finales, just you wait until you hear their Tomb Scene from Aida. A certain Sylvia Sawyer, who evidently actually filled in a few mezzo-soprano roles on some early-fifties opera LPs, offers an Aida excerpt (Amneris) that, although shows no gross lapses of pitch, taste, or intonation, is a precious textbook example of bland mediocrity combined with indifferent attention to the peculiars of Italian pronunciation. One wonders if the Capitol label thought to check the Yellow Pages under ""mezzo-sopranos"" when casting for this Aida album.From the lamented Remington label comes the ""Tosca from Hell"", an infamous performance by Vassilka Petrova.Madame Mari Lyn (although the program notes claim that she was a woman, and a widow to boot, I swear I think this person was a drag queen!) gives her special vocal rendition of ""Una voce poco fa"".  [Later research on the part of this writer revealed that she was, in fact, a she.  Mea culpa.]The most disturbing performance on the disc is a 1980 performance by socialite and trophy-wife Sari Bunchuk Wontner, who gave staged performances of ""Traviata"" in her home - with full casts and orchestra. (One hell of a Tupperware party, don't you think?) Of course, art imitates life, and she was Violetta. Secretly taped from a live performance (presumably by a ""former friend""), this first-act scene defies description. She is often several beats ahead of or behind the orchestra, she may be as much as a third off of the key in either direction, and the whole affair sounds as if she had a flask of Cuervo hidden behind each prop. A year after this performance, she fell overboard from her yacht. Perhaps she was rehearsing for a future Tosca.Surely the best-known name included is that of Florence Foster Jenkins, arguably the most famous of the daffier divas. The track, a Cosme McMoon decomposition entitled ""Valse Caressante"", is not included in the Victor reissue of dear Flofojen's legendary Melotone discs; in fact it is not included in the Jenkins discography in the magazine ""The Record Collector"". This rather long affair seems to find the diva, the pianist, and the flautist all on a bad day, with the result being a performance that is cheaper than a home perm and twice as curly on your hair.The last track is a recording of Jenkins' accompanist, Cosme McMoon, reminiscing about his musical life with our dear Flofojen. Benko also clears the air, after careful research, about the ""Cosme McMoon was actually Edwin McArthur"" rumor. Buy the CD to find the answer.This is also a first-class prodution, with attention to quality in presentation.  The program notes alone are worth the price of the CD. Benko has carefully researched these singers, often waiting years for leads to information. In fact, a picture of Natalia de Andrade arrived after the disc went to press, and it is posted on the Homophone website. Our poor Manon looks for all the world like trailer trash showing up for a Jerry Springer taping.Another picture of interest to many will be the penultimate photo - a picture of Cosme McMoon, radiant in a 70s combover, flanked by ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER at the 1974 Mr. Universe Contest, during the time he had given up his music career and was managing a male bordello.This will be The Party Album of the New Millenium.

"Not many band's greatest cd comes on their debut album, but in System's case it's so obvious to me that this is their most energetic, heavy, and best all-around performance. Most fans believe Toxicity to be their greatest cd, and they have a very good case. That's also an unbelievable cd, but I really believe this self-titled debut album to be the best. S.O.A.D. is easily one of the most unique bands out there. With Daron's creative guitar style and musical inventiveness, and Serj's extraordinary voice, and then Shavo's great bass playing, and John's different drum style, this band was destined for fame. What I love about this cd is that you can tell they had a great time writing and playing the music. Just listen to some of the humorous lyrics and Serj's screechy vocals. Daron doesn't get the credit that should be asserted to him. He is the primary song writer for this band and many times, it's confused with Serj being the main writer.There are no bad songs whatsoever on this cd. Every song has a certain energy to it. Spiders and Sugar are the most well known on here, but my favorites are Darts, Peephole, Suite-Pee, and Know. Serj's angry political chants mix together greatly with Daron's heavy guitar playing. If you've seen the music videos for Spiders or Sugar, they're really weird and different. Check em' out if you haven't yet, they're pretty cool. I think System's first three cds are all worthy of 5 stars. Mezmerize was a 3.5 in my book. And Hypnotize was a 4. I wish they'd go back to the heavy, hard hitting days like the 1-3 cds.Get your self a copy of this cd. It's #1 in System's catalog. They really bring a weird,different, incredibly great sounding cd up to the table. It won't dissapoint. As always, most of the songs are extremely short, but there are 13 of them.

"I am very proud to have the box set.Any country fan, regardless new or classic must have this box set. for several reasons:A.

A clean marketing deal from the record company by releasing the complete Hank recordings. Lucky for us, No greedy marketing scam by releasing the complete set in installments.D. Heck a lot of Hank's songs have been covered over and over again by stars from the 50's all the way to today.

"This is the only Dark Tranquillity album that I own, but from the reviews I have read and the quality of the album it is reasonable to think that Damage Done is the best of Dark Tranquillity.  I really like it a lot.  The vocals are dark and guttural, which can be very cool.  It goes well with the style of the music.  If you like Dark Tranquillity definitely check out In Flames as well",0,0,0,music
"This is actually the first album that I have ever listen to from The Black Crowes. For some reason I never got around to listening to them before and didn't know what they were all about. A friend of mine who's a big fan of theirs lend me this album to listen to and I was blown away. I love every song they sound really good, I am a big fan of classic rock and blues and the Crowes mix these two styles in practically every song on this CD and they do a fantastic job at it. My favorites are ""She Talks To Angels"" (a beautiful ballad and soul stirring) I also love ""Remedy"" this song jams and I love both the lyrics and music on this one. ""Jealous Again"" and ""Hard To Take"" are awesome. ""Thorn On My Pride"" is a great song as well and the lyrics are very nice also. This is a great album overall and I am glad that my friend let me this album to listen to. I now know what I had been missing by not discovering this band at an earlier time when they were in their heyday which was in the 1990's. I'm going to buy this album right now because is a great one and I have to included in my music collection of all time great rock n roll albums of all times. I look forward to seeing The Black Crowes live, I hope they're still touring if they sound in concert as great as they sound on record than they are a really great rock band which as far as I am concern just by listening to this fantastic CD they are indeed",0,0,0,music

"Listening to this CD in the car on the way home from the record store, I found myself cracking up. It was noise to me, pure noise that seemed totally unenjoyable. I sat there for what seemed like hours and when I looked at the CD player only 4 minutes had gone by. However, after listening to it again later that day, my attitude changed.I felt myself getting progressively more in-tune with the attitude of the players. The mess of horns is at first repulsive, then bareable, and as you continue to listen, it becomes just plain awesome. Each horn has a different sound, and the sounds interact and weave together. It's really like listening to a conversation. One horn makes a statement, the others comment on it or interrupt it entirely. The horn reactions are very human, while the basses and drums provide the background (with that beast Scott LeFaro soloing a good deal of the time, if you can hear it over the horns). It really takes a keen ear to hear these things, or repeated listenings. It takes a sense of listening for not melody, but timing and texture. If you're into free jazz its a must. It's definitely its own specific genre... it sure as heck ain't bebop, people. A creative noise masterpiece",0,0,0,music

"Well, first, Randy Newman is unbelievably talented. He is a song writer, a singer, and last but not least at all, a film composer. And what a composer! This multi talent has a family name, which can be a real pain in the ars. But Randy seems not to be bothered by it at all. He wrote some of the most beautiful scores of the 90-s. His music for Pleasantville should have won him an Oscar. But remember The Natural, Toy Story, Awakenings, just to name a few. This really nice compilation and anthology gives Newman the treatment he has long time deserved. I love the title: Guilty: 30 years of Randy Newman. This man does not seem to take himself serious. Yet his art is pretty serious, and he is aware of it very much. Randy Newman is there in the world of music, yet he is not there. You have to listen to this man to get to know him, and once you meet him, you do not want to part from him, he will be a friend of yours forever.Randy Newman is right by the side of the greatest composers, Williams, Goldsmith, Bernstein or his late uncle Alfred Newman.Buy this anthology and get to know this musical giant",0,0,0,music

"This is a great compilation album! It starts off with a remix of &quot;I Will Survive&quot; by Gloria Gaynor. I prefer the original, found on Pure Disco #1. The second track is the KC and the Sunshine Band Hit, &quot;Shake Your Booty&quot;, which I doubt anyone doesn't know at least one line of. Then is one of my favorite disco songs, Vicki Sue Robinson's &quot;Turn the Beat Around&quot;. It is a song with so much going on you almost get lost! After that is &quot;Macho Man&quot; by the Village People, which is definitely not one of my favorites, but some people like it. Next is Sister Sledge's &quot;We Are Family&quot;, which is just a bit repetitious. After that is the famous &quot;What a Feeling&quot; by Irene Cara. It may not technically be disco, but it's a nice inclusion. Next is Andy Gibb's &quot;I Just Want to Be Your Everything&quot;, which I like the beat and melody, but not Andy Gibb's vocals. After that is &quot;Everlasting Love&quot; by Carl Carlton, a quite unappreciated song. Then you'll hear &quot;Can't Get Enough of Your Love&quot;, a Barry White song I'm not too fond of. After that is The Hues Corporation's &quot;Rock the Boat&quot;, which annoys me for some crazy reason. Then you'll get &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; by the Ohio players, the most annoying disco song of all time. The only songs after that worth mentioning are &quot;Upside Down&quot;, a fun song by the Motown/Disco legend Diana Ross. &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot;, one of my favorite ABBA songs, &quot;It's Raining Men&quot;, a song with about 3 other versions floating around, and &quot;Last Dance&quot;, the most energetic disco song I've heard.

First there was Dad (mentor to all of those  talented Marsalis children) and his years of talent both as a pianist, as  well as song-writer(some tracks are original compositions) are apparent  beginning with the very first lick.  Confident that they will love it, I  have given this disc countless times as a gift to folks of all ages and all  musical tastes.  It is always well received by all.

"I stumbled upon this CD after hearing K&D's brilliant ""Sessions"". ""Conversions"" is pure drum and bass. The beats are tight, the bass is deep and warm, all overlayed with beautiful ambient flourishes. The first four tracks are average/pretty good, but they're only a warm-up. The real journey begins when K&D kick it into high-gear with the final 6 tracks. Starting with ""One and Only"" and ending with ""The Lick"", this seamless stretch of drum and bass is excellent and addictive. Drum and bass fans should definitely check out this cd.Also, if for some reason you don't have the K&D Sessions cd, make sure you pick that up as well. It's different than this, less drum and bass and more downtempo-chillout with more variety.",0,0,0,music

"This tricycle is simply way too big.  While the seat position is adjustable, even when adjusted, this thing is simply huge!  I imagine my 2 year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster.  By then, he'll be 5 or 6 and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike, so I just don't get the point of this.  Why in the world would someone build a trike so big?I did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires, and was fairly sturdy (at least in terms of construction).  I suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike, maybe this monster would be OK. I did have a few issues with design and/or build quality though: First, the grips are fairly fragile plastic and I imagine will break after just a tumble or two.  Second, the way the seat ""adjustment"" works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar.  This would be OK, but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar, so I had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place.    Overall, I'm just not very impressed.

"As my family concluded our first annual Thanksgiving game of Quelf, I surveyed the table.  My mother, who turns seventy this year, had a belt tied around her head (to look like a ninja, of course).  My father, seventy-four, had a sock coming out of his shirt collar and his shoelaces were tied together.  My sister, thirty-nine, was wearing a bike helmet (the card had called for anything with a chinstrap), and her pajama sleeves hung loosely by her sides (another card had informed her that she was now ""armless"" - we had to roll the die for her after that).  Who were these people?  I have known them all my life, yet throughout this spirited game I had witnessed surprisingly novel actions: My mother pantomiming that she was wearing flippers and a snorkel while being attacked by a swarm of bees.  My father, a physician, delivering a moving eulogy for his fictitious dog ""Scooter,"" who, according to the instructions on the card, had an affinity for coleslaw and delighted in playing with large land mammals.  Never had I seen my sister slap herself on the face, turn to me and yell ""you must not defy the king!""  The four of us agreed that we have never laughed so hard, or so consistently, as we had during that hour of play.  I admit, I was skeptical before purchase.  After reading some of the reviews and viewing pictures of the box online, it had first seemed as if Quelf was some sort of wacky game that needs a certain setting, mood, or substance related enhancement in order to be fully appreciated.  This is not the case.  There are elements of the game, such as the trivia and category parts, that help Quelf to maintain its flow and keep the players grounded in authentic board-game style competition...This game sucks you in and then absolutely hammers you with random acts of creativity and humor.  Player age, gender, and personality are non-factors.

"We purchased this dollhouse for our three year old daugther last July when she turned three.  Fortunately, at the time, I went a bit crazy with ordering the furniture and bought almost all of the furniture sets that were made to activate the Sweet Sounds dollhouse.  I just recently discovered, however, that you cannot buy the Loving Family furniture that was made for the dollhouse in the department/toy stores. Instead, you have to buy it for three to five times the original price from an individual on eBay (i.e., $54 and up for one set which originally cost $12).  If you do decide to buy this dollhouse, the furniture that you actually need to activate some of the 200 phrases must contain an item called a ""BONUS FEATURE"".  The BONUS FEATURE are furniture sets that come with a certain furniture item (i.e., wrapped gifts and balloons, parrot, blue television, tea set, blue teddy bear) that has a PINK or BLUE ribbon attached.  Those items will activate the dollhouse sounds.  Yes, you can still buy doll furniture from Fisher Price for the Twin Times Fisher Price Dollhouse that are on the same size scale as the Sweet Sounds dollhouse, but that furniture will not activate the dollhouse's supposed 200 phrases.Personally, I think it is an atrocity that Fisher Price continues to sell this dollhouse with the marketing claim that it has over 200 phrases.  A majority of those so-called phrases are activated by the extra dollhouse furniture that you USED to be able to purchase.  Hence, the claim that Fisher Price (aka Mattel) makes that the dollhouse has over 200 phrases is misleading and false advertising because the dollhouse only comes with a few pieces to activate the dollhouse sounds (i.e., adult female, adult male, child female, cat, and tape recorder).  That's it!  Someone else put together a list of all the sets you used to be able to purchase so you can see what I'm talking about here (although the representative picture of the displayed furniture on the left is not always the same item as the boxed picture on the right -- the boxed picture on the right shows the correct furniture to activate the dollhouse).  Please see:  http://mydreamdollhouse.com/FPdollhouse_sweet_sounds.htmlObviously, Fisher Price and/or Mattel believe that as parents we are stupid and that we don't pay attention to details. They have incorrectly assumed that we will not recognize that although they sell the Sweet Sounds dollhouse (probably because they have a lot left to deplete in their inventory), they don't sell the corresponding furniture to activate the house.  Why then spend the extra $20 pay for the electronic dollhouse sounds when you can purchase the Fisher Price Twin Times dollhouse for much less?Although I already own almost all of the Sweet Sounds dollhouse furniture sets, I have now developed a great disdain for the unscrupulous business dealings of the manufacturer who no longer supply the corresponding furniture for this Sweet Sounds dollhouse.Lastly, today I contacted a supervisor within Mattel's customer service (1-800-432-5437).  Although she was very nice, I could hardly believe that their computer datebase does not reflect that the corresponding activating furniture has been discontinued.  She was totally unaware that people across the globe cannot purchase it anywhere but on eBay at a ridiculous prices.  I did not realize when I spoke to her that there was this message board with so many complaints in this regard, however, I pointed out to her that I have been unable to find the furniture sets (with the ""BONUS FEATURE"") in any in the stores and that everyone on eBay is bidding them up three to five times the original price (I think that was fairly convincing to her).  Dare I say that the omittance of the word ""DISCONTINUED"" in Mattel's database was completely purposeful because they don't want their customer service representatives telling the consumers that you we can no longer get the activating furniture because they want you to buy up the inventory of remaining dollhouses!  I'm sorry, Fisher Price, but not all parents are quite as dumb as you think they are.For a mother with two toddler girls ages 2 and 3, I am going to boycott Fisher-Price altogether because I think this is unscrupulously deceptive marketing on their part.  I cannot return all of the unopened furniture sets and the Sweet Sounds dollhouse, but I certainly will continue to raise an awareness via the Internet.Final word:  If you don't care whether or not the dollhouse makes sounds and talks, then go ahead and spend the extra money, although the feature is otherwise useless.  In truth, you're wasting your money because you can buy another dollhouse that doesn't have electronic sounds for considerably less money.Signed,MAD AS HECK AT MATTEL IN SUNNYVALE, CALIFORNI",1,0,0,toys_&_games

Two of the good knights make an appearance here (blue and purple), and we also get Vladek, a dark soldier, and a skeleton.  The minifigs are as charismatic as ever, each sporting his own unique expression.  Vladek and his henchman have that cute ""I'm evil"" Lego frown.  Our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories.  Swords and shields, and a black hatchet for the henchman.The scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster.  The creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and Technic parts, and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers.  The blue knight is accompanied by his horse, who has a cute mini-catapult strapped to his side.The scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle, which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered.  High atop the tower is a mini-catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it.  The rest of the castle is just walls, floors, and a staircase.  This castle is very fragile.  Mine fell apart several times while I was working on building it.  On the whole, the design just isn't all that great.  Handle with care, and play with care.  Colors are mostly black, dark gray, dark red, and brown.  This set has one of those nice walls with the barred window, and some signature Knights Kingdom battlement pieces.This set works as an addition to Vladek's Dark Fortress.  On its own, it's stunningly less impressive.  The good news is that a savvy Lego Maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them.My verdict:  one thumb up for the scorpion monster (who can be added to your other Knights Kingdom adventures), one thumb down for the rest.  Could've been better.  My advice is to get Vladek's Dark Fortress.  It's more than worth the price of admission.  For those still hungering for more Knights Kingdom action after Vladek's fortress has been built and conquered, this set is better than nothing",1,0,0,toys_&_games

"Based upon a foreign film that translates into English as OPEN YOUR EYES (ABRE LOS OJOS), VANILLA SKY gets its title from a Claude Monet painting, ""Seine at Argenteuil"" that the film's protagonist, David Aames (Tom Cruise) has upon a wall.  The painting is sometimes mistakenly referred to as ""Vanilla Sky"" because of the color that Monet used for the sky in the painting.  The misnomer of the painting's title is a key in understanding and appreciating the film because early on it becomes clear that this is a movie that likes to play with one's mind and the things that take place aren't necessarily real.VANILLA SKY revolves around the character of David Aames.  David is the son and heir of a international media tycoon.  Most everyone close to him, including his best friend Brain Shelby (Jason Lee) see David as a spoiled brat who has no appreciation whatsoever for all the gifts that have been given to him since birth.  He takes advantage of almost everyone he meets and lives in a fantasy world of wine, women, and song.  At the start of the film David is involved in a serious relationship with a beautiful blonde named Julie Gianni (Cameron Diaz).  They have been dating for sometime and are romantically linked, but David doesn't feel their relationship is as serious as Julie does.  Whereas Julie is waiting for David to commit and propose, David sees her as simply being a ""friend with benefits.""At his birthday party, David meets a woman that he finds so captivating and fascinating that he falls immediately in love with her.  The woman, Sophia Serrano (Penelope Cruz) is the opposite of everything that he found attractive in Julie.  David ends up walking her back to her place and spends the night talking with her.  To him, Sophia is the woman of his dreams.  She is the woman he would choose to marry.  Unfortunately for David, Julie doesn't take things very well.  She reminds him of some of the unavoidable truths about their relationship.  Julie and David are involved in a car crash and when he opens his eyes, he is living in a different world.His face has been reconstructed and at first things seem normal.  But then David starts having nightmares.  Soon the nightmares of his dreams seem to mix with his day to day life.  He finds himself unable to distinguish the difference.  Sophia is Julie and Julie is Sophia.  The world is too confusing and David longs to sleep so that he can return to his dreams.  Pleasant, pleasant dreams filled with the Sophia he met at the party and skies colored in vanilla.I really don't like Tom Cruise much.  He does have talent, but his large ego and cocky attitude take away from every picture I've ever seen him act in.  Therefore, I was reluctant to see VANILLA SKY.  I wish I would have watched the movie long ago.The movie is a strange romantic drama sci-fi picture that tackles some huge issues.  How do we live our lives?  Would you rather live your life in a comfortable existence filled with superficial happiness or would you rather live an exciting, though often painful life filled with wonder and awe, truth and beauty, but only occasional moments of happiness?  This is a decision that each one of us is actually presented with daily. We might not always recognize it as such, but it is and the way that choice is presented in the film makes VANILLA SKY such a powerful and engaging piece of cinema.Cruise's ego works well for most of the film, though it denies the audience from completely identifying and empathizing with the plight of David Aames.  Cruise is a great jerk, but not a very good reformed man.  However, his gift at playing spoiled id-driven men sucks the audience into the action of VANILLA SKY from the beginning and even though one is never convinced of David's reformation, Cruise's performance/presence keeps the audience engaged throughout the film.  Penelope Cruz reminds me of a Spanish Audrey Hepburn and though she isn't in the movie a great deal, she shines in the moments that she is.  Cameron Diaz is a beauty and movie star, but overcomes her celebrity. She does a wonderful job of portraying Julie, an everywoman character that many women who have been stepped upon by men can relate to.  Julie isn't on screen very long either, but when she is she raises some important questions about love, relationships, and sex in American society.  Another important actor in the film is Jason Lee.  Lee portrays David's best friend Brian, who is busy writing a novel.  Brian is the catalyst for many of the film's deeper thought-provoking moments.  It is also Brian who just might hold the key to the real meaning of the film.  Like Cruise, sometimes having Lee in a picture is a turnoff, however in VANILLA SKY he is perfectly cast.VANILLA SKY isn't the easiest film to understand.  It isn't necessarily the most romantic film and though it's an intelligent movie, it asks more questions than it answers.  It also has an open ending, so people who have to have a movie end all tidy will have problems with the film's ending.  Nevertheless, the film is a beautiful piece of cinema that engages and entertains.  A person cannot watch it without and not have something to think about later.  That's something only really good movies can do",0,0,0,video
"This movie is a complete gem, and I don't know what exactly the critics that panned it (I've even read that the closing theme voiced by Lauper was a flop) were thinking.  Granted, it is probably funnier if you've had any sort of involvement with psychic phenomena or got swept up in any sort of New Age spirituality, but even if you don't get the ""psychic"" humor, the script is great, the comedic timing is impeccable, and the cast is completely delightful.  (For example, psychic Lauper letting her spirit guide work through her tells one of the bad guys, ""Your [dead] mother wants you to let us go, Ingo.""  Immediately, Falk adds, ""And she wants you to give us all your money.""  This was one of my all-time favorite Peter Falk vehicles, and I thought Lauper was charming and had great on-screen chemistry with Goldblum.  Really, what was not to like here",0,0,0,video
"Enough can not be said about these wonderful videos!  Not only do we own EVERY Disney Sing Along cartoon video, we own the Holiday ones and the Character ones as well (Campout etc..).  Nothing entertains my 5 yo. and 1 1/2 yo. like these tapes do.  The music is good for them, the word recognition is good for them, they are familiar with many characters now (which makes going to the park WAY MORE FUN! - they dont have to have watched every movie to know most characters). Great for little ones with short attention spans since it changes characters with each song and the music keeps them hopping! I feel no guilt at all letting them watch alone while I cook or unload the dishwasher as I gaze over at my two happy, singing, dancing girls!  Best baby sitter in the UNIVERSE!  I also think it will help them when they are older and start to read - They have been a staple to our VHS collection since my eldest was a toddler! WELL WORTH THE MONEY",0,0,0,video
"Elf is one of our favorite family Christmas movies.  We purchased this particular edition for the karaoke, coloring pages, games, and activities that were offered.  I really didn't think my kids would be very interested in the games, but to my surprise they loved them.  Even now after Christmas, we find ourselves using lines from the movie.  Maybe it's a little corny, but it always brings a smile!I recommend this edition to anyone who just can't get enough of Buddy the Elf",0,0,0,video
"Young Cameron possesses some crafty telekinetic powers and inadvertantly unleashes a nasty Mayan demon...A great horror film done in a sitcomish/tvmovieoftheweekish style with a healthy heaping of late 80s style will be sure to please horror fans, and Scott Curtis enthusiasts. Never really scary, but somewhat eerie. Good sound sequences. Interesing images. Cameron is cinematic copecetic",0,0,0,video

"This is the most definative presentation of all the Kennedy Assasination materials availble for review. By far the most factual. When all eyewitnesses are interviewed and all the Doctors at Parkland and all the eyewitnesses at the autopsy are heard, there leaves little doubt to the conclusion. There's no fluff just fact. I own all other presentations and the Peter Jennings presentation is on the other end of this spectrum. The 3D animation is so ridicolous and unaccurate relative to the Zappruder Film I can't believe it and neither should you. A cartoon which never accounts for the 3rd bullet hitting the President in the back as shown on Zappruder Film and no interviews with the Parkland Doctors or Bethesda Staff of x-ray teams who say "" That's not the x-rays we took."" What kind of reporting is that. John Kennedy has been dead a long,long time now and the events that occured the day he died are more than just a compelling story. It's hard, or mabey not so hard, to believe that a grand conspiricy took place because Kennedy had an agenda that did not set well with many people from many powerful places inside and outside government. The mission was accomplished. It dosn't matter who did it but it does matter that more than 1 person did. Although the Congressional Panel concluded that as fact, that's as far and as much as we will ever get. If you want to know what happened and get on with your life, JFK: The Case for Conspiracy, is the only choice if you just want the facts and hear the real eyewitnessees tell the story.",0,0,0,video
this si without a doubt the most moving of all the disney princess movies I've seen. The ending of this movie had me in tears. When i first saw this movie i though the beast really had died and it was too late for him and then it turned out that belle's love for the beast brought him back to life and broke the evil spell that was cast on him by the enchantress. the ending couldn't have been more perfect. I'm so glad to own the dvd. The picure and sound quality is perfect. I now have the entire princess collection on dvd. Thanks amazon for carrying these out of print titles,0,0,0,video
"I don't often watch foreign films.  The reason being, as an American, I don't feel that I can ever fully grasp the cultural and linguistic subtleties needed to truly understand and enjoy these works.  French....  Spanish....  German...  etc.... regardless of nationality, genre, or time period, they generally leave me cold.   With that in mind, I went into this with no doubts as to the film's greatness, but again, didn't think as an American I would be able to see it, as the situational nuances would be lost on me.   As it turned out, I was wrong, and found a sublime masterpiece that went down easily, and didn't seem obtuse or ""foreign"".   The experience could best be likened to watching ""The Graduate"", as you find yourself viewing seemingly mundane events and conversations, but the subtle turns in those events and words speak of such depth and gravity that you feel almost driven to your knees by the masterwork that you are watching. I won't recap the storyline, or discuss details of the movie itself, I just wanted to say that I went into this skeptical, expecting to find a picture that I couldn't relate to, but what I found was an immediate, compelling and moving work that speaks volumes of the human condition.",0,0,0,video

"This movie is a movie about contrasts, with a stunning compilation of varying colorful scenes.First, the theme of the movie is about polar contrasting ideals, a local culture that revels in masculine ideals and romantic escapades with woman who idolize and treasure attention from men.  This is contrasted with the isolated, withdrawn culture of the nunery.  Second, the colors and lighting of the scenes correspond to the contrasting cultures of the film, the scenes taking place outside the nunery are full of color and sunshine, while inside the colors are drab and plain.  Ultimately the contrast has an effect on all characters of the film those on the oustide, the general and local Brit respect the determination and innocence of the nunery and the sisters begin to feel a longing for the romance and excitement of the outside. This film will sincerely impress you with its images, as well as is powerful, yet unspoken, themes of romance and sexual desire.  I never thought a nun could look so sexy, just wait until the one Sister changes her appearance towards the end",0,0,0,video
"I watched this movie not knowing all that much about about the whole Mothman phenomenon, so fortunately wasn't in a position to have my expectations dashed.  I guess that's the thing about movies based on real or alleged events, and there's not much that can be done about it if you've already read up on the whole incident.  The movie should be taken for what it is, a good, spine chilling paranormal thriller.  The Special edition includes a 50 minute documentary on the 1960s Mothman sightings on which the movie is based.  Very interesting in its own right",0,0,0,video

"For years we waited for it, and it finally ahppened, as Batman and Superman teamed up to thwart their greatest foes, The Joker and Lex Luthor. Gloriously animated and presented like it was a real movie rather than a cartoon, ""The Batman Superman Movie"" ranks with ""Batman: Mask Of The Phantasm"" and ""Batman & Mr. Freeze: Subzero"" as the ultimate animated adaptions of the Dark Knight and the Man Of Steel.The Joker (voiced by the great Markk Hammil) and his accomplice Harley Quinn (Arleen Sorkin) have robbed a pricless artifact from an antiquie shop in Gotham. Batman (Kevin Conroy) seems to be one step ahead of them, and his alter ego Bruce Wayne heads out to Metropolis, home of Superman (Tim Daly). Meanwhile, Joker has teamed up with wealthy industrialist Lex Luthor (Clancy Brown), offering to kill Superman for $ 1 billion dollars. To complicate things, Bruce Wayne has fallen for Lois Lane (Dana Delany), enraging Clark Kent, who is determined to find out who Batman is. The two learn each other's secret identities, and realize they must team up to stop The Joker and Lex from destroying Metropolis.This is an excellent animated films that I'd recommend to all comic book fans. It is affordable and comes with extras",0,0,0,video
"This paint-by-numbers New Zealand film is a rote Coming-of-Age / Adultery flick in which a family living by the seaside is put in moral jeopardy by a handsome stranger. Throughout the film, I kept asking myself how the parents in this nuclear unit could spend so much time at their dream house without working a steady job. Instead, it appears that everyone involved has far too much time on their hands and found that drinking themselves into oblivion will only do so much to ease the boredom.Yes, Mom (Sarah Perise) has a booze problem and the hots for the boat-bound stranger (Marton Csokas). Meanwhile, Dad (Alistair Browning) sits cuckolded in the back yard sipping hard liquor. Their two kids (Alicia Fulford-Wierzbicki and Aaron Murphy) don't have healthy hobbies either; spending their time cutting private parts out of porn magazines and taping them to their bodies. I suppose there is a lot of ""higher meaning"" going on between these ""adult parts"" and the lemon tree that grows in their back yard. However, I really wasn't inclined to dig deep in this overly glossy film whose plot and ending were visible from the onset.Director Jeffs muddies her water with an overabundance of slow motion shots, drawing out the tedium of RAIN. Instead of treading new ground, the film provides the audience with trite morality and one-dimensional characters",1,0,0,video
