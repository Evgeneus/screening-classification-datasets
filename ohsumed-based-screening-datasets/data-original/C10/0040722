A comparison between iotrolan, a non-ionic dimer, and a hyperosmolar contrast medium, Urografin, in hysterosalpingography.
 For hysterosalpingography, there were no significant differences between the non-ionic dimeric contrast medium iotrolan (300 mgI/%) and Urografin (370 mgI/%) with regard to ease of application or radiographic quality, and both agents were equally suitable.
 There were no significant differences between two groups of patients with regard to pain due to instrumentation, pain at the time of injection and pain up to 2 h after the procedure.
 There was a significant difference (p = 0.04) between the two groups with respect to delayed pain, when iotrolan was associated with a lower incidence and decreased severity of delayed pain.
 There were no differences in the incidence of nausea, vomiting, headache and syncope.
 No allergic phenomena were seen in either group.
