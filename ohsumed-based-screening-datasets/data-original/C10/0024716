Bacterial meningitis following spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.
 We report a case of meningitis caused by inadvertent introduction of bacteria following spinal anaesthesia for Caesarean section.
 The technique of performing the spinal anaesthesia is reviewed.
 Meningitis may occur, although very rarely, despite meticulous aseptic techniques.
 It is vital that meningitis should be considered in the differential diagnoses of post-spinal headache when patients present with headaches, pyrexia and meningism in the postoperative or postpartum period.
