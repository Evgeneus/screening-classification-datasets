Protective effect of electrical stimulation in the deafened guinea pig cochlea.
 The effect of chronic intrascalar electrical stimulation on the spiral ganglion cell survival of the ototoxically deafened guinea pig was investigated.
 Immediately after ototoxic drug administration, unilateral sinusoidal (1 kHz) charge-balanced electrical stimulation on a 50% duty cycle was administered for 2 hours per day, 5 days per week, at intensities from 0 (control) to 400 microAmp via an implanted scala tympani electrode.
 The relationship of electrically evoked middle latency response (EMLR) to stimulation protocol and cell survival was studied.
 At 9 weeks post-drug treatment, the animals were killed and temporal bones were prepared for morphometric analysis of spiral ganglion cell density.
 The subjects showed essentially complete elimination of outer hair sensory cells, with minimal remaining inner hair cells confined to apical turns.
 Variable loss of spiral ganglion cell populations was observed, which related to electrical stimulation.
 In animals that received daily unilaterally electrical stimulation, statistically significant increases in survival of spiral ganglion cells were observed in the stimulated ear, compared to the nonstimulated ear-particularly in basal cochlear regions near the electrode.
 Spiral ganglion cell density was a function of stimulation current intensity level.
 Moreover, the slope of the amplitude input/output (I/O) function of the EMLR was found to be dependent on stimulating current level.
 The effect of stimulation on induced survival may be dependent on a number of mechanisms, including metabolic effects of direct activation of "deafferented" spiral ganglion cells.
 These data support the suggestion that implantation may provide optimal benefits when performed shortly after deafness.
