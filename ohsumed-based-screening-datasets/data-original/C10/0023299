Efficacy and complications of radiotherapy of anterior visual pathway tumors.
 A progressive disturbance in visual acuity or visual field, along with an unexplained optic nerve atrophy, suggests the possibility of a tumor.
 Tumors that frequently affect the anterior visual pathway include primary optic nerve sheath meningiomas, intracranial meningiomas, optic gliomas, pituitary tumors, and craniopharyngiomas.
 The location of these tumors sometimes prohibits a complete surgical excision that might jeopardize the visual system.
 Radiation therapy, however, can be beneficial in these cases.
 This article reviews the indications for radiotherapy of tumors that involve the anterior visual pathway, along with the possible complications.
 Cases that present the effect of radiation therapy and radiation damage are presented.
