Evolution of technetium-99m-HMPAO SPECT and brain mapping in a patient presenting with echolalia and palilalia.
 A 78-yr-old woman presented with transient echolalia and palilalia.
 She had suffered from Parkinson's disease for 2 yr.
 Routine laboratory examination showed hypotonic hyponatremia, but was otherwise unremarkable.
 Brain mapping revealed a bifrontal delta focus, more pronounced on the right.
 Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain with technetium-99m labeled d,l hexamethylpropylene-amine oxime (99mTc-HMPAO), performed during the acute episode showed relative frontoparietal hypoactivity.
 Brain mapping performed after disappearance of the echolalia and palilalia, which persisted only for 1 day, was normal.
 By contrast, SPECT findings persisted for more than 3 wk.
 Features of particular interest in the presented patient are the extensive defects seen on brain SPECT despite the absence of morphologic lesions, the congruent electrophysiologic changes and their temporal relationship with the clinical evolution.
