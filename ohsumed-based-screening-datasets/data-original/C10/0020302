CV 205-502--effectiveness, tolerability, and safety over 24-month study.
 Twenty hyperprolactinemic women (median prolactin [PRL] 2,989 mU/L, range 1,149 to 11,910 mU/L), previously unsuccessfully treated with bromocriptine, were treated in a prospective study, for 3 to 24 months with the new, nonergot, long-acting, dopamine agonist, CV 205-502.
 Treatment resulted in normalization of PRL in 14 patients, in one daily dose of 0.075 to 0.150 mg of the drug.
 Three patients were treated in doses above 0.150 mg up to 0.300 mg, but PRL was not normalized during the study.
 Menstrual function was restored in 15 of 18 amenorrheic patients.
 Galactorrhea, present in 7 patients, disappeared in 5.
 Four patients became pregnant and gave birth to healthy children.
 In conclusion, we found CV 205-502 effective in one daily dose, with good tolerability; it is safe and provides a valuable alternative to the dopamine agonist drugs in use today.
