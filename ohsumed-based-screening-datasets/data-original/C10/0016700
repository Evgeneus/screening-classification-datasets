Visual recovery in patients with optic neuritis and visual loss to no light perception.
 We reviewed the records of 151 patients with optic neuritis examined over an eight-year period.
 Of these patients, 12 developed visual acuity of no light perception during the first episode of optic neuritis in the affected eye.
 Eight of the 12 patients recovered visual acuity of 20/40 or better.
 Of these, five patients had visual acuity of 20/20 or better, one had visual acuity of 20/25, one had visual acuity of 20/30, and one had visual acuity of 20/40.
 Four of the 12 patients recovered peripheral visual fields but had dense central scotomas and visual acuity of less than 20/400.
 Dyschromatopsia persisted after visual recovery in 11 of 12 patients.
