Intracranial vascular abnormalities: value of MR phase imaging to distinguish thrombus from flowing blood.
 The interpretation of conventional spin-echo and gradient-echo MR images of intracranial vascular lesions can be complex and ambiguous owing to variable effects on image intensity caused by flowing blood or thrombus.
 MR phase images, obtained simultaneously with conventional-magnitude images, are useful for evaluating proton motion (i.e., blood flow), and therefore can simplify the diagnosis of the presence or absence of thrombosis within a vascular structure or lesion.
 Fourteen patients with a variety of intracranial vascular abnormalities (aneurysms, superior sagittal sinus thrombosis, neoplasms adjacent to venous sinuses, and vascular malformations) were evaluated with conventional MR and phase imaging for the presence of blood flow.
 The phase images correlated with angiography in all cases.
 Phase imaging was not necessarily better than conventional spin-echo imaging in all cases, but it simplified the evaluation of thrombus vs blood flow in many.
 In three of five aneurysms, the phase images were diagnostic for evaluating lumen patency whereas the conventional images were ambiguous.
 Phase imaging was advantageous for detecting tumor invasion of the venous sinus when venous blood was enhanced by gadopentetate dimeglumine.
 A laminar flow phantom experiment determined the lower limits of sensitivity of phase imaging to be 0.5 cm/sec in the slice-select and 2.5 cm/sec in the read gradient directions.
 Phase imaging is a simple, reliable technique that can distinguish thrombosis from flowing blood within intracranial lesions.
 It is easily performed and adds no additional time to the MR examination.
