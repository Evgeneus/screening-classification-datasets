A case of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and positive antiglutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies.
 A 50 year old woman developed progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity over a three year period.
 Her CSF contained oligoclonal bands and both her serum and CSF contained antibodies directed against GABA-ergic synapses (antiglutamic acid dehydrogenase antibodies).
 These antibodies have recently been described in cases of stiff man syndrome.
 Both disorders may be part of a clinical spectrum that has an underlying autoimmune basis.
