Uncommon neurologic complications of burns in infants: a parkinsonian extrapyramidal disorder and massive cerebral infarction.
 We report uncommon neurologic complications of moderate to severe burns in two infants aged 13 and 19 months, respectively.
 The first patient suffered a 25% total body surface area burn to her lower limbs; 3 days later she became mute and irritable, with increasing rigidity of limbs and trunk.
 Her face was expressionless and she also had mild dysphagea.
 Muscle-stretch reflexes were brisk and accompanied by episodes of coarse jitteriness.
 A diagnosis of an extrapyramidal parkinsonian disorder was made.
 The infant was treated with amantadine hydrochloride, and she recovered completely over a period of 2 months.
 The second infant was admitted with an extensive burn to his trunk and limbs; 3 days later he became comatose and had intractable seizures, which were more prominent over his right side.
 Dysphasia and right-sided hemiplegia became apparent; these conditions were and remained permanent, accompanied by focal seizures and a marked cognitive delay.
 Although relatively uncommon, central nervous system involvement may be a hazardous complication of burns in infants, who thus represent a high-risk group.
