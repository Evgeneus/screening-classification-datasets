Developing anxiety-reduction procedures for a ventilator-dependent pediatric patient.
 This study evaluated two strategies to reduce anxiety behaviors which interfered with the daily tracheostomy care and ventilator maintenance of an eight-year-old ventilator-dependent boy.
 A multiple-baseline design (across ventilator and tracheostomy procedures) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of an information-only procedure and combined relaxation and cognitive distraction procedures.
 Partial-interval recording was used to measure heart rate, disruptive mouth noises, and demands and complaints to staff members.
 The patient's behavior did not change during a no-intervention baseline or during the information-only condition.
 Cognitive distraction and relaxation procedures were introduced, first during ventilator checks and then during tracheostomy care; corresponding decreases in heart rate, mouth noises, and demands and complaints were noted.
 Gains were maintained at one year follow-up.
 Results suggest that information alone may not effectively reduce anxiety behaviors for some ventilator-dependent patients unless additional anxiety-reduction procedures are implemented.
