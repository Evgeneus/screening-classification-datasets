Cytomegalovirus infection in Gambian mothers and their babies.
 A 15 month longitudinal study of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in 178 Gambian mothers and their babies was undertaken.
 Twenty five (14%) of the babies were congenitally infected despite the fact that 87% of their mothers were antibody positive to the virus.
 Two of the 25 congenitally infected infants had evidence of severe neurological damage; skin sepsis was also a prominent feature in congenitally infected infants.
 The other children soon became infected.
 At 6 months of age, 53% of the infants were shedding virus either in urine or saliva.
 By the age of 12 months 86% of the infants had serological evidence of CMV infection.
 Preliminary evidence suggests that sibling to sibling infection in crowded compounds might be a major route of transmission.
