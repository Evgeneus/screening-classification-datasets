Acoustic neuroma: a cost-effective approach.
 A cost-effective approach to the diagnosis and treatment of acoustic neuromas continues to evolve as diagnostic methods improve.
 In the past 7 months, since gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become available in our practice, our screening and presurgical workup has changed.
 The purpose of this article is to outline the current philosophy of the senior authors in relation to acoustic neuroma management on the basis of 72 patients diagnosed from July 1988 to February 1989.
 With more sensitive diagnostic means, older less sensitive studies may be eliminated from the routine workup, thus maintaining cost-effectiveness while preserving the highest standard of patient care.
 The body of this article will review our current use of the many available diagnostic options and emphasize a cost-effective approach.
