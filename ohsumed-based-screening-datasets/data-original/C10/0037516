The value of bupivicaine hip injection in the differentiation of coxarthrosis from lower extremity neuropathy.
 A series of 18 consecutive patients with roentgenographically proven osteoarthrosis (osteoarthritis, OA) of the hip and spine were evaluated because of concomitant lower extremity pain below the knee.
 To determine whether the leg symptoms were coxalgic or neuropathic, intraarticular hip bupivicaine was injected as a provocative test.
 This test allowed correct identification of the source of the pain with a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 100%, and an efficiency of 88%.
 This office test also provides significant savings in terms of diagnostic tests and patient discomfort.
