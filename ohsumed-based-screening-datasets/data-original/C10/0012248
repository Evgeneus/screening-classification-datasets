Differential reading recovery in patients with severe to moderate closed head injury.
 A differential recovery was seen when alternate forms of a nationally standardized test of Reading Vocabulary, Literal Reading Comprehension and Inferential Reading Comprehension was administered serially to 10 consecutive closed head injury admissions to a university rehabilitation hospital.
 Inferential Reading Comprehension was the most impaired and had the fastest recovery rate.
 Subtle cognitive deficits in Inferential Reading Comprehension were detected when Reading Vocabulary was at or better than a twelfth grade level.
 Maximal recovery of all three reading functions occurred within 4 months after trauma, with most occurring in the first 3 months.
 The reading recovery pattern parallels the recovery of intelligence scores in the literature.
