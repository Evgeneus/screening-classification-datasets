Liver failure occurring as a component of exertional heatstroke.
 An unusual case of an exertional heatstroke in a healthy 25-year-old man is presented.
 Initially, the patient was deeply comatose and developed severe rhabdomyolysis and massive hepatic necrosis.
 Subsequently, he received a liver transplant with remarkable improvement in his mental status, although the rhabdomyolysis continued.
 The patient died 41 days after the transplant due to a complicating infection.
 Providing that infections can be effectively controlled, liver transplants might be a promising therapeutic alternative for the few patients who survive the initial neurological consequences of this unusual event.
