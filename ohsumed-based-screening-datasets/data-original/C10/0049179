Haemodynamic changes during the apnoea test for diagnosis of brain death.
 Haemodynamic responses to the apnoea test for the diagnosis of brain death were investigated in nine patients with severe head injury or cerebrovascular disease.
 To prove apnoea, the ventilator was disconnected for ten minutes and oxygen was insufflated to avoid hypoxaemia.
 No respiratory movement was seen in any patient.
 Ten minutes after disconnecting the ventilator, PaCO2 was increased to 78 +/- 3 mmHg and pH was reduced to 7.17 +/- 0.02.
 Adequate oxygenation was maintained in all patients.
 Cardiac output increased from 4.8 +/- 0.7 to 5.7 +/- 0.8 L.min-1 (P less than 0.05), and mean pulmonary artery pressure increased from 11 +/- 1 to 17 +/- 2 mmHg (P less than 0.01).
 However, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, pulmonary artery wedge pressure and right atrial pressure did not change.
 Plasma catecholamines were measured in three patients.
 Plasma norepinephrine concentrations increased in all three patients but the changes in plasma epinephrine were minimal.
 These circulatory responses to acute hypercapnia were less than those reported in awake volunteers and in patients during general anaesthesia.
 However, since plasma norepinephrine concentration increased during the test, some sympathoadrenal response, probably of spinal origin, was present, and may have prevented the direct depressant circulatory effects of acute hypercapnia.
 In conclusion, the apnoea test did not produce haemodynamic disturbances when respiratory acidosis was limited to a pH 7.17 +/- 0.02 and PaCO2 60-80 mmHg.
