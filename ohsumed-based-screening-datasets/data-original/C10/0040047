The present status of akathisia.
 Akathisia is a common and distressing side effect of antipsychotic and some other psychotropic medications.
 This paper reviews the current state of knowledge of its clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment.
 Restless legs syndrome and akathisia associated with Parkinson's disease are discussed in so far as they help understand drug-induced akathisia.
 The complexity of the disorder, and the difficulty in characterizing and quantifying it, may explain why researchers have relatively neglected akathisia for so long.
 The recent upsurge of research interest promises the hope of a better understanding of its pathophysiology so that effective therapy may result.
