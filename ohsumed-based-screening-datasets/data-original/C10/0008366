Sensorineural hearing loss: a reversible effect of valproic acid.
 We report 2 patients over the age of 70 who, while on valproate (VPA) for complex partial seizures, developed sensorineural hearing loss.
 Following discontinuation of VPA for nonaudiologic reasons, the patients reported improved hearing which was confirmed by audiometry.
 These findings represent VPA-induced sensorineural hearing loss, possibly in preexisting presbycusis.
