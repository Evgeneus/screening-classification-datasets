The relationship of cocaine to headache in polysubstance abusers.
 In a questionnaire survey of inpatient polysubstance abusers it was found that cocaine relieved migraine-type headaches much more often in chronic headache sufferers than in those with only occasional headaches (p less than .05).
 However, cocaine could also bring on headaches after several hours, both in chronic headache sufferers and in those not subject to headaches.
 The facts that cocaine may relieve headache immediately, and also may precipitate headaches several hours after use, suggests that the well-known vasoconstrictive actions of cocaine may be responsible.
 Migraineurs seem more susceptible to some of these effects of cocaine than are people without chronic headaches.
