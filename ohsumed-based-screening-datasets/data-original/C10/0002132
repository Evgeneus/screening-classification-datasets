Cavernous-carotid thrombosis and ocular motor paresis 
 A 64-year-old man presented with the acute onset of unilateral blindness and ipsilateral ocular motor paresis.
 Occlusion of the central retinal artery associated with thrombosis of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus was demonstrated by angiography and magnetic resonance imaging.
 Cases of carotid thrombosis associated with ipsilateral ocular motor paresis are rare.
 The pathophysiology of intracavernous carotid thrombosis is discussed in connection with blood supply of the cranial nerves in the cavernous sinus.
