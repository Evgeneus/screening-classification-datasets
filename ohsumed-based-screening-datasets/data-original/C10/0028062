Nonneoplastic enhancing lesions mimicking intracanalicular acoustic neuroma on gadolinium-enhanced MR images.
 The authors describe five patients with nonneoplastic lesions of the facial and/or vestibulocochlear nerves that demonstrated focal enhancement within the internal auditory canal on magnetic resonance (MR) images.
 MR and surgical findings for four patients with unilateral sensorineural hearing loss and one with Ramsay Hunt syndrome were reviewed.
 Three patients with hearing loss underwent surgical exploration and decompression of the internal auditory canal.
 The MR findings in all four patients with hearing loss were similar: Focal enhancement of the internal auditory canal was depicted on postcontrast T1-weighted images.
 Nonneoplastic lesions of the seventh and eighth cranial nerves may show focal enhancement on MR images, which mimics the appearance of a small intracanalicular neuroma.
 This potential for misdiagnosis may have important therapeutic implications.
