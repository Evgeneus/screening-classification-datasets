Breast conservation therapy. Severe breast fibrosis after radiation therapy in patients with collagen vascular disease.
 Two patients with collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma) had extremely poor cosmetic results after breast radiation therapy (RT).
 The patient with rheumatoid arthritis received 5251 cGy at 210 cGy per day, followed by a 1600 cGy iridium-192 implant boost.
 Between 8 and 11 months post-RT she had severe breast fibrosis, retraction, and pain that required a mastectomy for relief.
 The patient with scleroderma received 5040 cGy at 180 cGy per day without a boost.
 Between 1 and 4 months post-RT the systemic symptoms of scleroderma progressed and the breast became hard and retracted.
 Both rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma are chronic systemic diseases characterized by severe inflammation and an autoimmune component.
 The presence of scleroderma at or before treatment should be considered a contraindication to breast RT, whereas the presence of active rheumatoid arthritis should be considered a relative contraindication.
 An autoimmune mechanism will be presented to explain both the fibrosis and the systemic progression of collagen vascular disease that was observed.
