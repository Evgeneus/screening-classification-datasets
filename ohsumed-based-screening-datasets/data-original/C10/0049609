Early enteral nutrition after brain injury by percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy.
 Twenty-seven patients in a series of 52 patients with severe brain injury (Glasgow Coma Scale score less than or equal to 8) underwent insertion of intestinal feeding tubes at the bedside.
 The technique required endoscopy with externalization of gastric and intestinal ports through the abdominal wall.
 Feedings were begun through the intestinal tube with Vital HN within 4 hours of its insertion with simultaneous gastric decompression via the gastric tube.
 Tubes were placed 2.3 (range 0-5) days after injury.
 Full caloric intake (3020 kcal/24 h) was achieved by 6.8 (range 2-8) days after injury to 4.2 (range 2-8) days after placement of the feeding tube.
 Only 1 patient failed to tolerate feedings immediately after tube insertion.
 Technical inability to insert the tubes occurred in 3 patients and the intestinal tube migrated into the stomach in 2 patients; diarrhea occurred in only 1 patient.
 With this technique, it was possible to deliver an average daily intake of 1.2 g/kg of protein in 8-day balance periods beginning at the time of tube insertion.
 These data included 3- to 4-day periods in which feedings were steadily increased.
 In 16 patients in whom nitrogen balance was measured for 8-day balance periods, average nitrogen balance was -5.7 (range -11.3 to +3.5) g/24 h.
 The reduction in nitrogen loss by this technique appears equal to or superior to either gastric feeding or TPN.
 This technique provides the ability to enterally feed a high proportion of brain-injured patients (except those in barbiturate coma) very early after injury using a bedside procedure.
