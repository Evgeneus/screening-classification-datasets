The painful shoulder: Part II. Intrinsic disorders and impingement syndrome.
 Intrinsic disorders that can cause shoulder pain include arthritis, gout, pseudogout and osteonecrosis.
 In its mildest form, impingement syndrome may cause only minimal discomfort.
 At its worst, impingement syndrome may lead to rotator cuff tear.
 Bicipital tendinitis and rupture of the biceps tendon may also be associated with impingement.
 Early rehabilitative intervention is important.
 Physical therapy is directed toward restoring range of motion and muscle strength.
