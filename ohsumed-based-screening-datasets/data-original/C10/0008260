Eosinophilic meningitis: cause of a chronic pain syndrome.
 Three tourists developed eosinophilic meningitis after visiting the Fijian Islands.
 Two had a severe and long lasting illness with chronic intractable pain.
 In one patient electrophysiological studies and MRI scan of the brain were abnormal and provided evidence of both radicular and cerebral parenchymal involvement by the most likely causative agent, Angiostrongylus cantonensis.
