Results of N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists in perinatal cerebral asphyxia therapy.
 Perinatal cerebral asphyxia, which results in significant neurologic and cognitive disabilities in infants and children, remains a major health problem.
 Potential neurologic sequelae include cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and epilepsy.
 Over the next few years, neuroprotective agents that prevent asphyxial neuronal injury and death are likely to be developed.
 These agents may also be effective in prophylaxis and treatment of chronic neurologic disorders, including epilepsy and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Huntington disease.
