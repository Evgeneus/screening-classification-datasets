Aspirin in transient ischemic attacks and minor stroke: a meta-analysis.
 An overview analysis of seven randomized controlled trials testing the effectiveness of aspirin in the treatment of patients with transient ischemic attacks and minor strokes was performed.
 A total of 6409 patients from the seven trials was entered in the analysis; 2182 patients received only aspirin; 1598 patients received an aspirin-combination regimen with either sulfinpyrazone or dipyridamole; and 2629 subjects received a placebo.
 Aspirin alone produced an 18% decrease in all strokes and cardiovascular deaths.
 The pooling of studies examining aspirin-combination regimens and the larger grouping of studies of aspirin and aspirin-combination regimens led to more striking results.
 Indeed, significant risk reductions were observed for three of the four outcomes, namely, total deaths, total strokes, and total strokes and cardiovascular deaths, with odds ratios ranging from 0.59 to 0.78.
 Suggestive, albeit more modest, results were obtained when examining the impact of these regimens on total cardiovascular mortality.
 The same tendencies have also been observed in three previously published meta-analyses.
