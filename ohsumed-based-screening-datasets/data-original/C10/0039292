The fibromyalgia impact questionnaire: development and validation.
 An instrument has been developed to assess the current health status of women with the fibromyalgia syndrome.
 The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) is a brief 10-item, self-administered instrument that measures physical functioning, work status, depression, anxiety, sleep, pain, stiffness, fatigue, and well being.
 We describe its development and validation.
 This initial assessment indicates that the FIQ has sufficient evidence of reliability and validity to warrant further testing in both research and clinical situations.
