Ifosfamide extrapyramidal neurotoxicity.
 Ifosfamide-associated central nervous system toxicity has been reported in 5% to 30% of patients treated with ifosfamide.
 Its pattern is characterized by metabolic encephalopathy with confusion, blurred vision, mutism, auditory or visual paranoid hallucinations, seizures, and rarely coma.
 The biochemical cause of the neurotoxicity is not understood completely, but it is thought to result from an accumulation of drug metabolites with direct central nervous system effects.
 A case of ifosfamide neurotoxicity is reported that had unusual extrapyramidal features in a patient treated with a 5-day course of infused ifosfamide.
 Although usually spontaneously reversible with cessation of drug administration, ifosfamide neurotoxicity occasionally has been associated with prolonged psychopathologic sequelae.
 Death from irreversible encephalopathy has also been reported rarely.
 The authors believe that classic extrapyramidal symptoms should be considered to be a part of the neurotoxic profile of ifosfamide.
