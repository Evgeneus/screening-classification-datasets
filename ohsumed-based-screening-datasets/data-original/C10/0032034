Psychological aspects of orthognathic surgery: how people respond to facial change.
 This study was undertaken to explore the motivations and problems shared by adult orthognathic surgical patients over the age of 25.
 Objective findings included demographic information and reasons for seeking surgery.
 The majority of 65 respondents cited functional problems as their primary reason for seeking treatment.
 Eighty-nine percent were pleased with esthetic changes, and 83% responded that the functional problem had been corrected.
 For most, the greatest discomfort related to the surgery was the postoperative intensive care unit.
 Two of the most common side effects of the surgery were the loss of sensation in the lips and chin area and a short period of depression.
 Women had depression more often than men but were more enthusiastic about the final results of the procedure.
 Two major areas of interest to surgeons emerged from the research.
 First, although women have functional problems, the majority seem to have a desire for cosmetic improvement.
 Having a functional problem seemed to provide the psychological permission necessary to spend the time and money for a cosmetic change.
 The second point focused on the need for good communication between surgeon and patient.
 The patients who were more positive toward the procedure and more satisfied with the results were those who were better informed and who thought they had a good system of communication with the orthodontist, surgeon, and their respective staffs.
