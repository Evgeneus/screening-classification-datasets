Arteriovenous malformation in meningothelial meningioma: case report.
 An unusual association of a meningioma and an arteriovenous malformation is reported.
 A 68-year-old man developed left homonymous hemianopsia, left hemiparesis, and gaze palsy.
 Magnetic resonance imaging showed a right occipital mass lesion containing multiple signal-void areas with tubular and honeycomb appearance, suggesting a marked vascular component.
 An angiogram showed abnormal vasculature in the mass supplied by the posterior cerebral artery and a dural arteriovenous malformation on the tentorium.
 Neuropathological examination after total removal of the mass revealed a meningothelial meningioma including major portions of an arteriovenous malformation that extended from the dura and leptomeninges, through the meningioma, and into the occipital lobe, where the tumor was located.
