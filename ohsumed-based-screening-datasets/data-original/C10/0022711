Cosmetic, functional, independent: self-help aids.
 Self-help orthotics have been developed to assist functional activities for high-level spinal cord injured patients.
 The goal of rehabilitation has been to do this with as little intrusion on independence and cosmesis as possible.
 This paper describes devices to help a patient with C6 quadriplegia independently place his own utensils and eat with an almost normal appearance.
 The new self-help aids are made from standard silverware, a rivet, and two one-eighth-inch Kydex loops.
 The loops are riveted centrally on the utensil, allowing for free rotation.
 The device was evaluated on a patient with C6, complete quadriplegia.
 The subject demonstrated independence in donning and doffing the device and in eating with an almost normal appearance.
