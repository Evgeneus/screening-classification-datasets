Zinc sulphate therapy for Wilson's disease after acute deterioration during treatment with low-dose D-penicillamine.
 A 30-year-old woman with Wilson's disease was treated with low-dose D-penicillamine.
 After 12 days, treatment was changed to zinc sulphate because of severe neurological deterioration.
 The patient subsequently improved within a few days.
 During a follow-up period of 20 months, the effectiveness of therapy was evaluated by measuring copper and zinc levels in plasma and urine, and by 64Cu-loading tests.
 We conclude that sulphate therapy may be a satisfactory alternative, even when rapid deterioration occurs in the early stages of D-penicillamine treatment.
