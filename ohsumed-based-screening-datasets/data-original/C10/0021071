Meningeal involvement in Bence Jones multiple myeloma.
 A case of Bence Jones kappa multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement in a 64-year-old woman is presented.
 Three years after the diagnosis of multiple myeloma, gait disturbances developed followed by visual disorders and impaired consciousness.
 A lumbar puncture revealed numerous atypical plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid.
 Craniospinal irradiation and intrathecal injections of methotrexate, cytarabine, and prednisolone were effective for a short period.
 At autopsy, the leptomeninges were infiltrated diffusely with atypical plasma cells.
 A review of the literature showed that multiple myeloma with meningeal involvement is accompanied frequently by circulating atypical plasma cells or plasma cell leukemia.
 Meningeal involvement is a rare complication and shows poor prognosis in cases of multiple myeloma.
