Management options in fulminant hepatic failure.
 The diagnosis of FHF carries with it a high mortality rate.
 Though the early results of OLT for FHF are encouraging, some have called for caution as these results are in a select population and may be similar to the optimistic early reports of now-discredited therapies.
 However, OLT differs fundamentally from all other interventions and, as such, it is ethically unjustified to withhold potentially life-saving therapy from patients with a predicted mortality in excess of 60%.
 Therefore, patients with FHF should be transferred at an early stage to an experienced liver unit where the option of liver transplantation can be considered.
