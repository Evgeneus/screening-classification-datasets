Sumatriptan in acute migraine: pharmacology and review of world experience.
 The introduction of sumatriptan, a novel abortive antimigraine agent, has generated a significant amount of preclinical and clinical interest during the past few years.
 At the scientific level, sumatriptan is unique in terms of its selective pharmacological properties.
 The effects of sumatriptan in various experimental paradigms have led to new insights into the pathophysiology of migraine.
 At the clinical level, sumatriptan appears to be an effective abortive anti-migraine agent with minimal side effects.
 Its ability to decrease, rather than exacerbate, the nausea and vomiting of migraine appears to be an important advance in the treatment of migraine.
