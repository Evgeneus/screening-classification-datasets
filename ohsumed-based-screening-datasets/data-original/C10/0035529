Cerebrospinal fluid protein and opening pressure in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).
 We studied the relationship between the CSF protein concentration and the degree of elevation of the CSF opening pressure in 177 patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri).
 There was no linear correlation between the CSF protein and opening pressure.
 In addition, low CSF protein (less than 20 mg/dl) was present in only 26% of the patients.
 Our findings fail to confirm previous reports of an inverse relationship between the CSF opening pressure and CSF protein as well as low CSF protein in these patients.
