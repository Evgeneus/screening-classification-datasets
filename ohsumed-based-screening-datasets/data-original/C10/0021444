rCBF-SPECT in brain infarction: when does it predict outcome?
 We prospectively studied 26 patients with ischemic stroke within 24 hr, after 2 wk, and after 6 mo with thallium-201-diethyldithiocarbamate single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and neurologic and functional assessments.
 The admission flow deficits correlated with outcome.
 The admission and 6-mo scores correlated with clinical conditions at each time.
 At 2 wk, the flow deficits were smaller and did not correlate with clinical parameters.
 Nor did the presence or absence of hyperfixation of the radiopharmaceutical.
 Six months after the infarct, the flow defect had decreased in 9 of 15 patients in whom three serial scans were available, with better clinical improvement than in the remaining six whose flow deficits increased.
 More patients in the first group had been treated randomly with the calcium-entry blocker flunarizine.
 SPECT imaging of rCBF within 24 hr after stroke correlates with clinical outcome and condition, whereas rCBF imaging at 2 wk after the stroke shows no clinical correlation.
