Carotid endarterectomy in a community hospital: a change in physicians' practice patterns.
 A total of 243 consecutive carotid endarterectomies (CEA) performed at Providence Medical Center in Portland, Oregon, were retrospectively reviewed over a 22-month period.
 Of these, 137 patients (56%) underwent CEA for asymptomatic disease, 52 (37%) of whom had stenotic lesions of 79% or less.
 There were 6 deaths (3%) and 12 strokes (5%).
 Four strokes were in asymptomatic patients.
 These data prompted development of criteria for CEA: (1) hemisphere-specific transient ischemic attacks, reversible ischemic neurologic deficits, or amaurosis fugax with an appropriate carotid lesion; (2) completed stroke with major recovery and significant carotid stenosis; (3) asymptomatic lesion with greater than 80% stenosis (D+) either by carotid arteriogram or non-invasive lab evaluation; and (4) other indications only with a supporting second opinion from a disinterested vascular surgeon, neurosurgeon or neurologist.
 A prospective review followed institution of the guidelines.
 In 21 months, 148 operations were performed, a 36% reduction over the initial study period.
 Of these, 46 (31%) were for asymptomatic lesions.
 Two patients (4%) did not fulfill the guideline criteria.
 There were six strokes (4%) and no deaths.
 The reduction of CEAs appears to be related to a significant decrease in "inappropriate" operations being performed.
 Surgeons' familiarity with the data rather than external pressures seems to be the major factor in changing practice patterns.
 The decrease in stroke/death rate is not statistically significant.
