Twenty-four-hour variation of blood pressure in vascular dementia of the Binswanger type.
 Using a noninvasive portable blood pressure recorder, we compared 24-hour variations of blood pressure among 1) 35 patients with Binswanger-type dementia, 2) 43 with lacunar-type dementia, 3) 26 with a single lacunar stroke, and 4) 30 controls.
 Each group was divided into antihypertensive-treated and -untreated subgroups.
 Among the untreated subgroups, patients with Binswanger-type dementia had significantly greater 24-hour mean systolic blood pressures, 24-hour systolic blood pressure standard deviations, and maximal systolic blood pressure variations than the controls (p less than 0.05).
 Among the treated patients, blood pressure variability increased similarly in all subgroups with cerebrovascular lesions compared with the controls (p less than 0.05).
 The nocturnal blood pressure decreases seen in the controls were absent among both untreated and treated patients with Binswanger- or lacunar-type dementia (p less than 0.05).
 Our results suggest the importance of hypertension, short-term variations in blood pressure, and a sustained nighttime elevation of blood pressure for the pathogenesis of both Binswanger-type and lacunar-type dementia in patients receiving antihypertensive medication.
