Elevation of plasma concentrations of haloperidol after the addition of fluoxetine.
 Fluoxetine (20 mg/day) was added for 7-10 days to stable doses of haloperidol given to eight psychotic patients.
 Mean plasma concentrations of haloperidol were elevated by 20% (p less than 0.05), but extrapyramidal side effects did not increase appreciably, indicating a relatively minor interaction between these agents.
