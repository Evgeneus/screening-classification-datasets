Angiographic changes suggestive of vasospasm in migraine complicated by stroke.
 A 30-year-old woman with a history of common migraine developed a permanent left homonymous hemianopia during a typical headache.
 CT scan demonstrated a right posterior cerebral infarction and angiography showed irregular narrowing of the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, suggestive of vasospasm.
 In the case no risk factors for atherosclerotic stroke were present except for smoking, and no other causes of stroke could be found.
