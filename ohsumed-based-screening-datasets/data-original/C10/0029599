Fragile X syndrome: diagnosis using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers.
 We describe two highly polymorphic microsatellite AC repeat sequences, VK23AC and VK14AC, which are closely linked to the fragile X at Xq27.3.
 Both VK23AC (DXS297) and VK14AC (DXS292) are proximal to the fragile site.
 Two-point linkage analysis in 31 fragile X families gave (a) a recombination frequency of 1% (range 0.00%-4%) with a maximum lod score of 32.04 for DXS297 and (b) a recombination frequency of 7% (range of 3%-15%) with a maximum lod score of 12.87 for DXS292.
 Both of these polymorphisms are applicable to diagnosis by linkage in families with fragile X syndrome.
 A multipoint linkage map of genetic markers at Xq27.3 was constructed from genotyping these polymorphisms in the CEPH pedigrees.
 The DXS292 marker is in the DXS98-DXS297 interval and in 3 cM proximal to DXS297.
