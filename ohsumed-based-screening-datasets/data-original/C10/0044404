Determination of erythrocyte-bound acetylcholinesterase activity for monitoring pyridostigmine therapy in myasthenia gravis.
 Monitoring of pyridostigmine therapy in patients with myasthenia gravis is not routinely performed, since the daily pyridostigmine doses are adjusted to the patient's actual clinical status rather than to pyridostigmine plasma concentrations (PPC).
 Moreover, PPC determination is time-consuming and needs much technical equipment.
 Since pyridostigmine reversible blocks acetylcholinesterase (AChE) at the neuromuscular junction, we studied the correlation between the enzyme's blood activity (erythrocyte-bound AChE) and PPC, on the one hand, and between blood AChE activity and the clinical status of the individual patient, on the other.
 In five previously untreated patients with myasthenia gravis blood AChE activity decreased in accordance with the actual PPC after a single oral dose of 60 mg pyridostigmine (group A).
 Amelioration of the clinical status corresponded to the decrease of AChE activity in the same way.
 In another five patients, who were on stable pyridostigmine medication for at least 1 week, AChE activity and PPC were constant during the day (group B).
 Since it is easier to perform than PPC, our results suggest that the determination of AChE activity may be superior to measuring PPC for monitoring cholinesterase inhibitor therapy in selected cases.
