The prognostic value of postoperative seizures following epilepsy surgery.
 Among 55 patients undergoing temporal lobectomy for refractory epilepsy, patients with seizures in the week following surgery had a poor long-term, seizure-free outcome compared with patients without seizures.
 Outcome for patients with single seizures or seizures restricted to the first postoperative day seemed favorable compared with patients with multiple or later seizures.
 Seizure type and similarity to preoperative events did not predict outcome.
