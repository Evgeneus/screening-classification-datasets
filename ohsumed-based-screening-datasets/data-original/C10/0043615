Large amplitude sensory action potentials in myelopathy: an observation.
 Subjects with at least one sensory action potential (SAP) amplitude greater than 2 SD above the age-matched mean during standard nerve conduction tests were evaluated for evidence of spinal cord disease.
 From a total of 153 subjects, 16 had at least one large amplitude SAP and 12 of 16 (75%) had a documented myelopathy.
 While a mechanism has yet to be determined, this observation suggests that SAP amplitudes greater than 2 SD above normal may be correlated with clinical evidence of injury to the central nervous system.
