Effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on ischemic brain edema in rats evaluated by proton magnetic resonance method.
 We examined the effect of atrial natriuretic peptide on cerebral edema in 96 rats.
 Forty-four rats were given 30 (n = 11), 120 (n = 26), or 150 (n = 7) micrograms/kg of the peptide intravenously over 24 hours after occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery to induce cerebral ischemia.
 We then measured the brain water content, the brain sodium and potassium contents, the in vitro proton nuclear magnetic resonance longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) relaxation times, and the area of the edematous regions.
 Compared with saline treatment (n = 39), peptide treatment decreased the brain water content in a dose-dependent manner and decreased the brain sodium content significantly (p less than 0.05).
 Peptide treatment also suppressed the lengthening of both T1 and T2 in edematous tissue (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively) and reduced the area of the edematous regions observed by magnetic resonance imaging (p less than 0.01).
 Atrial natriuretic peptide appears to have a pharmacological effect on ischemic brain edema, possibly by suppressing the elevation of water content through regulation of electrolyte transport in the brain.
