Choroid plexus tumors in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome.
 Choroid plexus neoplasms are rare epithelial tumors of the central nervous system.
 A carcinoma of the choroid plexus occurred in a child from a family with the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome (Li-Fraumeni or SBLA syndrome), an inherited condition characterized by the development of diverse neoplasms (sarcoma, breast cancer, brain tumors, leukemia, adrenal cortical carcinoma, and others).
 Choroid plexus carcinomas were identified in two kindreds previously reported with the syndrome.
 The literature contains reports of choroid plexus neoplasms occurring in families and in individuals with multiple primary tumors.
 Choroid plexus neoplasm may be a manifestation of the inherited proclivity to tumor development in the breast cancer-sarcoma syndrome.
