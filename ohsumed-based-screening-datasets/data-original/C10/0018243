Antivenom therapy in Russell's viper bite.
 Bleeding and renal failure are the two main manifestations responsible for the high morbidity and mortality in untreated Russell's viper bite victims.
 This study was an effort to find prognostic factors and a practical therapeutic approach for the care of such patients.
 Early detection of abnormalities in the clot quality test and/or evidence of systemic bleeding followed by immediate correction of the clotting defects using specific antivenom can reduce morbidity in Russell's viper envenomation.
