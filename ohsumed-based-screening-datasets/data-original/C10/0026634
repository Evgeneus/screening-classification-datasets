Increased circulating levels of bromocriptine after vaginal compared with oral administration.
 OBJECTIVE: To compare the circulating levels of bromocriptine after oral and vaginal administration of the drug.
 DESIGN: Experimental PARTICIPANTS: Seven ovulatory female volunteers and one hyperprolactinemic patient.
 INTERVENTIONS: Ovulatory volunteers were randomized to receive either oral or vaginal bromocriptine (2.5 mg).
 In a second session, the subjects were crossed-over to bromocriptine by the alternate route.
 An additional hyperprolactinemic patient received vaginal bromocriptine only.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum bromocriptine and prolactin (PRL) levels were measured hourly for 12 hours in the normal volunteers and for 10 hours in the hyperprolactinemic patient.
 RESULTS: Circulating bromocriptine levels were significantly higher after vaginal bromocriptine after the 7th hour (P less than 0.05).
 The reduction in serum PRL was significantly greater after oral administration between 2 and 6 hours.
 CONCLUSIONS: Vaginally administered bromocriptine may result in a reduction in the overall dose required, thereby improving compliance without compromising therapeutic efficacy.
