Optimal dose of lignocaine for preventing pain on injection of propofol.
 The purpose of this study was to define the optimum dose of lignocaine required to reduce pain on injection of propofol.
 We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial on 310 patients undergoing anaesthesia.
 Patients were allocated to four groups according to the lignocaine dosage: group A (control), no lignocaine; group B, lignocaine 0.1 mg kg-1; group C, lignocaine 0.2 mg kg-1; group D, lignocaine 0.4 mg kg-1.
 Our results showed that a dose of lignocaine 0.1 mg kg-1 significantly reduced the incidence of pain and that there was no improvement when the dose was increased.
