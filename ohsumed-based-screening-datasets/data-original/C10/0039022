Special considerations in the physical exam of older patients.
 For diagnostic utility, aspects of the standard physical examination are modified for elderly patients.
 Special attention is paid to problems that interfere with function, such as gait disorders, incontinence, and hearing and visual loss.
 Certain findings in cardiac and pulmonary examinations of the elderly require different interpretations.
 The examination should include the head and neck, chest, back, abdomen, breasts and pelvic area in women, prostate in men, extremities, and skin, as well as mental status.
 A number of diagnostic maneuvers are used to distinguish changes of normal aging from those associated with disease.
