Syndrome of the cervical plexus caused by high cervical nerve root compression.
 Lesions affecting the roots of the cervical plexus can cause a syndrome not previously described.
 The C3-C4 disc space is the most likely to be involved, but pressure on the C5 root can also produce facial, auricular, or retroauricular pain.
 Motor innervation to the diaphragm can be affected, and even the uppermost disc space at C2-C3 might be implicated.
 Findings on examination findings are sparse, although sensory impairment in areas of cervical plexus innervation has been observed.
 In a series of 1000 cervical decompression cases (both anterior and posterior) for disc disease or similar processes, only 10 instances of this syndrome have been found.
 Paresthesia or episodic shock-like pain affecting the ear, para-auricular, lower occipital, and mandibular areas prompted by head turning or extension are the most common complaints.
