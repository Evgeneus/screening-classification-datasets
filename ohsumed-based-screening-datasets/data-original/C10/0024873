Headaches due to spontaneous internal carotid artery dissection magnetic resonance imaging evaluation and follow up.
 Spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection is not an infrequent cause of headache and acute neurologic deficits in the younger population.
 Angiography has been the imaging modality of choice for both diagnosis and follow-up.
 The use of magnetic resonance imaging, (MRI), in conjunction with angiography, is described in three patients shown to have ICA dissection.
 Our clinical findings suggest that MRI may provide a less expensive, non-invasive, diagnostic and particularly a follow up modality in patients with headache and signs suggestive of ICA dissection.
