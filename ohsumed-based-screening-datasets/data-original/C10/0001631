Gadolinium-MRI in acute transverse myelopathy.
 A patient with acute transverse myelopathy (ATM) had serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies before and after administration of gadolinium (Gd-DTPA).
 Gd-DTPA-MRI was useful in estimating the pathologic extent and residual deficit expected in ATM.
