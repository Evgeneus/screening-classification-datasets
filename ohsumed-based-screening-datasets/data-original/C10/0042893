Intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas.
 The cases of 16 patients with acoustic neurinomas confined to the intracanalicular area are presented.
 These represent 2.7% of the 600 patients with acoustic neurinomas consecutively operated upon at the Neurosurgical Clinic at Nordstadt Hospital during the last 8 years.
 The comparatively earlier onset of vestibular symptoms and signs was characteristic of this group and precipitated diagnosis.
 The diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging was at least equivalent to that of air computed tomographic cisternography.
 Complete tumor removal was accomplished via the suboccipital approach in all patients, with 100% preservation of facial nerve and facial function; the cochlear nerve was preserved anatomically in 100% of the patients and functionally in 57%.
 No recurrence has occurred during follow-up periods of up to 8 years in all 16 patients.
 A broad spectrum of the current literature is considered, and purely intracanalicular acoustic neurinomas are discussed with regard to clinical characteristics, diagnostic steps-including neuroradiological and neurophysiological approaches-and surgical treatment and results.
