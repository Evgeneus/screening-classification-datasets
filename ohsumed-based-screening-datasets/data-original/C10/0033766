Bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarction resulting from explosion-type injury to the head and neck.
 A 43-year-old woman suffered a blast-type injury to the head and neck.
 She subsequently developed bilateral internal carotid artery occlusion and bilateral anterior cerebral artery infarction not demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging scan 24 hours after the explosion, but confirmed by a second scan 8 days after the explosion.
 In patients with blast-type injury to the head and neck who develop coma with a nonfocal neurological exam, the possibility of bilateral carotid artery occlusion and bilateral ischemic infarction should be considered.
