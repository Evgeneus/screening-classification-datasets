Syncope of unknown origin: clinical, noninvasive, and electrophysiologic determinants of arrhythmia induction and symptom recurrence during long-term follow-up.
 Ninety-one consecutive patients with syncope of unknown origin underwent electrophysiologic studies (EPS).
 Univariate analysis identified the following variables: age, + signal-averaged ECG (SAECG), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), history of myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, left ventricular aneurysm, and history of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (SMVT) on Holter; multivariate analysis identified +SAECG, LVEF, and history of SMVT as risk factors for induction of SMVT at EPS.
 All patients were followed up for 19.0 +/- 8.3 months and 17 had recurrence of syncope.
 Patients were divided into empiric, EP-guided, and no therapy groups.
 The EP-guided therapy group included all patients with SMVT at EPS.
 Recurrence rates among all three groups were similar.
 We conclude that: (1) Patients who have inducible SMVT at EPS can be identified using certain clinical and noninvasive variables.
 When these patients undergo EP-guided therapy, their rate of recurrence of syncope becomes compatible with that of patients who had no arrhythmia induced at EPS.
 (2) Empiric therapy does not offer any benefit over no therapy in reducing the rate of recurrent of scope.
