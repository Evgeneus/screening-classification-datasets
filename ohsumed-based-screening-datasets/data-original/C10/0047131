Nasogastric feeding at home: acceptability and safety.
 A questionnaire was administered to 70 families with experience of home enteral nutrition.
 All but one patient received at least some of their feeding overnight.
 During 11,041 patient days of home enteral nutrition, no serious complications were seen.
 Sleep disturbance was common, however, and affected 59 parents and 35 children.
 A nocturnal cough or 'chestiness' were noted in 10 children suggesting occult gastro-oesophageal reflux.
 Enteral feeding disposables were not prescribable by general practitioners, and funding for the equipment was inadequate in the hospital and community.
 The mean time to arrange funding for equipment was eight months (range two weeks to two years).
 Parental views on home enteral nutrition were positive and none felt that its disadvantages outweighed the benefits.
 Altogether 35 children were described as being more happy and active.
 Given adequate preparation and continued support at home, parents can manage home enteral nutrition safely and effectively.
