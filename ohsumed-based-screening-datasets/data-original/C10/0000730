The effect of improved cementing techniques on component loosening in total hip replacement. An 11-year radiographic review.
 Improved cementing techniques have been shown to decrease the rate of aseptic loosening of femoral components of cemented total hip replacements at five to seven years.
 We now report our results in 105 hips in 93 patients at 10 to 12.7 years (mean 11.2).
 The improved techniques included use of a medullary plug, a cement gun, a doughy mix of Simplex P and a collared stem of chrome cobalt.
 Only three femoral components had definitely loosened, none were probably loose and 24 were graded as possibly loose.
 In contrast, the incidence of radiographic loosening on the acetabular side was 42%.
 Improved cementing techniques have produced a marked reduction in the rate of aseptic loosening of the femoral component, but the incidence of acetabular loosening is unchanged.
