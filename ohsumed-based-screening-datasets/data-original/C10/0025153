Optic neuropathy and central nervous system disease secondary to Sjogren's syndrome in a child.
 The authors describe a 10-year-old girl in whom optic neuropathy and central nervous system (CNS) disease developed in association with primary Sjogren's syndrome.
 There was angiographic evidence of cerebral vasculitis and multiple infarcts present on neuroimaging.
 Results of parotid biopsy, cerebrospinal fluid, and serologic analyses showed abnormalities that were consistent with the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndrome.
 Although the patient had optic disc pallor on initial evaluation, her color vision and acuity improved with immunosuppressive therapy, as did her other neurologic symptoms.
 The authors believe this represents the first reported case of optic neuropathy and CNS disease associated with primary Sjogren's syndrome in the pediatric population.
 The possibility of improvement in visual function with early institution of immunosuppressive therapy makes prompt diagnosis essential.
