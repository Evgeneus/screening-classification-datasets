Descriptive epidemiologic study of epilepsy syndromes in a district of northwest Tuscany, Italy.
 To evaluate the prevalence of epilepsy syndromes in a district in Northwest Tuscany (Vecchiano, 9,952 inhabitants) we identified all suspected cases (probable epilepsy) from several information sources: files of local doctors, prescriptions of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), hospital files from the center for epilepsy at the University of Pisa, medical files from university and hospital departments in Pisa, and files of the school doctors and social workers in the district of Vecchiano.
 All persons suspected of having epilepsy were examined; 51 cases of epilepsy were found, i.e., a prevalence rate of 5.1 in 1,000.
 During a previous study performed in the same district with the "house-to-house" method, a lower rate was found.
 Our study confirms that use of different epidemiologic investigational methods can produce different results.
