Residential arrangements for adults with cerebral palsy--California, 1988.
 In the United States, an estimated 274,000 persons have cerebral palsy (CP), a neurologic condition defined as a group of nonprogressive disorders in which an abnormality of the central nervous system can result in motor dysfunction (e.g., paresis, involuntary movement, and incoordination).
 CP is the third leading cause of the need for assistance with basic life activities and the fifth leading cause of activity limitation.
 An adult with CP may require adaptive housing to improve accessibility (e.g., to entrances and toilet facilities), attendant care to assist with activities of daily living, and/or nursing care to meet specific health-care needs.
 These needs can be met through a variety of residential accommodations.
 However, because the residential environment has a considerable impact on well-being and quality of life, the accommodations should be in the least restrictive environment and, when possible, community-based.
 This report summarizes an assessment of characteristics of adults with CP to determine which factors are associated with placement in a more restrictive environment.
