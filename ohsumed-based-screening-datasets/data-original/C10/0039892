Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of focal computed tomography abnormality in epilepsy.
 Sixty-seven patients with epilepsy and isolated enhancing computed tomography (CT) scan lesion were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 Fifty-six patients (83.5%) had partial seizures and 11 (16.4%) had generalized seizures.
 Four distinct groups were identified by MRI: nonspecific 16 cases (23.8%), tuberculoma 38 cases (56.7%), cysticercosis 12 cases (17.9%), and abscess 1 case (1.4%).
 Patients in the non-specific group had lesions that were hyperintense on T2 images and hypointense or isointense on T1 images.
 Such lesions resolved completely in 5 months with serial MRIs while the patients were receiving antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
 Virologic studies, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) serology, are suggested for patients with such MRI lesions.
