A qualitative approach to primary care research: the long interview.
 Qualitative research methods offer useful complements to the traditional epidemiologic approaches most commonly used by primary care researchers.
 Narrative texts generated through open-ended interviews are one form of qualitative data that may provide useful insights into primary care issues that are otherwise overlooked by more structured designs.
 This paper presents a step-by-step process for conducting a long interview, a qualitative approach with distinct potential for primary care research.
 Advantages and limitations of the long interview and its relationship to other qualitative methods are also discussed.
