Delayed sleep phase syndrome response to melatonin.
 The actions of melatonin on the sleep-wake cycle were investigated by means of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 8 subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome attending a sleep disorders clinic.
 In randomised order the subjects received placebo or melatonin 5 mg daily for 4 weeks with a 1 week washout period between the treatments.
 Drug or placebo was given at 2200 h, 5 h before the mean time of sleep onset determined by pretrial sleep logs.
 In all 8 subjects sleep onset time (mean advance 82 [range 19-124] min; p less than 0.01) and wake time (117 [10-187] min; p less than 0.01) were significantly earlier during melatonin treatment than during placebo.
 Mean total sleep time was slightly less on melatonin (8 h 12 min) than on placebo (8 h 46 min).
 Alertness acrophase calculated from the subjects' ratings of alertness made every 2 h while awake was unaltered.
 Melatonin may act as a phase-setter for sleep-wake cycles in subjects with a delayed sleep phase syndrome.
