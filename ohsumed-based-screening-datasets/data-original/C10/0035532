Diagnostic value of video-EEG polysomnography.
 To investigate the diagnostic value of video-EEG polysomnography (VPSG), we reviewed our experience in 122 patients with suspected parasomnias who underwent one or two nights of VPSG.
 Of 86 patients without known epilepsy, VPSG provided useful diagnostic information for 41 (69%) of those with a history of prominent motor activity during sleep and for 11 (41%) of those with a history of minor motor activity during sleep.
 Two children and one adult with clinical histories suggestive of sleep terrors had unequivocal partial seizures during VPSG.
 Of 36 patients with known epilepsy, VPSG was useful diagnostically in 28 (78%).
 VPSG is superior to standard polysomnography for the evaluation of parasomnias because of the increased capability to identify and localize EEG abnormalities and to correlate behavior with EEG and polysomnography.
 VPSG may also be a suitable alternative to intensive inpatient monitoring for some patients with known or suspected epilepsy who have frequent undiagnosed nocturnal spells.
