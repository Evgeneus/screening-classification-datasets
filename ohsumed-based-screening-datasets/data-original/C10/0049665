Effects of magnesium sulfate on pentylenetetrazol-induced status epilepticus.
 The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) as an anticonvulsant is controversial.
 Status epilepticus was induced in 0.5% halothane-anesthetized Wistar rats with a threshold (90 mg/kg) or suprathreshold (200 mg/kg) dose of intravenous (i.v.) pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) under stereotactic hippocampal depth electrode monitoring.
 Fifteen minutes after seizure induction, the maximum hemodynamically tolerated dose of MgSO4 (10 mg/kg/min in 22 min) was administered i.v.
 MgSO4 was ineffective in altering seizure discharge.
 A subgroup of nine animals received hypertonic mannitol before MgSO4 to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to facilitate Mg2+ CNS penetration.
 Again MgSO4 was ineffective in attenuating epileptic activity.
 These results support the contention that MgSO4 is not an effective treatment for status epilepticus.
 We hypothesize that because Mg2+ blocks Ca2+ influx into the neuron through the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-operated calcium channel in a voltage-dependent manner it would be ineffective in neurons that are continuously depolarizing as in status epilepticus.
