Sciatic nerve entrapment in a child. Case report.
 A child was brought for evaluation of signs of unilateral chronic progressive sciatic nerve dysfunction found to be due to nerve entrapment in the thigh by a fibrovascular band.
 Sectioning of the band was followed by marked improvement in the nerve function.
 Compression by a band is a rare but treatable cause of sciatic neuropathy.
