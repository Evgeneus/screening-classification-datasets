The survival of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial condyle.
 The results of total knee arthroplasty in patients with osteonecrosis of the medial femoral condyle were examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
 The study included 32 osteonecrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 3.9 years.
 For comparison, 63 osteoarthrotic knees with an average final follow-up examination of 4.6 years were also analyzed.
 The survival rates were calculated using four distinct categories of failure: (1) revision, (2) revision or radiolucency, (3) revision, radiolucency, or pain, and (4) pain.
 On the basis of pain relief alone, the five-year postoperative success rate was 82% for osteonecrosis (eight knees) and 90% for osteoarthrosis (27 knees), with no significant statistical difference between the two groups.
