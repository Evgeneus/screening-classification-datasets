Safety and tolerance of oral dextromethorphan in patients at risk for brain ischemia.
 Experimental ischemia models have shown the antitussive dextromethorphan to be an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist with neuroprotective properties.
 We treated 10 patients with a history of recent stroke or transient ischemic attack with oral dextromethorphan (60 mg q.i.d.) for 3 weeks in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover tolerance study.
 We documented no clinical evidence of toxicity attributable to dextromethorphan in this preliminary study.
