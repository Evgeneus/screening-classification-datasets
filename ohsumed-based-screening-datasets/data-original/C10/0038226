Anger and hostility in tension-type headache.
 A battery of standardized psychometric tests was administered to a group of 47 episodic tension-type headache sufferers and 47 headache-free controls.
 Compared to controls, headache subjects showed higher levels of anxiety, depression, and anger/hostility.
 The groups did not differ significantly on a measure of anger expressed toward persons or objects, but headache subjects showed significantly greater levels of suppressed anger.
 The results provide objective data that are in general agreement with predictions derived from psychosomatic theories about the interrelationships among anxiety,.
