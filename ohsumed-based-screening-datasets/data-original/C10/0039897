Risk factors for febrile seizures in the People's Republic of China: a case control study.
 A case control study was conducted to investigate the association of family history of febrile seizures (FS) and history of maternal, pregnancy and delivery, and postnatal factors with FS.
 Information was gathered by door-to-door survey in six major cities in the People's Republic of China.
 Factors present before the date of onset of FS were assessed in 182 subjects and in an equal number of controls matched for age, sex, and geographic area.
 The odds ratio for risk of FS in children with a family history of FS in a first-degree relative was 10.0 (confidence interval 2.7-58.6), confirming other observations that familial factors are an important predisposing characteristic for FS.
 Maternal acute respiratory infection during the first trimester of pregnancy was slightly more frequent in children with FS (odds ratio, 1.9 confidence interval 1.0-3.9).
 None of the other examined pregnancy or delivery factors was associated with an increased risk, suggesting that birth history is not an important factor predisposing to FS.
