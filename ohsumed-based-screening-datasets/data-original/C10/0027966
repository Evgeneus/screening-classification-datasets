Outcome of psychogenic seizures in children and adolescents compared with adults.
 We compared outcome of psychogenic seizures documented by video-EEG in 18 nonepileptic children and adolescents (ages 8 to 18; median, 14.5 years old) and 20 adults (ages 25 to 56; median, 34.0 years old).
 Outcome was significantly better for the younger patients at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years after diagnosis.
 At these follow-up times, the percentages of children and adolescents free of psychogenic attacks were 73%, 75%, and 81%; at the same follow-up times, the percentages of adults free of psychogenic attacks were only 25%, 25%, and 40%.
 Factors leading to better outcome for younger patients may have been different psychological mechanisms at different ages of onset and greater effectiveness with earlier intervention.
