Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty in sickle cell anemia: a case report.
 Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was performed on a 19-year-old female who had moderate pulmonary valve stenosis with sickle cell anemia.
 The patient developed sickle cell crisis resulting in occipital infarction, but she made a good recovery.
 We describe this case and the methods of reducing the risk of sickle cell crisis.
