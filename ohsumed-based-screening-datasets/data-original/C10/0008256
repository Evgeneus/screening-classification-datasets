Parkinsonian tremor loses its alternating aspect during non-REM sleep and is inhibited by REM sleep.
 Non-REM sleep transforms the waking alternating Parkinsonian tremor into subclinical repetitive muscle contractions whose amplitude and duration decrease as non-REM sleep progresses from stages I to IV.
 During REM sleep Parkinsonian tremor disappears while the isolated muscle events increase significantly.
