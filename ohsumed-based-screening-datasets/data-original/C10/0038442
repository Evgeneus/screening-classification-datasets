Thermographic observations on rats with experimental neuropathic pain.
 Infrared thermographic images were obtained from the plantar hind paws of rats with an experimental nerve injury that produces signs of neuropathic pain.
 Thermograms confirmed that the experimental neuropathy produces signs resembling those of patients with neuropathic pain.
 The hind paws on the nerve-damaged side were abnormally hot, abnormally cold, or apparently normal 8-16 days post injury, a variability that is seen clinically in neuropathic pain patients.
 Abnormally cold hind paws became warm as soon as the injured sciatic nerve was transected, indicating that the underlying vasoconstriction was mediated by neural impulse activity.
 Xylazine (Rompun), a sympatho-inhibitory alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist that normally increases cutaneous temperature, caused the hind paw on the control side to warm, as anticipated, while causing paradoxical cooling of abnormally hot hind paws, and even of 'normal temperature' paws on the nerve-injured side.
 These findings shed light on possible mechanisms underlying abnormal deviations of skin temperature as a symptom of nerve injury.
 The findings also attest to the usefulness of the experimental animal model of neuropathic pain and of the thermographic method.
