Head-up tilt for the evaluation of syncope of unknown origin in children.
 Fifteen patients aged 10 to 18 years with syncope of unknown origin, and 10 healthy control children aged 11 to 18 years, were evaluated by head-up tilt to 60 degrees for 60 minutes.
 Six patients (43%) reproduced symptoms of syncope during the examination.
 Four had a typical vasovagal reaction; two had marked hyperventilation.
 None of the children in the control group had syncope.
 The head-up tilt test offers a simple, noninvasive, high-yielding diagnostic tool for evaluation of syncope in children.
