Radiation-induced cranial nerve palsy: hypoglossal nerve and vocal cord palsies.
 Cranial nerve palsies are an unexpected complication of radiotherapy for head and neck tumours.
 We present a case of this radiation-induced cranial palsy.
 An 18-year-old female with nasopharyngeal carcinoma developed a right hypoglossal nerve palsy 42 months after cancericidal doses of radiotherapy.
 In addition, she developed a bilateral vocal cord palsy 62 months after therapy.
 Follow-up over four years has demonstrated no evidence of tumour recurrence and no sign of neurological improvement.
