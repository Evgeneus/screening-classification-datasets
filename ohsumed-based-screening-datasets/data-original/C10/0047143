Combined nasal intermittent positive-pressure ventilation and rocking bed in chronic respiratory insufficiency. Nocturnal ventilatory support of a disabled person at home.
 The use of intermittent positive-pressure ventilation via nasal mask with a rocking bed provided the necessary ventilatory support for a person with quadriplegia living at home.
 This option was required to maintain an independent life-style of choice.
 The combination of techniques and the linkage of devices demonstrated an effective use of simple available technology for respiratory care at home and the adaptation of the respiratory prescription to the total needs of each person: medical, social, and financial.
 The further use of nasal mask ventilation in selected cases is encouraged by clinical research protocol.
