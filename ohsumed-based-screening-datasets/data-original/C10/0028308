Central retinal vein occlusion associated with drusen of the optic disc.
 A 43-year-old man had gradual visual changes OD.
 Funduscopic examination revealed central retinal vein occlusion OD.
 Complete ocular examination revealed bilateral drusen of the optic disc, confirmed by b-scan ultrasonography.
 Complete systemic evaluation showed no other etiology for the central retinal vein occlusion.
 Over a ten-year follow-up, in the absence of systemic disease or other local ocular anomalies, we concluded that central retinal vein occlusion can arise from external compression secondary to drusen of the optic disc.
