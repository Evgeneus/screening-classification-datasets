Long-term L-carnitine treatment in isovaleric acidemia.
 A 5-year-old girl with isovaleric acidemia was treated with long-term L-carnitine and no supplemental glycine.
 Clinical and laboratory data are presented.
 Following diagnosis and treatment at age 2 years, the frequency of acute exacerbations of metabolic acidosis was reduced and she resumed normal growth and development.
 L-carnitine supplementation and protein restriction may be sufficient for effective therapy of isovaleric acidemia.
