Cerebral potentials evoked by painful, laser stimuli in patients with syringomyelia.
 Brief cutaneous heat stimuli generated by a CO2 laser were used to elicit late somatosensory evoked cerebral potentials (SEPc) in 10 patients with syringomyelia.
 For comparison, early and late cerebral potentials in response to electrical nerve stimuli (SEPn) were recorded in the same session.
 In 8 patients with localized impairment of pain and temperature sensitivity we found complete absence of SEPc after stimulation of the affected area; in another patient with similar sensory deficits, the SEPc was grossly attenuated and delayed.
 In 1 patient with intact pain sensitivity but absent temperature sensitivity, a well defined SEPc could be recorded.
 Both early cortical SEPn and late SEPn in response to conventional nerve stimuli were normal in all patients and thus did not differentiate control and affected areas.
 These data indicate that alteration of SEPc correlates with altered pain sensitivity in patients with a circumscribed spinal lesion.
 SEPc may thus be used as a neurophysiological test in the assessment of hypalgesic dermatomes.
