Surgical collars: a survey of their prescription and use.
 We report the results of a questionnaire survey of 124 orthopaedic, rheumatology, medical and accident and emergency outpatients prescribed a surgical collar during a 3-month period.
 Of these, 99 (80%) returned the questionnaire.
 Instructions received about when to wear the collar differed widely, especially between specialties.
 Most patients (76%) found benefit in wearing the collar.
 Pain was the symptom helped most (78%) whilst dizziness was helped least (40%).
 Problems with the collars were common, many being too hot (69%) and uncomfortable (48%).
 A third had difficulty putting the collar on.
 Despite these problems, compliance was good with 19 patients discontinuing collars for reasons other than recovery or medical advice.
 We believe this study highlights further areas for research and stimulates a re-evaluation of collar usage.
