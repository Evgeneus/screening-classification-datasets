Treating the progressive stages of Parkinson's disease.
 Parkinson's disease affects thousands of Americans, men and women equally and apparently with little regard to race.
 Its diagnosis depends largely on repeated clinical observations of representative signs, such as resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and gait disturbances.
 Patients progress through stages: Early disease involves only one limb or side and confers minimal disability, but advanced disease restricts patients to full care.
 Treatment is chosen on the basis of disease stage and patient response.
 Combination carbidopa-levodopa (Sinemet) is appropriate for any significant degree of disability, and other antiparkinsonian drugs and anticholinergic agents may be used as adjuncts.
 Electroconvulsive therapy, use of selegiline hydrochloride (Eldepryl), and surgery are still undergoing investigation but may hold promise.
