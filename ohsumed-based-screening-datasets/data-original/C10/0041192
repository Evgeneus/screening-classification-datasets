A familial coincidence of pseudotumor cerebri and communicating hydrocephalus.
 A family in which the mother and two of four daughters had a diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebri and one son developed communicating hydrocephalus is described.
 The other two daughters both have a long history of headaches but no signs of intracranial hypertension.
 The argument is advanced that there exists a defect of cerebrospinal fluid absorption common to pseudotumor cerebri and communicating hydrocephalus.
