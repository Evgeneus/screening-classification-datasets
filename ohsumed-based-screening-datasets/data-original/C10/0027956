Induction of speech arrest and counting errors with rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation.
 Six adult epileptic patients underwent rapid-rate transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) at stimulation rates of up to 25 Hz with an 11-cm water-cooled round coil held flat on the scalp, centered over 15 different positions on each side of the scalp.
 The trains of stimuli were for 10 seconds while the patients counted aloud.
 rTMS centered over D5 or D7 induced reproducible speech arrest in all patients and counting errors in three when applied at lower intensities.
 There were no such speech disturbances by rTMS centered over the different positions on the right side.
 Intracarotid amobarbital test (IAT) demonstrated left hemispheric language dominance in all patients.
 Lateralization of speech arrest induced by rTMS correlated with the IAT results and may be helpful for noninvasive determination of hemispheric language dominance.
