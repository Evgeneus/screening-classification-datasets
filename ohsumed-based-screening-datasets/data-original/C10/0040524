Resolution of chronic pelvic pain after laparoscopic lysis of adhesions.
 Thirty women undergoing laparoscopic lysis of adhesions for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain were prospectively evaluated for the presence of a chronic pain syndrome.
 At follow-up, of those with chronic pain syndrome (10), four (40%) reported continued improvement or resolution of pain during daily activities of dyspareunia, whereas of those without chronic pain syndrome (20), 15 (75%) were better (p = 0.06).
 When these two complaints are evaluated individually, both pain during daily activities (p less than 0.05) and dyspareunia (p less than 0.05) are more likely to improve after lysis of adhesions in women without chronic pain syndrome.
 Prognosis was not related to the number of previous operations, adhesion score, or other physical parameters.
 Laparoscopic lysis of adhesions is generally worthwhile in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain, although the presence of psychosocial compromise warrants preoperative evaluation and concomitant treatment.
