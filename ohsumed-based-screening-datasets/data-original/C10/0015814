Neuropsychological assessment of cognitive functioning in children with epilepsy.
 The variety of cognitive dysfunctions related to learning disabilities in children with epilepsy have been studied by linking electroencephalogram (EEG) and computerized neuropsychological testing.
 This showed that "subclinical" discharges impaired performance in 61% of the patients on a simple and a choice reaction time test, although some discharges lasted 1 s only.
 Neuropsychological investigation of subclinical EEG discharges may help to determine their adverse effect on learning.
