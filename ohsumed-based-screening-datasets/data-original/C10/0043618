Variations in anatomy of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel: pitfalls in the diagnosis of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.
 Two processes account for most instances of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: compression in the retroepicondylar groove, and compression by the humeroulnar aponeurotic arcade joining the two heads of the flexor carpi ulnaris.
 While conventional electrodiagnostic criteria may localize an ulnar neuropathy to the elbow, separating retroepicondylar compression from humeroulnar arcade compression is more difficult.
 In 130 cadaver elbows, we examined the relationships between the medial epicondyle, flexor carpi ulnaris, and ulnar nerve.
 The humeroulnar arcade lay from 3 to 20 mm distal to the medial epicondyle, the intramuscular course of the nerve through the flexor carpi ulnaris ranged from 18 to 70 mm, and the nerve exited the flexor carpi ulnaris 28 to 69 mm distal to the medial epicondyle.
 In 6 specimens, dense fibrous bands bridged directly between the medial epicondyle and the olecranon proximal to the cubital tunnel proper; accessory epitrochleoanconeus muscles were present in 14 specimens: both may cause ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.
 Anatomical variations may contribute to the difficulty in separating causes of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow.
