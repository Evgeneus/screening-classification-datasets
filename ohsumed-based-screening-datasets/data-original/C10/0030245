Verapamil and migraine prophylaxis: mechanisms and efficacy.
 Calcium channel blockers have demonstrated efficacy in investigative use for prophylaxis of migraine and cluster headaches.
 In particular, verapamil, with its low side-effect profile, appears to be a promising alternative to the currently available agents for prophylactic treatment of chronic recurring headaches.
 Although its exact mechanisms of action in this application are unknown, verapamil exerts a vasodilatory effect on cerebral arteries and interacts with serotonergic systems involved in migraine pathogenesis.
 A review of studies from the past decade indicates that verapamil may be as effective as traditional therapies as prophylaxis for the major types of chronic recurring headache.
