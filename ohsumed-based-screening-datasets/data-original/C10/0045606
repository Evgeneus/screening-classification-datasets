Estrogen and progesterone binding by acoustic neuroma tissue.
 Tissue samples from 37 acoustic neuromas were assayed for estrogen and progesterone hormone receptor binding by radioimmunoassay using a dextran-coated charcoal method and Scatchard plot analysis.
 Twenty-one of the samples were from men, and 16 of the samples were from women.
 Seven of 37 samples (19%) were positive for estrogen receptor and six of 36 samples (17%) were positive for progesterone receptor.
 Three of 37 samples (8%) were positive for both receptors.
 There was no correlation of estrogen receptor positivity with the sex of the patient.
 These results indicate that estrogen or progesterone receptor binding activity or both are present in a small subset of acoustic tumors.
 Evidence is lacking, however, that binding of estrogen to the receptor results in growth changes in the tumor.
 The empirical use of antiestrogen treatment in acoustic neuroma does not appear to be justified at the present time.
