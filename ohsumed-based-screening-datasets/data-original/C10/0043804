Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis: an immunohistochemical study.
 Lymphocytic adenohypophysitis is a rare inflammatory disorder of the anterior pituitary gland.
 In some cases, there is evidence of concurrent autoimmune disease.
 We present the case of a 39-year-old woman who developed visual disturbance during the early postpartum period.
 Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an intrasellar mass with suprasellar extension.
 Study of the tumor tissue showed diffuse infiltration of the entire pituitary gland by lymphocytes and plasma cells.
 Immunohistochemical examination revealed that the majority of the infiltrating lymphocytes were T cells that might have modulated the immunoreaction to the anterior pituitary gland.
 We suggest that the disorder is related to cell-mediated immunity as well as humoral immunity.
