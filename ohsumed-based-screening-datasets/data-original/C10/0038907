Noncemented porous-coated anatomic total hip arthroplasty.
 In 1984, as an alternate to the acrylic fixation of the components of total hip arthroplasty, the use of an uncemented porous-coated anatomic (PCA) hip system with a beaded porous coating to achieve biologic fixation was initiated.
 Since then, 44 patients with cementless acetabular components and 35 patients with cementless femoral components have been followed for a minimum of 24 months and an average of 37 months.
 Harris hip scores averaged 90.5 at most recent follow-up intervals.
 No reoperations were necessary for failures of fixation or change in position of the acetabular component.
 Ominous roentgenographic signs such as progressive bead shedding, progressive radiolucencies, or progressive component migration have not occurred.
 Two femoral component revisions have been necessary: one for intractable pain and one for pain and roentgenographic loosening.
 Although thigh pain has been prevalent (20%), all patients have been accommodated and have retained stable hip scores.
 Progressive radiolucencies and progressive implant subsidence have been rare occurrences.
 The authors continue to use the cementless acetabular component in all cases of total hip arthroplasty in which initial stability can be obtained.
 It is their preference to cement the femoral component in patients over 65 or when initial stability cannot be achieved.
