Mapping of human microtubule-associated protein 1B in proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy locus at 5q13.
 A polyclonal antiserum directed against the C-terminal domain of dystrophin was used to isolate a cDNA clone encoding an antigenically cross-reactive protein, microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP-1B).
 Physical mapping of the human MAP-1B locus places its chromosomal location at 5q13, in proximity to the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) locus.
 SMA is a degenerative disorder primarily affecting motor neurons.
 Genetic linkage analysis of SMA families using a human dinucleotide repeat polymorphism just 3' of the MAP-1B gene has shown tight linkage to SMA mutations.
 These mapping data together with the postulated role of MAP-1B in neuronal morphogenesis and its localization in anterior horn motor neurons suggest a possible association with SMA.
