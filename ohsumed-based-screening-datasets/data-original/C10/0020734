One-year outcome after cerebral infarction in whites, blacks, and Hispanics.
 Little is known about outcome after cerebral infarction for different ethnic groups.
 Of 590 stroke patients hospitalized from 1983 to 1986 at the Neurological Institute, cerebral infarction over age 39 years occurred in 135 whites, 177 blacks, and 82 Hispanics.
 Outcome after cerebral infarction differed by ethnicity.
 The 1-month mortality rate was similar in whites and blacks and least in Hispanics.
 Whites had a slightly greater risk of recurrent stroke or death than blacks or Hispanics until 6 months after infarction, when their risk stabilized, while the risk in blacks and Hispanics continued to rise for the entire year of follow-up.
 By 1 year, the rate of recurrent stroke or death was 34.8 +/- 4.2% in whites, 31.1 +/- 3.6% in blacks, and 21.4 +/- 4.8% in Hispanics (p = 0.04).
 Differences were found in the distribution of various stroke risk factors in the three ethnic groups.
 A Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that the ethnic differences in stroke risk factors and infarct subtype were responsible for the ethnic differences in outcome.
 An abnormal first electrocardiogram was a risk factor for stroke recurrence or death in all three ethnic groups, while a nonlacunar infarct subtype and a history of diabetes were significant only in Hispanics.
 Understanding the associations of stroke determinants with ethnicity may lead to more focused secondary prevention of recurrent stroke.
