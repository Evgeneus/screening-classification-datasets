Effect of indomethacin on the pathophysiology of experimental meningitis in rabbits.
 The effects of indomethacin on central nervous system abnormalities in rabbits with experimental pneumococcal meningitis were studied.
 As expected, prostaglandin E2 levels in cerebrospinal fluid were significantly lower in the indomethacin-treated group, indicating that the drug effectively reduced prostaglandin synthesis.
 Brain edema was markedly attenuated in the indomethacin-treated group; however, cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell counts, lactate and protein concentrations, and intracisternal pressure were not significantly different between groups.
 It seems that indomethacin, while effective in reducing brain edema, does not significantly affect other important pathophysiologic alterations in experimental pneumococcal meningitis.
