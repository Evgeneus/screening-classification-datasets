Pelvic pain: lessons from anatomy and physiology.
 Pelvic pain is often a difficult differential diagnosis in the emergency department.
 For physiologic reasons, pain in the pelvis is difficult to localize to a specific organ, and pelvic peritonitis is hard to recognize.
 On the other hand, differences in types of pain can be very useful in arriving at a correct diagnosis.
 The clinician must learn to recognize superficial and deep somatic pain, and differentiate between various types of visceral pain which originate from inflammation, ischemia, or colic.
 A review of the anatomy and physiology of pelvic pain helps identify some of the problems as well as potential aids in approaching the patient with pelvic pain.
