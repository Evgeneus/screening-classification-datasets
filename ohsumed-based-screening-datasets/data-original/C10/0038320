The binding and functional properties of voltage dependent calcium channel receptors in pediatric normal and myelodysplastic bladders.
 The present study was designed to compare the binding and functional properties of calcium channel receptors in normal and myelodysplastic bladders.
 Normal bladders were obtained from children with vesicoureteral reflux undergoing ureteral reimplantation.
 Myelodysplastic bladder specimens were obtained from patients undergoing bladder augmentation.
 The functional studies included agonist (calcium chloride) dose response experiments and the determination of apparent antagonist dissociation constants for various calcium channel antagonists.
 The receptor binding studies were performed using the ligand (+)-3H-PN200-110 (specific activity 86.6 Ci./mmol.).
 The mean maximal response of myelodysplastic bladders to calcium ions was 31% less than normal bladders (p greater than 0.05).
 The mean EC50 for calcium mediated isometric tension and the mean -log antagonist dissociation constant values of nifedipine, diltiazem and verapamil were similar in normal and myelodysplastic bladders.
 The radioligand receptor binding studies demonstrated that the equilibrium dissociation constant of (+)-3H-PN200-110 in myelodysplastic bladders was 4-fold greater than in normal bladders.
 The density of dihydropyridine binding sites in myelodysplastic and normal bladders was similar.
 Our study demonstrated that the pathophysiology of the poorly compliant hyperreflexic bladder is not related to up regulation of dihydropyridine calcium channel receptors or alterations in the response of detrusor muscle to calcium ions.
 The relative abundance of calcium channel receptors in the normal and myelodysplastic bladders, and the regulation of detrusor contraction by calcium ions suggest that calcium channel receptors have a meaningful role in detrusor function.
