Ablepharon macrostomia syndrome.
 The association of congenital ablepharon with the absence of eyelashes and eyebrows, a wide mouth (macrostomia), and auricular, nasal, genital, and other systemic anomalies has been termed the ablepharon macrostomia syndrome.
 One such case is reported which illustrates the importance of immediate postnatal ocular management to minimise severe visual loss.
