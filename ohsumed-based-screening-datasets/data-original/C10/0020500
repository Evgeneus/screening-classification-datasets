Significance of magnetic resonance imaging in acute head injury.
 One hundred seventy-seven patients who had incurred head trauma were studied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 Patients varied from those with mild injury without any focal neurological deficit to those with severe injury with post-traumatic coma.
 Altogether, 177 lesions were demonstrated by MRI in 123 of 177 patients within 3 days of injury using T2-weighted (SE2000/40,2000/111) and T1-weighted (IR1500/500/40) multislice sequences.
 In contrast, computerized tomography (CT) demonstrated 103 lesions in 90 patients.
 MRI was superior to CT in the diagnosis of nonhemorrhagic contusions demonstrated as a high-intensity area on T2-weighted imaging.
 MRI provided some information to evaluate the severity of diffuse axonal injury or to predict delayed traumatic intracerebral hematoma (DTICH).
