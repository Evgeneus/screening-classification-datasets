Operative and conservative treatment of moderate spondylolisthesis in young patients.
 We made a retrospective study of 149 children and adolescents with moderate spondylolisthesis (slip less than or equal to 30%), 77 treated by fusion and 72 conservatively at an average follow-up of 13.3 years.
 Both groups were fully comparable with regard to age at diagnosis, sex distribution (46% girls), and mean slip.
 The patients who were treated operatively had more pain before treatment and showed more initial progression of the slip.
 They had better clinical results and less pain at latest review, but the total progression of the slip over the whole follow-up showed no statistical differences between the two groups.
 Patients with a pseudarthrosis after attempted fusion had had a longer period of postoperative pain, but at the latest review had no more pain than those with sound fusion.
 None of those treated conservatively came to fusion later and the long-term results in 18 patients who had refused the advised operation were no worse than those for other conservatively treated patients.
 Our results suggest that a moderate grade of spondylolisthesis in adolescents usually has a benign course.
 It seems that spontaneous segmental stabilisation occurs as a result of degeneration of the disc at the level of the slip.
