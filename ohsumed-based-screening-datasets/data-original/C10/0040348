The modified buccal musculomucosal flap method for cleft palate surgery.
 We have reported previously on a palatoplasty method, called the T-shaped musculomucosal buccal flap method, for the primary repair of a cleft palate.
 This method has been used on more than 90 patients, and satisfactory outcomes have resulted in terms of maxillar development, the prevention of fistulation, and verbal functions.
 However, 14.3 percent of these patients exhibited a velopharyngeal incompetence that showed no potential improvement through training.
 In the majority of these patients, the entire raw surface of the oral cavity side could not be covered with a buccal musculomucosal flap, and as a result, postoperative contraction of the soft palate occurred.
 Thus a new surgical method has proven effective in which both buccal musculomucosal flaps are used as an oral lining, the nasal mucosa having been extended by Z-plasty.
 We have performed 25 operations using this new method and have observed no postoperative contractions of the soft palate, notwithstanding two cases (8.0 percent) of postoperative fistulation.
