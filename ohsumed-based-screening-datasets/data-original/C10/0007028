Recurrent lateral rectus palsy in childhood.
 Five patients with recurrent, lateral rectus palsy in childhood, examined at the University of Iowa Hospitals over a period of 22 years, are reported.
 During the same period, 131 abducens nerve palsy patients, younger than 18 years of age, were evaluated.
 Eighteen similar patients, most single case reports, are reviewed from the literature.
 All reported patients, including our own, shared the following features: spontaneous recovery within 6 months in the majority of patients, ipsilateral recurrence, and painless palsy.
 There is female and left-sided preponderance.
 Etiology is undetermined.
 Hypotheses include viral etiology, neurovascular compression by aberrant artery, and migraine.
