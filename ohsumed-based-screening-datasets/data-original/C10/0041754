The I-Abm12 mutation, which confers resistance to experimental myasthenia gravis, drastically affects the epitope repertoire of murine CD4+ cells sensitized to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.
 Susceptibility to experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG), which is induced in mice by injection of purified Torpedo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (TAChR), is influenced by the I-A locus products, which restrict presentation of AChR Th epitopes.
 The bm12 mutation of the I-Ab molecule in the C57BL/6 strain, which is highly susceptible to EAMG, yields the EAMG resistant mutant B6.C-H-2bm12 (bm12).
 We investigated here the consequences of the bm 12 mutation on the CD4+ response to the TAChR alpha subunit.
 Upon immunization with TAChR, CD4+ cells became sensitized to TAChR and anti-AChR antibodies were produced in both bm12 and C57BL/6 strains.
 Overlapping synthetic peptides, corresponding to the complete sequence of TAChR alpha subunit, were used to identify Th epitopes.
 CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized peptides T alpha 150-169, T alpha 181-200, and T alpha 360-378.
 CD4+ cells from bm12 mice did not respond to any synthetic sequence.
 Upon injection of the three C57BL/6 Th epitope peptides, either individually or as a pool, CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice recognized each peptide and TAChR.
 Therefore they recognized epitopes similar or identical to those originated from TAChR processing.
 CD4+ cells from bm12 mice injected with the same peptides responded to T alpha 360-378 strongly, to a lesser extent to T alpha 181-200, never to peptide T alpha 150-169.
 Only CD4+ cells sensitized against the T epitope peptide T alpha 181-200 responded to TAChR.
 We tested if lack of response to T alpha 150-169, and the low response to T alpha 181-200, was due to inability of the I-Abm12 molecule to present the T epitope peptides.
 bm12 and C57BL/6 APC were used to present the T epitope peptides to specifically sensitized CD4+ cells from C57BL/6 mice.
 All T epitope peptides were presented by bm12 APC, although T alpha 150-169 was presented less efficiently than by C57BL/6 APC.
 Resistance to EAMG induced by the bm12 mutation may be due to the change in the epitope repertoire of AChR-specific Th cells, and lack of recognition of otherwise immunodominant Th epitopes.
 For at least one epitope this might be due to absence of potentially reactive, specific CD4+ clones.
