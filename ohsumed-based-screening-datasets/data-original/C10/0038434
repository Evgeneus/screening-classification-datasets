Efficacy of desipramine in painful diabetic neuropathy: a placebo-controlled trial.
 Although amitriptyline relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, side effects often preclude effective treatment.
 Desipramine has the least anticholinergic and sedative effects of the first generation tricyclic antidepressants.
 We compared a 6 week course of desipramine (mean dose, 201 mg/day) to active placebo in 20 patients with painful diabetic neuropathy in a double-blind crossover trial.
 Pain relief with desipramine was statistically significant in weeks 5 and 6.
 Eleven patients reported at least moderate relief with desipramine, compared to 2 with placebo.
 Pain relief tended to be greater in depressed patients, but relief was also observed in patients who did not show an antidepressant effect.
 We conclude that desipramine relieves pain in many patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, offering an alternative for patients unable to tolerate amitriptyline.
 Blockade of norepinephrine reuptake, an action shared by desipramine, amitriptyline, and other antidepressants proven effective in neuropathic pain, may mediate this analgesic effect.
