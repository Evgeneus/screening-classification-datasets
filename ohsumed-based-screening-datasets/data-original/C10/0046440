Effect of DN-1417 on photosensitivity and cortically kindled seizure in Senegalese baboons, Papio papio.
 The effect of DN-1417, a thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) analogue, on photosensitivity and cortically kindled seizures was examined in seven Senegalese baboons (Papio papio).
 Intravenous (i.v.) administration of 2 mg/kg had no effect on either photosensitivity or cortically kindled seizures.
 When this agent was administered intracisternally, both the photomyoclonic response and cortically kindled seizures were suppressed for 4-5 days.
 A study of the transcallosal response also showed a long-lasting attenuation of the early positive wave (P1) amplitude (peak latency, 5-10 ms) elicited by a single stimulus after cisternal injection of DN-1417.
 These findings are consistent with the assumption that endogenous TRH is involved in suppression of epileptic seizures.
