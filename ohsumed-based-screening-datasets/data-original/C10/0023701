Continuous muscle fiber activity, peripheral neuropathy, and thymoma.
 Two patients, one of them with myasthenia gravis, presented symptoms of continuous muscle fiber activity syndrome before discovery of a thymoma.
 Peripheral neuropathy was present in both patients, with axonal and demyelinating lesions in sural nerve biopsy.
 The syndrome remained unchanged or worse after thymectomy.
 Both patients died of associated complications.
