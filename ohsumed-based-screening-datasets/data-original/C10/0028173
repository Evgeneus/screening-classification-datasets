Clinical survey of ischemic cerebrovascular disease in children in a district of Japan.
 Ischemic cerebrovascular disease in children is relatively rare.
 To clarify the clinical features of ischemic stroke occurring in infants and children, we evaluated 54 cases of cerebral infarction, excluding cases of moyamoya disease, in patients less than 16 years old at 24 clinics in the Tohoku (northeast) district of Japan.
 We observed two incidence peaks, one in little children and the other in junior high school students.
 Infection and minor head trauma were more frequently seen prior to ischemic strokes than was heart disease.
 The middle cerebral artery region, including the basal ganglia, was most commonly affected (49 patients, 91%) on computed tomograms.
 Angiography was performed in 48 patients (89%) and showed various types of occlusive lesions, mostly affecting the middle cerebral artery.
 Hemiparesis was the most common form of disability following ischemic strokes (48 patients, 89%).
 Surgical treatment was carried out in seven patients (13%).
 The clinical course of these cases showed that the recovery of children after a stroke tends to be better than that of adults, but that permanent disabilities, such as hemiparesis or mental retardation, occur commonly.
 Further investigation of juvenile cerebrovascular disease is important to prevent ischemic strokes in children.
