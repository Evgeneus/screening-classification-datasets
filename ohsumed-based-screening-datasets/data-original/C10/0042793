Determination of cerebrospinal fluid shunt obstruction with magnetic resonance phase imaging.
 The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow rates in 12 patients with symptoms suggestive of CSF shunt obstruction were measured with magnetic resonance (MR) phase imaging.
 The shunts were imaged over the skull, just distal to any reservoir, using a curved surface coil.
 Images perpendicular to the direction of flow were made on a 1.5-tesla clinical unit with a flow-sensitive pulse sequence.
 The patients' ages ranged from 2 months to 28 years.
 All patients had ancillary investigations to determine the functional status of the shunt.
 No flow was detected in seven patients with blocked shunts.
 Flow rates between 3 and 40 cc/hr were found in three patients with functioning shunts.
 Two patients, one with a blocked shunt and one with a functioning shunt, could not be imaged due to motion artifact.
 Magnetic resonance phase imaging is a promising technique in the determination of CSF shunt obstruction.
