Explicit memory and repetition priming in depression. Preliminary findings.
 Explicit memory and repetition priming, a form of implicit memory, were examined in depressed patients and controls.
 Explicit memory of depressed patients was severely impaired, whereas repetition priming was intact.
 These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the impairment of memory in depression is linked to a failure of effort-demanding cognitive processes.
 Repetition priming might be useful in differentiating between depression and dementia.
