Differential activation within costal diaphragm during rapid-eye-movement sleep in cats.
 Simultaneous recordings of the diaphragmatic electromyogram (EMG) were made from two separate regions of the costal diaphragm in six normal cats.
 The diaphragmatic activities were always synchronous and the amplitudes and rates of rise were similar during slow-wave sleep.
 In contrast, during natural rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, different activity was often present in the two leads.
 These differences were in the time of onset and offset, as well as in the amplitude and spike patterns, and occurred in approximately 5-20% of the diaphragmatic bursts averaged over the entire REM sleep period.
 With respect to eye movement density, the rate of differential activation was higher during periods of high density (26%) than in the absence of eye movements (1%) in the four animals for which these data were available.
 Differential activation of portions of the costal diaphragm is apparently a normal event of REM sleep.
 This could result from descending state-specific phasic neuronal activity that bypasses the medullary respiratory generator.
 Differential activation of portions of the diaphragm could contribute to disordered ventilation during REM sleep.
