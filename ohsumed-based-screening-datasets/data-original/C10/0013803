Attenuated neuropathology by nilvadipine after middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats.
 We investigated the effects of nilvadipine, a calcium antagonist, on cerebral ischemia in rats.
 Under halothane anesthesia, 30 rats had a 3-0 nylon suture introduced through the extracranial internal carotid artery to occlude the left middle cerebral artery.
 Nilvadipine was dissolved in polyethylene glycol 400.
 Immediately following occlusion, group 1 rats (n = 10) were treated subcutaneously with vehicle and group 2 and 3 rats were treated with 1.0 (n = 10) and 3.2 (n = 10) mg/kg nilvadipine, respectively.
 Perfusion fixation was performed 24 hours later, and the histopathologic outcomes were quantified.
 In group 1 infarct volume was 28.2 +/- 11.4% of the total cerebral volume; in groups 2 and 3 infarct volumes were 25.5 +/- 11.6% (NS) and 13.9 +/- 9.2% (p less than 0.05 different from group 1), respectively.
 Nilvadipine decreased ischemic neuronal injury in a dose-dependent manner and may be of use in the treatment of cerebral ischemia.
