Pressure-diameter relationships of the upper airway in awake supine subjects.
 In awake supine normal subjects, dimensional changes of the oropharyngeal airway were measured during exposure to negative intraluminal pressures.
 The pressure was generated 1) "actively" by subjects inspiring against an externally occluded airway or 2) "passively" by external suction at the mouth during voluntary glottic closure with no inspiratory effort.
 Airway dimensions were imaged with X-ray fluoroscopy and anteroposterior diameters measured at levels corresponding to cervical vertebra 3 and 4 (C3 and C4).
 Cephalad axial displacement of the hyoid bone (CDHY) was also measured.
 During the "active" maneuver, airway diameters and position were maintained at resting levels despite airway pressure up to -15 cmH2O.
 In contrast, during the passive maneuver at -15 cmH2O, C3 was only 15 +/- 9% and C4 only 47 +/- 8% of control; CDHY was 5.6 +/- 1.8 mm.
 In three subjects airway wall apposition occurred and persisted until an active inspiratory effort.
 We conclude that, in the absence of inspiratory effort, negative oropharyngeal airway pressures result in marked narrowing and cephalad displacement of the upper airway, even during wakefulness.
 Therefore, our data suggest that the complex interaction of upper airway and thoracic muscle activity is critical in determining the effective compliance and patency of the upper airway, which is readily collapsible even in normal subjects.
