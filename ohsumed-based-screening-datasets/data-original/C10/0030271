The effect of preoperative flurbiprofen on miosis produced by acetylcholine during cataract surgery.
 Sustained pupillary dilation during cataract surgery may be achieved with preoperative noncorticosteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as flurbiprofen.
 However, these agents may interfere with miosis after injection of acetylcholine.
 Thirty patients for extracapsular cataract extraction were randomly assigned in a double-masked fashion to receive either a placebo or preoperative 0.03% flurbiprofen every 30 minutes for four doses.
 All patients also received three doses of 2.5% phenylephrine and 2% cyclopentolate.
 Pupillary diameter was measured the day before surgery, immediately before the surgical incision, immediately before and five minutes after acetylcholine injection, and the morning after surgery.
 The flurbiprofen group had a larger mean pupillary diameter before injection of acetylcholine (P less than .001), five minutes after acetylcholine (P less than .001), and on the first postoperative day (P less than .005).
