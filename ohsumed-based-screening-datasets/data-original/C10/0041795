Dementia presenting with aphasia: clinical characteristics.
 Dementia, a disorder of multiple cognitive functions, may atypically present as an aphasia.
 The clinical characteristics are reported of 13 patients with up to 14 years of progressive language impairment before developing dementia.
 In reviewing the literature, it was found that these patients were similar to those reported with progressive aphasia.
 It is concluded that dementia may present with an anomic, dysfluent language disorder due to the focal left sylvian onset of several dementing illnesses.
