Enveloping the bladder with displacement of flap of the rectus abdominis muscle for the treatment of neurogenic bladder.
 Neurogenic bladder is a frequent occurrence.
 A new surgical technique has been designed and was used successfully in 18 patients with ideal results.
 The key point of the operation is to turn over a flap of rectus abdominis muscle to envelop the bladder.
 Contraction of the muscle flap and the abdominal muscles would enhance voiding ability.
 In the meantime, the bladder is displaced forward and the resultant change in the bladder-posterior urethral angle also favors voiding.
 Since the bladder is near the anterior abdominal wall manual compression during voiding is made easier.
 All of these advantages greatly facilitate voiding.
