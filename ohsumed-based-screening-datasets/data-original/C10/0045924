Predictive value of brainstem evoked response in the diagnosis of acoustic neuroma.
 Predictive value positive is the probability that a positive test result represents a true positive finding.
 Twenty-six patients with brainstem evoked response findings characteristic of retrocochlear hearing loss were studied.
 Four acoustic neuromas were diagnosed in this group after radiologic workup.
 The predictive value in this population was 15%.
 Statistical considerations are presented.
