Entrapment neuropathy of the median nerve at the level of the ligament of Struthers.
 The presence of a supracondylar process and Struthers' ligament is a rare congenital anomaly that may cause compression of either the median nerve, the brachial artery, or both.
 The authors present a case in which the supracondylar process and Struthers' ligament compressed both the median nerve and the brachial artery.
 This case is unusual, in that the symptoms of compression of the brachial artery increased--namely, the pulse intensity decreased and the pain increased with elbow flexion.
