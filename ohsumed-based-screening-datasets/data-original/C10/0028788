Carotid endarterectomy in Great Britain and Ireland: trends and current practice.
 Of 309 questionnaires on carotid endarterectomy sent to all surgeons in Great Britain and Ireland who might use this technique, 298 (96 per cent) were returned.
 In all, 110 (37 per cent) of 298 surgeons performed at least one carotid endarterectomy in 1989; 67 performed less than 10 and 43 greater than 10.
 In total, these 110 surgeons performed 1417 operations in 1989, a situation that has changed little over 5 years since the previous survey.
 Transient ischaemic attack and minor stroke remain the main indications for carotid endarterectomy; the operation was hardly ever performed for asymptomatic stenosis.
 By 1989 almost all surgeons initially assessed prospective patients using a technique less invasive than conventional angiography; duplex scanning was used 'always' or 'sometimes' by 70 per cent of surgeons.
 While 72 per cent of surgeons in 1984 'always' required conventional angiograms before operation, by 1989 only 21 per cent did so, most now relying on less invasive techniques.
 During operation there was an increasing use of shunts, carotid sinus nerve blockade and patch closure of the arteriotomy.
 The overall number of carotid endarterectomies performed annually in Great Britain and Ireland has remained steady over the past 5 years and is relatively low for a population of 60 millions.
 An increase in the number of surgeons performing the operation is almost entirely accounted for by an increase in those performing less than 10 carotid endarterectomies per year.
