The use of an intraluminal shunt for bypass grafts of the cavernous internal carotid artery. Technical note.
 The authors describe an indwelling intraluminal shunt for use during graft bypass procedures of the cavernous internal carotid artery.
 The clinical use of this shunt in a patient with meningioma invading the right cavernous sinus is described.
 This shunt has also been found applicable during carotid endarterectomy, and should prove to be a useful addition to the neurosurgical armamentarium for skull-base surgery.
