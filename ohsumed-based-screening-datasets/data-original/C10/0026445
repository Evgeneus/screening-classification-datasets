Extraocular muscle surgery in myasthenia gravis.
 Myasthenia gravis is typically a disease of young people in active employment who need a field of binocular single vision.
 Although it is systemically controllable with a good chance of spontaneous remission, persistent loss of binocularity may cause chronic disability.
 We report our experience of extraocular muscle surgery in five patients with stable myasthenia gravis and persistent double vision.
 Extraocular muscle involvement was selective, giving rise to incomitant and concomitant squints, with individual muscle overactions as well as underactions.
 Treatment was by conventional recession and resection procedures with the additional use of Faden and adjustable sutures where appropriate.
 In all five cases a larger, stable field of binocular single vision was established.
 It is concluded that extraocular muscle surgery may be beneficial in selected cases of myasthenia gravis.
