The use of transdermal scopolamine to control drooling. A case report.
 Drooling is a serious social handicap experienced by some neurologically impaired patients.
 No one method has been identified to control drooling for all patients, however, anticholinergic drugs recently have been utilized.
 In the case study described, transdermal scopolamine patches were found to be effective for controlling drooling in a traumatic brain-injured patient for whom more conservative methods failed.
 From a baseline saliva flow rate, saliva flow decreased an average of 30% with one-patch and 59% with two-patch dosing.
 No significant side effects were observed with treatment, and the decrease in drooling was maintained for a 4-month period.
 Although transdermal scopolamine may represent one acceptable facet of long-term treatment, it must be stressed that efficacy is variable across patient populations and that treatment approaches must be individualized.
