Botulinum treatment of childhood strabismus.
 Four hundred thirteen children ranging in age from 2 months to 12 years were treated for strabismus by botulinum injection of extraocular muscles.
 An average of 1.7 injections per patient was given.
 Follow-up at an average of 26 months after the last injection (minimum, 6 months) was available on 362 children (88%).
 The frequency of correction of 10 prism diopters (PD) or less in various groups of strabismus cases was: all 362 cases, 61%; all esotropia, 66%; infantile esotropia, 65%; and exotropia, 45%.
 Smaller deviations (10-20 PD) were more frequently corrected (73%) than were larger deviations (20-110 PD, 54%).
 The frequency of correction to 10 PD or less of previously operated cases was not different from that of unoperated cases.
 There was no globe perforation, amblyopia, or visual loss produced by the injection treatment in this series.
