Experimental nerve root compression. A model of acute, graded compression of the porcine cauda equina and an analysis of neural and vascular anatomy.
 Nerve root compression has been suggested as one important pathogenetic factor in low-back pain syndromes and sciatica.
 The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms are, however, incompletely known, partly because of the lack of experimental data on this topic.
 In the present study, a model for experimental compression of the porcine sacrococcygeal cauda equina is presented.
 The model consists of surgical exposure of the cauda equina and compression of the cauda equina toward the ventral aspect of the spinal canal by an inflatable balloon fixed to the spine.
 This compression system was shown to have a high accuracy in pressure transmission from the balloon to the cauda equina.
 The gross and microscopic neural anatomy and the vascular anatomy of the porcine cauda equina were analyzed with light microscopic and ink-perfusion techniques.
 The porcine cauda equina showed a close anatomic resemblance to the human lumbosacral cauda equina.
 The presented model offers unique possibilities for experimental studies on nerve root compression injury because of the easy surgical exposure and the sufficient length of the nerve roots.
 In separate studies, this model, along with investigations of solute transport to the nerve tissue and of impulse propagation, has been used to analyze the effects of acute, graded compression on blood flow and edema formation in the cauda equina.
 The porcine cauda equina would also be particularly suitable for chronic compression studies because any neurologic deficit acquired would be restricted to the tail.
