Captopril improves neurologic outcome from incomplete cerebral ischemia in rats.
 We investigated the effects of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril on neurologic outcome in a rat model of incomplete cerebral ischemia.
 Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized with 70% nitrous oxide in oxygen and fentanyl (10 micrograms x kg-1 i.v.
 bolus, 25 micrograms x kg-1 x hr-1 i.v.
 continuous infusion).
 Animals in group 1 (n = 10) received no angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor while animals in group 2 (n = 10) were given 10 mg x kg-1 i.v.
 captopril 30 minutes prior to the ischemic period.
 Ischemia was produced by unilateral carotid artery ligation and hemorrhagic hypotension to 35 mm Hg for 30 minutes.
 Body temperature, arterial blood gases, and arterial pH were maintained constant.
 Neurologic outcome was evaluated every 24 hours for 3 days using a graded deficit score (0, normal; 18, stroke-related death).
 On the third day after ischemia, captopril significantly improved neurologic outcome (median deficit score = 4) compared with controls (median deficit score = 18) (p less than 0.05).
 These results suggest that reduced angiotensin II levels or increased tissue kinin concentrations may decrease ischemic brain injury.
