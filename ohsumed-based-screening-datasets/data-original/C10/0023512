Compressive neuropathy of spinal nerve roots. A mechanical or biological problem?
 Pathophysiologically, nerve root pain production is a complex issue.
 For many years, mechanical compression has been regarded as the sole cause for such pain.
 There are indications, however, that other factors, such as intraneural inflammation, may be of importance in this context.
 In this article, four cases are presented in which nerve root related pain gradually resolved without any proven change in the mechanical deformation of the involved nerve root.
 The data presented here suggest that mechanical compression, per se, may not always be the sole cause of radicular pain and dysfunction.
 These findings suggest that improvement is needed in our understanding of the pathophysiology of nerve root compression and inflammation.
