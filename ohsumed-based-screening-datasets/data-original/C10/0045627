Carcinoma of the prostate. Treating disease that has metastasized.
 Common manifestations of metastatic carcinoma of the prostate are bone pain, spinal cord compression, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.
 Prostate-specific antigen represents a useful marker to monitor tumor progression and response to therapy.
 Until recently, no therapy was available to prolong survival in these patients.
 Now, the use of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate [Lupron]) plus an antiandrogen (flutamide [Eulexin]) to provide total androgen blockade has demonstrated a 25% increase in survival time.
