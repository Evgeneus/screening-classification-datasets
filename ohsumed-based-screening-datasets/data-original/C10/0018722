Reversible hearing loss from cerebellopontine angle tumors.
 We report two patients who presented with a dramatic recovery from severe sensorineural hearing loss after total surgical removal of cerebellopontine angle tumors (meningioma and jugular foramen neurinoma).
 The factors that differentiate these "non-acoustic tumors" in relation to the prognosis for hearing are discussed.
 A surgical approach that maintains the labyrinthine structure and preserves the arachnoid membrane of the superior cerebellopontine angle cistern during tumor removal is stressed.
