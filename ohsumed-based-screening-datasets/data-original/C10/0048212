Functional results after total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation.
 Locally advanced tongue cancer is a devastating disease for which there are limited therapeutic options that will result in a high rate of cure while preserving function.
 To determine the oncologic effectiveness of total or near total glossectomy with laryngeal preservation and the possibility of speech and swallowing rehabilitation following treatment, we reviewed our experience with 27 patients treated between 1982 and 1989.
 Twenty-four patients were eligible for 2-year follow-up and their disease-specific survival was 51%.
 Swallowing was achieved initially in 18 patients (67%), while 12 had successful long-term deglutition (44%).
 Oral communication was accomplished in 25 patients (92%).
 Significant aspiration occurred in three patients and was severe enough to require interval laryngectomy in two patients.
 The role of laryngeal suspension, palatal augmentation prosthesis, and videofluoroscopy as rehabilitation adjuncts for the total glossectomy patient are described.
