MR anatomy and pathology of the hypothalamus.
 The hypothalamus, the ventral-most portion of the diencephalon, surrounds the anterior inferior portion of the third ventricle (Fig.
 1).
 It functions primarily as an integrative mechanism for various autonomic and neuroendocrine activities including temperature regulation, water balance, behavior, and appetite.
 This pictorial essay illustrates the value of MR in depicting the normal anatomy and abnormalities of the hypothalamic region.
