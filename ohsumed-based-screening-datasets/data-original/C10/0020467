Intracranial pressure and cerebrospinal fluid outflow conductance in healthy subjects.
 Conductance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) outflow (Cout) is an important parameter to be considered in patients with CSF circulation abnormalities.
 In patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus it is the single most important parameter in determining if the patient needs CSF shunting.
 The lower normal limit for Cout has been estimated from the effect of shunting in patients with normal-pressure hydrocephalus, from patients retrospectively reevaluated after recovering from illness, and from patients with known abnormalities in the brain or the CSF system.
 The true value of Cout in normal individuals, however, has hitherto not been reported.
 In the present study, Cout has been measured by a lumbar infusion test in eight young volunteers with no suspicion of disease.
 The mean intracranial pressure (ICP) was 11 mm Hg and a linear relationship was found between CSF absorption and ICP.
 The mean Cout was 0.11 ml/min/mm Hg and the lower 95% confidence level was 0.10 ml/min/mm Hg.
 These values are in accordance with those obtained from previous studies.
