Sternohyoid muscle biopsy. A diagnostic technique in respiratory failure of neuromuscular origin.
 Patients with neuromuscular disease may develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation.
 We describe a sternohyoid muscle biopsy technique as a diagnostic aid in such patients undergoing tracheostomy for prolonged ventilatory support.
 The biopsy procedure is quick and without added discomfort or morbidity for the patient.
 Our preliminary observations in three patients suggest that the sternohyoid muscle biopsy may be a useful diagnostic tool in this selected group of patients.
