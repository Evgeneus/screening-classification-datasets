Carcinomatous meningitis: antibody-guided therapy with I-131 HMFG1.
 Seven patients with carcinomatous meningitis were administered intrathecal I-131 labelled monoclonal antibody HMFG1.
 Clinical responses were seen in two patients, with a long term survivor at 32 months.
 Aseptic meningitis occurred in 4/7 patients, but more serious toxicity was observed in the form of seizures (2/7 patients) and myelosuppression (3/7 patients).
 Partial obliteration of the subarachnoid space was identified as a potential problem in patients with advanced disease.
