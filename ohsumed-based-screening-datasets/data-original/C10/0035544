Usefulness of a writing device in writer's cramp.
 Fifteen of 20 patients with writer's cramp treated with a writing device noted an improvement in their writing ability, some quite marked.
 Despite this benefit, nine patients preferred to use alternate methods.
 In the absence of adverse effects, we suggest that trials of writing devices be the first recourse for all patients with writer's cramp requiring treatment.
