Clinical usefulness of amitriptyline in fibromyalgia: the results of 23 N-of-1 randomized controlled trials.
 Twenty-three double blind, randomized, multiple crossover trials (N-of-1 RCT) of amitriptyline were conducted in patients with fibromyalgia.
 The benefit of amitriptyline was assessed using a symptom questionnaire and count of tender points.
 To assess the usefulness of the method, the proportion of trials that provided a definite answer was examined.
 Completing the trial resulted in reaching a high degree of confidence in the final management decision in 74% of trials.
 In 35% of trials, results led to discontinuation of the drug which otherwise would have been continued indefinitely.
 The drug benefit, if present, was evident within first 2 weeks of therapy.
 We concluded that these results support the feasibility and usefulness of N-of-1 RCT in rheumatology practice.
