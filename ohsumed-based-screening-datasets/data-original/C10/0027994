Management of nasal fractures.
 Fracture of the nasal skeleton is a relatively common injury.
 Satisfactory treatment requires appropriate skills, diagnosis, and management.
 Some injuries require immediate attention; others are better treated in delayed fashion.
 Closed reduction provides satisfactory treatment in the majority of nasal fractures; however, open reduction often is a more appropriate choice.
 Injuries to the nasal septum should be recognized and given proper treatment.
