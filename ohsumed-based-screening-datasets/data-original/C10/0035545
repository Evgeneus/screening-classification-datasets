Two cases of neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis presenting with myelopathy.
 We describe two patients with autopsy-proven neoplastic angioendotheliomatosis (NAE) presenting only as a transverse myelopathy for 10 to 12 months, followed by disseminated intracranial manifestations.
 Postmortem examination disclosed a vasculocentric distribution of neoplastic cells in various organs that stained positively with B-lymphocyte-specific monoclonal antibody.
 These cases were unusual because they manifested as an isolated myelopathy for many months.
