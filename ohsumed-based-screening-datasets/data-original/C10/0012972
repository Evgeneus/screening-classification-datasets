Problems and solutions of pedicle screw plate fixation of lumbar spine.
 Fifty-seven patients with low back pain and sciatica of various causes were reviewed with reference to problems associated with pedicle plate fixation of the lumbar spine.
 Eleven percent of patients had neurologic problems postoperatively and 3.5% (two patients) had severe sensory impairments.
 All patients had this complication in the early phases of the study.
 Of 297 screws, 17 broke, ie, 5.7%.
 These breakages occurred in 12 of 57 patients (21%).
 In patients with spondylolisthesis, the degree of slip correction averaged 53% postoperatively, which decreased to 35% at the 1-year follow-up.
 Slip angle was maintained after correction.
 Pedicle screw plate fixation is an effective form of immobilization of the lumbar spine used in achieving arthrodesis.
 The surgeon must be fully trained in methodology.
 It is recommended that screw and plate materials be improved to prevent screw breakage.
