The use of cognitive behavior therapy with a normalizing rationale in schizophrenia. Preliminary report.
 Sixty-four consecutively referred patients with schizophrenia were treated with cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy as an adjunct to standard treatment.
 A destigmatizing rationale to explain symptom emergence was devised and supplemented these techniques.
 They proved safe to use and appeared acceptable to patients and their relatives.
 Members of the group are being maintained on low levels of or no medication and have required minimal hospitalization.
 The techniques used are described in detail.
