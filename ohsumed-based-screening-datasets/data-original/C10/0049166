Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis.
 Cerebral dural sinus thrombosis is an unusual syndrome in which a patient presents with a severe headache that may be associated with diverse neurologic and physical findings.
 The case of a 31-year-old woman with headache, vomiting, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, and subsequent dense hemiplegia is presented.
 The patient was diagnosed as having a cerebral dural sinus thrombosis, but only after the diagnosis was missed initially.
 The syndrome may be difficult to detect because it can mimic several other entities.
 There are several known or suspected predisposing factors.
 The syndrome, diagnostic modalities, and therapeutic options are reviewed.
