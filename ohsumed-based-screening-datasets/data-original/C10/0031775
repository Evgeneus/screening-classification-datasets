Index for optimum ventricular catheter length. Technical note.
 The optimum length of a ventricular catheter to be placed in a particular patient may be difficult to determine when either intraoperative ultrasound is not available or considerable time has elapsed between the diagnostic computerized tomography scan and the operation.
 An index for estimating ventricular length based on the head circumference of the individual is described.
 This method was tested clinically and proved to be successful.
