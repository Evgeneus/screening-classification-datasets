Theophylline-associated seizures with "therapeutic" or low toxic serum concentrations: risk factors for serious outcome in adults.
 We report 12 adults with seizures associated with serum theophylline levels between 14 and 35 mg/l.
 The seizures were frequently prolonged, and outcome was generally poor with eight deaths.
 Although we did not identify comparable control groups, possible risk factors for serious outcome in theophylline-associated seizures were age, previous brain injury or disease, severe pulmonary disease, and possibly low serum albumin level.
 In patients with these risk factors, serum theophylline levels should be maintained below 10 to 15 mg/l.
