Incidence of neuropathy in 395 patients with ovarian cancer treated with or without cisplatin.
 In two consecutive trials, a total of 395 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of hexamethylmelamine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil chemotherapeutic regimens including cisplatin or without this drug.
 With respect to neurotoxicity, 387 patients were fully eligible.
 The median follow-up for survival was 45 months.
 Neurotoxicity in any grade of severity developed in 47% of the patients treated with a cisplatin-containing regimen and in 25% of those treated with the non-cisplatin-containing regimen.
 The severity of neurotoxicity was much higher, however, in the cisplatin-treated patients.
 Neurotoxicity-free survival decreased below 50% at cumulative doses of cisplatin between 500 and 600 mg/m2.
 No additional effect of hexamethylmelamine on the incidence or severity of neurotoxicity could be demonstrated.
 In patients who survived for more than 5 years, the incidence of cisplatin neuropathy was 61%.
 Prognostic variables (age, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage, performance status, and others) possibly associated with high-risk subgroups could not be identified.
 The only consistent factor correlated with neurotoxicity was the total dose of cisplatin received.
