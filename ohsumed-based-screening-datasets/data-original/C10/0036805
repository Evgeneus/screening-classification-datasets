Effects of perinatal stroke on striatal amino acid efflux in rats studied with in vivo microdialysis.
 We used in vivo microdialysis to determine the impact of a focal hypoxic-ischemic insult on striatal amino acid efflux in the immature brain.
 Microdialysis probes were inserted into the right striatum of postnatal day 7 rats.
 To induce hypoxic-ischemic injury, the right carotid artery was ligated and the animals were exposed to 8% oxygen for 2.5 hours (n = 22).
 Rats exposed to ligation alone (n = 10) or hypoxia alone (n = 8) and untreated controls (n = 17) were also studied.
 Two hours after probe insertion, a 30-minute baseline microdialysis sample was obtained.
 After arterial ligation, two additional baseline samples were collected.
 Five more samples were collected over the next 2.5 hours (in 8% oxygen or room air).
 Eight amino acids (glutamate, aspartate, taurine, glutamine, alanine, serine, glycine, and asparagine) were consistently detected in dialysates using a high-performance liquid chromatography assay with electrochemical detection.
 In untreated controls, amino acid efflux did not change over 4 hours.
 During hypoxia-ischemia, efflux values fluctuated widely, with marked intra-animal and interanimal variability.
 Efflux peaks for each amino acid were defined as values greater than the highest control mean value plus two standard deviations.
 Glutamate efflux peaks (greater than 7 pmol/min compared with 2 pmol/min at baseline) were detected in no controls and in eight hypoxic-ischemic rats (p = 0.006, Fisher's two-tailed exact test).
 Taurine efflux peaks (greater than 75 pmol/min compared with 10 pmol/min for controls at baseline) were detected in 10 hypoxic-ischemic rats and one control (p = 0.01) and in seven of the eight animals in which glutamate efflux peaks occurred (p = 0.006).
