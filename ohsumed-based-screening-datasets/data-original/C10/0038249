Nontraumatic abdominal aortic thrombosis presenting with anterior spinal artery syndrome and pulmonary edema.
 A 51-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer developed pulmonary edema and lower extremity paraplegia with preservation of proprioception as the initial manifestation of abdominal aortic thrombosis.
 Back pain was present in the lumbar region radiating to buttocks and legs in a bilateral radicular pattern.
 Femoral pulses were initially palpable.
 Aortic angiography revealed complete abdominal aortic occlusion at L3 as well as total occlusion of the bilateral superficial femoral arteries and bilateral common iliac arteries.
 Transient occlusion of the anterior spinal artery due to aortic thrombosis may cause paraplegia and may also progress to renal failure, bowel infarction, and limb loss if left untreated.
 Abdominal aortic thrombosis needs to be considered in a patient who presents with an anterior spinal artery syndrome, which, if present, must be treated as rapidly as possible to preserve motor and sensory function.
