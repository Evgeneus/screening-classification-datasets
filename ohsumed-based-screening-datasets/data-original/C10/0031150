The representation of the visual field in human striate cortex. A revision of the classic Holmes map.
 We have tested the accuracy of Gordon Holmes' retinotopic map of human striate cortex by correlating magnetic resonance scans with homonymous field defects in patients with clearly defined occipital lobe lesions.
 Our findings indicate that Holmes underestimated the cortical magnification of central vision.
 In a revised map of the human striate cortex, we expand the area subserving central vision and reduce the area devoted to peripheral vision.
 These changes bring the map of human striate cortex into agreement with data reported for closely related nonhuman primate species.
