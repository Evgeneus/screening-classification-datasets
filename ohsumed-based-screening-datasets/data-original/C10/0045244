Spinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine.
 The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord.
 Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings.
 Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images.
 In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images.
 This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient.
 Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case.
 Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord.
 Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients.
 Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinomas (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one).
 Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS.
 We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms.
