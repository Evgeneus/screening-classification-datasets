Termination of central sleep apnea episodes by upper airway stimulation using intermittent positive pressure ventilation.
 A 52-year-old man presented with pure central sleep apnea syndrome that failed to respond to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) therapy.
 Intermittent positive pressure stimulation via a nasal mask was instituted using a portable positive pressure ventilator.
 We found marked reduction in the respiratory disturbance index, number of desaturations, and the number of arousals with this mode of therapy.
