Alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin in recurrent malignant glioma.
 The authors entered 43 patients with recurrent malignant glioma in a trial of alternating sequential intracarotid BCNU and cisplatin.
 Protocol design was alternating courses of BCNU (2 doses, 300 to 400 mg each) and cisplatin (2 doses, 150 to 200 mg each) each at 4-week to 6-week intervals.
 Eight of 40 patients (20%) evaluable after the first course of BCNU showed partial or minor response.
 Only 18 patients were evaluable after the first course of cisplatin, and 5 were evaluable after the second course of BCNU.
 Median survival was 9 months (range, 2 weeks to 6 years).
 Cerebral or ocular toxicity unique to this method of chemotherapy administration and failure to show clinical improvement were the most common reasons for removal from study.
 Because of the high attrition rate, the authors were unable to determine a meaningful response to alternating sequential BCNU and cisplatin or to test the clinical degree of cross-resistance to these agents in human malignant glioma.
