Effects of acute, graded compression on spinal nerve root function and structure. An experimental study of the pig cauda equina.
 A well-controlled experimental model for analysis of compression-induced functional changes of the porcine cauda equina is presented.
 The model allows for electrophysiologic investigation of a variety of neurophysiologic changes induced by nerve root deformation.
 At an acute pressure threshold of 50-75 mm Hg, changes in both afferent and efferent conduction are induced.
 With higher compression pressure, a differential recovery in afferent and efferent conduction is seen.
