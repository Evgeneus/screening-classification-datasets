Spike voltage topography identifies two types of frontotemporal epileptic foci.
 We characterized voltage topography of frontotemporal EEG spikes in 24 patients with complex partial seizures and identified two distinct patterns.
 "Type 1" spikes possessed a "dipolar" field with a negative region over the inferolateral temporal scalp and a positive region over the contralateral, centroparietal scalp.
 "Type 2" spikes showed only a broad, frontotemporal negative field.
 One or the other spike type predominated in all but two patients.
 Correlations with clinical data and intracranial EEG suggest that type 2 spikes arise from temporal or frontal neocortex, while type 1 spikes involve mesial temporal structures as well as lateral cortex.
