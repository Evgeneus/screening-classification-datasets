Time spent caregiving and help received by spouses and adult children of brain-impaired adults.
 Caregivers for brain-impaired adults differ in living arrangements, amount of time spent giving care, and assistance received from family and friends and from paid help depending on their kin relationship and employment status.
 Spousal caregivers devote large amounts of time to caregiving, and husbands spend no less time than wives.
 Most caregivers receive little assistance from other family members and friends, but husbands receive more than others.
 Employed spouses receive more paid help than those without jobs, but employment does not affect the amount of paid help received by adult daughters.
