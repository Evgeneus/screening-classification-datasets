Cheilitis granulomatosa: report of six cases and review of the literature.
 Six cases of cheilitis granulomatosa, a rare inflammatory disorder of unknown origin, are reported.
 The condition produces nontender, persistent swelling of one or both lips and affects primarily young adults.
 Histologically, nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation is seen.
 The clinical findings and results of therapy in these six cases are presented.
 One patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil) that stabilized the process.
 One of our patients had vesicular-appearing lesions.
 Microscopic examination showed the lesions to be dilated superficial lymphatic channels, a finding that to our knowledge has not been previously described.
