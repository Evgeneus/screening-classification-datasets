A controlled study of disruptive vocalizations among geriatric residents in nursing homes.
 This paper reports the results of a controlled study comparing geriatric residents in nursing homes who displayed disruptive vocalizations with residents in a comparison group.
 Two 350-bed nursing homes were surveyed, and it was found that 11% of the residents engaged in disruptive vocalizations, at least once per week, of sufficient severity to require consideration in the resident's care plan.
 Results show that disruptive vocalizers were more functionally impaired and were more likely to receive a diagnosis of dementia.
 They were also more likely to display a higher activity level and to experience sleep disturbance and to be prescribed neuroleptic medications.
 Descriptive data are presented on typology of disruptive vocalizations, likely situations for their occurrence, and the utilization and perceived efficacy of common interventions.
 Suggestions are made regarding behavioral treatments for this vexing problem.
