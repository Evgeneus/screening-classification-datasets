Severe sepsis following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
 A patient with life-threatening sepsis following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) is described.
 The urosepsis was complicated by meningitis and diffuse metastatic endophthalmitis necessitating enucleation of the right eye.
 Retinal detachment occurred in the left eye following focal endophthalmitis and the operation yielded a poor functional result.
 The patient was discharged from the hospital 3 months after the ESWL therapy, free of urinary stones.
 The etiology, treatment and prophylaxis of this serious problem are discussed.
