The relationship between MMPI cluster membership and diagnostic category in headache patients.
 Only one study has examined MMPI cluster profiles in the headache population.
 The present study expanded on this previous investigation by using a large sample size (N = 485) and a greater number of diagnostic categories.
 The five MMPI clusters replicated previous findings in the chronic pain literature.
 These MMPI cluster groups were compared to 5 diagnostic categories (migraine, cluster, post-trauma, tension, mixed).
 No relationship was found between cluster type and headache diagnosis.
 While the diagnostic groups were found to differ on measures of pain severity, sex and age, cluster groups did not.
 It is proposed that MMPI scale types reflect a patient's response to pain and are more likely to be the result of coping resources than headache-related personality style.
 Future research with additional, non-pain populations and prospective studies is suggested.
