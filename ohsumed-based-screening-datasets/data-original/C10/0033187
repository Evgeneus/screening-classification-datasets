Fatty infiltration in the liver in medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency.
 Fatty infiltration of the liver at postmortem examination has been recommended as a criterion for selection of infants who have died suddenly and unexpectedly for further biochemical investigation for disorders of fatty acid oxidation.
 We describe a boy with medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency who died four months after diagnosis and in whom only minimal hepatic fatty infiltration was found.
