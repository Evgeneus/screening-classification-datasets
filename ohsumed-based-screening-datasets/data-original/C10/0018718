Iatrogenic saphenous neuralgia: successful therapy with neuroma resection.
 We report the case of a patient with saphenous neuralgia secondary to iatrogenic trauma resulting from bypass surgery in the femoral-popliteal region.
 Early symptoms of this condition were medial calf and ankle pain, with no findings of motor and reflex abnormalities.
 Exploration of the thigh 2 years later revealed a neuroma of the nerve in the distal dissection site, medial to the knee.
 Resection of the neuroma alleviated this condition.
 It is noted that saphenous neuropathy is seen as a spontaneous entrapment syndrome as well as a complication of orthopedic and vascular procedures performed on the medial area of the knee.
 Saphenous neuralgia is often not recognized by neurosurgeons.
 If the condition is intractable, it does respond to surgical therapy.
