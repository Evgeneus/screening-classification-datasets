Trace elements and plasmapheresis.
 The relationship between serum aluminum (Al), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and iron (Fe) and plasmapheresis (PP) treatment was examined.
 Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis, six with myasthenia gravis, and 6 with multiple sclerosis were studied.
 Serum Al, Zn, Cu, and Fe were measured before and after PP.
 Plasma was separated by first filtration; a second filtration separated the plasma components.
 Three liters of plasma were treated in each PP session.
 With each PP treatment, total protein (TP) removed was 20 +/- 5% and serum albumin removed was +/- 6%.
 Serum Al rose significantly (p less than 0.01 from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 2.8 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl post-PP.
 Serum Zn, Cu, and Fe decreased significantly (p less than 0.01) from 86.2 +/- 7.4 micrograms/dl, 126 +/- 18 micrograms/dl, and 108 +/- 14 micrograms/dl pre-PP to 58.4 +/- 10.2 micrograms/dl, 104 +/- 6 micrograms/dl, and 82 +/- 16 micrograms/dl post-PP, respectively.
 Two days after the end of the six-month PP treatment, serum Al levels rose significantly (p less than 0.01), from 1.1 +/- 0.2 micrograms/dl to 3.6 +/- 0.8 micrograms/dl.
 However, serum TP, serum albumin, and serum Zn, Cu, and Fe did not change significantly.
 It thus appears essential in PP treated patients, to remove Al from the blood to protect against aluminum intoxication.
