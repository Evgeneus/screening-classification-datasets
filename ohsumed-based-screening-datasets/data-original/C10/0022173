Mycosis fungoides-like lesions associated with phenytoin and carbamazepine therapy.
 We report the cases of four patients who were taking the anticonvulsant drugs phenytoin or carbamazepine and in whom skin lesions developed that showed histologic features suggestive of mycosis fungoides.
 Two patients had a solitary lesion on the trunk, whereas the other two patients had multiple plaques.
 In all four patients systemic signs were absent.
