Acute naming deficits following dominant temporal lobectomy: prediction by age at 1st risk for seizures.
 Age at 1st risk for seizures may predict anomia following dominant anterior temporal lobectomy.
 We assessed confrontation naming before and 2 to 3 weeks after surgery in 45 right-handed patients grouped by side of focus and presence or absence of early (less than or equal to 5 years) risk factors.
 After left lobectomy, 6 of 10 (60%) patients with no early risks demonstrated significant decline (greater than or equal to 25%) in naming, but none of the patients with early risks showed this decline.
 After right lobectomy, there was no change.
 Cerebral representation of naming may be atypical in patients with early risks.
