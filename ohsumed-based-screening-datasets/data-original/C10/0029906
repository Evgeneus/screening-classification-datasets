Deglutition syncope with coexistent carotid sinus hypersensitivity.
 A 63-year-old man had symptomatic deglutition-induced atrioventricular (A-V) block.
 There was also a coexistent mixed type carotid sinus hypersensitivity presenting as A-V block.
 No A-V nodal dysfunction was revealed during electrophysiologic studies.
 The vasodepressor response to carotid massage implies a central vagal hyperresponsiveness, which can also explain the cardioinhibitory responses to swallowing and carotid sinus massage, both possibly unmasked by posterior myocardial infarction.
