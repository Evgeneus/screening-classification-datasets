Severity of obstructive sleep apnea.
 A four-level severity scale for obstructive sleep apnea is offered using four criteria: maximum oxygen desaturation, apnea/hyponea index, symptoms of excessive day-time sleepiness, and symptoms of related cardiac disease.
 Oxygen desaturation and the apnea/hyponea index for 175 patients, all having had uvulopalatopharyngoplasty surgery, showed 19% mild, 33% moderate, 17% moderately severe, and 31% severe obstructive sleep apnea.
 There was a very poor correlation between oxygen desaturations and number of obstructive events, which demands that both be used in any estimation of disease severity.
