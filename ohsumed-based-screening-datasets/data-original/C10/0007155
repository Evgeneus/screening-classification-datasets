Evaluation and treatment of mental disorders in patients with AIDS.
 Mental symptoms are common in patients with AIDS.
 Optimal management involves the identification and treatment of underlying mental disorders rather than symptomatic treatment alone.
 Organic mental disorders are very frequent in AIDS, particularly with seriously ill patients who are medical inpatients.
 There is a high priori probability that such common symptoms as agitation, irritability, and insomnia will be caused by an organic mental disorder.
 Psychopharmacology in the patient with AIDS requires considerable caution.
 Lower doses and careful surveillance for subtle neuropsychiatric side effects are necessary.
 Routine medical contact with a compassionate physician may be of inestimable value to the patient in coping with the fear and dread that surround the illness.
