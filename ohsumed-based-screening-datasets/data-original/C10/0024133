Brain-stem auditory evoked responses in 56 patients with acoustic neurinoma.
 The brain-stem auditory evoked responses (BAER's) recorded from 56 patients with acoustic neurinomas were analyzed.
 Ten of the patients had intracanalicular tumors and 46 had extracanalicular tumors.
 It was possible to obtain BAER's following stimulation of the affected side in 28 patients and after stimulation of the unaffected side in all 56.
 Five patients (11%) had normal BAER's following stimulation of both sides; three of these patients had intracanalicular tumors.
 Among BAER's obtained following stimulation of the affected ear, the mean interpeak latency (IPL) for peaks I to III associated with extracanalicular tumors was significantly prolonged relative to controls (p less than 0.001), and linear regression analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between tumor size and IPL of peaks I to III (p less than 0.05).
 Analysis of the 56 BAER's recorded after stimulation of the unaffected side revealed a significant positive correlation between the IPL's of peaks III to V and tumor size (p less than 0.001).
 This correlation was not strengthened when accounting for the degree of brain-stem compression.
 Finally, evidence of preserved function within the auditory pathway, even in the presence of partial hearing loss, is presented.
 This finding suggests that more patients might benefit from surgical procedures that spare the eighth cranial nerve.
