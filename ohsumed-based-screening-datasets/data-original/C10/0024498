Intraspinal neurothekeoma (nerve sheath myxoma). A report of two cases.
 Neurothekeomas (nerve sheath myxomas) are rare benign cutaneous tumors.
 The authors describe two spinal intradural cases that show histologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic features identical to their cutaneous counterparts.
 The authors' findings suggest histogenesis from Schwann's cells or undifferentiated nerve sheath precursor cells.
 Neurothekeomas in unusual locations should be differentiated from myxoid neurofibromas, perineuriomas, and soft tissue myxomas.
