Physiologic and psychobehavioral research in oncology.
 A major thrust in research in psychosocial oncology is the study of the interaction of psychologic and physiologic variables.
 This discussion reviews the current status and future directions of such research.
 Areas addressed include pain, nausea and vomiting with chemotherapy, sexuality, effects of cancer on psychologic and neuropsychologic function, impact of psychologic factors on cancer and its treatment, and psychoneuroimmunology.
 In addition, specific recommendations for strategies to facilitate research in these areas of psychosocial oncology are proposed.
