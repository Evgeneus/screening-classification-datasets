Internuclear ophthalmoplegia in the Chiari type II malformation.
 We describe 3 cases of Chiari type II malformation presenting with bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO).
 Although prominent, the INO was not an isolated sign in any of the patients; superimposed abduction paresis was present in 2, and deficits in smooth pursuit, optokinetic nystagmus, and vestibulo-ocular responses were present in 3.
 Two had hydrocephalus: 1 was clinically unchanged without therapy after 5 years; the other did not improve with shunting.
 Findings in our 3 patients, along with the 4 previously reported, confirm that INO is 1 manifestation of widespread brainstem or cerebellar dysfunction.
 Its origin is probably multifactorial, related to hydrocephalus, vascular compromise, direct neuronal distortion, or congenital neural malformation.
