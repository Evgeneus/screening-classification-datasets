Differentiation of hydrocephalic calf and human calvariae.
 Occasionally, partial calvariae of hydrocephalic calves are found in forensic contexts and mistakenly identified as human.
 Such specimens can be properly identified through immunological assessment of associated soft tissue, microscopic analysis of associated hair, and morphological comparison with documented museum specimens.
 Morphological comparison should focus on the form of the occiput, supraorbital grooves, and bulbous vault and presence of coronal processes.
