Sixth nerve schwannomas. Report of two cases.
 Two cases of sixth cranial nerve schwannoma are presented with a review of four other cases from the literature.
 The clinical spectrum, neuroradiological findings, and surgical outcome of the six cases are discussed.
 There are two distinct clinical presentations for sixth cranial nerve schwannomas.
 Type I sixth nerve schwannomas present with sixth nerve palsy and diplopia and arise from the cavernous sinus.
 In contrast, type II sixth nerve schwannomas have a more severe presentation with obstructive hydrocephalus, raised intracranial pressure, sixth nerve palsy, and diplopia.
 This type arises along the course of the sixth cranial nerve in the prepontine area.
 Cavernous sinus involvement in either type may preclude total surgical excision and indicate an increase possibility for recurrence.
