Management of middle third facial fractures.
 In the management of fractures of the middle third of the face, it should be apparent to the surgeon that the more sophisticated fixation techniques carry increased liability, and their incorrect and imprecise application mandates identification and correction of any contributing factors if malunion is to be avoided.
 A less sophisticated stabilization technique that, by convention, generally is reliable, less complicated, less expensive, and less intimidating may be preferred.
 Given the complexity and diversity of midfacial injuries and the variety of available fixation and stabilization techniques, it is unlikely that any one method precisely suits every situation.
