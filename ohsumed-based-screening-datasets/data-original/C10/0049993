A comparative immunohistochemical study of Kuru and senile plaques with a special reference to glial reactions at various stages of amyloid plaque formation.
 The authors examined 10 patients with Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and 10 with Alzheimer's disease (AD).
 Immunohistochemistry using anti-prion protein (PrP) and anti-beta/A4 protein (beta/A4) coupled with formic acid pretreatment could detect Congophilic and non-Congophilic deposits.
 Prion protein deposits were classified into five types and compared with types of beta/A4 deposits.
 Kuru plaques with multicentric cores and fine granular deposits were a characteristic feature of PrP deposits.
 Some types of PrP or beta/A4 deposits depend on the anatomic sites.
 To clarify the relationship of microglia and astrocytes to PrP or beta/A4 deposits, double-immunostaining method was performed.
 In both kuru and senile plaques, microglia were closely linked to the Congophilic plaques.
 Astrocytes, however, extended their processes toward the plaques even in the non-Congophilic plaques.
 These observations strongly suggest that similar glial association with plaque formation may be involved in both kuru and senile plaques, although the amyloid core proteins differ.
