A videofluoroscopy chair for the evaluation of dysphagia in patients with severe neuromotor disease.
 Due to the difficulties encountered in positioning severely neurologically impaired individuals for videofluoroscopic studies, the Rehab Tech Video FluoroChair was developed.
 The purpose of the chair is to provide the severely disabled patient with safe, stable postural support in an upright position for videofluoroscopic studies, with anterior-posterior, lateral, and rotational views easily performed.
 The chair features a removable headrest, a full back support, armrests, lateral truncal supports, and a patented base which is clamped to the footboard of the radiology table and allows for 200 degrees rotation of the patient.
 Two case studies illustrate the practical use and versatility of the Rehab Tech Video FluoroChair.
