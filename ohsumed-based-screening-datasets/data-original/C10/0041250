Toward an integrated understanding of fibromyalgia syndrome. II. Psychological and phenomenological aspects.
 The present paper is the second of a 2-part series in which extant empirical literature concerning fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) is reviewed in order to provide a preliminary approach to forming an integrated understanding of the syndrome.
 Research on psychological disturbance in FS is reviewed with particular emphasis on affective dysfunction among FS patients.
 The phenomenology of FS is then described.
 We attempt to suggest that FS represents a quantitatively and qualitatively experience distinct from similar chronic pain syndromes.
 Substantive findings in FS research are summarized in the final section and potential ways in which these findings might be integrated to provide a more cohesive model for future research are suggested.
