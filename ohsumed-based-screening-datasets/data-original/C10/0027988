Management of complicated fractures involving the orbits and nasoethmoid complex in young children.
 This article presents some ideas and techniques for surgical reduction of complicated orbit and nasoethmoid complex fractures in young children.
 Operative techniques for surgical exposure and fracture reduction and fixation have evolved from standard facial incisions and wire fixation to complete exposure of the cranium and orbits via a bicoronal scalp flap, application of rigid plating techniques, and use of cranial bone grafts when necessary.
 This evolution of surgical techniques has been accompanied by an overall improvement in cosmetic and functional results.
