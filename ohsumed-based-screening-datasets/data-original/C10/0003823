Seizures in the alcoholic patient.
 The First International Symposium on Alcohol and Seizures (September 1988, Washington, DC) convened experts from North America and Europe to discuss the basic and clinical research findings in this field.
 Most of the observations communicated at this symposium are included in this article.
 Emergency physicians are familiar with the alcoholic patient who presents during or after a seizure(s).
 This familiarity must not obscure the fact that a significant minority of these patients will have an underlying process that can cause morbidity or mortality if the unsuspecting physician does not have an organized and methodic approach to the evaluation and management of the seizing alcoholic patient.
 Status epilepticus should be evaluated and treated in a similar fashion, whether or not the patient is an alcoholic.
 Otherwise, almost without exception, there are nuances and controversies with respect to the evaluation and management of the alcoholic patient with a seizure(s), from the indications for CT scan, to the proper role of sedatives and anticonvulsants, and the need for admission.
 The emergency physician must remain a patient advocate.
 The great majority of alcoholic patients with seizures who require admission can be treated satisfactorily at the hospital of presentation.
