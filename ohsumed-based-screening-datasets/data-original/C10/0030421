Reducing postischemic paraplegia using conjugated superoxide dismutase.
 Paraplegia after thoracic aortic aneurysm repair has an incidence of 2.2% to 24%.
 Oxygen-derived free radicals after reperfusion of an ischemic spinal cord may be partly responsible for neuronal destruction.
 We studied the effects of polyethylene glycol-conjugated superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD), a free radical scavenger, as a way of increasing spinal cord tolerance to ischemia.
 Thirty rabbits underwent 40 minutes of aortic occlusion (a known model of paraplegia).
 Ten of these animals received 25,000 U/kg of PEG-SOD 24 hours before aortic occlusion and two additional doses of 10,000 U/kg, one before and one subsequent to spinal ischemia.
 Ten animals received superoxide dismutase in the same dosages as those receiving PEG-SOD.
 Ten control animals received placebo.
 All animals were studied for 96 hours, at which time a final neurological examination was performed and the results were recorded.
 Of the 10 animals treated with PEG-SOD, 2 were completely paralyzed whereas 8 had less (7) or no (1) neurological impairment.
 Eight of the 10 control animals and 9 of the 10 animals receiving superoxide dismutase were completely paralyzed.
 None of the control animals or animals receiving superoxide dismutase had a normal neurological examination (p less than or equal to 0.05).
 Treatment with PEG-SOD before and during occlusion increased the rabbit spinal cord tolerance to a 40-minute ischemic insult.
 Scavenging free radicals may lessen experimental spinal cord injury.
