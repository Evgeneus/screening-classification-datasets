Hearing improvement after acoustic tumor removal.
 Hearing improvement after removal of an acoustic tumor is an uncommon occurrence.
 Hearing improvement was observed in 8.5% of acoustic tumor removals performed using the middle fossa approach in an attempt to preserve hearing.
 Improvement in speech discrimination occurred most frequently and was of greatest magnitude compared with changes in the speech reception threshold or pure-tone average.
 No preoperative factors were predictive of postoperative hearing improvement.
 Findings support the conclusion that candidates for hearing preservation surgery should be chosen on the merits of their existing preoperative hearing and not on the basis of anticipated improvement.
