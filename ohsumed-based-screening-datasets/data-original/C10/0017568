Cauda equina syndrome after continuous spinal anesthesia.
 Four cases of cauda equina syndrome occurring after continuous spinal anesthesia are reported.
 In all four cases, there was evidence of a focal sensory block and, to achieve adequate analgesia, a dose of local anesthetic was given that was greater than that usually administered with a single-injection technique.
 We postulate that the combination of maldistribution and a relatively high dose of local anesthetic resulted in neurotoxic injury.
 Suggestions that may reduce the potential for neurotoxicity are discussed.
 Use of a lower concentration and a "ceiling" or maximum dose of local anesthetic to establish the block should be considered.
 If maldistribution of local anesthetic is suspected (as indicated by a focal sensory block), the use of maneuvers to increase the spread of local anesthetic is recommended.
 If such maneuvers prove unsuccessful, the technique should be abandoned.
