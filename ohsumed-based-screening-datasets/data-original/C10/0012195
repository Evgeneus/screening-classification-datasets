Spontaneous electromyographic potentials in chronic spinal cord injured patients: relation to spasticity and length of nerve.
 Nine patients with complete cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) had their vastus medialis, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius muscles evaluated with an electromyographic (EMG) examination in the acute (four to eight weeks) and chronic (more than one year) phases.
 The hypothesis that spontaneous EMG activity changes with time was assessed.
 During the chronic phase evaluation, a conduction study was performed to rule out peripheral nerve damage, and the amount of reflex activity was assessed on a scale of 0 to 5 (0 = areflexia; 5 = greater than 5 beats of clonus) to estimate the amount of spasticity.
 Subjects demonstrated normal conduction through the sensory (sural nerve) and/or motor segments of the peroneal and tibial nerves.
 In the acute phase, each muscle had spontaneous activity with no significant variation between different muscles of the same patient.
 In the chronic phase, there was a positive correlation between the degree of spontaneous activity in a muscle and the length of its axon (p less than .01) and a negative correlation between the amount of spontaneous activity and the degree of reflex activity (p less than .01).
 Specifically, the lower motor neuron in the chronic phase of an SCI seems to behave much like an axonopathy where the degree of spontaneous EMG activity is dependent on the length of the axon, with the additional concept that spontaneous activity is inhibited by spasticity.
