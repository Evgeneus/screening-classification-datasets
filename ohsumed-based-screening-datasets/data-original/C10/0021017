Observation of cerebrospinal fluid flow with echo-planar magnetic resonance imaging.
 Using echo-planar (EP) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow patterns have been demonstrated in the normal subject and patients with pathological conditions including communicating hydrocephalus, aqueduct stenosis and syringohydromyelia.
 Snap-shot imaging times of 128 ms allow detailed demonstration of transient intraventricular CSF flow patterns, which is not possible with conventional MRI.
 The potential of EPI as a method for qualitative and quantitative assessment of CSF dynamics is illustrated.
