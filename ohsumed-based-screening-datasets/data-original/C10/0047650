Using ADLs to establish eligibility for long-term care among the cognitively impaired.
 Using a database from the Oregon Medicaid program, we examined the differences in the potential insurance coverage of demented persons by using different formulations of ADL (activities of daily living) dependencies in which the definition of dependency did or did not include the need for supervision.
 For those with clear dementia, 81-88% of the persons with significant behavioral problems were correctly identified when a cut score of three or more ADLs was used; this percentage was even higher for two or more ADLs.
 This approach was not as effective in correctly discriminating those who had no behavioral problems.
