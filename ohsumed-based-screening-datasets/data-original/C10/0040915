Dutch general practice care for patients with epilepsy: results from the Dutch National Survey of Morbidity and Interventions.
 This study aimed to assess the share which Dutch general practice has in the care of patients with epilepsy.
 During a 3-month period 400,000 patient contacts in 103 general practices with a total list of 335,000 patients were registered, 1536 of these, concerning 1059 patients, concerned epilepsy.
 Contacts with patients with known epilepsy in Dutch General Practice were handled mainly by the practice nurse and most involved repeat prescriptions.
 Patients suspected of having epilepsy had more attention from the General Practitioner.
 The involvement of General Practitioners in the care of epilepsy was found to be small, but not unimportant.
 GPs are in a crucial position as regards the detection of epilepsy.
 They can enlarge their role in respect of patients with known epilepsy and improve continuity of care.
