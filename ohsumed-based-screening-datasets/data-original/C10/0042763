The relation of dizziness to functional decline.
 OBJECTIVE: to assess the effect of dizziness on the probability that an older person will die or become functionally disabled within 2 years.
 Dizziness is a common symptom for which the prognosis is uncertain.
 This report compares the prognoses for dizzy and not-dizzy older people in order to assist clinicians who diagnose and treat these patients.
 DESIGN: a prospective study of a representative sample of elderly (70+) non-institutionalized Americans.
 Elderly subjects (n = 3,798) in the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) were asked questions about the presence of dizziness, medical conditions, and functional disability in 1984.
 The cohort was reinterviewed about functional disability in 1986.
 OUTCOME MEASURE: transition from functional ability to disability after 2 years.
 RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that dizziness predicts functional decline but not mortality.
 Multivariate models revealed that age, race, sensory impairment, vascular disease, and other morbidity are independent predictors of becoming disabled.
 Controlling for these potential confounders, dizziness does not predict an increased probability of becoming disabled.
 CONCLUSION: Elderly people who are dizzy should be evaluated for the presence of these related conditions.
