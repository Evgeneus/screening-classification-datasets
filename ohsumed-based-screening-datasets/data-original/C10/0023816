Severe fibromyalgia after hypophysectomy for Cushing's disease.
 We report a case of fibromyalgia occurring after hypophysectomy for Cushing's disease.
 Clinical examination revealed tender points at 12 of the 18 tender point sites described in the American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of fibromyalgia.
 The cause of fibromyalgia remains unknown.
 In our patient, hypophysectomy may have played a role by disturbing endorphin secretion and pain modulation.
