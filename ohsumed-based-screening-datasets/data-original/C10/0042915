Cystic cerebellar schwannoma: case report.
 We report a case of cerebellar schwannoma in a 64-year-old woman.
 The tumor was defined on computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging scans and confirmed on surgery.
 The solid part of the tumor appeared to be derived from the inferior vermis of the cerebellum, the cystic part extending toward the medulla oblongata and the foramen magnum.
 The problem of preoperative diagnosis based on magnetic resonance imaging findings is discussed.
