Right ventricular hypertrophy detected by echocardiography in patients with newly diagnosed obstructive sleep apnea.
 We used polysomnography, echocardiography and ventilatory measurements to study 50 patients suspected of having OSA to determine a link to RVH.
 Twenty-eight patients (56 percent) had OSA and 20 (71 percent) of those had isolated RVH.
 We evaluated patients with RVH and divided them into two groups, those with apnea and those without apnea.
 The patients with sleep apnea were younger, weighed more, had greater BSA and had lower average oxygen saturations during the sleep study period.
 We divided the group with apnea into those with RVH and those without it.
 Those patients with RVH had a higher AI, longer average apnea time, a greater duration of longest apnea and a lower average oxygen saturation for the period of the sleep study.
 In addition, those with RVH had a lower average oxygen saturation during each apneic episode with a p value equaling 0.09.
