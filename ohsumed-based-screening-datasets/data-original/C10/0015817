Cognitive deficits in children: adaptive behavior and treatment techniques.
 Impaired cognitive functioning impedes the development of age-appropriate adaptive behavior, thus adding to the burdens of many children with epilepsy.
 Detailed neuropsychological assessment can identify the underlying ability-related impairments that contribute to the adaptive behavior deficiencies evidenced, particularly in the home and school settings.
 This information can serve as the basis for a multidisciplinary treatment plan tailored to individual needs.
 Ideally, the need for such a treatment plan should be perceived early in childhood, so that it can be developed and applied preventively.
 The same remedial principles also apply in older children and are here set out in detail.
