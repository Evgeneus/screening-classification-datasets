Diphenylhydantoin-induced hypogammaglobulinemia in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
 A case is reported of reversible panhypogammaglobulinemia in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patient.
 Onset and resolution were temporally correlated with initiation and termination, respectively, of diphenylhydantoin therapy for a possible seizure.
 A rapid alteration in peripheral T-cell subpopulations was also noted in association with diphenylhydantoin administration.
 This case is compared with previous reports of diphenylhydantoin-associated hypogammaglobulinemia in non-HIV-infected patients.
 In addition, the case is discussed with regard to possible deleterious effects associated with the use of diphenylhydantoin as therapy for HIV-associated seizures or as an antiretroviral agent in HIV disease.
