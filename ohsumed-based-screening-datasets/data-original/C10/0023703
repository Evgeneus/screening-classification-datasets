Cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the tardive cauda equina syndrome of ankylosing spondylitis.
 Typical cauda equina syndrome secondary to long-standing ankylosing spondylitis is reported in a 63-year-old man.
 Radionuclide cisternography demonstrated a resorption defect of cerebrospinal fluid in the enlarged lumbosacral dural sac.
 After transient symptomatic improvement with acetazolamide, a lumboperitoneal shunt was placed.
 The rate of cerebrospinal fluid, isotope resorption became normal.
 In the 5 years of follow-up, partial remission has been observed.
