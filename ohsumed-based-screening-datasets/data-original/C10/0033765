Clinical anatomic study of pure dysarthria.
 Nine patients with pure dysarthria underwent computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.
 Eight patients had infarcts of lacunar or larger size in the internal capsule: four in the superior portion of the anterior limb or adjacent corona radiata and four in the superior portion of the genu or the adjacent corona radiata.
 In one patient, there was a small infarct in the bulbar motor cortex.
 Dysarthria was transient and characterized by poor articulation in all cases.
 Five patients also had contralateral facial weakness, and three patients with lesions in the genu had minimal and transient involvement of the contralateral fingers.
 These three cases appeared to be variants of the dysarthria-clumsy hand syndrome.
 We submit that this syndrome should sometimes be regarded as a stroke syndrome rather than always as a lacunar syndrome.
