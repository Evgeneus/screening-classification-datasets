Pneumocephalus secondary to a high-pressure water injury to the nose.
 We report a case of pneumocephalus following a water jet injury to the nose incurred during a water-skiing fall.
 Pneumocephalus due to this type of injury has not been previously reported, to our knowledge.
 Since this unusual injury may be associated with serious complications, it must be promptly recognized and treated.
