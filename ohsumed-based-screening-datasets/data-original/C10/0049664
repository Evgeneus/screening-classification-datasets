Double-blind study of Gabapentin in the treatment of partial seizures.
 Forty-three patients completed a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Gabapentin (GBP) as add-on therapy in partial and secondarily generalized seizures.
 All patients were followed for an initial 3-month baseline period, after which they were randomly allocated to receive either a placebo or 900 or 1,200 mg/day GBP for 3 months.
 A statistically significant difference in seizure frequency from the baseline to the treatment phase was noted between patients receiving placebo and GBP 1,200 mg, in whom seizure frequency decreased 57%.
 The GBP dosage of 900 mg appeared to be ineffective.
 A close relationship was observed between the serum GBP concentrations and the GBP dosage based on the seizure frequency.
 Serum GBP concentrations greater than 2 micrograms/ml resulted in a lower frequency of seizures.
 The adverse effects were minor and consisted mainly of transient drowsiness.
 GBP appears to be effective in the treatment of partial epileptic seizures in a dosage-related manner.
