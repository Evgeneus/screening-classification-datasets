Intracranial arteriovenous fistula manifesting as progressive neurological deterioration in an infant: case report.
 This 1-year-old male infant had been diagnosed with cerebral degenerative disease because he developed psychomotor regression, and brain atrophy was demonstrated on computed tomography.
 He underwent magnetic resonance imaging, which suggested a cerebrovascular malformation.
 Cerebral angiography disclosed an arteriovenous fistula, fed by an anterior cerebral artery and directly draining into a cortical vein.
 The occlusion of the feeding artery was followed by a satisfactory recovery.
 The mechanism of the neurological symptoms in this patient is thought to be caused by a steal phenomenon and compression of the brain stem by venous engorgement in the posterior fossa.
