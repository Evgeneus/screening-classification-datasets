Intrapalatine resection (IPR) in the treatment of sleep apnea and snoring.
 A conservative surgical technique is proposed as an alternative to the classical uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea and snoring.
 The resection is strictly intrapalatine, and careful suturing in three planes seems to lead to complete disappearance of the often unbearable postoperative pain.
 The soft palate is shortened but nonetheless still resembles a normal soft palate.
 Uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP) was described by Ikematsu in 1952.
 This method has taken on a new lease of life in recent years.
 Its efficacy is generally accepted, and its use, especially in cases of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, is the only treatment of the palatal velum at present practiced.
 In addition to aesthetic problems, this method generally gives rise to complications in the shape of temporary--but sometimes considerable--pain, nasal regurgitation, and a nasal voice.
 In a small percentage of patients, some of these disorders may prove irreversible.
 In my series of eight patients, five were obese and presented with hypertension.
 Three of them also were suffering from obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.
 The three others were ordinary snorers who caused considerable inconvenience to sleeping partners.
