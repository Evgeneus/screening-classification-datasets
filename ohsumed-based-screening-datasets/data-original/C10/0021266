Cholinergic stimulation of the pons depresses respiration in decerebrate cats.
 The injection of carbachol into the pontine tegmentum of decerebrate cats evokes a postural motor atonia that has many of the characteristics of the atonia of natural rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep (Morales et al.
 J.
 Neurophysiol.
 57: 1118-1129, 1987).
 We have used the carbachol-injected decerebrate cat to study the changes in respiratory neuronal activity that accompany the atonia.
 The activities of representative respiratory motor nerves--phrenic, intercostal, and hypoglossal--and that of a motor branch of C4 were recorded in decerebrate, vagotomized, paralyzed, and artificially ventilated cats.
 After the microinjection of carbachol, there was a profound suppression of activity in all the nerves and a decrease in respiratory rate.
 This was a consistent stereotyped response in which the magnitude of the suppression of respiratory-related activity was phrenic (to approximately 65% of control) less than inspiratory intercostal (approximately 50%) less than hypoglossal (approximately 10%) less than expiratory intercostal (approximately 5%).
 The decrease in respiratory rate (to approximately 70% of control) was caused by a prolongation of both inspiratory and expiratory durations.
 Complete reversal of the carbachol effect was elicited by the microinjection of atropine into the same site as the carbachol injection.
 This allowed us to produce a second episode of atonia by the injection of carbachol into the contralateral pons.
 Thus we have demonstrated the existence of neural pathways originating in the cholinoceptive cells of the pons that have the potential to powerfully and differentially depress various respiratory motoneuronal pools and to reduce the respiratory rate.
 These pathways are likely to be activated along with the atonia of REM sleep.
