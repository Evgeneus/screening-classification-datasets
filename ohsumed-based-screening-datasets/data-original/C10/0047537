Local application of somatostatin in the rat ventrolateral brain medulla induces apnea.
 Local injections of the tetradecapeptide somatostatin (SOM) into the brain stem region were performed in anesthetized and decerebrate rats.
 SOM administration (0.6-1.8 nmol) into the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis of the ventrolateral medulla oblongata induced ventilatory depression and apnea.
 The occurrence of apnea was dose dependent and attributed to the anesthetic depth, and it was seen within 60-240 s after injection.
 In anesthetized rats the apnea was seen as a termination or a continuous decrease in tidal volume while respiratory frequency remained unaltered.
 SOM-induced apnea was caused by depression of central inspiratory drive.
 SOM injections into the dorsal medulla were ineffective in eliciting apnea, although a ventilatory depression but no apnea was induced in the awake unanesthetized state.
 In addition to its effect on basal ventilation, SOM administration in the ventrolateral medulla resulted in a blunted ventilatory response to hypoxic and hypercapnic stimuli in anesthetized rats.
 We conclude that SOM has potent inhibitory effects on respiration that are specifically located in the nucleus paragigantocellularis and the nucleus reticularis lateralis.
