Surgical approaches for resection of heterotopic ossification in traumatic brain-injured adults.
 The site of heterotopic ossification (HO) at the elbow or the hip dictates the surgical approach for resection.
 Three approaches are used for HO resection at the elbow: (1) a posterolateral approach for posterolateral HO; (2) an anterolateral approach for anterior HO; and (3) a medical approach for medial or posteromedial HO or anterior transfer of the ulnar nerve.
 Two approaches are recommended for resection of HO at the hip: (1) an anterior approach for anterior or inferomedial HO and (2) a posterior approach for posterior HO.
 Posterior HO is often associated with a hip-flexion contracture, and an anterior soft-tissue release may be necessary as well.
 Physical examination indicates the prognosis for functional improvement as well as recurrence.
 Patients with a near normal neurologic recovery have minimal to no HO recurrence with improved limb function and increased joint motion, whereas a poor neurologic recovery and persistent spasticity are associated with recurrence of HO and no functional limb improvement.
 Standard roentgenograms aid in selecting the appropriate surgical approach.
 Radiation, indomethacin, and diphosphonates have been administered for prophylaxis.
 Physical therapy is necessary until range of motion stabilizes.
