Focal high signal on MR scans of the midbrain caused by enlarged perivascular spaces: MR-pathologic correlation.
 Punctate and linear foci of abnormal signal were observed near the substantia nigra in the midbrains of 32 (20%) of 157 patients undergoing high-resolution MR imaging of the brainstem.
 The lesions were most easily seen on long TR/long TE images, where they were of high signal intensity.
 Their location was consistently in the lower mesencephalon near the junction of the substantia nigra and cerebral peduncle.
 Unilateral lesions were observed in 18 cases, while bilateral lesions were noted in 14.
 A review of anatomic specimens revealed the constant presence of penetrating branches of the collicular or accessory collicular arteries in this location.
 Enlarged perivascular spaces around these vessels were frequently seen in the specimens and probably account for punctate and linear foci observed on high-resolution MR images of the midbrain.
