Prenatal diagnosis of the neurofibromatoses.
 This article reviews the application of genetic linkage analysis to molecular prenatal diagnosis using the neurofibromatoses as an example.
 The clinical manifestations and diagnostic criteria for these diseases are reviewed first, followed by a brief description of the principles underlying genetic linkage analysis, the detection of DNA polymorphisms and their application to the cloning of the NF1 gene.
 The last two sections review the molecular diagnosis and some of the problems in prenatal genetic counseling for NF1.
