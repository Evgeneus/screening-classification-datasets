Appropriateness of intrapartum fetal heart rate management and risk of cerebral palsy.
 Cerebral palsy affects 2 in 1000 infants in the United States, and the intrapartum period is frequently scrutinized as the etiologic source.
 In a matched group of 49 infants with cerebral palsy at 1 year of age and 49 controls, no difference in the incidence of inappropriate intrapartum fetal heart rate pattern management was detected.
 This supports the conclusions of others that the intrapartum period is an infrequent source of cerebral palsy.
