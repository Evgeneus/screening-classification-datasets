Reference values for the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in octo- and nonagenarians 
 The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was used in a population survey of all inhabitants of Leiden, the Netherlands, over 85 years (n = 1258).
 In this paper we report on 532 subjects without neurological or psychiatric disease.
 Results show that the median score and lowest quartile cut-off score remain high until the tenth decade (median score = 28, lowest quartile cut-off score = 26).
 Thus age, in itself, is not a major limitation in using the MMSE.
 In this study a comparatively low level of education (the majority had 6 to 7 years of education) did not affect the results on the MMSE in a negative way, nor did we find an association with the use of psychoactive drugs.
