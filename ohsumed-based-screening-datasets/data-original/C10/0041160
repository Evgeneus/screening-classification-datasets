Treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts with octreotide.
 Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common and painful complication of chronic pancreatitis.
 Seven patients (six male, one female; mean age 49.9 years) with chronic pancreatitis complicated by pseudocysts and persistent pain were treated with the pancreatic anti-secretory drug octreotide for 2 weeks.
 Octreotide caused no notable changes in the size of the pseudocysts of three patients.
 In the remaining four patients, the pseudocysts decreased in size by a mean of 42% (range 29-52%), and pain disappeared completely.
 These findings suggest a role for octreotide in the treatment of pancreatic pseudocysts.
