Arthroscopic surgery for treatment of closed lock.
 This study evaluates the first 51 consecutive cases treated for limitation of mandibular movement due to closed lock.
 Eighty joints (22 unilateral, 29 bilateral) were treated with arthroscopic surgery.
 The mean follow-up was 29.4 weeks, with a range of 6 to 77 weeks.
 These results showed an immediate improvement after arthroscopy followed by a more gradual improvement during the next 6 months, with a plateau in improvement thereafter.
 All cases, unilateral and bilateral, generally reached the same level of opening.
