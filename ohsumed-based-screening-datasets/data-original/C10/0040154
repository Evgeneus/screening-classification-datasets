Electrophysiological improvement following decompression surgery in tarsal tunnel syndrome.
 Plantar nerve conduction studies 14 months to 3.5 years after decompression surgery in 3 cases of tarsal tunnel syndrome showed an improvement in motor conduction as well as in sensory nerve conduction.
 This electrophysiological improvement was associated with clinical improvement.
 However, minor abnormalities still existed in sensory nerve conduction in all 3 cases.
