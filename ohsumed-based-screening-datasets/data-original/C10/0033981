Clonidine inhibits vesico-sphincter reflexes in patients with chronic spinal lesions.
 When administered systemically to spinalized animals, clonidine, the prototypic alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, purportedly acts at spinal sites to suppress motor responses related to painful peripheral and vesical stimulation and spasticity, and to improve vesicourethral coordination.
 Hence, the action of clonidine (400 micrograms in three divided doses in a 16-hour span) on spinal vesical and somatic reflexes was examined in five patients with suprasacral spinal cord lesions by assessing volume-induced micturition reflexes and limb motor discharges that occurred spontaneously or were elicited by noxious and nonnoxious cutaneous stimulation.
 Clonidine caused a significant reduction in (1) blood pressure, (2) amplitude of detrusor contraction, and (3) vesical external urethral sphincter dyssynergia.
 Limb motor electromyography discharges were not markedly attenuated, although spatiotemporal changes (eg, irradiation, after-discharges) were observed in some of the patients.
 The results are ascribed to binding to spinal cord alpha 2 adrenergic receptors located on segmental and intersegmental (propriospinal) interneurons, released from descending inhibition, with greater motor system specificity on striated sphincter innervation.
 Clonidine may be clinically effective in the treatment of hyperactive micturition reflexes in patients with chronic spinal lesions.
