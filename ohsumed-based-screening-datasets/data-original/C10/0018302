Non-drug related asystole associated with anaesthetic induction.
 A patient is presented where routine venepuncture associated with anaesthetic induction resulted in bradycardia and asystole.
 The case highlights the need for special caution with, and ECG monitoring throughout induction for, patients with a history of syncope.
 It also demonstrates the need for caution when attributing cardiovascular events during induction to the effect of the induction agents used.
