Exacerbation of partial seizures and onset of nonepileptic myoclonus with carbamazepine.
 A child had two to three generalized tonic-clonic (GTC) seizures per week unresponsive to phenobarbital (PB) and valproate (VPA).
 Interictal EEG demonstrated left occipital spikes.
 When carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy was started, he developed very frequent (4-6/day) complex partial seizures (CPS) characterized on ictal EEG by focal right temporal lobe discharges.
 The seizure exacerbation, which was associated with development of nonepileptic, multifocal myoclonus, resolved 24 h after CBZ was discontinued.
 The exacerbation occurred with therapeutic CBZ serum levels, but may have been related to the toxic levels of carbamazepine-10, 11-epoxide (CBZE).
