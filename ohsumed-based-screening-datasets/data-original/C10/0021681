Corticosteroid-responsive dominantly inherited neuropathy in childhood.
 We describe three children with corticosteroid-responsive inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy from families with dominantly inherited neuropathy.
 There were atypical clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic characteristics that suggested a coexistent inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy and that should alert the clinician to the possibility of an associated acquired, potentially treatable disorder.
