Extradural haematoma after continuous extradural anaesthesia.
 We report a case of extradural haematoma occurring after extradural anaesthesia in an anticoagulated patient.
 The diagnosis was confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging and the haematoma was evacuated surgically.
 A search of the literature revealed only five previous reports of extradural haematoma in association with extradural anaesthesia.
