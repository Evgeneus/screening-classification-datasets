Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVsm) isolation from blood and brain of experimentally infected macaques.
 The possibility of using simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques to study pathogenic events linked to HIV infection of the brain prompted us to investigate some of the virological features in SIV-infected macaques.
 Nine cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with SIVsm and killed at different times.
 We successfully isolated virus from the blood of all the animals and from the brains of eight.
 These results point to the early and regular spread of this lentivirus to the brain.
 Neutralizing activity was studied in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid specimens obtained from these macaques against a selected group of isolates.
 Cerebrospinal fluid did not show any neutralizing activity.
 Our findings integrate the observations from HIV-1 infection in man and indicate that SIV infection of macaques is a useful model for studying pathogenic events of brain infection.
