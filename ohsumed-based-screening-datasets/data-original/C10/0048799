Bacterial meningitis: T cell activation and immunoregulatory CD4+ T cell subset alteration.
 Meningitis is the most important cause of acquired postnatal deafness and neurologic disorders in children.
 To determine if cell-mediated immunity is casually related to the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis, T cell subsets were quantitated from blood of the 29 children with clinical and bacteriologic diagnosis of Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Neisseria meningitidis bacterial meningitis.
 The CD4+ T cells increased and CD8+ T cells decreased in patients with meningitis as compared to patient control subjects (bacterial infections without meningitis) and normal healthy control subjects.
 An elevated percentage of CD25+ (interleukin-2 receptors) and HLA-DR+ (immune-response gene-associated antigen) T cells were detected from all patients with meningitis.
 All 29 patients with meningitis had highly elevated CD4+ CD45R+ (suppressor-inducer) cells and reciprocally depressed CD4+ CDw29+ (helper-inducer) cells compared with healthy age-matched normal and patient control subjects.
 These findings indicate characteristic immunologic T cell abnormalities from meningitis.
 The abnormal increase in the CD4+ CD45R+ suppressor-inducer or "virgin" cells and expression of activation antigens on T cells may be of help in future understanding of abnormal immune reactions from bacterial meningitis.
 However, deficiency of the CD4+ CDw29+ helper-inducer or "memory" cells may contribute to the impaired helper function for B cell-induced protective antibody synthesis to bacterial capsular polysaccharides found in this disease.
