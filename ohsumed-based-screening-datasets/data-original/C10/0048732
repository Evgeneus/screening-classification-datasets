Preclinical detection of Parkinson's disease: biochemical approaches.
 Dysfunction of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain has been linked to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.
 While simple assays of complex I activity are unlikely to be useful in the preclinical detection of Parkinson's disease, other more sophisticated physical-chemical approaches including detection of free radical damage may have utility.
 Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy may provide a useful model system for development of such strategies.
