Multifocal independent epileptiform discharges in children: ictal correlates and surgical therapy.
 We obtained continuous EEG/video recordings on four children who had the interictal EEG pattern of multifocal independent epileptiform discharges (MIED).
 The prominent feature of their evaluation was the evidence that their clinical seizures appeared to be of focal origin; 42/44 seizures were manifested by "fencing postures." Three patients subsequently underwent epilepsy surgery: one focal resection of superior frontal-parietal cortex and two hemidecorticectomies.
 Seizure control improved in all three patients, and one patient is now seizure-free.
 Our patients differ from those previously reported in that they had a predominance of tonic seizures and had no history of infantile spasms or Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
 Some patients, such as ours, with MIED may have clinical seizures of more focal origin than might be expected from their interictal EEG and, therefore, may benefit from resective epilepsy surgery.
