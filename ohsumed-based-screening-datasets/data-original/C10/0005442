Extracranial repair of cerebrospinal fluid fistulas: technique and results in 37 patients.
 Although neurosurgeons have traditionally preferred intracranial repair for the management of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistulas, this approach is associated with the complications of a craniotomy, anosmia, and a high incidence of recurrent fistulas.
 Extracranial repair, on the other hand, produces no central nervous system morbidity, preserves olfaction, and is associated with a low incidence of recurrence.
 Although there have been several reports of extracranial repair of CSF fistulas by otorhinolaryngologists, this approach has received scant mention in the neurosurgical literature.
 We report here our experience with 37 patients with CSF rhinorrhea or otorrhea who underwent extracranial repair.
 The etiology of the fistula was postoperative in 22, traumatic in 6, and spontaneous in 9.
 The fistulas were repaired using one of four techniques: external ethmoid-sphenoid in 18 patients, transmastoid in 9, transseptosphenoid in 7, and osteoplastic frontal sinusotomy in 3.
 In 32 of the 37 patients (86%) the fistulas were successfully repaired with the initial procedure.
 Of the 5 patients requiring a second operation, the fistula was successfully closed in 4 for an overall success rate of 97%.
 Complications were few and consisted of a transient facial paresis in a patient undergoing transmastoid repair and one death from meningitis.
 The authors conclude that because of low morbidity and mortality and a high success rate in closing fistulas, extracranial repair is the preferred technique for the operative management of CSF rhinorrhea and otorrhea.
