Neuroanatomy in fragile X females: the posterior fossa.
 The relative homogeneity of the neuropsychiatric phenotype in individuals with fragile (fra) X syndrome suggests that there are consistent central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities underlying the observed cognitive and behavioral abnormalities.
 In this study, the neuroanatomy of the posterior fossa and other selected CNS regions in 12 young fra X females were compared with those of a group of 12 age-, sex-, and IQ-matched females without evidence of the fra X syndrome.
 Fra X females were shown to have decreased size of the posterior cerebellar vermis and increased size of the fourth ventricle, findings that are identical to those previously reported for fra X males.
 When compared with fra X male and nonfra X control groups, the distribution of the posterior-vermis and fourth-ventricle variables for the fra X female group was intermediate.
 These results support the hypothesis that the fra X genetic abnormality leads to hypoplasia of the posterior cerebellar vermis, a neuroanatomical variation of potential importance to both developmental and neuropsychiatric syndromes.
