Alcohol-dependent unilateral vestibular impairment persisting after a closed head injury.
 A 20-year-old man suffered a closed head injury followed by symptoms of right-sided labyrinthine concussion with complete clinical recovery within 3 weeks.
 Episodic vertigo and ataxic gait occurred after the ingestion of small amounts of alcohol over the next 2 years.
 Electro-oculography revealed a right-sided peripheral type vestibular lesion, only after taking alcohol.
 This was interpreted as an alcohol-induced impairment of central compensation following an incomplete recovery from right-sided labyrinthine trauma.
