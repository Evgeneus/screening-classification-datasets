Prognostic significance of multimodality evoked response testing in high-risk newborns.
 Exposure to hypoxic-ischemic events in fetal or neonatal life may lead to permanent brain damage and subsequent neurodevelopmental deficits.
 Clinical and diagnostic tools have been somewhat helpful in identifying an at-risk group, particularly those patients sustaining significant neurologic sequelae.
 In this prospective study, the prognostic significance of multimodality evoked responses in high-risk newborns was examined.
 A group of 44 high-risk newborns, as well as 14 healthy newborns, were tested during the newborn period with auditory brainstem responses and somatosensory evoked responses; these tests were repeated at 2 and 6 months corrected age.
 A neonatal neurologic examination, the Einstein Neonatal Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale, was also conducted.
 At 1 year corrected age, both groups were assessed in a blind fashion by a pediatric neurologist and a psychologist to determine neurodevelopmental outcome.
 Results indicated that somatosensory evoked response abnormalities in particular predict an abnormal neurologic status at 1 year of age.
 Abnormalities that persisted or worsened correlated with severe neurologic impairment, whereas an abnormal somatosensory evoked response that improved or normalized in infancy was associated with mild to moderate neurologic sequelae.
 Increased brainstem conduction in the auditory brainstem responses was also associated with neurologic sequelae.
 Normal findings from auditory brainstem responses and somatosensory evoked responses predicted normal developmental scores in all areas, as well as a normal neurologic outcome at 1 year with negative predictive powers ranging from 85-100%.
 Evoked response testing appears to be an important adjunct to the neurologic investigation of high-risk newborns.
