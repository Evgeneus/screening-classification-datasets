Magnetic resonance imaging in preterm infants.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 9 preterm infants at 37-43 weeks postmenstrual age.
 They all were born at 26-35 weeks gestation.
 Myelination was graded according to its most cephalic location.
 Myelination pattern 2 (myelination observed in the posterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent structures of the thalamus and lenticular nucleus) was demonstrated in 2 infants, pattern 3 (myelination of the corona radiata) in 3 infants, and pattern 4 (myelination of the centrum semiovale) in 4 infants.
 Bilateral low intensity areas were found on T1-weighted images in 7 infants and a ribbon-like, high intensity was observed in 5.
 These findings revealed a wide variety of magnetic resonance imaging appearance in apparently normal preterm infants.
 Caution is needed in interpreting the pathologic nature of such features in preterm infants during the perinatal period.
