Severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption.
 A severe lidocaine intoxication by cutaneous absorption is described.
 Data are presented to show a significant absorption of lidocaine through diseased skin when lidocaine cream is used as a local anesthetic.
 Awareness of this route of intoxication might be important in patients in whom neurologic or psychiatric symptoms develop while large amounts of lidocaine cream are being used.
