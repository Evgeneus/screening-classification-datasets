Seizures caused by nontraumatic parenchymal brain hemorrhages.
 Seizures occurred in 15% of patients with parenchymal brain hemorrhage (early in 12% and delayed in 3%).
 Seizures were most frequent with lobar hemorrhages and uncommon with deep subcortical hemorrhages.
 Lobar hemorrhages in the frontal, parietal, or temporal region were more commonly associated with seizures, whereas occipital hemorrhages were not.
 Seizures were most common if the hemorrhage was due to an aneurysm, angioma, or neoplasm and less common if hypertensive or spontaneous.
 If the patient had recurrent seizures or developed delayed seizures, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to a hypodense appearance; if the seizure did not recur, CT showed that the hemorrhage evolved to an isodense appearance.
