Home use of rectal diazepam for cluster and prolonged seizures: efficacy, adverse reactions, quality of life, and cost analysis.
 From 1982 through 1987, 128 families, who were instructed in the use of rectally administered diazepam (R-DZP) for the treatment of severe epileptic seizures, were surveyed.
 Sixty-seven families returned questionnaires and met inclusion/exclusion criteria; the results were used to analyze the medical, psychosocial, and economic impact of this program during the first year following instruction.
 Twenty-six families did not use R-DZP, primarily because of patient improvement.
 Among families using R-DZP, a total of 428 doses were administered to 41 children.
 R-DZP was effective in controlling seizures in 85% of patients.
 Adverse reactions usually were mild, consisting of drowsiness and/or behavioral changes.
 Compared to the year prior to instruction, emergency room visits decreased in both R-DZP-treated and -nontreated children; however, cost-savings were greater for the R-DZP group ($1,039.00 vs $420.00 per patient per year).
 Improvements in quality of life associated with the availability of R-DZP were observed by 58% of users and 27% of nonusers which included improved management of their children's seizures, increased flexibility in family activities, and greater peace of mind.
 R-DZP appears to be a practical method in the effective treatment of severe seizures at home.
