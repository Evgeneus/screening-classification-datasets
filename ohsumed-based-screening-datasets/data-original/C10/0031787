Carpal tunnel syndrome: surgical treatment using the Paine retinaculatome.
 The operative technique for the relief of carpal tunnel syndrome has remained controversial.
 This report presents the results of 445 patients or 577 hands operated on using a transverse technique that varies little from that described by Paine and Polyzoidis.
 The patients were followed for 9 months to 3 years.
 In addition to the data received from follow-up visits, a questionnaire was sent to each patient for evaluation of their results.
 All surgery was performed under local anesthesia, sometimes with intravenous supplement.
 Of the 445 patients, 313 had unilateral operations and 132 had bilateral operations at one sitting.
 Postoperatively, normal hand function was achieved in 59.4% of patients in 1 week or less.
 Of the 577 hands operated on, 535 (92.7%) exhibited satisfactory results from surgery.
 No patient required postoperative physical therapy or splinting.
 There were no injuries to the median nerve or any of its branches.
