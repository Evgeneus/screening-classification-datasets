Combined therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine in murine cryptococcal meningitis.
 To assess the possible beneficial effects of combined therapy (fluconazole and flucytosine) in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis in the immunocompromised host, we compared therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine, individually and combined, in the experimental murine model.
 BALB/c athymic (nu/nu) mice were infected intracerebrally with 150 to 300 CFU of Cryptococcus neoformans.
 In mortality studies, treatment was initiated 24 h postinfection and continued for 10 to 14 days with either fluconazole (1 to 15 mg/kg of body weight per day), flucytosine (60 to 120 mg/kg/8 h), both drugs, or 0.3% Noble agar (control).
 Combined therapy delayed mortality significantly when compared with controls and single-drug regimens.
 This was observed over a broad range of doses.
 Quantitative determinations of CFU in brain tissue demonstrated a significantly lower burden of C.
 neoformans in mice receiving combined therapy.
 The results indicate that combined therapy with fluconazole and flucytosine is superior to single-drug therapy.
