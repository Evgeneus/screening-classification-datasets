Digitally-directed transrectal biopsy using Biopty gun versus transrectal needle aspiration: comparison of diagnostic yield and comfort.
 A technique for digitally-directed core biopsy using the Biopty device and prospective comparison of accuracy and comfort, using this technique simultaneously with transrectal needle aspiration, are presented.
 To better estimate the true prevalence of carcinoma in the study population, a repeat combined procedure was performed on all subjects who did not have carcinoma confirmed on the initial core biopsies.
 All procedures were done by one investigator and all pathology reviewed by one senior pathologist.
 A total of 180 combined procedures were performed on 100 consecutive patients with palpably abnormal prostates; 30 carcinomas were detected.
 Digitally-directed Biopty biopsy yielded a sensitivity rate of 87 percent compared with 57 percent for needle aspiration (p less than 0.05).
 Using a numerical comfort scale, the Biopty device was also rated less painful than needle aspiration (p = 0.0001).
 The morbidity of the combined procedure was minimal, with a minor complication rate of 2.2 percent.
 No infections occurred.
