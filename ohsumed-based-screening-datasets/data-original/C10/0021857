Isolation of sequences that span the fragile X and identification of a fragile X-related CpG island [published erratum appears in Science 1991 Apr 26;252(5005):494]
 Yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) were obtained from a 550-kilobase region that contains three probes previously mapped as very close to the locus of the fragile X syndrome.
 These YACs spanned the fragile site in Xq27.3 as shown by fluorescent in situ hybridization.
 An internal 200-kilobase segment contained four chromosomal breakpoints generated by induction of fragile X expression.
 A single CpG island was identified in the cloned region between markers DXS463 and DXS465 that appears methylated in mentally retarded fragile X males, but not in nonexpressing male carriers of the mutation nor in normal males.
 This CpG island may indicate the presence of a gene involved in the clinical phenotype of the syndrome.
