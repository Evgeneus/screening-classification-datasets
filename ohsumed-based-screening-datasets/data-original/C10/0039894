Paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis with abnormal electroencephalogram during attacks.
 An 18-year-old man with paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis (PKC) showed rhythmic electroencephalographic (EEG) discharges of 5-Hz spikes over the entire scalp during episodes.
 The EEG findings in this case suggest that PKC may have an epileptogenic basis.
