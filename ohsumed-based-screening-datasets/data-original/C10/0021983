Anomalous macular vessels: case report and review of the recent Japanese literature.
 We examined a 19-year-old woman with large macular vessels who had temporarily impaired visual acuity.
 The anomalous macular vessels had arteriovenous shunts and were associated with abnormal capillary networks.
 In a review of the recent Japanese literature, we found another eight patients with anomalous macular vessels who had undergone fluorescein angiography.
 We prefer the term anomalous macular vessels to describe this condition.
