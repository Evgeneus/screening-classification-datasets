Acute hemiplegia associated with HIV infection.
 An acute hemiplegia secondary to a large cerebral infarct is described in a 16-month-old infant with congenitally-acquired human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Serial imaging studies during the next year documented improvement in his hemiplegia and a static underlying human immunodeficiency virus encephalopathy.
 Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis of children with acute hemiplegia.
