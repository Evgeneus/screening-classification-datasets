Evaluation of treatment protocols on minimal to moderate spasticity in multiple sclerosis.
 Thirty men and women diagnosed with definite multiple sclerosis (MS) were treated for ten weeks in a blinded, cross-over study.
 Patients with minimal to moderate spasticity were randomized to one of three sequences to evaluate the effects on MS-related spasticity of baclofen alone, stretching regimen with placebo, placebo alone, and stretching regimen with baclofen.
 The Cybex II isokinetic unit, timed gait, Ashworth scale, and subject's assessment of function were objective and subjective measures used to evaluate changes in hypertonicity.
 There was significant correlation between the Cybex and Ashworth as methods of measuring spasticity.
 Overall, treatment with baclofen alone significantly improved moderate quadriceps spasticity as measured by Cybex flexion scores.
 A trend, indicative of enhancing the beneficial effects of baclofen, was noted when stretching exercises were added to the treatment.
