Hypercapnic and hypoxic ventilatory responses in parents and siblings of children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.
 Children with congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) have abnormal ventilatory responses to metabolic stimuli.
 As there is a genetically determined component of chemoreceptor sensitivity, parents and siblings of children with CCHS may also have blunted ventilatory responses to hypercapnea and hypoxia.
 To test this, we studied hypercapnic ventilatory responses and hypoxic ventilatory responses in six mothers, four fathers, and five siblings (6 to 49 yr of age) of seven children with CCHS and compared them with 15 age- and sex-matched control subjects (5 to 47 yr of age).
 Pulmonary function tests were not different between relatives of children with CCHS and control subjects.
 To measure hypercapnic ventilatory responses, subjects rebreathed 5% CO2/95% O2 until PACO2 reached 60 to 70 mm Hg.
 To measure hypoxic ventilatory responses (L/min/% SaO2), subjects rebreathed 14% O2/7% CO2/balance N2 at mixed venous PCO2 until SaO2 fell to 75%.
 All tests were completed in less than 4 min.
 Instantaneous minute ventilation, mean inspiratory flow (tidal volume/inspiratory time), and respiratory timing (inspiratory timing/total respiratory cycle timing) were calculated on a breath-by-breath basis.
 Hypercapnic ventilatory responses were 1.97 +/- 0.32 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in children with CCHS relatives and 2.23 +/- 0.23 L/min/mm Hg PACO2 in control subjects.
 Hypoxic ventilatory responses were -1.99 +/- 0.37 L/min/% SaO2 in the relatives and -1.54 +/- 0.25 L/min/% SaO2 in the control subjects.
