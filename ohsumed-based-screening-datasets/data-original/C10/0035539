Neuropsychiatric aspects of psychogenic status epilepticus.
 We studied 20 patients with continuous repetitive psychogenic seizures simulating status epilepticus.
 Most patients received intravenous doses of multiple anticonvulsants.
 Our definition used for status epilepticus was that of Delgado-Escueta et al, at least 30 minutes of repetitive seizures without regaining consciousness.
 Nineteen of 20 patients were young women, all but one under 40 years of age.
 Sixteen of these patients had a history of childhood seizures.
 In over 50% of patients, seizures continued until respiratory arrest and intubation occurred.
 Thorough neuropsychological testing and psychiatric interview were done after cessation of the acute episode.
 Long-term outcome and prognosis depended on definitive psychiatric diagnosis.
 Repetitive psychogenic seizures simulating status epilepticus are not uncommon, and such patients may incur serious iatrogenic complications from treatment for status epilepticus.
 Appropriate management and long-term prognosis may be determined by the type and severity of the underlying psychiatric disorder.
