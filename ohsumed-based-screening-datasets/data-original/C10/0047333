Prolonged relief of neuralgia after regional anesthetic blocks. A call for further experimental and systematic clinical studies.
 Thirty-eight consecutive patients with neuralgia after peripheral nerve injury were treated with one or two series of peripheral local anesthetic blocks.
 All patients experienced an initial total relief of ongoing pain for 4-12 h.
 Evoked pain (hyperalgesia or allodynia), which occurred in 17 patients, was blocked simultaneously with the spontaneous pain.
 In 18 patients the analgesia outlasted the conduction block and there was a period of complete pain relief of 12-48 h in 13 patients and of 2-6 days in the other 5.
 In 8 patients there was a second phase of analgesia of 4 h to 6 days duration occurring within 12 h of pain recurrence.
 Thus, mono- or biphasic prolonged complete analgesia occurred in 25 out of 38 patients.
 A prolonged analgesia may be the result of a central action of the local anesthetic at the spinal level after intra-axonal incorporation and centripetal axoplasmic transport.
 To test this hypothesis, an experimental study with [3H]lidocaine was performed in 6 rats.
 The radioactive local anesthetic was injected into one hind limb foot with the other side serving as a control.
 Tissue samples from the peripheral nerve, nerve root and the lumbosacral spinal cord segment were analyzed for radioactivity using a scintillation counter technique at various time intervals after the [3H]lidocaine injection.
 There was a low grade of activity in all samples and no difference between the test side and the control side.
 Thus these experiments provided no evidence in support of this hypothesis.
 Various alternative peripheral and central mechanisms are discussed.
 Further studies specifically directed to these alternatives and with longitudinal controls are prompted.
