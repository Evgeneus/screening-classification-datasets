Phencyclidine increased release of beta-endorphin from anterior lobe of the pituitary.
 Phencyclidine (PCP) has been found to affect neuroendocrine function by altering the release of the anterior pituitary hormones, adrenocorticotrophin, luteinizing hormone and prolactin.
 The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of PCP on release of the two pituitary hormones also derived from the adrenocorticotropin precursor, namely, alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and beta-endorphin (beta-E), synthesized in the neurointermediate and anterior lobes of the pituitary.
 At behaviorally active doses, PCP administered i.c.v.
 increased plasma levels of immunoreactive beta-E (i beta-E) without affecting the concentration of immunoreactive alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, suggesting that PCP increased the release of beta-E from only the anterior lobe of the pituitary.
 Dexamethasone pretreatment blocked the PCP-induced increase in i beta-E which indicated further the anterior lobe effects of PCP.
 MK-801 [(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo [a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine maleate), a selective PCP ligand, at behaviorally active doses also increased the plasma concentration of i beta-E.
 The dose-response curves for induction of behavior was very different from that for increasing the concentration of i beta-E in plasma.
 The increase in release of i beta-E was stereoselective as (+)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine but not (-)-(1-(1-phenylcyclohexyl)-3 methylpiperidine increased release of i beta-E.
 The increase in plasma levels of beta-E was not due to an interaction with opioid receptors because naloxone did not block PCP-induced release of beta-E.
 In vitro, PCP also significantly increased release of i beta-E from anterior lobe of the pituitary.
