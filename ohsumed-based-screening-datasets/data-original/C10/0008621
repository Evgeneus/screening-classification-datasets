Calcium antagonists in the management of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage: a review.
 Cerebral arterial vasospasm and infarction is the leading cause of death and disability among patients who reach a major medical center after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
 Recent evidence suggests that two calcium antagonists, nimodipine or nicardipine, may be useful in preventing this important complication of SAH.
 This paper reviews the current status of these two calcium antagonists in the management of SAH.
