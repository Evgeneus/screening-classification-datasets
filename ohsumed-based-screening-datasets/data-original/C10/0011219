Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema complicating massive diltiazem overdose.
 Non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema has not been previously described in calcium channel blocker overdose.
 We describe a case of non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema occurring during the course of therapy for massive diltiazem overdose in a young patient with anorexia nervosa.
 Review of the current literature suggests that major and minor pulmonary complications occur with some frequency in the setting of calcium channel blocker overdose although their exact incidence remains unclear.
