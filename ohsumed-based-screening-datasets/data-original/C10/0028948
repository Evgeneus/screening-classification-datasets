Differing activities of medullary respiratory neurons in eupnea and gasping.
 Our purpose was to compare further eupneic ventilatory activity with that of gasping.
 Decerebrate, paralyzed, and ventilated cats were used; the vagi were sectioned within the thorax caudal to the laryngeal branches.
 Activities of the phrenic nerve and medullary respiratory neurons were recorded.
 Antidromic invasion was used to define bulbospinal, laryngeal, or not antidromically activated units.
 The ventilatory pattern was reversibly altered to gasping by exposure to 1% carbon monoxide in air.
 In eupnea, activities of inspiratory neurons commenced at various times during inspiration, and for most the discharge frequency gradually increased.
 In gasping, the peak discharge frequency of inspiratory neurons was unaltered.
 However, all commenced activities at the start of the phrenic burst and reached peak discharge almost immediately.
 The discharge frequencies of all groups of expiratory neurons fell in gasping, with many neurons ceasing activity entirely.
 These data are consistent with the hypothesis that brain stem mechanisms controlling eupnea and gasping differ fundamentally.
