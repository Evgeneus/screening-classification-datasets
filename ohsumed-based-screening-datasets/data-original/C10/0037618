Pain reduction interventions during neonatal circumcision.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of some noninvasive pain reduction interventions on pain in 121 neonates undergoing unanesthetized circumcision.
 Subjects were randomly assigned to one of six groups: classical music, intrauterine sounds, pacifier, music and pacifier, intrauterine sounds and pacifier, or control (no nurses present and no pain reduction interventions used).
 Physiological variables that were monitored were heart rate, rhythm, dysrhythmias, blood pressure, transcutaneous oxygen (tcpO2), rate pressure product, and behavioral state, measured during 14 circumcision steps.
 Over the 14 steps, 42% of the heart rates, 78% of the systolic blood pressures (SBP), 30% of the diastolic blood pressures (DBP), and 81% of the tcpO2 pressures were abnormal.
 Few significant differences were found among any of the steps.
 SBP and DBP differed significantly between groups during two of the noninvasive steps; and tcpO2 differed significantly during six steps.
