Haemophilus influenzae meningitis with prolonged hospital course.
 A retrospective evaluation of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis observed over a 2-year period documented 86 cases.
 Eight of these patients demonstrated an unusual clinical course characterized by persistent fever (duration: greater than 10 days), cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, profound meningeal enhancement on computed tomography, significant morbidity, and a prolonged hospital course.
 The mean age of these 8 patients was 6 months, in contrast to a mean age of 14 months for the entire group.
 Two patients had clinical evidence of relapse.
 Four of the 8 patients tested for latex particle agglutination in the cerebrospinal fluid remained positive after 10 days.
 All patients received antimicrobial therapy until they were afebrile for a minimum of 5 days.
 Subsequent neurologic examination revealed a persistent seizure disorder in 5 patients (62.5%), moderate-to-profound hearing loss in 2 (25%), mild ataxia in 1 (12.5%), and developmental delay with hydrocephalus which required shunting in 1 (12.5%).
 One patient had no sequelae.
