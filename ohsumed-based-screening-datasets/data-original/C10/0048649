A rare cause of nasal obstruction: a solitary neurofibroma.
 This case represents a peripheral nerve sheath tumor as a cause of nasal obstruction.
 Nerve sheath tumors are relatively uncommon; however, most otolaryngologists will encounter them.
 These tumors develop from cranial and spinal nerve roots and from peripheral nerves.
 In total, approximately 25% to 44% of nerve sheath tumors occur in the head and neck region.
 Although the most important are cranial nerve tumors--the majority being acoustic neuromas arising from the vestibular nerve--they may also develop in the nasal cavity.
