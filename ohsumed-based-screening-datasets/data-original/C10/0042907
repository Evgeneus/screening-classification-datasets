Hemorrhagic venous infarction after excision of an arteriovenous malformation: case report.
 A case of arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in which postoperative hemorrhagic infarction developed, probably because of occlusion of the former draining veins, is reported.
 The hemorrhage developed in the temporal lobe 3 days after the initial operation and was located in the immediate vicinity of the site of the AVM.
 The following findings suggest that the postsurgical hemorrhage probably resulted from a venous thrombosis: 1) no evidence of residual AVM; 2) delayed onset of the hemorrhage, inconsistent with the time course of a hemorrhage developing according to the breakthrough theory or with insufficient hemostasis with a high-pressure afterload; 3) good correlation between the location of the hemorrhage and the occlusion of the draining veins; and 4) multifocal hemorrhage affecting both the gray matter and the subcortical white matter.
 Postoperative hemorrhagic infarction caused by thrombosis in the draining veins is rare, but it should be considered as a distinct postoperative complication after removal of an AVM.
