"Frontal lobe" utilization behavior associated with paramedian thalamic infarction.
 Disinhibited, exaggerated responses to objects and environmental cues (utilization behavior) occur predominantly with frontal lobe damage.
 We report a striking example associated with paramedian thalamic infarction suggesting a thalamofrontal component to environmental interactions that require inhibition, self-monitoring, and cognitive flexibility.
