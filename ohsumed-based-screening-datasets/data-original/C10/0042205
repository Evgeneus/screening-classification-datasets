Isolation of a human DNA sequence which spans the fragile X.
 To identify the sequences involved in the expression of the fragile X and to characterize the molecular basis of the genetic lesion, we have constructed yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) containing human DNA and have screened them with cloned DNA probes which map close to the fragile site at Xq27.3.
 We have isolated and partly characterized a YAC containing approximately 270 kb of human DNA from an X chromosome which expresses the fragile X.
 This sequence in a yeast artificial ring chromosome, XTY26, hybridizes to the two closest DNA markers, VK16 and Do33, which flank the fragile site.
 The human DNA sequence in XTY26 also spans the fragile site on chromosome in situ hybridization.
 When a restriction map of XTY26, derived by using infrequently cutting restriction enzymes, is compared with similar YAC maps derived from non-fragile-X patients, no large-scale differences are observed.
 This YAC, XTY26, may enable (a) the fragile site to be fully characterized at the molecular level and (b) the pathogenetic basis of the fragile-X syndrome to be determined.
