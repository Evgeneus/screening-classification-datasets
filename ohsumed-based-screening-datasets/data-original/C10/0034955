Effects of preoperative electrical stimulability and historical factors on performance with multichannel cochlear implant.
 We investigated the relationship between results of preoperative transtympanic electrical promontory stimulation, duration of deafness, postoperative implanted psychophysical results, and postoperative speech and speech sound recognition as indicated by a battery of five tests.
 Our subjects were 10 patients implanted with the Cochlear Corporation multielectrode implant, 1 year postimplantation, with a minimum of 17 active electrodes programmed in the bipolar + 1 mode.
 The results indicated that preoperative promontory thresholds, the slope of the threshold function, and the duration of auditory deprivation are excellent predictors of postoperative speech and speech sound recognition in the auditory (processor alone) mode.
 These results have significant implications for patient selection and counseling.
