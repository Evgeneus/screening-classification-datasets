Civilian craniocerebral gunshot wounds.
 Experience with 120 patients who incurred a gunshot wound to the head with dural penetration is presented.
 All of the patients were managed by a standard resuscitation protocol and assigned a clinical grade based on their level of consciousness both at the time of presentation and at 2 to 4 months after injury.
 Fifty patients (42%) underwent surgery.
 Twenty-eight patients (23%) had a good recovery, 19 (16%) were moderately disabled, 6 (5%) were severely disabled, and 67 (56%) died.
 All patients who were alert and awake with a normal or near normal neurological examination at the time of admission survived with a good outcome.
 All but 4 patients who were comatose at the time of admission died.
 Nine patients, however, who were not comatose at the time of admission died from potentially preventable causes.
 In 3 of these patients, a more aggressive diagnostic approach (including cerebral angiography) may have altered their ultimate outcome.
 An expeditious approach to the trauma victim with a comprehensive management scheme after injury may have altered the course in the remainder of these patients.
