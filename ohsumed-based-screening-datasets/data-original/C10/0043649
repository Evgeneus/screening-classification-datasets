Globoid cell leukodystrophy: a family with both late-infantile and adult type.
 We present a patient with adult-onset globoid cell leukodystrophy (GBL) who had almost complete deficiency of galactosylceramide beta-galactosidase.
 A brother of the index patient deteriorated neurologically and died at the age of 4, probably from the late-infantile form of the disease.
 In this family, two clinical types of GBL are probably different expressions of an identical genotype.
