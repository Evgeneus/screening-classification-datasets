Carpal tunnel syndrome: objective measures and splint use.
 One hundred five adults with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) were studied to assess the efficacy of a neutral-angle wrist splint, and to identify criteria for splint referral.
 Ten observations before and after treatment were analyzed with descriptive and inferential statistics.
 After splint use, 67% of the subjects reported symptom relief.
 T-test comparison of sensory latency of values before and after treatment indicated improvement for the total group.
 Chi-square and t-tests failed to reveal significant differences between relief and no-relief groups for gender, affected hand, presence of concomitant conditions, duration of symptoms before treatment, age, length of time between pretreatment and posttreatment nerve conduction testing, initial nerve latency of motor and sensory fibers, or the difference between pretreatment and posttreatment sensory latencies.
 A significant difference was found for motor latency; the relief group improved and the no-relief group deteriorated.
 Data suggest that splinting is most effective if applied within three months of symptom onset.
 Those with damage to the wrist structures or median nerve were least responsive to splinting.
