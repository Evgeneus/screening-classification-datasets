Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan: muscle biopsy findings in 4 patients.
 Muscle biopsies of 4 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome associated with ingestion of L-tryptophan showed lymphocytic infiltrates with occasional eosinophils largely restricted to interstitial fibrous tissue and perivascular areas.
 There was inflammation and fibrosis of muscle spindle capsules in 3 patients.
 In the 2 sickest patients, there was profound muscle atrophy, affecting both muscle fiber types.
