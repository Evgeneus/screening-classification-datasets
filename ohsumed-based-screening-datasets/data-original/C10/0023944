Strokes in African-Americans.
 Hypertension is the most important risk factor for stroke, especially in African-Americans.
 Improved control of high blood pressure nationwide is a key factor in the recent dramatic decline in stroke frequency, most notably in African-American women.
 Hypertension control programs must be adequately funded and expanded.
 African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of risk factors for stroke, including hypertension.
 There is evidence that the cerebral vessels involved in ischemic stroke in African-Americans may differ from those of Caucasians.
 There is an urgent need for more research on stroke in general, risk factor relations in particular, and mechanisms in the pathogenesis of stroke in African-Americans.
