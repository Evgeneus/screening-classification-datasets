Characterization of "peak E," a novel amino acid associated with eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.
 Epidemiologic studies strongly associate eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) with ingestion of tryptophan containing a contaminant ("peak E").
 Prior reports have suggested that peak E is the di-tryptophan N alpha-animal of acetaldehyde.
 Spectral and chemical studies now demonstrate that peak E is 1,1'-ethylidenebis[tryptophan].
 This novel amino acid may be the etiological agent responsible for EMS, or it may be a marker of a still unidentified causal agent.
