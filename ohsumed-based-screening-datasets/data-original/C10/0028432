Stability of buffered lidocaine and epinephrine used for local anesthesia.
 Buffered lidocaine has been recently recommended for local anesthesia, as there is less pain on injection of the buffered solution.
 Reduced pain on injection of lidocaine and epinephrine buffered to a neutral pH was confirmed in 20 subjects (P less than .01).
 Concentrations of buffered lidocaine and epinephrine were performed in order to evaluate their stability.
 Buffered lidocaine dropped to 66.1% of initial concentrations after 4 weeks when stored at 25 degrees C.
 Buffered epinephrine fell to 1.34% of its initial concentration under similar conditions.
 Buffered lidocaine and epinephrine maintained 94.54% and 82.04%, respectively, of their initial concentrations after 4 weeks when refrigerated at 0-4 degrees C.
 Both lidocaine and epinephrine maintained greater than 90% concentration 2 weeks after buffering when stored at 0-4 degrees C.
 This permits batch buffering of lidocaine with epinephrine and storage for periods up to 2 weeks when properly refrigerated.
