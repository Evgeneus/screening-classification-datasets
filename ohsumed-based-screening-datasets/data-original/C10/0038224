First clinical study of the selective 5-HT3 antagonist, granisetron (BRL 43694), in the acute treatment of migraine headache.
 Granisetron (BRL 43694), a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, was assessed as acute therapy for the first time in migraine patients.
 In an open pilot study 7 migraine attacks were treated in 6 patients.
 All but 1 patient experienced marked and rapid relief from the headache, and nausea and vomiting were rapidly resolved in the 6 cases where these symptoms accompanied the attack.
 No side effects were recorded.
 Development of granisetron for migraine was suspended during the study for extraneous reasons.
