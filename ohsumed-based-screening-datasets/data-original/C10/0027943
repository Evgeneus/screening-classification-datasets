"Early" initiation of levodopa treatment does not promote the development of motor response fluctuations, dyskinesias, or dementia in Parkinson's disease.
 We reviewed the histories of patients seen in a large Parkinson's disease clinic from 1983 to 1989 to determine if there is a relationship between the timing of initiation of levodopa therapy and the development of motor response fluctuations, dyskinesias, and dementia.
 There were no factors predisposing to the development of response fluctuations or dementia.
 Younger age at disease onset predisposed to the development of dyskinesia.
 Dyskinesias occurred in a greater proportion of patients in whom the initiation of levodopa therapy was delayed by more than 2 years from disease diagnosis than among those in whom treatment was started earlier.
 We thus failed to identify any adverse consequences of early levodopa treatment in our patient population.
