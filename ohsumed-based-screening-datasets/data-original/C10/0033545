Adjuvant effect of human growth hormone with an inactivated flavivirus vaccine.
 Vaccines made by inactivating pathogenic microorganisms have been dramatically successful in controlling diseases in humans and animals.
 Despite their successes, they have a major disadvantage in that several inoculations are required for them to be effective.
 To overcome this problem, a commercial inactivated vaccine preparation against tickborne encephalitis was combined with human growth hormone (HGH).
 This formulation produced complete protection in a murine model with only one dose of vaccine, apparently by binding hormone and antigen to an insoluble matrix containing aluminium hydroxide.
 Thus it is postulated that when virus-specific lymphocytes are attracted to the site of injection, the hormone is at a high local concentration and stimulates the clonal expansion of antigen-specific T cells.
 The development of genetically engineered HGH now gives unlimited supplies of hormone, potentially resulting in an increase in efficacy of a wide variety of vaccines, especially those needing prolonged immunization schedules such as those being developed to combat human immunodeficiency virus infection.
