Psychological stress and the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome.
 The relationship of stress and social support to the fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (FS) was investigated by administration of 4 questionnaire instruments to 28 patients with FS, 20 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 28 pain-free normal controls.
 FS showed higher levels of stress as measured by daily "hassles" than did RA or controls.
 However, on a measure of major life stress, they reported lower levels.
 No differences were found between groups with regard to daily "uplifts" or social support.
 Correlations between those measures of stress and social support with their scores on the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale showed that the Hassles Scale was significantly related to the AIMS Psychological component.
