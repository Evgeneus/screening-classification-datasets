Factors affecting decisions made by family members of patients with severe head injury.
 An exploratory descriptive study was conducted to determine factors affecting decisions made by families of patients with severe head injury during the first two stages of recovery.
 Nineteen family members of 11 patients participated in this study.
 Five interviews of each family member were conducted over a 1-month period after the injury.
 Sixty decisions were identified by family members.
 Six factors: personal functioning, relationships, information, uncertain outcomes, environment, and emotions, were found to affect these decisions.
 The six factors identified by family members have specific implications for nursing.
