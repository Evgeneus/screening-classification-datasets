Identification of perilymph proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.
 Perilymph has a total protein component that is quantitatively distinct from serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
 The goal of this research was to determine if perilymph contains any qualitatively unique protein constituents that will distinguish it from serum or CSF.
 To test this hypothesis, matched sets of perilymph, serum, and CSF were obtained from 18 guinea pigs and seven human subjects.
 The purity of each sample was assured by measurement of the protein concentration of each sample and comparison of this parameter to known normal values for perilymph, serum, and CSF.
 Each sample was then subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, separating proteins by isoelectric point in the horizontal dimension and by relative molecular weight in the vertical dimension.
 All gels were processed under precisely identical physical conditions by use of a diamine silver stain.
 A small number of perilymph proteins not found in plasma were identified in both the guinea pig and the human specimens.
 The finding of unique perilymph proteins may permit the development of a sensitive marker that will aid in the diagnosis of perilymph fistula.
