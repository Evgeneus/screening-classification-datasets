The antinociceptive effects of anterior pretectal stimulation in tests using thermal, mechanical and chemical noxious stimuli.
 Four behavioural tests have been used to study the antinociceptive effects of electrical stimulation of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APtN) in the rat.
 The antinociceptive effects of stimulating this nucleus, which lies dorsally in the posterior diencephalon, have recently been studied extensively but always using briefly applied heat stimuli.
 It is reported here that APtN stimulation effectively inhibited responses to briefly applied noxious pressure and longer-lasting noxious chemical (formalin) stimuli.
 Although the tail-flick reflex to noxious heat was very potently depressed by APtN stimulation, responses to noxious heat in the hot-plate test were not.
 Three doses of morphine were also studied with each test and it was concluded that 15 sec of 35 microA r.m.s.
 current into the APtN was as effective as 3-5 mg/kg morphine s.c.
 in the rat.
