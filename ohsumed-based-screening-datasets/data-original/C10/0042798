Radiation-induced meningiomas: experience at the Mount Sinai Hospital and review of the literature.
 From the records of The Mount Sinai Hospital, seven cases which met established criteria for radiation-induced meningiomas were identified.
 This represents the largest series of radiogenic meningiomas documented in North America and includes both intracranial and intraspinal tumors.
 The records and pathological specimens were reviewed and these data analyzed with other cases retrieved from the world literature.
 This study reveals that radiation-induced meningiomas can be categorized into three groups based on the amount of radiation administered: 1) low dose; 2) moderate dose and miscellaneous; and 3) high dose.
 The overwhelming majority of cases had received low-dose irradiation (800 rad) to the scalp for tinea capitis and the second largest group resulted from high-dose irradiation for primary brain tumors (greater than 2000 rad).
 The unique features distinguishing radiation-induced meningiomas from other meningiomas are reviewed.
 Although histologically atypical tumors were common in this series, overt malignancy was not encountered.
 The preoperative management of these lesions should include angiography to evaluate for large-vessel occlusive vasculopathy, a known association of meningiomas induced by high-dose irradiation.
 Given the propensity these tumors possess for recurrence, a wide bony and dural margin is recommended at surgical resection.
