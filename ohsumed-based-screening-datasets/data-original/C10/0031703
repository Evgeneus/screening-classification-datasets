High frequency of asymptomatic visual field defects in subjects with transient ischaemic attacks or minor strokes.
 The hypothesis that asymptomatic visual field defects can be found in patients with carotid transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) or minor strokes was tested.
 Twenty-two consecutive male patients with TIA and 18 patients with minor strokes from the carotid artery territory were examined by perimetry, cerebral computerised tomography and regional cerebral blood flow.
 Asymptomatic visual field defects were found in many TIA and minor stroke patients, 29% (5/17) and 57% (8/14), respectively (NS).
 Eighty-five per cent (11/13) of the scotomas were solely or predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field (P = 0.008 for absolute defects and P = 0.03 for relative defects).
 We conclude that both carotid territory TIA and minor stroke patients have a high frequency of asymptomatic visual field defects, predominantly located in the upper part of the visual field.
