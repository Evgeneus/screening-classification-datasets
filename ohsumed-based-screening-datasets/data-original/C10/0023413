Actigraphic home-monitoring sleep-disturbed and control infants and young children: a new method for pediatric assessment of sleep-wake patterns.
 Two studies were conducted to evaluate actigraphic home-monitoring for the assessment of infants' and children's sleep patterns.
 In the first study, 11 children (aged 12 to 48 months) were monitored in the laboratory by traditional polysomnography and by actigraphy for one night.
 Actigraphic automatic sleep-wake scorings were compared with those of the polysomnograph; total agreement rate was 85.3%.
 In the second study, sleep patterns of 63 sleep-disturbed and 34 control healthy children (aged 9 to 27 months) were compared.
 These children were home-monitored by actigraph for a mean of 4.45 nights (total 482 nights).
 Actigraphic data were analyzed by an automated scoring procedure.
 Sleep quality of the sleep-disturbed children, measured by actigraphically derived sleep percent and number of longer-than-5-minute wakings, was significantly lower than that of the control subjects (P less than .0001).
 Sleep measures showed significant night-to-night stability in both groups.
 The stability of specific measures and their age trends were different between the groups.
 Actigraphic sleep measures alone could discriminate between sleep-disturbed and control children with a highly correct assignment rate of 79.4% and 91.2%, respectively.
