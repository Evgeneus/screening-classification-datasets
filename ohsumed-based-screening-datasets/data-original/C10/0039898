A contribution to the genetics of febrile seizures: waking and sleep EEG in siblings.
 Waking and sleep EEGs were recorded in 67 siblings of 52 patients with febrile seizures (FS).
 Epileptic activity was noted in at least 1 sibling for 28 of the 52 patients (53.8%).
 Epileptic discharges were noted in 33 (49.2%) of the 67 siblings.
 Thirty-two siblings had 3-4 Hz spike wave complexes, and 1 sibling had independent centrotemporal spike foci (rolandic foci).
 Epileptic activity was noted exclusively in the waking state in only 3%, in waking and sleep in 31.3%, and only in sleep in 14.9%.
 The greatest number of epileptic discharges occurred in waking during hyperventatilation (32.8%) and during stage C sleep (38.8%).
 In 5 photosensitive siblings, additional epileptic discharges were noted in sleep in 1 and in waking and sleep in 4.
 At least 1 sibling in 5 (55.6%) of 9 patients with complicated febrile seizures, in 23 (53.5%) of 43 patients with simple FS, and in 4 of 9 patients (44.4%) with later onset epileptic seizures had seizure discharges.
 At least 1 sibling in 24 of 43 patients (55.8%) with exclusively FS in 13 of 30 (43.3%) male patients and in 15 of 22 (68.2%) female patients had seizure discharges.
 Siblings aged 6-10 years had (66.7%) the highest rates of activation.
 Epileptic discharges were noted in 83.3% of siblings with seizures, but in only 45.9% of siblings without seizures.
 Seizure activity was recorded in 68.2% of siblings who had occipital 3-4-Hz theta-delta-activity but in only 13.0% of siblings without this pattern.
