Gunshot wounds to the cervical spine.
 A retrospective review was performed on 28 patients with low-velocity gunshot wounds to the cervical spine.
 These composed 31% of all spinal gunshot wounds seen during the study period between 1979 and 1988.
 Surgical decompression did not seem to improve neurologic recovery in either the incomplete or complete patients.
 Neurologic recovery also appeared to be unaffected by the presence of retained intracanal bullet fragments.
 The authors found no advantage to routine neck exploration of this penetrating injury.
 Complications were seen in 93% of the patients.
 Most complications were thromboembolic, pulmonary, and urinary tract infections.
 No cases of instability occurred as a direct result of the gunshot wound.
 No deaths occurred in this series.
 Two cases of posttraumatic syrinxes were diagnosed.
 The authors' current treatment recommendations for these patients include selective wound management and observation of retained intracanal bullet fragments in patients with complete lesions.
 Surgical decompression after this injury is not recommended.
