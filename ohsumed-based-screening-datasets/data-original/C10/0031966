An open-label trial of fluoxetine for obsessive-compulsive disorder in Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome.
 Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) occurs commonly in association with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) and can be a major source of disability.
 Fluoxetine, a new antidepressant, has been effective for psychiatric patients with OCD.
 We conducted an open-label trial of fluoxetine (20 to 40 mg/d) for 32 GTS patients with OCD.
 After 1 week of treatment, six patients (16%) withdrew from the trial due to perceived lack of benefit.
 Data were analyzed for 26 patients (13 children and 13 adults) who were treated by a neurologist for 3 to 8 months.
 Following treatment, there was a significant reduction in scores on the Leyton Obsessional Inventory for both the adult and child groups, and 81% of patients reported a subjective improvement in obsessions and compulsions.
 Since fluoxetine was well tolerated, our findings indicate that the drug may be an effective agent for the treatment of OCD in GTS patients.
