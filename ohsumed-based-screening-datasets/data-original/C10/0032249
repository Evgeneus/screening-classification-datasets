Vocal cord paralysis in the Shy-Drager syndrome. A cause of postoperative respiratory obstruction.
 A case is presented in which unexpected and persistent postoperative respiratory problems led to the finding of bilateral abductor vocal cord paralysis and confirmed the diagnosis of the Shy-Drager syndrome.
 Anaesthetists should be aware that vocal cord paralysis may be a feature of this uncommon condition, and should consider the possibility of glottic obstruction as a cause of ventilatory difficulties.
