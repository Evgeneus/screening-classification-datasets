Cardiovascular causes of syncope. Identifying and controlling trigger mechanisms.
 Syncope usually has a cardiovascular source, so neurologic evaluation has a low diagnostic yield in these patients.
 Cardiac arrhythmias in persons with or without structural heart disease can produce syncope.
 Neurocardiogenic dysfunction that results in diminished venous return and hypercontractility is another frequent cause.
 Postural hypotension or left ventricular outflow obstruction may also be to blame.
 Careful history taking and physical examination, head-up tilt testing, echocardiography or radionuclide isotope imaging, and electrophysiologic study are often diagnostic.
 However, syncope remains undiagnosed in some patients, and they may require periodic reassessment.
 Treatment options are available for most cardiovascular disorders, among them use of pharmacologic agents; catheter, surgical, or radio-frequency modification of certain tachycardias; and permanent pacing.
