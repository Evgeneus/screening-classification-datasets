Tissue plasminogen activator reduces brain injury in a rabbit model of thromboembolic stroke.
 Tissue plasminogen activator is an endogenous fibrin-specific serine protease with potent thrombolytic activity.
 We investigated the efficacy of tissue plasminogen activator in reducing cerebral infarct size after thromboembolic stroke in a rabbit model.
 Seventeen rabbits were randomized to receive either tissue plasminogen activator (2.5 mg/kg, n = 6) or vehicle control (n = 11).
 We controlled mean arterial pressure, hematocrit, and arterial blood gases before and after the intracarotid embolization of an autologous clot.
 Cerebral blood flow (cm3/100 g/min) (mean +/- SEM) was immediately reduced from 55.2 +/- 7.7 to 8.5 +/- 2.5 in the control group and from 61.8 +/- 14.8 to 10.0 +/- 3.5 in the treated group after embolization.
 Cerebral blood flow recovered significantly within 60 minutes of thrombolytic therapy and attained a value of 59.6 +/- 10.0 cm3/100 g/min 4 hours after embolization, whereas cerebral blood flow in control animals demonstrated only a minimal recovery to 15.3 +/- 8.9 cm3/100 g/min.
 Cerebral infarct size (percent of hemisphere) was reduced from 34.4 +/- 5.6% in control animals to 8.8 +/- 5.6% in treated animals (mean +/- SEM, p less than 0.01).
 These results suggest that tissue plasminogen activator may be efficacious in restoring cerebral blood flow and thus limiting infarct size in acute thromboembolic stroke.
