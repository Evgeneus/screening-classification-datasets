Arboviral infections in the United States.
 Arboviruses are important considerations in the differential diagnosis of encephalitis and other acute infections.
 Alterations in the environment and in human behaviors contribute to changing patterns of arboviral transmission.
 These trends, the periodic epidemic resurgence of arboviral diseases such as St.
 Louis encephalitis, and the discovery of new arboviruses present a continued challenge to infectious disease clinicians.
