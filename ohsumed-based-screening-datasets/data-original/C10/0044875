Catecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals and patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
 The parabrachial nucleus is believed to play a role in autonomic regulation.
 We have used the Fontana-Masson ammoniacal silver nitrate method and a tyrosine hydroxylase-immunostaining technique to demonstrate the presence of neuromelanin-containing catecholaminergic neurons in the parabrachial nucleus of normal individuals.
 In addition, we also show that there is a significant reduction of these catecholaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy bodies in the parabrachial nucleus of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
 These findings may be related to the several autonomic disturbances that may occur in idiopathic Parkinson's disease.
