Posterior chamber IOL implantation with suboptimal posterior capsular support.
 A posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC/IOL) was implanted in 24 patients with suboptimal posterior capsular support due to preoperative or intraoperative rupture of the posterior capsule or zonules in which at least six clock hours of peripheral zonular support remained.
 The PC/IOLs were implanted, with ciliary sulcus haptic placement, with special attention to sulcus fixation of the haptics over the zone of residual zonular support.
 All of the IOLs have remained centered after a mean follow-up 10.5 months.
 We conclude that a PC/IOL can be successfully implanted and its position maintained if at least six clock hours of peripheral zonules remain.
