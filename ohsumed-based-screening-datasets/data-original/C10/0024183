Normal pressure hydrocephalus in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 We describe a patient who had concomitant systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a normal pressure hydrocephalus.
 She improved only after appropriate therapy for each.
 Although 6 patients with arthritis and normal pressure hydrocephalus have been described, this is the first report of it occurring in a patient with SLE.
 It has been emphasized that normal pressure hydrocephalus can easily be overlooked in elderly patients with arthritic conditions.
 Since neuropsychiatric symptoms are likelier to occur in patients with SLE than in other rheumatologic conditions, the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus may be delayed or overlooked.
 Because normal pressure hydrocephalus is a potentially reversible cause of neurologic dysfunction, it should be considered in appropriate populations.
