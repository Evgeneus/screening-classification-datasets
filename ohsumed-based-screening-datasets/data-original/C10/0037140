Primary intracerebral osteosarcoma.
 A 64-year-old man was admitted because of a rapidly progressive left side hemiparesis.
 A computed tomography scan showed a right side intrathalamic mass, partially calcified.
 Surgical specimen proved to be an osteosarcoma.
 The patient died 3 days later from an acute myocardial infarct.
 Autopsy failed to discover any other significant lesion.
 A review of the literature disclosed that this case might be the second published primary intracerebral osteosarcoma and the first with immunocytochemical analysis.
