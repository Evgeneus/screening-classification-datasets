Experience with rehabilitation in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) represent a novel referral population for rehabilitation services.
 Limited information about the rehabilitation needs of individuals with human immunodeficiency virus infection is available.
 We reviewed 51 consecutive patients with AIDS referred to a rehabilitation consult service.
 Common problems encountered included generalized deconditioning (27%) and neurologic dysfunction (45%).
 Neurologic presentations were diverse and included hemiparesis, diffuse cognitive dysfunction and dementia, myelopathy, myopathy and peripheral neuropathy.
 Other patients were referred for wound care as well as the management of the local effects of Kaposi's sarcoma, various musculoskeletal syndromes and new onset blindness.
 Problems identified included impaired mobility (76%), difficulty with self-care (57%), impaired cognition (29%) and uncontrolled pain (37%).
 Among the rehabilitation interventions utilized were therapeutic exercise (73%), gait aids (45%), bathroom and safety equipment (45%), orthotics (29%), vocational counseling (4%), pain management (29%) and whirlpool treatments (10%).
 Five patients were too ill or refused treatment.
 We conclude that AIDS patients referred for rehabilitation have a wide variety of physical deficits, demonstrate a considerable degree of functional impairment and may require multiple rehabilitation interventions.
