Optic nerve sheath decompression for the treatment of progressive nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy.
 We performed optic nerve sheath decompression on four patients (five eyes) with visual loss secondary to nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
 Four of the five eyes had marked improvement in visual function after the operation.
 Optic nerve sheath decompression is an effective treatment for patients with nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy and progressive visual loss.
