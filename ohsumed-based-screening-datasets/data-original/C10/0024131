Intraoperative ultrasonography: an important surgical adjunct for intramedullary tumors.
 The echographic characteristics of 186 suspected intramedullary spinal cord tumors were reviewed.
 Ultrasonography was found to be specific in distinguishing the tumor type, the extent of the lesion, and the presence and type of associated cysts.
 Ultrasonography greatly facilitates the selection of respective sites for the placement of a myelotomy, and for initiation of the resection.
 Additionally, this indispensable adjunct provides ongoing images that allow the preoperative plan to be precisely followed in a surgical field where anatomical landmarks are limited and the margin for error is minimal.
