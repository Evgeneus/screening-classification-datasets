Miosis and internal ophthalmoplegia as a manifestation of partial seizures.
 We present a patient whose only physical manifestation of a partial sensory seizure was bilateral pupillary constriction and internal ophthalmoplegia.
 The onset and offset of each attack corresponded distinctly with an electroencephalographic discharge of the left temporo-occipital region.
 We propose involvement of a cortical pupillary constrictive center in the temporal-occipital area.
