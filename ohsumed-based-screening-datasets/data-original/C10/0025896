The interpretation of dysprosody in patients with Parkinson's disease.
 Prosodic features in the speech production of 21 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease were tested.
 The appreciation of vocal and facial expression was also examined in the same patients.
 Significant intergroup differences were found in the prosody production tasks but, in contrast to previous results, not in the receptive tasks on the recognition and appreciation of prosody and of facial expression.
 The discrepancy between the production and recognition of prosodic features does not support the suggestion that dysprosody in Parkinson's disease is necessarily a disorder of processing emotional information that could be misinterpreted as a dysarthria.
