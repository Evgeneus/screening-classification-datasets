Basal temporal language area.
 Language interference was elicited by electrical stimulation of the dominant basal temporal region in 8 out of 22 cases and in none of 7 cases with subdural electrodes implanted over the nondominant temporal lobe.
 Language interference was elicited by stimulation of electrodes placed over the fusiform gyrus 3-7 cm from the tip of the temporal lobe.
 Electrical stimulation of the basal temporal language area produced a global receptive and expressive aphasia with speech arrest at high stimulus intensities.
 Other higher cortical function, for example copying complex designs or memory of nonverbal information was intact, in spite of the total inability to process verbal information.
 At lower stimulus intensities partial aphasias with a predominant receptive component occurred.
 Surgical resection of the basal temporal language area produces no lasting language deficit.
