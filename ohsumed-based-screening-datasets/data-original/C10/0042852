The treatment of small acoustic tumors: now or later?
 Prior to the advent of microneurosurgery, the operative mortality for acoustic tumor removal was high and management often consisted of observation until sufficient symptoms warranted removal.
 The treatment of these tumors has evolved, and recent introduction of gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the diagnosis of very small intracanalicular acoustic tumors before hearing has been significantly affected.
 For such tumors, some surgeons advocate the premicrosurgical philosophy of observation rather than removal.
 Our results of small acoustic tumor removal with attempt at hearing preservation were reviewed.
 From 1961 to June 1989, 39 acoustic tumors 0.5 cm or less were removed by the middle fossa approach.
 Measurable hearing was preserved in 67%, and facial function 1 year postoperatively was normal or nearly normal in 97%.
 There was no other permanent operative morbidity.
 Given our results, early surgical removal of small acoustic tumors is advocated.
