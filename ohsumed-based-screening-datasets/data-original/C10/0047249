Symptomatic cerebral swelling complicating diabetic ketoacidosis documented by intraventricular pressure monitoring: survival without neurologic sequela.
 A six-year-old boy developed symptomatic cerebral swelling four hours after the initiation of treatment for newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus complicated by ketoacidosis.
 Ventriculostomy documented intracranial pressure over a two-day period.
 Increased intracranial pressure unresponsive to controlled hyperventilation and sedation was treated by administering a diuretic and by drainage via a ventriculostomy.
 Intracranial pressure monitoring was a useful adjunct in management of this rare, but often lethal, complication of diabetes mellitus.
 One year later, both school performance and the results of a neurologic examination were normal.
