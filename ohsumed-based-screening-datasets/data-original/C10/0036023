Bladder compliance in myelodysplastic children: effect of anti-reflux surgery and conservative treatment. Paediatric urology.
 Little is known about changes in bladder compliance and bladder capacity in myelodysplastic patients following anti-reflux surgery.
 A study group of 70 patients was divided as follows: group A included 20 myelodysplastic patients who had been operated on for reflux and whose subsequent treatment was conservative.
 Group B comprised 31 myelodysplastic patients who had been treated conservatively; a third group of 19 non-myelodysplastic patients, treated by anti-reflux surgery because of primary reflux, formed the control group.
 The follow-up period for group A averaged 61 months (extending from a urodynamic study 3 months after surgery to the most recent test).
 In group B the mean follow-up period between the initial test and the latest test was 86 months.
 Bladder compliance in group A patients did not increase significantly (from 5.5 to 6.9), but patients in group B did show a significant increase (from 5.9 to 10.7).
 Compliance in the 19 non-myelodysplastic patients decreased only marginally 6 months after surgery (from 29.6 to 26.3).
 Changes in bladder capacity showed a similar trend.
 In their most recent test, however, the bladder capacity of group A patients increased to the same volume as that of group B.
 A high correlation between radiological bladder deformity and bladder compliance was found.
 We propose a bladder compliance of 10.0 as the lower limit for myelodysplastic patients' preferred range.
 It was concluded that anti-reflux operations prevent any improvement in bladder compliance (but not in bladder capacity) compared with conservative treatment.
