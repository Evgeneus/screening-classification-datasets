Reactive occipital epileptiform activity: is it benign?
 Occipital epileptiform activity that is almost continuous and reactive to eye opening has been associated with a childhood epilepsy syndrome and basilar migraine with seizures.
 An association of these syndromes with a benign course had been disputed.
 In this study, a retrospective investigation of reactive occipital epileptiform activity (ROEA) was performed to determine the prognostic value of this distinctive EGG pattern.
 The EEG and hospital record of patients with ROEA were reviewed with an observation period of 6 months to 8 years.
 The patients were divided into good and poor outcome groups based on response to treatment.
 Of 33 patients, 12 (36.4%) had complete seizure control; 21 (63.6%) continued to have poorly controlled seizures.
 Only 3 (9.1%) patients were able to discontinue antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) without seizure recurrence.
 Analysis of clinical and EEG variables showed that a history of perinatal difficulties, abnormal neurologic findings, and abnormal EEG background activities occur significantly more frequently in the poor outcome group.
 This study suggests that ROEA is not uniformly associated with a benign course and that other factors are involved in determining prognosis of the epilepsy.
