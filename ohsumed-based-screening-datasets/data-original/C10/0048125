A double-blind comparison of low-dose intravenous ketamine and methohexital in adults.
 Two ultralight general anesthetic techniques, one using low-dose ketamine and the other using methohexital as the primary anesthetic agent, were compared for efficacy, safety, and psychomotor recovery in a double-blind fashion for use during third molar surgery.
 Low-dose intravenous ketamine as the primary anesthetic following premedication with fentanyl and midazolam, and in conjunction with nitrous oxide, appeared to produce less hypoxia, hypercarbia, and apnea than when methohexital was used.
 No significant differences were noted in heart rate or blood pressure between the techniques.
 The ketamine technique was universally preferred by the surgeons and anesthesiologists because of superior patient cooperation and airway management.
 No unpleasant psychomimetic side effects of significance were noted with the use of ketamine.
 Postoperative recovery took slightly longer in the ketamine group, with patients being judged fit for discharge approximately 10 to 15 minutes later than the patients who received methohexital.
