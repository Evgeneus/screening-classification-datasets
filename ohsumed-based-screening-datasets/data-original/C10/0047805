Brain biopsy in tuberculoma: the risks and benefits.
 In developing countries, 5 to 8% of the space-occupying lesions of the central nervous system are tuberculomas.
 Diagnosis can be difficult in the absence of extracranial tuberculosis; computed tomography is suggestive only.
 To assess the value of brain biopsies in tuberculomas, the records of 15 patients aged 6 to 80 years were reviewed.
 Histological confirmation was obtained in 15 patients, and acid-fast bacilli were cultured from 12 patients.
 Intracranial hypertension was the principal sign in 11 patients; other neurological signs were related to the location of the tuberculoma.
 One patient had evidence of extracranial tuberculosis.
 Biopsy-related complications consisted of an epidural hematoma in 1 patient and hydrocephalus in another; both required additional surgery.
 One case of tuberculous meningitis was probably related to surgery and poor drug compliance.
 There was no postoperative mortality.
 Thirteen patients (2 were lost to follow-up) were cured after an average of 16 months of antituberculous therapy.
 It was concluded that the brain biopsy is useful in diagnosing tuberculoma but that there is some associated risk.
