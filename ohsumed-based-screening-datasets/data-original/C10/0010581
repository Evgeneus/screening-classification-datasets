Pseudopsammomatous meningioma with elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen: a true secretory meningioma. Case report.
 A sphenoid-wing meningioma in a 60-year-old woman was accompanied by elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, which returned to normal after removal of the tumor.
 Light microscopic examination revealed a secretory meningioma containing numerous pseudopsammoma bodies and a prominent vascular pattern.
 Immunohistochemical analysis showed the tumor cells and pseudopsammoma bodies to be CEA-positive.
 This case illustrates the possibility that secretory meningioma may be associated with clinically detectable secretion of CEA.
 The report also documents the rare occurrence of elevated serum CEA in a primary benign intracranial tumor.
