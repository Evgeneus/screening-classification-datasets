The motor control assessment: an instrument to measure motor control in physically disabled children.
 The Motor Control Assessment has been developed as a research tool for the assessment of motor skills in physically disabled children.
 In tests of concurrent validity it was found to be highly correlated with the results of the Physical Abilities Chart (Pearson coefficient = .96), and satisfactorily correlated with ranking of motor ability assigned using the clinical judgment of physiotherapists (Spearman rank coefficients = .63 to .97 in diagnostic subgroups).
 Estimates of both interrater and intrarater reliability were also high, with intraclass coefficients above .95.
