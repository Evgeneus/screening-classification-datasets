Deep brain stimulation: a review of basic research and clinical studies.
 Deep brain stimulation for pain control in humans was first used almost 30 years ago and has continued to receive considerable attention.
 Despite the large number of clinical reports describing pain relief, numerous studies have indicated that the results of these procedures vary considerably.
 In addition, many neurosurgeons find the procedures unpredictable, and considerable disagreement still exists regarding important issues related to the technique itself.
 This review gives an historical overview of the relevant basic and clinical literature and provides a critical examination of the clinical efficacy, choice of stimulation sites, parameters of stimulation, and effects on experimental pain.
 Finally, we give suggestions for future research that could more definitively determine the usefulness of deep brain stimulation for pain control.
