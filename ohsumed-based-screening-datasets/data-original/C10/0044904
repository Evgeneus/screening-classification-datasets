Schwannoma of the brachial plexus mimicking an apical lung tumor.
 Primary tumors of the brachial plexus are unusual.
 We describe a patient with a large schwannoma of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus that had the radiologic appearance of an apical lung mass.
 Use of a posterior subscapular approach as well as intraoperative nerve action potential recording permitted resection with spared function.
