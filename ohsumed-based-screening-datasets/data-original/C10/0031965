Behavioral state-specific changes in human hippocampal theta activity.
 Although there has been extensive examination of the behavioral and physiologic correlates of hippocampal theta activity in animals, the human literature consists of a single case study.
 We investigated the differential effects of four behavioral states on human hippocampal theta activity in 16 epilepsy surgery patients.
 Behavioral conditions included resting eyes closed (RC), resting eyes open (RO), eyes open with auditory word activation (AW), and eyes open with visuospatial activation (VS).
 Hippocampal theta activity decreased during both RO and VS compared to both RC and AW.
 There were reciprocal changes in delta activity.
 Comparisons of RO to VS and of RC to AW were nonsignificant.
 The results demonstrate state-specific changes in human hippocampal theta and are consistent with the animal literature that relates hippocampal theta to sensorimotor integration and forebrain volitional mechanisms.
