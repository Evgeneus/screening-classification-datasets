Gaze-evoked visual seizures in nonketotic hyperglycemia.
 Focal motor seizures are commonly a symptom of nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH).
 Posture-induced motor seizures are less common but have been reported in some patients with this disorder.
 We report the first case of gaze-evoked sensory (visual) seizures in nonketotic hyperglycemia.
 Both seizures and ictal EEG findings disappeared shortly after hyperglycemia was corrected.
