Evaluation of extracranial-to-intracranial bypass surgery using iodine 123 iodoamphetamine single-photon emission computed tomography.
 Eleven patients with occlusive cerebrovascular diseases were imaged with N-isopropyl-p-I-123 iodoamphetamine.
 Preoperative and postoperative single-photon emission computed tomography was performed in 10 patients undergoing extracranial-to-intracranial bypass procedures.
 New images were reconstructed from the two images obtained on the different days by superimposition and division in each pixel to get the ratio of cerebral perfusion change.
 All patients with bypass procedures had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the affected areas, and nine of 10 had an increase in cerebral blood flow in the contralateral cortex.
 There was no increase in cerebral blood flow in one case with no operation.
 Neither our procedure nor the results in this small series prove that recovery of function is due to an increase in blood flow, but we believe this is the case.
