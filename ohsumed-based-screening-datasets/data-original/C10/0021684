Locked-in syndrome with bilateral ventral midbrain infarcts.
 We report a patient who was quadriplegic and mute, but retained consciousness and communicated by eye movements and blinks.
 EEG and SEPs were normal.
 BAEPs showed slight prolongation of latencies for waves IV and V.
 MRI showed bilateral infarcts only in the middle and lateral portions of the cerebral peduncles.
