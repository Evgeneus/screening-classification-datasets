Progressive deterioration of auditory evoked potentials after excision of an acoustic neurinoma: case report.
 The authors report the case of a 17-year-old girl who underwent excision of bilateral neurinomas of the cerebellopontine angle.
 Although her auditory evoked potentials were well maintained during the operation, they deteriorated gradually and progressively for the following 2 months.
 This seemed to reflect degeneration of the cochlear nerve fibers initiated by operative manipulation in the cerebellopontine angle in a patient who had no hearing when she awoke from surgery.
