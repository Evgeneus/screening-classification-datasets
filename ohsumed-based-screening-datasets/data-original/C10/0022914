The effect of nightly nasal CPAP treatment on underlying obstructive sleep apnea and pharyngeal size.
 Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is an effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
 It is usually prescribed for nightly use; however, recent studies show that patients often do not wear the appliance consistently.
 Previous studies have also suggested that nasal CPAP may improve a patient's underlying OSA even when the mask is not in place.
 We investigated 12 men with OSA to see if nasal CPAP used nightly for six weeks would improve their underlying sleep-disordered breathing.
 We also studied pharyngeal volumes measured using magnetic resonance imaging and a computer-controlled digitizing pad.
 Patients with more severe OSA had improvement after six weeks; however, they still demonstrated significant OSA.
 Patients with less severe OSA did not have significant change.
 We were unable to show a significant difference in any patient's awake pharyngeal volumes.
 We conclude that patients with OSA should be encouraged to wear their nasal CPAP machines regularly.
