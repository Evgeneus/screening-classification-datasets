Seizures of fronto-orbital origin: a proven case.
 Distinguishing characteristics of seizures of frontal origin have not been clearly delineated.
 We describe a case of seizures of proven fronto-orbital origin to provide further definition of characteristics of seizures arising in that lobe.
 A 36-year-old man had medically intractable seizures since age 8 years.
 Clinically the seizures were stereotyped, with cessation of activity followed by turning of head and body to the right and then by struggling, kicking, and vocalizations indicating fear.
 Total seizure duration was approximately 30 s, with an apparent abrupt return of consciousness.
 The interictal scalp EEGs were similar to those of primary generalized epilepsy, with bisynchronous though asymmetric epileptiform activity anteriorly.
 Ictal scalp recordings were not localizing.
 Recordings from bilateral frontal and temporal subdural electrodes showed an electrical focus in the right fronto-orbital region which was confirmed by electrocorticography (ECoG) at the time of craniotomy.
 The right fronto-orbital cortex was resected and on pathologic examination showed gliotic tissue and intracytoplasmic neuronal inclusions of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules consistent with lipofuscinosis.
 The patient has remained seizure-free for 6 years after operation.
