Response of obstructive sleep apnea to fluoxetine and protriptyline.
 Protripyline is the pharmacologic agent most commonly used to treat obstructive sleep apnea (OSA); however, its anticholinergic side effects make it intolerable to many patients.
 Because serotonin may be a central respiratory stimulant and because the serotonin-uptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, is usually well tolerated, we wanted to try fluoxetine in the treatment of OSA.
 Therefore, we compared the effect of fluoxetine to that of protriptyline in 12 patients with OSA.
 Both drugs significantly decreased the proportion of REM sleep time and decreased the number of apneas or hypopneas in NREM sleep.
 The response to fluoxetine was equivalent to that of protriptyline; however, for the group as a whole, there was no significant improvement in the number of arterial oxygen desaturation events, the level of arterial oxygen desaturation, or the number of arousals with either agent.
 Although there was wide variability in the response to each medication, six of the 12 patients had good responses, including improvement in oxygenation, to either fluoxetine or protriptyline.
 Three patients could not complete the trial of protriptyline.
 We conclude that fluoxetine is beneficial to some, but not all, patients with OSA.
 Fluoxetine was better tolerated than protriptyline.
