Phenytoin administration by constant intravenous infusion: selective rates of administration.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the adequacy of seizure control and the adverse effects of administering an IV loading dose of phenytoin by constant infusion pump.
 DESIGN: A prospective study of patients presenting with acute onset of seizures.
 Patients were divided into two groups.
 Group 1 comprised all patients 50 years of age or younger without a history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).
 Group 2 comprised all patients older than 50 years or with a history of ASCVD.
 SETTING: A rural community hospital emergency department.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Forty-two adult patients.
 INTERVENTIONS: Both groups received an IV loading dose of phenytoin at 15 mg/kg.
 Infusion rates were 50 mg/min and 25 mg/min for groups 1 and 2, respectively.
 Cardiac rhythm and vital signs were monitored throughout and after infusion.
 MEASURES AND MAIN RESULTS: Group 2 demonstrated significantly more cardiovascular side effects (hypotension and bradycardia) than did group 1 (Fisher's exact test, P less than .05).
 CONCLUSION: Phenytoin provided adequate seizure control in both groups.
 For individuals with ASCVD, IV phenytoin administration rates should not exceed 25 mg/min.
 For individuals without ASCVD, phenytoin administration at 50 mg/min appears safe and without significant cardiovascular side effects.
