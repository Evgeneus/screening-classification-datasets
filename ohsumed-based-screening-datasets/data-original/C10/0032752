The consistency of pulse frequencies and pulse patterns of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) used by chronic pain patients.
 This study records the consistency of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) pulse frequency and pulse pattern used by 13 chronic patients over a 1 year period.
 The results show that patients prefer specific pulse frequencies and pulse patterns unique to the individual and that they turn to such frequencies and patterns on subsequent treatment sessions.
 Pulse frequencies and pulse patterns were not related to the cause and site of pain, a finding consistent with previous study in this laboratory.
 This observation, coupled with the large variability in pulse frequencies and pulse patterns used between individuals, implies that patients prefer such frequencies and patterns for reasons of comfort which may not be related to mechanisms specific to the pain system.
