Modified Rambo meatoplasty in translabyrinthine tumor removal.
 Spinal fluid otorrhea and otorhinorrhea are morbid complications that occur in up to 18% of patients after removal of translabyrinthine tumor.
 Both of these problems can be significantly reduced if, during the initial surgery, the posterior canal wall is taken down and the tympanic membrane and external auditory canal skin are removed for better exposure of the eustachian tube orifice.
 The external auditory meatus can then be sealed by a previously described modification of the Rambo procedure.
 This additional procedure adds about 20 minutes to the surgery and presents a small risk of retained squamous epithelium.
 Fifty consecutive patients were divided into two equal groups and studied retrospectively.
 In group I, the patients underwent a modified Rambo meatoplasty at the time of the removal of their translabyrinthine tumor, whereas patients in group II had the tympanic orifice of their eustachian tube obstructed through the facial recess.
 Review of the postoperative course of these fifty patients indicated that the addition of the modified Rambo meatoplasty was justified by the overall reduction in morbidity and expense it provided.
