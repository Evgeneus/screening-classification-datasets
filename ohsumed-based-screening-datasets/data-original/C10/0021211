Sensations during chest tube removal.
 Nurses prepare patients for chest tube removal, yet little has been written to indicate the sensations to be expected during this routine procedure.
 The sensations reported by patients and factors that could influence those sensations were examined in this study.
 The sample consisted of 36 patients after thoracic surgery (24 men and 12 women), all of whom were scheduled to have either a mediastinal or a pleural tube removed.
 They reported their sensations and the intensity of those sensations (using a 100 mm visual analog scale) within 15 minutes after tube removal.
 The most frequently reported sensation during chest tube removal was burning, followed by pain and pulling with mean intensities of 64, 62, and 45, respectively.
 Subjects reported having few sensations after the tube was removed with only five reporting soreness in the chest.
 The sensations and intensities did not differ for those who did and did not receive analgesia or for those having a pleural tube versus a mediastinal tube removed.
 The sensations were similar for the old and young subjects with younger subjects reporting higher intensities.
 Women reported pain more frequently than men, but the intensities of the sensations reported by men and women were not significantly different.
 The sensations reported during chest tube removal differ from those described in the literature and can be used to prepare patients more appropriately for chest tube removal.
