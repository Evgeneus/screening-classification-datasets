An analysis of lymphocyte 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine binding in neurological patients. Evidence of altered binding in Alzheimer's disease.
 Muscarinic cholinergic receptors were analysed in lymphocyte membranes from 35 patients with early (n = 20) and late onset (n = 15) Alzheimer's disease (AD), 86 patients with other neurological disorders and 60 normal controls by the specific binding of 3H-N-methyl-scopolamine (3H-NMS).
 The number of binding sites of 3H-NMS (Bmax) was significantly decreased both in early and late onset AD groups as compared with age-matched controls, by 54% and 40%, respectively, whereas the apparent binding affinity (Kd) was the same in all disease and control groups.
 In addition, the average Bmax in early AD was significantly lower than in late AD.
 The density of the binding of 3H-NMS was also significantly lower in a subgroup of old subjects with Down's syndrome (DS), whereas no changes were found in younger individuals with DS or in patients with Parkinson's disease, whether they were demented or not, multi-infarct dementia, myasthenia gravis or epilepsy.
 In the AD group, the difference in binding sites was unrelated either to the severity of dementia or disease duration.
 Treatment of the patients with cholinergic agents did not alter the binding values in any of the examined group.
 We conclude that the alteration of lymphocyte muscarinic receptors is highly associated with AD, but whether this reflects the central cholinergic deficit in these patients is uncertain.
