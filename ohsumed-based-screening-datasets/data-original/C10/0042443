The aphasic isolate. A clinical-CT scan study of a particularly severe subgroup of global aphasics.
 This paper outlines the clinical and CT scan features of a subtype of global aphasia, characterized by an extreme loss of communicative abilities, verbal as well as nonverbal.
 Three to four weeks after a left hemisphere stroke, 17 patients were completely unable to communicate with people addressing them.
 Though there were differences in their willingness to interact with the environment, they were characterized by complete loss of speech output and by inaccessibility to any kind of message, whether given verbally or through gestures.
 Patients who survived were reassessed 6 and 12 mos later and half of them were still found in a state of complete communicative isolation.
 The remainder had somewhat improved, but remained globally aphasic.
 The attempt to find a CT scan basis for this picture was disappointing.
 Only 35% of patients had a lesional pattern in agreement with the traditional view that ascribes global aphasia to the involvement of Broca's and Wernicke's areas.
 The location of lesion in the other cases spanned from anterior cortical damage, to posterior cortical damage, to deep nuclei damage and none of the lesions that have been proposed to account for subcortical global aphasia was consistently observed.
