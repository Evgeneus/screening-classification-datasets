An evaluation of a 30-gauge needle for spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section.
 A 30-gauge spinal needle was evaluated for Caesarean section, using a combined epidural/spinal technique, in 50 mothers.
 Spinal anaesthesia failed in six mothers and was inadequate in another six.
 General anaesthesia was required on one occasion.
 A 25% overall failure rate suggests that a 30-gauge needle is not a practical proposition for routine clinical practice.
