Evaluating oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization with mixed venous oxygen saturation monitoring: a case study approach.
 Three cases studies are presented to demonstrate clinical application of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) monitoring in critical care nursing practice.
 Examples of critically ill patients are used to demonstrate how SvO2 monitoring can be used in clinical practice to reflect an imbalance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization.
 In the first case, the patient had a problem with oxygen delivery.
 Continuous SvO2 data aided nurses in guiding, adjusting, and assessing therapy.
 The second case demonstrates how SvO2 monitoring can provide an early sign of a life-threatening complication.
 The final case is one in which the patient had a problem with oxygen utilization.
 In all the cases, continuous SvO2 data provided important information about the balance between oxygen delivery and oxygen utilization.
