Unruptured intracranial aneurysms: seizures and antiepileptic drug treatment following surgery.
 Twenty-one patients operated on for unruptured intracranial aneurysms were studied retrospectively in order to identify the incidence of postoperative seizures, factors predictive of seizures, and the response to discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs.
 The overall risk of postoperative seizures in initially seizure-free patients was 15.7%.
 Although seizures were not uncommon, antiepileptic drugs were successfully tapered in most of the patients before 12 months.
