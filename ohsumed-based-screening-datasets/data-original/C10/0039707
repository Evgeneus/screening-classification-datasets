Resistance to vecuronium in patients with cerebral palsy.
 To determine the electromyographic response of patients with cerebral palsy to vecuronium, 10 children (mean age, 6 yr 10 mo) without cerebral palsy and 11 children with cerebral palsy (mean age, 10 yr 3 mo) were studied.
 All patients were undergoing abdominal or orthopedic surgery and were anesthetized with isoflurane and nitrous oxide.
 The time from intravenous administration of 0.1 mg/kg of vecuronium to 25% recovery of control twitch height was 43.9 +/- 5.3 and 18.9 +/- 1.7 min (mean +/- SEM) in children without and with cerebral palsy, respectively (P less than 0.01).
 The authors conclude that patients with cerebral palsy are either resistant to vecuronium or have a rapid clearance as evidenced by the rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade.
