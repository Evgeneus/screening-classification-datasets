Corneal sensitivity and correlations between decreased sensitivity and anterior segment pathology in ocular leprosy.
 Leprosy is one of the leading causes of corneal hyposensitivity.
 In this article the corneal sensitivity of 143 leprosy patients was examined, and correlations between corneal hyposensitivity and anterior segment pathology were detected.
 Twenty four healthy volunteers were examined as controls.
 Various degrees of corneal loss of sensitivity were found in 46.2% of leprosy patients.
 Lagophthalmos, chronic lepromatous granulomatous uveitis, iris atrophy, and social blindness were found 4.5-16.6 times more frequently in eyes which developed severe corneal hyposensitivity.
