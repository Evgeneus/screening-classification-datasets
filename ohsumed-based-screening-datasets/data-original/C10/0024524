Linkage analysis in spinal muscular atrophy, by six closely flanking markers on chromosome 5.
 The proximal spinal muscular atrophies (SMA) represent the second most common autosomal recessive disorder, after cystic fibrosis.
 The gene responsible for chronic SMA has recently been mapped to chromosome 5q by using genetic linkage studies.
 Among six markers mapping to this region, five were shown to be linked with the SMA locus in 39 chronic SMA families each containing at least two affected individuals.
 Multilocus analysis by the method of location score was used to establish the best estimate of the SMA gene location.
 Our data suggest that the most likely location for SMA is between loci D5S6 and D5S39.
 The genetic distances between these two markers are estimated to be 6.4 cM in males and 11.9 cM in females.
 Since meiosis were informative with D5S39 and D5S6 in 92% and 87% of SMA families, respectively, it is hoped that the present study will contribute to the calculation of genetic risk in SMA families.
