Do primary dysfunctions in neural control of arterial pressure contribute to hypertension?
 This article is a summary of the physiological and clinical evidence that links the cause of essential hypertension to the brain.
 We stress the potential importance of a biochemical disturbance in the central role of angiotensin II in the regulation of arterial pressure.
 While the evidence is compelling, we acknowledge the need for further complete studies on this timely subject.
