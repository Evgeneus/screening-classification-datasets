Acetylsalicylic acid vs. metoprolol in migraine prophylaxis--a double-blind cross-over study.
 In a double blind cross-over study, 28 patients, 5 male and 23 female, aged 31 +/- 14 years, after a run-in period of 8 weeks, were treated for 3 months with acetylsalicylic acid and for another 3 months with metoprolol, both in a prophylactic mode.
 Attack frequency was reduced significantly with both therapeutic regimens (ASA p less than 0.001, metoprolol p less than 0.00005).
 Reduction of attacks below 50% was seen with metoprolol in 14 cases, and with ASA in three cases.
 Even though ASA was of statistically significant efficacy in migraine prophylaxis, it clearly is not the drug of first choice in migraine prophylaxis.
