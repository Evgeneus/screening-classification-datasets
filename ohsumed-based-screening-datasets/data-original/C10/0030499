Observer variation in assessing neurophysical signs among patients with head injuries.
 As an early phase in the development of a valid and reliable measure of the neurophysical sequelae after head injury, we carried out assessments of interrater agreement on representative items.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of agreement among expert raters who independently measured neurophysical signs on patients undergoing physical rehabilitation after brain injury.
 Agreement was described using the index of crude agreement, expected agreement and Kappa.
 Therapists showed a high degree of agreement on those items forming part of a routine neurological assessment: prehension, coordination, voluntary movements and tendon reflexes.
 Crude agreement ranged from 77.8-100%.
 There was considerable discordance in assessing muscle tonus, equilibrium and protective reactions, spinal reflexes, tremor and dysmetria (crude agreement ranged from 49.7-97.9%).
 Although, the number of subjects was small, the information generated from this study will be useful in refining our instrument for the assessment of neurophysical signs.
