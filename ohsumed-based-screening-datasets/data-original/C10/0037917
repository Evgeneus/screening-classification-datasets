Central sleep apnea and arterial compression of the medulla.
 We report a 5-year-old with central sleep apnea associated with compression of the medulla oblongata by abnormal looping of the left vertebral artery.
 The magnetic resonance imaging findings raise the possibility that compression of the respiratory center by an aberrant vertebral artery might cause central sleep apnea.
