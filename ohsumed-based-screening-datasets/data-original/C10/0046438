Glial contribution to seizure: carbonic anhydrase activity in epileptic mammalian brain.
 The activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA), a glial enzyme, was measured in the epileptic cortex of audiogenic DBA/2 mice and of cats with a freeze lesion.
 In mice, the activity increased with age from birth to 24 days, but were always higher in audiogenic mice than in normal C57/BL mice, reflecting species differences.
 The difference between the two strains increased sharply from 25 to 40 days of age, after the period of maximal audiogenic susceptibility.
 Acetazolamide, a CA-specific inhibitor, greatly decreased the seizure severity score of DBA/2 mice after a single intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (150 mg/kg).
 After 24 days of age, when CA activities were high, the effect of acetazolamide was less important, suggesting that the increased cortical CA activity might reflect a protective mechanism.
 In cats with a freeze lesion, no significant changes in CA activities were observed in the actively discharging primary and secondary foci as compared with the nonepileptogenic perifocal cortex and the control cortex of sham-operated animals.
 The results indicate that the cortex of genetically susceptible audiogenic mice has an increased CA activity.
 The hypothesis of an adaptive glial mechanism, relating to the age-dependent decrease of seizure susceptibility in DBA/2 mice, is postulated.
