Delirium in an elderly woman possibly associated with administration of misoprostol.
 Misoprostol has been associated with adverse reactions, including gastrointestinal symptoms, gynecologic problems, and headache.
 Changes in mental status, however, have not been reported.
 We present a case in which an 89-year-old woman in a long-term care facility became confused after the initiation of misoprostol therapy.
 The patient's change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therapy.
 Her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week.
 Because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly, the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy.
