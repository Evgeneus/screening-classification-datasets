Perilymph fistulas: the House Ear Clinic experience.
 The diagnosis, evaluation, and surgical treatment of perilymph fistulas has recently been the focus of a great deal of attention in otology.
 Authors have focused on perilymph fistulas as the cause of hearing loss and vertigo in many diverse situations.
 Additionally, surgical repair has been suggested when there is little objective support for intervention.
 To address some of the problems inherent in the diagnosis and treatment of perilymph fistulas, records of patients operated on at the House Ear Clinic during the past 12 years were reviewed retrospectively.
 Eighty-six patients were surgically explored for fistulas during this period.
 Thirty-five (40.7%) fistulas were found, and 51 ears were patched whether fistulas were found or not.
 Of the 80 patients who were seen for follow-up, 35 (43.8%) were subjectively better, and 45 (56.2%) were the same.
 Although the number of fistulas found and the number of patients improved were similar, the composition of the two groups was different.
 On the basis of audiometric results, improvement in hearing occurred in only 18.7% of the patients.
 None of the demographic factors or diagnostic tests were predictive of either the presence of a fistula or the therapeutic outcome.
 Further work is required to facilitate the preoperative diagnosis of fistulas and to design appropriate surgical intervention.
