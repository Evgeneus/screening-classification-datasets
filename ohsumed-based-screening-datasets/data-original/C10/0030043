Survival of patients with dementia.
 The evidence on survival in dementia is summarized.
 There are no reliable data on survival after onset of dementia or after first contact with medical services.
 People with dementia in outpatient clinics and nursing homes have 2-year survival rates of 75% (range 60%-95%) and 50% (range 30%-65%), respectively.
 Differences in survival between patients with senile dementia of the Alzheimer's type (SDAT) and multi infarct dementia (MID) are small.
 Women in nursing homes have a better prognosis than men (2-year survival rates, 60% vs 40%).
 Dementia patients have a considerable excess mortality when compared to the vital statistics.
 There is no evidence for improvement of survival rates during recent decades.
 Recommendations for future studies are made.
