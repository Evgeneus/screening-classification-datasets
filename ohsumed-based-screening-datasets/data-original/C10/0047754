Abnormal pattern of luteinizing hormone pulsatility in women with epilepsy.
 Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in epileptic females has been suggested in the latest years.
 To further elucidate this issue, we assessed reproductive endocrine function in 10 normally cycling, drug-free epileptic women and in 5 normal controls, evaluating the basal hormonal profile and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatility in the midfollicular phase.
 Luteinizing hormone pulse frequency was significantly higher in epileptic women with a consequent reduction of the LH interpulse interval.
 We suggest that epilepsy may interfere with the functional activity of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pulse generator.
 The pathogenetic mechanisms for this phenomenon may be the spreading of paroxysmal activity within the hypothalamic areas or, alternatively, a neurotransmitter dysfunction giving rise both to the seizure disorder and to the abnormal LH pulsatile pattern.
