New pathologic observations in juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia.
 A patient with hereditary juvenile onset parkinsonism with dystonia died at age 39.
 There were Lewy bodies and regionally selective neuronal damage in the substantia nigra pars compacta.
 These changes closely resemble those seen in Parkinson's disease, and emphasize the selective vulnerability of the ventral tier of the pars compacta in these degenerations.
