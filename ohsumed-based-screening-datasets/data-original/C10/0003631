Anterior acromioplasty for treatment of the shoulder impingement syndrome.
 Between 1975 and 1979, anterior acromioplasty was performed in 65 patients with 66 involved shoulders.
 The procedure appears to be safe and reasonably effective.
 Of the 65 patients in this study, 50 had chronic tendon inflammation with fibrosis, and 16 also had a small supraspinatus tendon tear.
 These 16 had rotator cuff repairs.
 Twenty-six patients were also treated with distal clavicle excision, and seven had tenodesis of the long head of the biceps brachii.
 The average age of the patients was 50 years (range, 23-75 years).
 All patients were followed for an average of eight years (range, three to 13 years).
 At final evaluation, no or slight pain was present in 77% of the shoulders: 39 of 50 without tendon tearing and 12 of 16 with tendon tearing and repair.
 Active shoulder abduction averaged 167 degrees.
 Ninety-two percent returned to employment, including 18% with some job modification.
 Eighty-six percent returned to recreational athletics, 20% with some modification of activities.
 Seven patients had additional surgical treatment.
 The progression of rotator cuff disease is not always prevented, but the need for subsequent shoulder treatment generally decreases.
