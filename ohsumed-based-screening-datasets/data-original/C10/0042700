Pattern of simulated snoring is different through mouth and nose.
 Cineradiography of the pharynx during simulated snoring was done in 6 healthy volunteers, and supraglottic pressure and flow rate were recorded in 12 others.
 We observed, immediately before snoring, a decrease in the sagittal diameter of the oropharynx followed, during snoring, by high-frequency oscillations of soft palate and pharyngeal walls.
 The pattern of soft palate oscillations was different while snoring through the nose or mouth.
 During inspiratory snoring through the nose, the soft palate remained in close contact with the back of the tongue and only the uvula presented high-frequency oscillations.
 Snoring through the mouth resulted in ample high-frequency oscillations of the whole soft palate.
 Frequency of airflow and supraglottic pressure oscillations was less (P less than 0.05) during mouth (28.2 +/- 7.5 Hz) than during nasal snoring (77.8 +/- 36.7 Hz).
 This difference may be related to the smaller oscillating mass (i.e., uvula) during nasal snoring.
 At variance with our previous data, which showed that snoring during sleep, in both heavy (nonapneic) snorers and obstructive sleep apnea patients, was systematically preceded by flow limitation, this was not true during simulated snoring.
