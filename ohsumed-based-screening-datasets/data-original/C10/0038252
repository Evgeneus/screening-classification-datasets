Midazolam use in the emergency department.
 Midazolam is a new imidazobenzodiazepine derivative that is two to three times as potent as diazepam, is water-soluble, has a rapid onset and short duration of action, and produces a profound amnestic effect.
 These properties make it an extremely useful drug for outpatient sedation.
 We performed retrospective review of midazolam use in a general emergency department over a one-year period.
 Midazolam was used in 120 patients, 71 men and 49 women, with an average age of 46 years.
 The average dose given was 3.4 mg, with a range of 1 to 10 mg.
 In 69 of the cases (57%) other drugs were administered, most commonly an opiate.
 There were only four adverse reactions.
 One patient developed urinary retention, one patient vomited, and two patients were somnolent for a prolonged period of time.
 There were no serious cardiovascular or respiratory problems.
 We conclude that midazolam is a safe drug to use in the emergency department.
 Close monitoring of the patient and the availability of airway support equipment are mandatory.
