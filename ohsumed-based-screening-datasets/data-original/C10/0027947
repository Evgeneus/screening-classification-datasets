Hemianesthesia, sensory neglect, and defective access to conscious experience.
 We report a patient with an ischemic stroke in the vascular territory of the right middle cerebral artery who had left spatial neglect and left hemianesthesia.
 The patient showed a dissociation between defective verbal reporting of somatosensory stimuli delivered to the left hand and physiologic evidence from an autonomic index.
 This indicates that there was processing of undetected stimuli without the patient's awareness, and suggests that the hemianesthesia was due, at least in part, to somesthetic hemi-inattention.
