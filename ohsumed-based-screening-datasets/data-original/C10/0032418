Subcutaneous sumatriptan in the treatment of headache during withdrawal from drug-induced headache.
 In a pilot study (5 patients) we investigated the effects of subcutaneous sumatriptan, a 5-HT1-like receptor agonist, on headache experienced during the withdrawal period of drug-induced headache.
 The pilot study indicated that the substance was effective mostly in patients who originally suffered from migraine.
 In a patient with tension headache the substance was less effective.
 In a second double-blind study on six migraine patients with severe drug-induced headache, the drug was highly effective in ameliorating headache and autonomic disturbances.
 Blood flow velocities measured in extracranial parts of internal and external carotid arteries by duplex-sonography and in middle cerebral and basilar arteries by transcranial Doppler showed no changes after administration of sumatriptan or placebo.
 This result suggests sumatriptan does not act primarily via constriction of the large cerebral arteries.
