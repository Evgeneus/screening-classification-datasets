Disability, residential mobility, and changes in living arrangements.
 The extent of mobility and changes in living arrangements associated with disability were studied using data from the 1984-86 Longitudinal Study of Aging.
 It was hypothesized that persons with significant limitations in their ability to perform normal daily activities (ADLs and IADLs) in 1984 would be more likely to move, more likely to be living with others in 1986, and more likely to have entered an institution between 1984 and 1986 than those without limitations.
 When only those variables that were measured in 1984 were used as predictors, this turned out to be true for institutionalization and for living with others in 1986.
 However, among those remaining in households, residential mobility showed little relationship to disability when other variables were controlled.
 When the change in disability between 1984 and 1986 was added to the prediction equation, there were strong relationships between changes in disability and both residential mobility and adjustment in living arrangement, suggesting that people respond quickly to significant changes in disability.
 However, because we cannot be sure that the changes in disability preceded the mobility or changes in living arrangements, we cannot claim to have established a causal link between these events.
