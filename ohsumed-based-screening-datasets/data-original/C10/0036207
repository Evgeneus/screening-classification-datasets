Plasma and saliva levels of PGI2 and TXA2 in the headache-free period of classical migraine patients. The effects of nicardipine.
 The levels of Prostacyclin (PGI2) and Thromboxane A2 (TXA2) were assayed simultaneously (RIA) in the plasma and saliva of 9 patients suffering from classical migraine attacks.
 The assays were done during an attack-free period.
 In relation to the control group we observed a significant decrease in the plasma levels of PGI2 together with a sharp increase in TXA2 in saliva.
 When the patients were treated with nicardipine, a calcium antagonist, the TXA2 increase in saliva did not occur.
 These results suggest both a systemic and local effect in the classical migraine attacks.
 We explain and discuss our results by referring to the PGI2: TXA2 equilibrium system.
 Nicardipine action might be related to its ability to reduce the calcium entry into the cell induced by thromboxane.
