The potential use of a dopamine neuron antibody and a striatal-derived neurotrophic factor as diagnostic markers in Parkinson's disease.
 The cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) contains an antibody that immunocytochemically reacts with dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN).
 This antibody was found in 78% of the CSF samples taken from patients with clinical PD.
 In contrast, only 3% of the CSF samples taken from control patients or patients with neurologic symptoms other than PD possessed this antibody.
 The production of this antibody might contribute to disease progression but does not appear to be the etiologic factor responsible for PD.
 In other experiments, concentrates of the CSF of patients with PD enhanced growth of mesencephalic cultures relative to control CSF.
 Both the antibody and the growth-promoting activity found in CSF are associated with degeneration of the SN and might therefore be useful as potential diagnostic markers for PD.
