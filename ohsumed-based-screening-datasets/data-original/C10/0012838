Haemorrhagic shock encephalopathy and sudden infant death 
 In 2 pairs of non-identical twins, haemorrhagic-shock encephalopathy syndrome developed in 1 co-twin while the other died of sudden infant death syndrome.
 The twin pairs were aged 3 and 4 months, respectively, and no cause was identified.
 We suggest that stress protein deficiency may underlie both syndromes.
