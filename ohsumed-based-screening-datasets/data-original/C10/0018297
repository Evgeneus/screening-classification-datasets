Midazolam-induced benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome 
 A case history of a patient who developed severe anxiety and agitation on two occasions after discontinuation of a midazolam infusion is presented.
 The withdrawal symptoms interfered with effective mechanical ventilation and the patient required the reintroduction of a long-acting benzodiazepine to treat the withdrawal state and to facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation.
