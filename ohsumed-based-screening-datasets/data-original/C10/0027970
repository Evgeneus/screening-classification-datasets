Legionella myositis.
 Neuromuscular involvement in patients with legionnaires' disease is common, with serum CK elevations in up to 78% of patients.
 A few cases have been associated with neuropathy.
 The mechanism of injury to the neuromuscular system is unknown, but organisms have not previously been found in nerve or muscle.
 We report the clinical, electrophysiologic, and pathologic findings in a patient with Legionella myositis and motor neuropathy, the first case to demonstrate direct muscle invasion by the Legionella organism.
