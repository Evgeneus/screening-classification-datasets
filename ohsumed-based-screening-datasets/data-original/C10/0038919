Symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition. Its clinical significance and treatment.
 The clinical significance of symptomatic talocalcaneal coalition was described subjectively, objectively, and identified roentgenographically after examining 67 feet of 42 patients between 1977 and 1987.
 Computed tomographic examinations, conducted on 29 of 42 patients, were useful in recognizing the extent of coalition, the condition of union, and the postoperative results.
 Tarsal tunnel syndrome was present in 23 feet with the coalition.
 Thirty-one feet (24 patients) were treated conservatively and 36 feet (29 patients) surgically.
 Of the surgically treated feet, the coalition was excised in 33 and talocalcaneal fusion was performed in three.
 Follow-up examinations were performed at an average of 5.3 years (range, 2.25-11.2 years).
 In the excision group, the results were excellent in 24 feet, good in seven, and fair in two.
 The results were good in three feet treated by arthrodesis.
