Visual function in patients undergoing long-term total parenteral nutrition.
 To evaluate the effects of long-term total parenteral nutrition (TPN) on eye function, 27 adults and 12 children in the UCLA Home TPN Clinic underwent ophthalmoscopic examination and visual-function testing.
 Direct inspection of the fundus showed a marked granularity of the retinal pigmented epithelium in some patients.
 About one-half of the children and one-third of the adults tested had at least one and usually two abnormalities in their electroretinogram.
 Determination of blood nutrients thought to affect vision revealed that zinc and vitamin E were within normal range.
 Vitamin A concentrations were above normal in 10 of 19 adults and selenium concentrations were below normal in 10 of 10 children and 17 of 21 adults tested.
 Linoleic and linolenic acid concentrations were low; plasma, platelet, and urine taurine concentrations were significantly lower than normal.
 Despite these diffuse nutrient abnormalities, only zinc and vitamin E concentrations correlated significantly with any index of visual function.
