Otolaryngologic management of patients with subdural empyema.
 From 1979 to 1988, 17 patients presented to Duke University Medical Center for treatment of subdural empyema.
 Empyemas were caused by sinusitis in 53% of the patients and by otitis media in 12%.
 None of those with otologic causes required mastoid drainage, while all patients with sinus infections required sinus drainage.
 External frontoethmoidectomies were associated with a lower incidence of frontoethmoid re-exploration (P = 0.048), and antrostomies with a lower incidence of maxillary re-exploration (P = 0.111), than were more limited drainage procedures.
 Sinus drainage performed simultaneously with neurosurgical drainage reduced the incidence of sinus re-exploration (P = 0.167), neurosurgical reexploration (P = 0.048), and length of hospitalization (P = 0.020).
