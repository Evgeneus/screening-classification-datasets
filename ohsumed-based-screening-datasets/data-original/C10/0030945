Group C streptococcal bacteremia: analysis of 88 cases.
 Eighty-eight cases of group C streptococcal bacteremia were reviewed retrospectively.
 Most patients had underlying diseases (72.7%), predominantly cardiovascular disease (20.5%) or malignancy (20.5%).
 The infection originated most often from the upper respiratory tract (20.5%), the gastrointestinal tract (18.2%), or the skin (17.1%).
 Prior exposure to animals or animal products was reported in 23.9% of cases.
 The most common clinical manifestations of group C streptococcal bacteremia were endocarditis (27.3%), primary bacteremia (22.7%), and meningitis (10.2%).
 Of streptococcal isolates, 61.4% were not speciated, 19.3% were Streptococcus equisimilis, 17.1% were Streptococcus zooepidemicus, and two (2.3%) were Streptococcus equi.
 The isolates were sensitive to most antibiotics, and most patients were treated with beta-lactam agents.
 Mortality was high (25.0%), especially among older patients and patients with endocarditis, meningitis, and disseminated infection.
 Group C streptococcal bacteremia does not differ from bloodstream infection caused by other beta-hemolytic streptococci with regard to clinical presentation, treatment, or outcome.
