Puppet-like syndrome of Angelman: a pathologic and neurochemical study.
 We present the first pathologic descriptions of the puppet-like syndrome of Angelman based on autopsy studies of a 21-year-old woman.
 The noteworthy findings were a small brain with mild cerebral atrophy but normal gyral development.
 There was marked cerebellar atrophy with loss of Purkinje and granule cells and extensive Bergmann's gliosis.
 Study of dendrite morphology using Golgi impregnations of the visual cortex revealed a prominent decrease in dendritic arborization of layer 3 and layer 5 pyramidal neurons.
 Quantitative Golgi analysis also revealed a significant decrease in the numbers of dendritic spines in apical layer 3 dendrites and both apical and basal layer 5 dendrites.
 Neurochemical studies of frozen brain tissue demonstrated markedly reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid content in the cerebellar cortex, as well as elevated glutamate content in the frontal and occipital cortices.
 Although there are no definite morphologic correlates of many of the clinical signs, the pronounced dendritic pathology and neurochemical abnormalities in cerebral cortex may provide a physiologic basis for mental retardation.
