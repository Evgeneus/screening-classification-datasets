Treatment of primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome with ibuprofen and alprazolam. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
 A multidimensional evaluation of 78 patients with primary fibrositis/fibromyalgia syndrome (PFS) revealed no significant relationship between clinical measures of physical discomfort and psychological measures.
 This observation provided evidence against the notion that the pain of PFS has a psychological etiology.
 The same patients were randomized into 4 groups for treatment with ibuprofen and/or alprazolam in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled pilot trial.
 Clinical improvement in patient rating of disease severity and in the severity of tenderness upon palpation was most apparent in the subgroup of patients who were receiving both ibuprofen and alprazolam.
 An 8-week, open-label study in which 52 patients received both drugs further documented improvement in outcome measures.
 These data indicate that treatment with a combination of ibuprofen and alprazolam can be beneficial for some patients with PFS.
