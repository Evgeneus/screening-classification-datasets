Methamphetamine. Stimulant of the 1990s?
 During the past several years, the use of a smokable form of methamphetamine hydrochloride called "ice" has increased rapidly.
 The heaviest use has occurred on the West Coast and in Hawaii.
 Many regional emergency departments treat more methamphetamine users than cocaine-intoxicated patients.
 The ease of synthesis from inexpensive and readily available chemicals makes possible the rampant abuse of a dangerous drug that can produce a euphoria similar to that induced by cocaine.
 Clinicians should be familiar with the medical effects and treatment of acute methamphetamine toxicity.
