Burden: a review of measures used among caregivers of individuals with dementia 
 This paper critiques and discusses 10 measures of burden that have been used with caregivers of individuals with dementia.
 Current measures target diverse caregiver and care recipient populations, and vary in conceptualization and measurement of burden.
 Although many measures contain reliability data, relatively few report content validity, convergent/divergent validity, criterion validity, or sensitivity to change.
 Implications of these limitations for research and clinical practice are discussed.
