Beneficial effects of isovolemic hemodilution using a perfluorocarbon emulsion in a stroke model.
 In a clinically applicable cat stroke model, 16 purpose-bred adult animals were used to evaluate the beneficial effects of two treatment regimens: isovolemic hemodilution with either a perfluorocarbon emulsion or dextran 40 (a glucose polymer).
 Animals that received these treatment regimens were then compared with a control group of untreated animals.
 Focal cerebral infarctions were produced by transorbital ligation of the left middle cerebral artery.
 The randomly allocated treatment arms of the study were instituted 3 hours after ligation of the middle cerebral artery, thereby simulating a human clinical situation.
 In vivo mitochondrial metabolic activity of the peri-infarct cerebral tissue was continually assessed by means of a multiwavelength near-infrared spectrophotometer.
 This allowed measurement of cellular oxygenation at the cytochrome aa3 level, the terminal member of the cytochrome chain.
 Sequential proton-based magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure intracerebral water in vivo.
 Cardiac output, oxygen consumption/delivery, chemical, histologic, and rheologic parameters were also assessed.
 The data collected were analyzed by group means and standard statistical analyses, which revealed that the group treated with the perfluorocarbon emulsion had both less brain edema in the early post-infarct period (p less than 0.05), as well as a higher level of oxidation of cytochrome aa3 (p less than or equal to 0.025).
 This evidence supports the premise that isovolemic hemodilution with an oxygen-carrying hemodiluent may be beneficial in the treatment of ischemic strokes.
