Diffuse axonal injury: analysis of 100 patients with radiological signs.
 One hundred patients with head injuries who showed diffuse axonal injury on computed tomographic scans are reported.
 Evaluation of the Glasgow Coma Score, pupillary signs, and computed tomographic findings on admission led to an improved ability to forecast outcomes.
 Our relatively good results as compared with other series, can be explained by the high proportion of children and by the liberal use of computed tomography to evaluate head injuries, thus revealing that concussion may sometimes be regarded as an early form of diffuse axonal injury.
