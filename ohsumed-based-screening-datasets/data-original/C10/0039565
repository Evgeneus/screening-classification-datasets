Human immunodeficiency virus infection and diffuse polyneuropathy. Implications for rehabilitation medicine.
 Patients at various stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection require rehabilitation services.
 These patients present problems for each of the disciplines in a rehabilitation team, and all team members must confront the psychosocial and ethical issues involved with the disease.
 Patients with HIV infection may have polyneuropathy with multisystem involvement, including dysphagia, autonomic dysfunction, respiratory failure, bowel and bladder dysfunction, generalized weakness, a painful sensory neuropathy, and depression.
 Guidelines are presented for determining if inpatient rehabilitation or other settings are appropriate.
 Case management is a valuable strategy for the rehabilitation of patients with this complicated disorder.
