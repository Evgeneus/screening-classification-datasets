Antral choanal polyp presenting as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.
 Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) in children is commonly caused by adenotonsillar hypertrophy.
 The diagnostic criteria of OSAS in children are not so well delineated as in adults.
 We report the first case of antral choanal polyp presenting as OSAS in a 10-year-old boy that initially presented to the child psychiatry service for behavior disturbance, enuresis, and daytime somnolence.
 Overnight electroencephalogram sleep study revealed events consistent with OSAS.
 Multiple inhalant allergies, chronic maxillary sinusitis, and obstructive adenoid hypertrophy were diagnosed by the allergy and otolaryngology services.
 The child was scheduled for adenoidectomy when his sleep apnea symptoms persisted following antimicrobial therapy.
 Examination under anesthesia revealed a normal adenoid bed and a large left antral choanal polyp.
 Polypectomy was performed as dictated by parental consent.
 Postoperatively treatment with an intranasal steroid was begun.
 However, polypoid nasal mucosa recurred in 2 months and a Caldwell-Luc procedure was performed.
 Subjective reports following surgery indicated improvement in daytime irritability, attention, and mood.
 A follow-up overnight electroencephalogram sleep study confirmed resolution of OSAS.
