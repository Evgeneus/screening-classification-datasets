Carnitine deficiency associated with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency.
 An infant with X-linked recessive ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency is described who also had severe deficiency of plasma and liver carnitine during normoammonemic periods.
 Treatment with L-carnitine (100 mg/kg/day) for 12 months decreased the frequency of hospitalizations for hyperammonemia, although it did not alter his neurologic status.
 This report demonstrates that persistent carnitine deficiency may be present in patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency even when plasma ammonia is normal.
 Carnitine evaluation and supplementation may be important in the treatment of patients with this metabolic disorder.
