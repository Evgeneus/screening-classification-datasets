Self-reported sleep quality in HIV infection: correlation to the stage of infection and zidovudine therapy.
 We investigated self-reported sleep quality in a group of 50 patients in different stages of HIV-1 infection by using a standardized questionnaire (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index).
 Alterations of sleep were found to be significantly correlated with the most severe stage of infection in AIDS patients.
 Analysis of data failed to indicate a significant influence of zidovudine on self-reported sleep quality.
