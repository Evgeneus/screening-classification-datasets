Risk factors for stroke as predictors of platelet membrane fluidity in Alzheimer's disease.
 We have previously reported that increased platelet membrane fluidity identifies a subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who have distinct clinical features including an earlier age of symptomatic onset, a more rapidly progressive cognitive decline, and a decreased prevalence of focal electroencephalographic findings.
 In the current study, these patients also exhibited a decreased prevalence of risk factors for stroke compared with patients who had normal platelet membrane fluidity.
 Our findings suggest that the platelet membrane abnormality describes a clinical subgroup of patients with Alzheimer's disease who are less likely to have coexisting cerebrovascular disease than the remaining patients who meet clinical consensus criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease.
