Neuropathy, myopathy and destructive arthropathy in primary hypothyroidism.
 A 75-year-old woman with untreated primary hypothyroidism was found with peripheral neuropathy (including carpal tunnel syndrome), severe myopathy (high levels of creatine phosphokinase) and destructive arthropathy, affecting fingers, toes and the left knee.
 Radiographs of her knee showed destructive lesions of the tibial plateau similar to a pathologic compression fracture, while the joints of the fingers and toes showed all signs of severe erosive osteoarthritis (OA), radiographically documented over a period of 7 years.
 It is suggested that hypothyroidism is causally related to the development of erosive OA.
