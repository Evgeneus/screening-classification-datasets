Acute twin-twin transfusion: a possible mechanism for brain-damaged survivors after intrauterine death of a monochorionic twin.
 Intrauterine death of one twin in monochorionic pregnancies is associated with increased mortality and morbidity for the survivor.
 This has been attributed to the consequences of intrauterine disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) initiated by the dead twin.
 We describe a case in which the fetal cerebral and renal lesions typically found in survivors occurred without any derangement in coagulation.
 Instead, acute twin-twin transfusion was suggested by the presence of severe anemia in the surviving fetus at delivery.
 We suggest that the lesions frequently found in the survivors are often due to acute hemodynamic and ischemic changes resulting from acute twin-twin transfusion at the time of intrauterine death, rather than to late-onset DIC.
 This hypothesis has an important implication for future management: Intervention must occur before intrauterine death if neurologic sequelae in the survivor are to be prevented.
