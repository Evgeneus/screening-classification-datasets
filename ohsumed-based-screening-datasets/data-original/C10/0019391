Correlation between essential tremor and migraine headache.
 The relationship between essential tremor (ET) and migraine was investigated in a prospective study.
 In a group of 74 ET patients 36.5% had migraine compared with 17.7% of 102 control subjects without tremor.
 In a group of 58 patients with migraine 17.2% had ET compared with 1.2% of 85 controls without migraine.
 The prevalence of ET in migraine controls was greater than controls without migraine (22% compared with 1%; p = 0.002).
 It is concluded that there is an association between essential tremor and migraine.
