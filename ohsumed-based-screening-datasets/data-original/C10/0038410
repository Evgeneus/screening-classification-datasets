Operative laparoscopy with the Nd:YAG laser in the treatment of endometriosis and pelvic adhesions.
 A multicenter, prospective trial was initiated to test the effectiveness and safety of the Nd:YAG laser equipped with artificial sapphire contact tips for the laparoscopic treatment of pelvic pain.
 Ninety-three women were enrolled in the study, 37 with endometriosis alone, 47 with endometriosis complicated by pelvic adhesions, and 9 women with adhesions alone.
 In over 90% of adhesions and 96% of endometriotic implants the Nd:YAG laser could be delivered to the site and be used to restore normal anatomy.
 The exception was deep bowel involvement with endometriosis, which was not treated.
 The majority of women had marked reduction or resolution of their symptoms for up to 12 months postoperatively.
 We conclude that the use of the Nd:YAG laser is an appropriate method to laparoscopically treat pelvic pain resulting from endometriosis or pelvic adhesions.
