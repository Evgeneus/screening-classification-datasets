Evaluation of optic nerve sheath fenestration in pseudotumor cerebri using automated perimetry.
 Evaluation of the efficacy of optic nerve sheath fenestration in pseudotumor cerebri has been hindered by a lack of quantitative indicators of visual function before and after treatment.
 Nine patients (14 eyes) were treated who had pseudotumor with optic nerve sheath fenestration, in whom automated perimetry was used as a major parameter in the decision to undertake surgery and in evaluating the results.
 Visual field results demonstrated significant improvement in this group of patients.
 Seven of 8 eyes with total loss less than 1500 dB had improvement or no further deterioration.
 Using results of the last preoperative examination as baseline, it was found that six of the eight had improvement over 150 dB.
 In one patient, a slight deterioration occurred postoperatively.
 Those eyes with total loss above 1500 dB demonstrated stabilization of fields postoperatively.
 Statistical analysis of total loss preoperatively and postoperatively for this group of patients demonstrated significant improvement for five of the six comparisons investigated.
 Average preoperative total loss and average postoperative total loss were not significantly different.
 Comparisons of results of the last preoperative examination to those of the first postoperative and most recent follow-up examinations, and evaluation of average total loss postoperatively showed significant improvement had occurred.
 Results of the first postoperative examination and those of the most recent follow-up examination showed significant improvement from the average preoperative total loss.
