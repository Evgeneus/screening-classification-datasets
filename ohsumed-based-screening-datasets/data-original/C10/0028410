The differential effects of biofeedback in the treatment of menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine.
 The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of biofeedback training in the treatment of menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine.
 Accordingly, 39 female patients suffering from both migraine associated, and migraine not associated, with menstrual periods were drawn from a pool of research volunteers enrolled in a biofeedback treatment program for migraine headaches.
 All patients were required to complete 5 weeks of daily self-monitoring of headache and menstruation activity immediately before and after treatment, and again at 6-month follow-up.
 Within-subjects comparisons of the effects of biofeedback on menstrual and nonmenstrual migraine, and between-subjects comparisons of the effects of biofeedback on patients suffering predominantly from either menstrual or nonmenstrual migraine showed that biofeedback is just as effective in reducing menstrual migraine as it is in reducing nonmenstrual migraine.
 Questions as to whether or not these conclusions can apply to patients who experience migraine headaches only during, or shortly before or after, menstruation, are raised.
