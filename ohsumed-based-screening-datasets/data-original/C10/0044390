Persistence of Theiler's virus infection following promotion of central nervous system remyelination.
 Chronic infection of SJL/J mice with the Daniel's strain of Theiler's virus develop primary demyelination, viral persistence but minimal central nervous system (CNS)-type remyelination.
 In contrast, treatment of virus-infected mice with sera or immunoglobulin G (IgG) from mice immunized with homogenized spinal cord (SCH) emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant promotes CNS remyelination.
 We measured levels of infectious virus, virus antigen and virus-specific antibody to determine if treatments which promote CNS remyelination are able to modulate infection.
 Levels of virus-specific antibody were higher in mice treated with SCH/IgG than control treatment groups and correlated positively with extent of remyelination.
 Although number of virus antigen-positive cells in spinal cord was less in mice treated with SCH/IgG than mice treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS)/IgG, there was only a slight negative correlation with extent of remyelination by regression analysis.
 Titers of infectious virus isolated three to six months following infection were not different among treatment groups.
 Even though treatment of mice with SCH/IgG reduced number of virus antigen-positive cells and enhanced levels of virus-specific antibody, CNS remyelination can occur despite presence of infectious virus.
