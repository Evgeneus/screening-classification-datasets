Review of neurobehavioral assessment tools.
 Behavioral, cognitive, and memory deficits are frequently observed sequelae of brain injury.
 Yet in most critical care settings, neurologic assessment is limited to evaluation of arousal, pupillary response, orientation, and motor capability.
 Behavior, cognition, and memory are not routinely evaluated.
 Several brief, bedside assessment tools are reviewed.
 All may be used in the critical care setting to evaluate the type and extent of residual deficits in the neurologically impaired patient.
 Nursing implications, based on the evaluation of deficits, are also discussed.
