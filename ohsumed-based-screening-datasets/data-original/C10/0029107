Transesophageal echocardiography: a simple method for monitoring the patency of ventriculoatrial shunts. Technical note.
 A new method for evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt is described, and early experience with it is reported.
 Transesophageal echocardiography can demonstrate a cerebrospinal fluid leak in the right atrium through the atrial tip of a shunting device.
 This capability was an incidental discovery, and since then the accuracy of the technique in evaluating the patency of a ventriculoatrial shunt has been prospectively studied in 20 observations of 16 patients.
 The method proved to be accurate in 90% to 100% of cases.
 It is concluded that transesophageal echocardiography offers a rapid and accurate assessment of ventriculoatrial shunt function, is well tolerated, and is easy to perform.
