Caffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects among coffee drinkers.
 Twenty-two coffee drinkers (three to seven cups per day) underwent repeated double-blind trials to test for caffeine self-administration, withdrawal, and adverse effects.
 Each trial consisted first of a randomized crossover period of 1 day of decaffeinated coffee and 1 day of caffeinated coffee (100 mg) to assess withdrawal and adverse effects of caffeine.
 Next, subjects were given 2 days of concurrent access to the two coffees.
 The relative use of the two coffees was used to assess caffeine self-administration.
 Reliable caffeine self-administration occurred in three of 10 subjects in study 1 and seven of 12 subjects in study 2.
 Withdrawal symptoms were headaches, drowsiness, and fatigue.
 The major adverse effect from self-administration was tremulousness.
 The occurrence of headaches on substitution of decaffeinated coffee prospectively predicted subsequent self-administration of caffeine.
 These results indicate that some coffee drinkers exhibit signs of a caffeine dependence, ie, they self-administer coffee for the effects of caffeine, have withdrawal symptoms on cessation, and experience adverse effects.
