Educational policies.
 It is vital that teachers, parents, and health professionals recognize the major educational problems that affect students with epilepsy.
 Children with epilepsy should be placed in the least restrictive schooling environment so that social, emotional, and educational requirements can be met in a setting best suited to the individual's present needs and future development.
 Personal assessment and monitoring of progress form an equally important part of a child's educational program in integrated schools, but there is a need to develop suitable instruments to assist teachers in their assessments and decision making.
 In Australia, the National Epilepsy Association has developed an "Alert Kit" based on the Epilepsy Foundation of Americas "School Alert Kit" to provide basic medical information on epilepsy to teachers and pupils.
