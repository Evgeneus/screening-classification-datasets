The treatment of multiple intracranial tuberculous abscesses: a case report.
 A Chinese female aged 2 years 8 months with tuberculous meningitis developed hydrocephalus requiring insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.
 After adequate anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy for 14 weeks, multiple intracranial tuberculous abscesses developed.
 The lesions increased in size and number accompanied by clinical deterioration.
 Repeated drainage operations were performed in view of the increased intracranial pressure.
 The child made a remarkable recovery after an initial stormy course.
