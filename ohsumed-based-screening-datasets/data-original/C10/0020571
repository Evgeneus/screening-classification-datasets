Seizure-associated speech arrest in elderly patients 
 Recurrent, brief episodes of speech arrest associated with bifrontal electroencephalographic seizure activity developed in three ill elderly patients.
 The seizures ceased after the initiation of antiepileptic drug therapy and the correction of metabolic abnormalities.
 The cause of the seizure activity remains unknown, but a possible mechanism may be a transient epileptogenic cortical dysfunction that predominantly affects the frontal lobes as a result of concomitant metabolic alterations.
