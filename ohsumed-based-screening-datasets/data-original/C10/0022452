Neuroleptic malignant syndrome. When levodopa withdrawal is the cause.
 Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been described in patients receiving dopamine antagonists and in a few patients after withdrawal of dopaminergic antiparkinson therapy.
 Complications affect almost all organ systems and can be life-threatening.
 Most patients have fever, altered level of consciousness, bradykinesia, and rigidity.
 Treatment includes withdrawal of the causative agent and supportive therapy for complications.
 When withdrawal of a dopaminergic medication is the suspected cause, the agent should be reinstated.
