Effect of milacemide on audiogenic seizures and cortical (Na+, K+)-ATPase of DBA/2J mice.
 Milacemide (MLM, CP 1552 S, 2-N-pentylaminoacetamide), a glycinamide derivative, is currently being evaluated clinically for antiepileptic activity.
 Anticonvulsant properties have been shown in various animal models, but the mechanism of action of MLM is unclear.
 We studied its activity in audiogenic seizures of DBA/2J mice.
 MLM was effective in inhibiting the convulsions induced by sound with a biphasic dose-effect relation.
 The ED50 was 109 mg/kg orally against tonic extension.
 Higher doses were necessary to abolish clonic convulsion and running response.
 Because impaired cerebral (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity is supposed to play a role in epileptogenesis, we tested MLM on in vitro cortical enzymatic activity of DBA/2J mice.
 Basal (Na+, K+)-ATPase activity was unchanged by several concentrations of MLM in normal C57BL/6J and audiogenic DBA/2J mice.
 K+ activation (from 3 to 18 mM) of (Na+, K+)-ATPase is abolished in DBA/2J mice as compared with C57BL/6J mice, suggesting impaired glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase.
 In the presence of MLM (from 30 to 1000 mg/L), cortical (Na+, K+)-ATPase of DBA/2J mice is activated by high concentrations of K+, as in C57BL/6J mice.
 Results suggest that the antiepileptic activity of MLM in audiogenic mice may be secondary to an activation of a deficient glial (Na+, K+)-ATPase.
