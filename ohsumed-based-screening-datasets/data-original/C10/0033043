Posttraumatic intradiploic leptomeningeal cyst in an adult: case report.
 We report the case of an adult with a posttraumatic intradiploic leptomeningeal cyst that caused a circumscribed osteolytic skull lesion.
 Local pain, the only symptom of the lesion, regressed after surgery.
 Intradiploic leptomeningeal cysts must be distinguished from intradiploic arachnoid cysts, which are of congenital origin.
