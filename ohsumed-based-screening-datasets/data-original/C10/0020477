Magnetoencephalographic localization of interictal spike sources. Case report.
 The reliability of localization of interictal spike sources using magnetoencephalography (MEG) was examined by repeated measurements in a patient with temporal lobe epilepsy.
 During two preoperative recording sessions, the estimated sources, projected onto magnetic resonance images of the patient's brain, were found to lie less than 1 cm apart within the area subsequently resected.
 The MEG localization was in close agreement with intraoperative cortical recordings.
