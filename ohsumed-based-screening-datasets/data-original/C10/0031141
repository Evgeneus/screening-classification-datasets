Successful treatment of primary amebic meningoencephalitis.
 The fourth documented survivor of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, a young man with a history of waterskiing in a stagnant freshwater lake in northeastern Pennsylvania, is presented.
 Early consideration of this unusual diagnosis, based on historical factors (recent contact with warm fresh water), coupled with prompt aggressive therapy with high-dose amphotericin B is emphasized in achieving a successful outcome.
