Parapharyngeal abscess and torticollis.
 The combination of a parapharyngeal abscess and torticollis in an adult, due to a spastic contraction of the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle is an extremely rare condition.
 We have recently been exposed to such case, in which it was very difficult to make the diagnosis and where CT of the neck gave us the answers without any difficulty.
 The indication for CT at an early stage in unexplained neck infections is stressed.
