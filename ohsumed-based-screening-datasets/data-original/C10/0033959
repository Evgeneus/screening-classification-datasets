Nonpharmacologic treatment of periodic leg movements in sleep.
 The effects of a 30-minute stimulation of the dorsiflexors of the feet and toes before bedtime were investigated in eight patients with periodic leg movements in sleep (PLMS).
 None were taking medications at the time of the investigation.
 All subjects were treated with the EMS-250 Neuromuscular Stimulator, which has a maximum output per channel of 1.5mA and a frequency of 47Hz.
 Stimuli were delivered via a pulse train (on for 1.5sec and off for 1.8sec).
 A single all-night polysomnogram after this stimulation showed that all patients responded to stimulation, with reduction of leg movements from an average pretreatment PLMS index of 44.6 per hour to a posttreatment PLMS index of 14 per hour (p less than .01).
 Nocturnal leg movements were primarily reduced during the non-REM sleep.
 Multiple indices of sleep continuity did not change significantly, although there was a trend toward better sleep consolidation.
