Evidence for a defect in growth hormone-releasing factor signal transduction in the dwarf (dw/dw) rat pituitary.
 Dwarf (dw/dw) rats exhibit a 40% reduction in body growth, isolated GH deficiency (less than 5% of normal pituitary content), and a decreased number of pituitary somatotrophs (15-20% of normal).
 Since GH-releasing factor (GRF) stimulates GH synthesis and secretion and somatotroph proliferation, and its effects are probably mediated by cAMP, we have assessed GH secretion and cAMP production in dw rat pituitaries in response to various GH secretagogues.
 Dispersed pituitary cells from dw rats were less sensitive (2.5-fold) to stimulation of GH secretion by GRF and showed a 25% reduction in the maximal GH response even after normalization of their reduced GH content.
 Intracellular cAMP was elevated 63-fold over basal levels in normal cells after 4 h in response to maximal GRF stimulation, but only 1.9-fold in dw cells, and even larger differences between the groups were found at earlier time points.
 The GH responses of dw cells to exogenous cAMP, however, were indistinguishable from normal.
 Forskolin, a direct stimulator of adenylate cyclase, elicited comparable maximal GH and cAMP responses, but an increased ED50, in dw cells.
 Activation of GS alpha by cholera toxin showed an increased ED50 and reduced GH and cAMP responses in dw cells, and marked decreases in these responses were observed in response to prostaglandin E1.
 Phorbol ester stimulation resulted in a reduced maximal GH response in dw cells without a change in sensitivity.
 These results provide evidence for a defect in the GRF signal transduction pathway associated with a decreased ability of GS alpha to stimulate adenylate cyclase in dw rat somatotrophs that may be causally linked to their GH deficiency.
