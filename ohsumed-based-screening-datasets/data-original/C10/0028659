Instability of a 550-base pair DNA segment and abnormal methylation in fragile X syndrome.
 The fragile X syndrome, a common cause of inherited mental retardation, is characterized by an unusual mode of inheritance.
 Phenotypic expression has been linked to abnormal cytosine methylation of a single CpG island, at or very near the fragile site.
 Probes adjacent to this island detected very localized DNA rearrangements that constituted the fragile X mutations, and whose target was a 550-base pair GC-rich fragment.
 Normal transmitting males had a 150- to 400-base pair insertion that was inherited by their daughters either unchanged, or with small differences in size.
 Fragile X-positive individuals in the next generation had much larger fragments that differed among siblings and showed a generally heterogeneous pattern indicating somatic mutation.
 The mutated allele appeared unmethylated in normal transmitting males, methylated only on the inactive X chromosome in their daughters, and totally methylated in most fragile X males.
 However, some males had a mosaic pattern.
 Expression of the fragile X syndrome thus appears to result from a two-step mutation as well as a highly localized methylation.
 Carriers of the fragile X mutation can easily be detected regardless of sex or phenotypic expression, and rare apparent false negatives may result from genetic heterogeneity or misdiagnosis.
