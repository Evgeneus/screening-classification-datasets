The efficacy of suction drains after routine total joint arthroplasty [published erratum appears in J Bone Joint Surg [Am] 1991 Jun;73(5):791]
 A prospective study of thirty-eight patients (seventy-six knees) who had had a primary bilateral total knee replacement and twelve patients (twenty-four hips) who had had a primary bilateral total hip replacement was conducted to assess the effect of postoperative suction drainage on wound-healing.
 A suction drain was placed on each patient's right operative wound, while no drains were used on the left.
 Otherwise, the same operative technique and method of closure were used in all wounds.
 Statistical analysis of the results showed no difference between the two sides with regard to the incidences of swelling or persistent drainage.
 Return of active function of the quadriceps and of range of motion of the knee in patients who had had a total knee replacement was also unaffected by the use of suction drains.
 We concluded that the routine use of suction drains for wounds is unnecessary after uncomplicated total joint arthroplasty.
