Information and referral service usage among caregivers for dementia patients.
 Questionnaires were mailed to 257 callers of a toll-free telephone "helpline" specializing in Alzheimer's disease and related dementing illnesses; 125 (48.6%) were completed and returned.
 On the average, 3.94 requests for information were made per call.
 The most common requests concerned services delivered to the home, general information about dementia, information about adult day care, and support group information.
 Results indicated that a telephone-based information and referral helpline is useful in disseminating knowledge about resources to caregivers of older community-residing adults with cognitive impairment.
