The modified Schollner costoplasty.
 The modified Schollner costoplasty is a cosmetic procedure for the correction of rib prominence deformity in scoliosis.
 We present the results of the procedure in 21 patients who had previously undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis.
 We found the procedure to be well tolerated without major complications.
 Objective cosmetic improvement was achieved in all but one case.
 All but one patient considered the procedure to have been of cosmetic benefit.
