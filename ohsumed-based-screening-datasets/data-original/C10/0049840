Rhabdomyolysis in children: a 3-year retrospective study.
 The case reports of 4 pediatric patients illustrate the complex clinical scenarios in which childhood rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria occurs.
 Children ranged in age from 8-18 years.
 Presumed etiologies of rhabdomyolysis/myoglobinuria included Neisseria sepsis, exertion-related episodes, dialysis disequilibrium, and diabetic ketoacidosis.
 No child developed respiratory or renal failure.
 all children were discharged with normal muscle power, indicating the benign nature of this disease and the importance of aggressive management.
