Treatable blindness in temporal arteritis.
 Temporal arteritis is a common cause of blindness.
 Prompt steroid treatment limits unilateral visual loss while protecting the contralateral eye.
 Established blindness is irreversible.
 We report a case of temporal arteritis in which an eye with no light perception secondary to an arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy regained 6/6 vision.
