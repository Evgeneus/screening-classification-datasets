Vagal schwannoma.
 A patient with a benign encapsulated intrathoracic vagal schwannoma is presented and the literature is reviewed.
 The right paratracheal tumor was identified incidentally on a chest film and excised using a right thoracotomy.
 Although rare, vagal schwannomas should be considered for any mediastinal mass along the vagus nerves especially when the paratracheal tumor produces minimal or no respiratory symptoms suggesting a slow-growing, encapsulated process.
