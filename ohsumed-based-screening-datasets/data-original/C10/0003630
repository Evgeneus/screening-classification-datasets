HTLV-I viral-associated myelopathy after blood transfusion in a multiple trauma patient.
 This may be the first documented case in the United States and in the orthopedic literature of transfusion-transmitted human T-cell leukemia virus Type I (HTLV-I)-associated myelopathy (HAM).
 Progressive myelopathy occurred in a 58-year-old white man with serologic and molecular evidence of HTLV-I infection after multiple trauma and subsequent transfusion with multiple units of banked blood products.
 Symptoms of myelopathy occurred 15 months after the transfusions.
 Myelopathy from HTLV-I infection simulates a disorder of orthopedic interest.
 Physicians should be aware of the symptoms of HAM and unexplained myelopathy.
