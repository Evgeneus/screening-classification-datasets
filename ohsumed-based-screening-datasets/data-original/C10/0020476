Shunt nephritis. Case report.
 The incidence of shunt nephritis has decreased over the past several years due to the increased use of ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunts rather than the ventriculovascular systems for which this complication was originally reported in 1965.
 Despite this trend, the syndrome has been reported in cases of VP shunting and, for this reason, merit a renewed look.
 Shunt nephritis is thought to be secondary to immune complex formation and deposition in the kidney in response to Staphylococcus epidermidis.
 The diagnostic workup and management of this disease is discussed.
