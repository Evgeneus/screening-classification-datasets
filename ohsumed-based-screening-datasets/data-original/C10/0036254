The diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy using an algometer.
 Thirty-three patients with reflex sympathetic dystrophy were studied prospectively to ascertain the pressure-pain threshold of affected and unaffected limbs.
 The affected side had a lower threshold which was found to be statistically significant.
 In all 18 patients with upper limb involvement, the pain threshold was reduced on the affected side, but this applied to only 11 of the 15 with leg involvement.
 This difference may be because patients with lower limb symptoms had been referred later in the course of the syndrome.
 We showed by repeated tests that after an average of 49 days there was a slow return to normality.
 The estimation of pressure-pain thresholds may help in the earlier diagnosis of reflex sympathetic dystrophy.
