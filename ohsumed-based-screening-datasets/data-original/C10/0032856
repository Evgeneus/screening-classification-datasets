Hyperalgesia induced in the rat by the amino-terminal octapeptide of nerve growth factor.
 Nerve growth factor (NGF) in the mouse submandibular gland undergoes cleavage of its amino-terminal octapeptide when salivation is induced by epinephrine.
 The significance of this event is uncertain; cleaved NGF demonstrates bioactivity and no function has been attributed to the octapeptide produced (NGF-OP; Ser-Ser-Thr-His-Pro-Val-Phe-His).
 Enzyme inhibition studies indicating structural relatedness of NGF-OP and bradykinin (BK) prompted us to determine whether NGF-OP would elicit BK-like actions.
 We found that like BK, NGF-OP induced a decrease in mechanical nociceptive threshold (i.e., produced hyperalgesia) in the hairy skin of the rat.
 This effect was dose-dependent and sequence-specific; like BK it was attenuated by sympathectomy and indomethacin pretreatment.
 However, NGF-OP actions appeared to be distinct from those for BK in that tissue injury was required for NGF-OP to induce hyperalgesia.
 Furthermore, we found no evidence that NGF-OP bound to or activated BK receptors.
 Our data indicate that NGF-OP is a distinct mediator of hyperalgesia.
 We suggest that NGF-OP alters pain threshold in the injured target regions of NGF-responsive neurons.
