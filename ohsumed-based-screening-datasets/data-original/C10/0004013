Heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant Wilson's disease.
 Wilson's disease may present with severe acute hepatocellular failure.
 The only effective treatment for fulminant Wilson's disease is liver transplantation, which may lead to reversal of the underlying disease.
 Some patients with cirrhosis who are too ill to undergo orthotopic liver transplantation have been treated with heterotopic liver transplantation.
 However, use of heterotopic liver transplantation for fulminant hepatocellular failure has not been successful.
 This case study involves a patient in whom a heterotopic liver transplant was successfully used for treatment of Wilson's disease presenting with fulminant hepatocellular failure.
