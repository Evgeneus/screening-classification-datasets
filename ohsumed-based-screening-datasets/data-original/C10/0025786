Effect of anticoagulant on biocompatibility in membrane plasmapheresis.
 The effect of heparin or citrate anticoagulation on blood cellular, complement pathway and coagulation pathway was investigated in a membrane plasma exchange procedure.
 Two membrane plasma separators constructed of cellulose di-acetate (CA) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were evaluated with heparin or citrate alone for anticoagulation in a 26 year old male with myasthenia gravis.
 Maximum white blood cell counts decrease was 21% at 30 min for the CA with heparin while no decrease was observed for the other schemes.
 Platelet counts changes were comparable between heparin and citrate, while the PVC groups showed less changes than the CA groups.
 The CA groups, regardless of the type of anticoagulant used, indicated that complement activation occurred via the classical pathway within the module in addition to the activation via alternative pathway for the CA with heparin.
 In the PVC groups, complement activation was noted to occur only when heparin was used for anticoagulation.
 PT and PTT showed slight increases with citrate, while they were remarkably prolonged with heparin.
 Citrate showed less changes in cellular and humoral factors compared to heparin.
 CA with heparin was the most activating combination of membrane material and anticoagulant, while the PVC with citrate was the least activating combination.
