Endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus using the Nd:YAG laser: initial experience and proposal for management.
 Although most patients with hydrocephalus are treated effectively with ventriculoperitoneal shunts, a small group fails to respond to diversion procedures.
 In some patients within this group, hydrocephalus may be caused in part by the overproduction of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
 In other patients, previous shunt infections may limit the ability of the peritoneum to absorb fluid, and patient response to a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be improved by reducing CSF production.
 We discuss a case of a 29-month-old hydrocephalic infant with a ventriculoperitoneal shunt who had ascites.
 Computed tomography showed bilateral symmetrical enlargement of the choroid plexus.
 Repeated cultures of the CSF and shunt tubing were sterile, and the daily production of the CSF exceeded 1000 ml.
 Therapy with acetazolamide decreased the CSF output temporarily, but it was discontinued after serious electrolyte abnormalities occurred.
 The endoscopic coagulation of the choroid plexus with a neodymium:YAG laser transmitted through a flexible quartz fiber decreased CSF production effectively.
 This procedure may be useful in a variety of clinical conditions associated with hydrocephalus or with other intraventricular lesions.
