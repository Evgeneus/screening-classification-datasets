Factors influencing outcome of prednisone dose reduction in myasthenia gravis.
 We reviewed retrospectively 114 prednisone dose reduction attempts in 63 myasthenic patients.
 Dose reduction was considered successful if a patient remained asymptomatic for more than 1 year on no prednisone or a stable low dose of prednisone.
 Successful dose reduction attempts were more common in patients taking azathioprine, but thymectomy did not influence taper outcome.
 Slower rate of dose reduction and higher ending dose of prednisone improved the chance of success.
