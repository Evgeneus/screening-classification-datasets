Complete temporal lobectomy for surgical resuscitation of patients with transtentorial herniation secondary to unilateral hemispheric swelling.
 Transtentorial herniation is an ominous finding in the patient with head injuries.
 We report our experience with 10 patients suffering from acute transtentorial herniation secondary to posttraumatic unilateral hemispheric swelling who were treated aggressively with temporal lobectomy.
 Eight patients were men and 2 were women.
 Their ages ranged from 22 to 61 years, with a mean of 37 years.
 Their preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale scores ranged from 3 to 6, with a mean of 4.
 All patients had both computed tomographic and clinical evidence of unilateral hemispheric shift and acute herniation without a significant subdural or epidural hematoma.
 Seven patients had unilateral nonreactive pupils and 3 had bilateral nonreactive pupils.
 All were taken to the operating room within 2 hours of clinical signs of herniation.
 Complete unilateral temporal lobectomies including the mesial structures, amygdala, and uncus were performed.
 In this series, the mortality rate was 30%, including a single patient who was neurologically stable but died from nonneurological injuries.
 Of the 7 survivors, 4 were functionally independent and 3 required minimal assistance with the activities of daily living.
 Aggressive, early decompression via complete temporal lobectomy may thus significantly improve the outcome in patients with transtentorial herniation accompanying posttraumatic hemispheric swelling and midline shift.
