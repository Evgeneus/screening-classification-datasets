Education and epilepsy: assessment and remediation.
 Learning difficulties in children with epilepsy may be caused by brain damage and should be investigated.
 In many cases, however, seizures and/or electroencephalographic (EEG) findings are the only signs of pathology.
 Frequency and type of seizures may be determining factors that should, if necessary, be evaluated by long-term EEG monitoring, preferably during school performance or in conjunction with neuropsychological assessment.
 This may prove that subclinical epileptiform discharges in the EEG can adversely affect the child's performance.
 Secondary psychological problems in epilepsy patients, combined with side effects of antiepileptic drugs, may cause or heighten learning problems.
 Prophylactic control of seizures with one appropriate drug may alleviate learning problems.
 Computerized neuropsychological testing with simultaneous EEG recording may reveal the influence of epileptiform discharges on cognitive function and also help to evaluate the effects of antiepileptic drugs.
 Objective assessment of subclinical epileptiform activity makes it easier to treat the pathology identified by the EEG with optimal dosage of the most appropriate drug.
 A balance is required because epileptiform discharges and even occasional seizures may be less disabling than side effects from large doses of several drugs.
 Information to the school and the parents concerning the patient's abilities and limitations may be as important as seizure control.
 Specialized teaching should be started early, when necessary, with the patient integrated into a normal school if possible.
 However, good functioning in a special school is preferable to marginal functioning in a normal school.
