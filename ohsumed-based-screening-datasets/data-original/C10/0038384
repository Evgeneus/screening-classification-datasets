Associative anomia: dissociating words and their definitions.
 A 60-year-old woman, in whom magnetic resonance imaging and single photon emission computed tomography confirmed the presence of chronic damage to the left temporal lobe, had pure anomia with sparing of other language and cognitive functions.
 She could independently access lexical knowledge (words) and semantic knowledge (word definitions).
 We postulate that her anomia was due to a failure to associate lexical and semantic knowledge.
