An investigation into the etiology of irritable hip.
 A prospective review has been made of 111 children who presented with acute hip pain to determine it's etiology and assess the need for multiple investigations at presentation.
 There was no clinical hematological, serological or bacteriological evidence to identify positively patients with an irritable hip, neither was there good correlation with a history of infection.
 An effusion was diagnosed by ultrasound in 71% but there were no factors, either clinically or by investigation, to differentiate between patients with or without an effusion.
 We conclude that multiple investigations to find a source of infection in patients with irritable hip are not warranted as they are rarely positive, seldom affect management and are of no help in investigating the etiology of irritable hip.
