Perioperative stroke. Part II: Cardiac surgery and cardiogenic embolic stroke.
 The major mechanism of stroke in cardiac surgery is embolization.
 The risk is higher in intracardiac than in extracardiac surgery.
 The incidence of stoke associated with CABG is about 5%.
 The cerebral protective properties of isoflurane and thiopentone, acid-base management, and monitoring of cerebral perfusion during cardiopulmonary bypass are discussed.
 Prophylactic carotid endarterectomy for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease before cardiac surgery is not necessary.
 Symptomatic carotid disease increases the risk of stroke, and the management of patients who have both symptomatic coronary and carotid artery diseases is discussed.
 Cardiogenic embolism is probably responsible for many perioperative strokes.
 Patients with atrial fibrillation, valvular disease, and prosthetic heart valves are at high risk of cardiogenic embolism.
 Strokes associated with cardioversion, pacemaker insertion, coronary arteriography and angioplasty are explored.
