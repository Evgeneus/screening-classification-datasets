CD4+ lymphocyte subsets in the cerebrospinal fluid of multiple sclerosis and non-inflammatory neurological diseases.
 We studied paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood (PB) samples from 18 inactive multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and 10 with non-inflammatory neurological diseases.
 By means of a dual-colour cytofluorimetric micromethod we were able to count 1500 cells on average in each CSF sample.
 We found a significant reduction of CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the CSF of MS patients.
 Similarly, CD45RA+ and CD4+CD45RA+ CSF/PB ratios were lower compared with controls.
 The reduction of suppressor-inducer T-cells did not correlate with CD8+ cell levels in the CSF.
 The CD4+ subset ratio (CD4+CD45RA-/CD4+CD45RA+) was significantly increased in the CSF of MS patients.
 Our data suggest that the reduction of CD4+CD45RA+ cells in the PB is not due to a segregation of such cells in the CSF.
 Conversely, CSF changes reflect changes in the PB similar to these found for other T-cell subsets.
