Epidemiology of absence epilepsy: EEG findings and their predictive value.
 This population-based study of absence epilepsy comprised 97 children, ranging in age from newborns to 15 years.
 All had regular bilaterally synchronous and symmetric 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges and absences with or without generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS).
 Patients without GTCS tended to have long episodes of 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave discharges (greater than or equal to 10 sec), and simultaneous clinical correlates more frequently than those with GTCS.
 Posterior delta rhythm was found only in patients without GTCS.
 Focal abnormalities, albeit transient, were more frequent among patients with GTCS.
 The initial electroencephalogram was of some early predictive value in patients with only absences at the time of the initial registration.
 Brief episodes of 2-4 Hz spike-and-slow wave (less than 10 sec) without clinical correlates were associated with a slightly increased risk of future GTCS.
