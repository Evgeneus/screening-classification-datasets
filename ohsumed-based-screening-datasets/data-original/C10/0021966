Transcranial Doppler in reversible migrainous vasospasm causing cerebellar infarction: report of a case.
 A young woman with a history of classic migraine suffered a large cerebellar infarction.
 Comprehensive evaluation did not disclose any potential causes for the stroke and she had no other risk factors.
 Transcranial Doppler (TCD) was useful in identifying vasospasm of the vertebral arteries.
 Following treatment with propranolol, angiography and repeat TCD revealed resolution of the vasospastic disorder.
 TCD is a useful noninvasive tool in detecting vasospasm associated with ischemic lesions in certain patients with migraine.
