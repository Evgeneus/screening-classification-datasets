Spinal cord schistosomiasis: a pediatric case mimicking intrinsic cord neoplasm.
 We present the clinical, myelographic, MRI, and histologic data on a 7-year-old girl with confirmed Schistosoma mansoni infection of the spinal cord.
 MRI of the granulomatous spinal lesion revealed extensive enlargement of the cord in the T11-12 area, with some intramedullary swelling extending to T-5 through T-7.
 The clinical manifestations of spinal schistosomiasis can be diverse, and there should be a high index of suspicion for all patients from endemic areas.
