Incidental microvesicular steatosis due to valproic acid anticonvulsant therapy.
 Valproic acid has been implicated in at least 100 cases of fatal acute liver failure.
 Most cases have occurred in patients less than 10 yr old; however, at least seven have involved adults.
 Microvesicular steatosis has been uniformly observed, but its incidence in less severe liver disease and in asymptomatic patients receiving valproate is unknown.
 We report two patients receiving maintenance valproate, one with resolving acute hepatitis C and the other with chronic persistent hepatitis C, with incidental microvesicular steatosis demonstrated on oil-red O stains.
 We conclude that microvesicular steatosis does not necessarily signify hepatotoxicity in patients on chronic valproic acid, and should not lead to discontinuation of the drug until other causes of acute or chronic liver disease have been excluded.
