An unusual angiographic picture in status migrainosus.
 Arteriographic findings suggestive of inflammation are described in a 26-year-old woman presenting with headache and syncope.
 There were no clinical findings of angitis, and a diagnosis of status migrainosus was eventually made.
 We present her case, as well as a review of previous cases of arterial changes in patients with headache.
 Most previous cases report arterial narrowing, felt to reflect spasm, whereas our patient demonstrated segmental stenoses and dilatations, perhaps implicating inflammation.
 The inflammatory process has been postulated as the pathogenesis of migraine pain.
 As most migraineurs do not undergo arteriography, the incidence of arterial change in these patients is unknown.
 This finding has therapeutic implications for selecting the optimal anti-migraine agent.
