The modified superior based pharyngeal flap. Part III. A retrospective study.
 A retrospective study of 31 patients who had diagnosed velopharyngeal incompetence and were surgically managed with the modified superior based pharyngeal flap was completed.
 The following were analyzed: age at time of operation, gender, physical status, diagnostic protocol, length of operation (length of total surgery) and length of superior based pharyngeal flap, length of postoperative hospital stay, length of total hospital stay, length of follow-up, speech results, complications, patient care, and medication.
 The result showed that the optimal timing for correction of velopharyngeal incompetence was between 3 and 6 years of age.
 The mean length of total hospital stay was 2.7 days, postoperative complications were minimal, and speech results were generally good.
