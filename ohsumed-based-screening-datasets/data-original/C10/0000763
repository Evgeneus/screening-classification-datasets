A surgical approach to the cervicothoracic spine.
 We describe a method for approaching the lower cervical and upper thoracic spine, the brachial plexus and related vessels.
 The method involves the elevation of the medial corner of the manubrium, the sternoclavicular joint, and the medial half of the clavicle on a pedicle of the sternomastoid muscle.
 We have used this exposure in 17 cases with few complications and good results.
 Its successful performance requires high standards of anaesthesia, surgical technique and postoperative care.
