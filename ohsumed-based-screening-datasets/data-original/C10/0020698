Spinal cord injuries. Clinical, functional, and emotional status.
 Ninety-eight patients with traumatic spinal cord injury, at a median age of 33.5 years (range, 16-72 years), with nonremarkable distributions of neurologic characteristics were investigated at a median of 2.3 years (range, 0.1-23 years) after injury.
 Functioning, mood disturbances, and overall quality of life were recorded with established self-assessment instruments.
 Physical dysfunction levels were moderate, being proportionate to neurologic impairment.
 Psychosocial functions, mood states, and quality-of-life perceptions did not differ from those of a control population sample.
 Psychosocial function and mood disturbances varied greatly during the first 4 years after injury, but patients' later recordings expressed predominantly a balanced emotional state and a rewarding social life.
 Progress in this direction consisted of clearly lessened physical dysfunction 1 year after injury and better psychosocial function and well-being after 2 years, whereas patterns of social activities and contacts became gradually less inhibited during a 4-year period after injury.
 Analysis of complications in patients' histories that affected function and mood showed severe pain to be the only complication that related to lower quality-of-life scores.
 Urinary incontinence and infection and autonomous dysreflexia related to inhibited self-care performance; spasticity related to impaired ambulation and feeding skills.
 Gainful employment was the only demographic factor linked to high quality-of-life scores.
