Clinical correlation with serum-soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in Guillain-Barre syndrome.
 In patients with Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) levels were elevated compared with those of patients with other neurologic diseases (OND), and of healthy controls.
 Smaller increases in sIL-2R levels occurred in OND patients compared to healthy subjects.
 Monitoring of GBS patients clearly demonstrated that decreases in sIL-2R levels correlated with clinical recovery.
 Thus, T-cell activation may be relevant in the pathogenesis of GBS.
