Clinical characteristics of acromegalic patients whose pituitary tumors contain mutant Gs protein.
 Activating mutations in the gene for the alpha-chain of Gs, the stimulatory regulator of adenylyl cyclase, have been identified in human GH-secreting pituitary tumors.
 Using the polymerase chain reaction and allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization, we screened 25 GH-secreting tumors for the presence of the activating mutations.
 We also reviewed the clinical charts of the patients from whom the tumors were removed.
 Of 25 tumors, 10 (40%) contained activating mutations.
 Patients in the mutation-positive group came to surgery with smaller tumors and had lower GH levels.
 The activating mutations identify a subgroup of GH-secreting pituitary tumors that probably arise from a shared oncogenic mechanism.
