Migraine headaches.
 Once the definitive diagnosis of migraine has been formulated, the physician has many options available for abortive and prophylactic therapy.
 Nonpharmacologic modalities, including behavioral modification methods such as biofeedback training, may also be considered.
 Migraine does not necessarily have to disrupt the lives of those afflicted.
 The patient with mixed headache presents a more difficult diagnostic and therapeutic problem.
 These patients can also be helped when the disorder is identified, and inpatient therapy for these patients may be required.
