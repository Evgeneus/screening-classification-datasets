Subacute AIDS-related lumbosacral radiculopathy: a bacterial infection?
 A case of lumbosacral polyradiculitis in an HIV-1-positive man (CDC IIB) leading to a flaccid paraplegia below the level of L4 is reported.
 A detailed analysis of several cerebrospinal fluid samples led to the suspicion of a bacterial infection.
 After treatment with antibiotics and tuberculostatic agents the neuropathy improved and the patient has survived for 2 years.
 In contrast to similar cases that were probably caused by cytomegalovirus in terminal stages of AIDS, it is argued that an unidentified bacterial infection was the cause of the polyradiculitis in the present case.
