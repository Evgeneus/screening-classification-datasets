GM1-gangliosidosis (genetic beta-galactosidase deficiency): identification of four mutations in different clinical phenotypes among Japanese patients.
 GM1-gangliosidosis is a genetic neurological disorder caused by mutations in the lysosomal acid beta-galactosidase gene.
 While its phenotypic expression is complex, it is usually classified as being of infantile, juvenile, or adult form, on the basis of age at onset, the rate of symptomatic progression, and severity of central nervous system involvement.
 We have analyzed the acid beta-galactosidase gene in 12 Japanese patients from nine families.
 The aim was to identify mutations in individual patients and then to examine possible correlation between the mutations and the clinical phenotypes.
 Northern blotting studies with a full-length human beta-galactosidase cDNA showed that the mRNA ranged from undetectable to substantially decreased in the infantile patients but was normal in quantity and size in all juvenile and adult patients.
 Four distinct missense mutations have been identified, each limited to the respective clinical forms within our small-size samples.
 In the infantile patient with decreased but detectable mRNA, a point mutation was found resulting in Arg49----Cys.
 In the infantile patient with nearly undetectable mRNA, mutation Arg457----Ter was identified.
 The mutation Arg201----Cys was found in all four of the juvenile patients, while all six adult patients were homozygous for the point mutation Ile51----Thr.
 The mutations found in the juvenile and adult patients alter restriction sites in the normal gene and thus are amendable to quick screening.
 The prediction that these mutations are responsible for the clinical disease was confirmed by no expression of the catalytic activity of the mutant proteins in the COS-I cell expression system.
