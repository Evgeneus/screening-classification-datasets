Comparison of CT, low-field-strength MR imaging, and high-field-strength MR imaging. Work in progress.
 To assess objectively the sensitivity and specificity of low-field-strength (0.064 T) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, a prospective blind study of 280 examinations was performed to compare low-field-strength MR imaging with computed tomography (CT) and with high-field-strength (1.5-T) MR imaging of the cranium.
 The sensitivity (defined as the true-positive rate) with high-field MR imaging was superior to that with low-field MR imaging and CT in helping detect overall abnormalities.
 Sensitivities were generally similar over a broad range of specific cranial central nervous system diseases.
 Low-field and high-field MR imaging were equivalent in the blind diagnoses of neoplasms and white matter disease, whereas low-field MR and CT were equivalent in the blind diagnoses of contusion, subdural and epidural hematoma, sinus disease, normality, and abnormality.
 The specificities with low-field MR imaging and CT were substantially better than those with high-field MR imaging.
