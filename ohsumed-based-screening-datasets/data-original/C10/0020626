Indwelling epidural catheters for pain control in gynecologic cancer patients.
 Seven patients with severe pain caused by an advanced, incurable gynecologic malignancy were treated with an indwelling epidural catheter connected to an implantable subcutaneous port through which morphine was infused.
 There were few major complications associated with insertion or maintenance of the system.
 The average usage was 60 days, although the system functioned continuously for 6 months in one patient.
 Pain distribution in these women ranged from the upper abdomen to the lower extremities.
 All patients, including one with liver metastases, reported good to excellent pain control with the epidural narcotics.
 Two subjects with upper abdominal pain occasionally required supplemental oral oxycodone, but the other five patients had adequate pain relief with the epidural system alone.
 The indwelling epidural system provides excellent analgesia for patients with advanced, incurable gynecologic cancer.
