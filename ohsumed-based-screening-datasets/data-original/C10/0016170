Increased arterial adrenaline is related to pain in uncomplicated myocardial infarction.
 Plasma levels of catecholamines, beta-thromboglobulin (BTG) and arginine vasopressin (AVP), and degree of pain were examined in 22 patients with suspected uncomplicated myocardial infarction within 24 h following onset of chest pain.
 Sixteen patients developed infarction with peak creatine phosphokinase at 1280 Ul-1 (range 293-3770 Ul-1).
 Fifteen healthy men served as controls (C).
 Arterial adrenaline levels were significantly higher in patients with pain (1.15 +/- 0.23 nmol l-1, n = 8, mean value +/- SEM) than in those without pain (0.60 +/- 0.10 nmol l-1, n = 14, P less than 0.05).
 Plasma catecholamines were moderately but significantly elevated in myocardial infarction; the concentration of arterial adrenaline was 0.83 +/- 0.14 nmol l-1 and that of arterial noradrenaline was 2.70 +/- 0.28 nmol l-1 compared with 0.44 +/- 0.04 nmol l-1 (P less than 0.025) and 1.47 +/- 0.05 nmol l-1 (P less than 0.0005), respectively, in C.
 One week later, plasma catecholamines had returned to baseline levels.
 Plasma BTG showed borderline elevation (1.0 +/- 0.1 pmol l-1) compared with C (0.6 +/- 0.1 pmol l-1, P = 0.04), and remained unchanged 1 week later.
 Plasma AVP was at baseline level.
 Uncomplicated myocardial infarction, regardless of size, was associated with only moderately increased sympathetic tone.
 Plasma adrenaline was related more to the degree of pain than to the presence of acute myocardial infarction.
 Arterial adrenaline may be a sensitive marker of sympatho-adrenal activity related to pain.
