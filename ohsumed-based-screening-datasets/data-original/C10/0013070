Utility of upright tilt-table testing in the evaluation and management of syncope of unknown origin 
 PURPOSE: Vasovagally mediated hypotension and bradycardia are believed to be common, but difficult to diagnose, causes of syncope.
 Upright tilt-table testing has been proposed as a possible way to test for vasovagal episodes.
 This study investigated the clinical utility of this technique in the evaluation and management of patients with syncope of unknown origin.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-five patients with recurrent unexplained syncope and six control subjects were evaluated by use of an upright tilt-table test for 30 minutes, with or without an infusion of isoproterenol (1 to 3 micrograms/minute given intravenously), in an attempt to provoke bradycardia, hypotension, or both.
 Of the 25 patients, there were 14 males and 11 females, with a mean age of 50 +/- 16 years.
 Six control patients with no history of syncope were also studied.
 All tilt-positive patients received therapy with either beta-blockers, disopyramide, transdermal scopolamine, or hydroflurocortisone, the efficacy of which was evaluated by another tilt-table test.
 RESULTS: Syncope occurred in six patients (24%) during the baseline tilt and in nine patients (36%) during isoproterenol infusion (total positives, 60%).
 None of the controls had syncope during the test.
 All patients who had positive test results eventually became tilt-table-negative by therapy, and over a mean follow-up period of 16 +/- 2 months no further episodes have occurred.
 CONCLUSION: From this study we conclude that upright tilt-table testing combined with isoproterenol infusion is clinically useful in the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope and the evaluation of pharmacologic therapy.
