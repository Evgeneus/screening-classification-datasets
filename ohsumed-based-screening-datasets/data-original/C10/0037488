A short plasma exchange protocol is effective in severe myasthenia gravis.
 Plasma exchange has been reported to be a successful therapeutic procedure for the treatment of severely compromised myasthenic patients, but the optimal regimen in terms of costs or clinical benefit has not so far been determined.
 We have investigated the efficacy of a short plasmapheresis protocol of two exchanges 1 day apart in a series of 70 patients with severe forms of myasthenia gravis.
 Patients were evaluated before and 7 days after the first exchange.
 A positive outcome was observed in 70% of the plasma exchange cycles performed.
 Disease severity did not seem to be a negative prognostic factor for the efficacy of this short protocol, which was well tolerated by patients.
 In only 1 case were major side-effects observed.
 In spite of its short duration, the exchange treatment plus concomitant immunosuppressive drug therapy was not followed by early clinical deterioration.
