Six-year follow-up of early physiotherapy intervention in very low birth weight infants.
 Eighty very low birth weight infants assigned to neurologically normal or at-risk groups on the basis of a neurodevelopmental score were previously described.
 Infants were assigned to physiotherapy or control groups, and the effect of physiotherapy was assessed at 1 year.
 At-risk infants had a significantly lower developmental quotient than the normal group and no beneficial effect of physiotherapy was shown.
 Of the original 80 subjects, 49 were reassessed at a mean age of 74.7 months.
 As observed previously, physiotherapy until 1 year did not influence subsequent outcome in either normal or at-risk children.
 At-risk and normal children had similar mean developmental quotients at 6 years, but the locomotor score of at-risk children was significantly below that of normal children.
 Cerebral palsy occurred in 6 of 24 at-risk vs 0 of 25 normal subjects (P less than .01) and remedial therapy was recommended in 17 of 24 at-risk subjects vs 6 of 25 normal subjects (P less than .001).
 These results confirm that the neurodevelopmental score predicts a risk for either cerebral palsy or soft neurological problems, and early physiotherapy is of questionable benefit in preventing such problems.
