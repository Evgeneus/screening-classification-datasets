Laparoscopic ventrosuspensions. A review of 72 cases.
 Laparoscopic ventrosuspension is simple to perform after diagnostic laparoscopy.
 Serious postoperative complication is unlikely.
 However, patient follow-up over 6 months has not confirmed the usefulness of laparoscopic ventrosuspension in the management of deep dyspareunia or pelvic pain in association with a retroverted uterus.
 The success rate of laparoscopic ventrosuspension at 6 months varies from 18.6% to 46.5%.
 The prior use of a Hodge pessary does not predict the success of laparoscopic ventrosuspension.
