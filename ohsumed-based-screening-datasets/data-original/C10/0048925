Dry beriberi: unusual complication of prolonged parenteral nutrition.
 An adult with Crohn's disease on home total parenteral nutrition (TPN) for 8 months presented with peripheral neuropathy and ataxia.
 The patient was found to be deficient of thiamine.
 A prompt symptomatic response to intravenous thiamine suggests that the patient had the chronic form of dry beriberi.
 To our knowledge, this variety of beriberi in a patient on TPN has not previously been reported.
