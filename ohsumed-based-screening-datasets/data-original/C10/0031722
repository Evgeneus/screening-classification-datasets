Subcutaneous sumatriptan in the acute treatment of migraine. Sumatriptan International Study Group.
 Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multicentre studies were carried out to assess the efficacy and tolerability of subcutaneous (s.c.) injections of 1-3 mg and 1-8 mg sumatriptan, respectively, in the acute treatment of migraine.
 Data are presented from a total of 519 patients.
 In both studies, the primary endpoint of efficacy was a reduction in headache severity from severe or moderate to mild or no headache.
 All doses of sumatriptan were significantly more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms, and the response appeared to be dose-related; an effective response to treatment was achieved within 30 min in 73% of patients treated with 6 mg sumatriptan and 80% of patients treated with 8 mg sumatriptan s.c., compared with 22% for placebo.
 Sumatriptan was well tolerated and the majority of adverse events were mild and transient.
 The most frequent complaint was irritation and pain at the site of injection.
 No changes in laboratory values were noted and ECG readings were unaltered by treatment.
 On the basis of these results, the 6 mg subcutaneous dose has been selected for further evaluation in large-scale studies.
