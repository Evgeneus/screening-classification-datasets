Evaluating painful osteopenia in the elderly.
 Osteopenia is a frequent finding on radiographs of elderly patients.
 When the exam is performed for skeletal pain, this finding may be significant.
 The differential diagnosis for osteopenia is extensive, but individualizing the patient work-up begins with a careful clinical history and laboratory studies.
 Appropriate radiographic exams can then be requested.
 A plain radiograph is always the starting point, followed by--as indicated--a nuclear bone scan, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging.
