Acute atraumatic subdural hematoma associated with moyamoya disease in an African-American.
 A 57-year-old black woman with an atraumatic subdural hematoma was treated for congestive heart failure and was found to have moyamoya disease.
 The association of these two lesions is rare and has never been described in an African-American.
 High cerebral venous pressures and changes in cerebral perfusion caused by congestive heart failure and the loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation in moyamoya disease may explain the spontaneous occurrence of a subdural hematoma.
 Recommendations for management are discussed.
