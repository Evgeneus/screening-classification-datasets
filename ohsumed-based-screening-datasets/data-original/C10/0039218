Deficiencies in anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody measurement in myasthenia gravis.
 In a retrospective case note study of 86 patients with myasthenia gravis, 60 had an anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody assay performed by the regional immunology laboratory.
 Antibody was detected in 38% which compares with 66-93% in other series.
 Whilst the use of staphylococcal protein A to precipitate the antibody-receptor complex, rather than anti-human immunoglobulin, may be partly responsible for this low sensitivity, other methodological problems are likely to exist.
 It is suggested that this potentially critical assay becomes a subject for regular audit.
