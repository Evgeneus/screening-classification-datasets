Clinical features and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.
 OBJECTIVE: To review the clinical features and treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).
 DATA SOURCE AND SELECTION: All articles on OSA published in French and English between 1970 and 1990 and indexed in Index Medicus were reviewed.
 Studies addressing the epidemiologic features and clinical aspects of OSA were selected, and special emphasis was given to articles reporting the effects of treatment on morbidity and mortality rates.
 MAIN RESULTS: OSA is characterized by episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep that result in repetitive hypoxemia and sleep disruption.
 OSA leads to various neuropsychologic and cardiovascular complications, including daytime hypersomnolence, cognitive impairment, systemic and pulmonary hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.
 There is suggestive evidence that the death rate among affected people is increased.
 The true incidence of OSA is unknown, but estimates have varied from 1% upwards among men.
 The current treatment with the greatest overall effectiveness and acceptability is nasal continuous positive airway pressure.
 CONCLUSION: This common, readily treatable disorder is associated with serious complications and therefore must be widely recognized by health professionals.
