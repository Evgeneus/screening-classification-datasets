Multiple noncontiguous spine fractures.
 The data from a prospective study of 508 spine injuries were reviewed to determine the incidence of multiple noncontiguous spine fractures.
 All patients were examined at admission and at 1 and 2 years postinjury.
 This series identified 77 (15.2%) multilevel fractures.
 Motor vehicle accidents were the primary cause of these fractures.
 The incidence of neurologic injury was not significantly different between multiple noncontiguous and single fractures.
 Failure to use seat belts and ejection from the vehicle were the main factors associated with multiple noncontiguous spine injuries.
 Seven major fracture patterns were identified, which accounted for 60% of these injuries.
 The prognosis for multilevel spine fractures was not significantly worse that that for single-level injuries.
