Breathing during sleep in patients treated for obstructive sleep apnea. Nasal CPAP for only part of the night.
 To determine whether long-term NCPAP therapy influences severity of sleep disordered breathing during the second part of a night when NCPAP is applied for only the first four hours of sleep, we studied 21 patients with OSA receiving NCPAP therapy for 253 +/- 41.6 days.
 Results from polysomnography for the period after withdrawal from NCPAP (night B) were compared to the corresponding period of sleep prior to initiation of NCPAP therapy (night A).
 There was no significant change in RDI from night A (53.9 +/- 8.6) to night B (28.7 +/- 3.3), but maximal apnea length diminished from 55 +/- 2.9 s to 40 +/- 2.9 s (p less than 0.05).
 Whereas daytime Po2 and the amplitude of desaturations during sleep remained equal, overall oxygenation during sleep improved slightly (mean SaO2 night A = 90.6 +/- 0.9 percent; night B = 92.8 +/- 0.5 percent; p less than 0.05).
 Differences between nights A and B were more prominent the more severe sleep apnea had been prior to treatment and could not be explained by weight loss.
 There was strong correlation between improvements in oxygenation measurements and the daily time of NCPAP use.
 In conclusion, we found a subgroup of OSA patients receiving long-term NCPAP therapy with less disturbed ventilation during sleep following use of NCPAP for only the first part of the night, but in the majority of patients, sleep disordered breathing off NCPAP remained unchanged.
