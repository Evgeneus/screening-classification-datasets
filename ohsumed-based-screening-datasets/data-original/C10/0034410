The Purkinje cell and its afferents in human hereditary ataxia.
 The cerebellar cortex in patients with autosomal dominant and recessive ataxia was studied by Golgi impregnation and immunocytochemistry in order to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of neuronal atrophy which accompanies these disorders.
 Monoclonal antisera were used to visualize phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated neurofilament proteins, and a synapse-specific protein (P38; synaptophysin).
 Golgi stain and immunocytochemistry for non-phosphorylated neurofilament protein revealed partial or complete loss of distal Purkinje cell dendrities in the dominant cases and in one recessive case.
 Many preserved parallel fibres were shown by the monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated neurofilament protein.
 This antibody also gave strong reaction product in torpedoes.
 Axosomatic and axodendritic terminals on Purkinje cells were reduced in number, and loss of mossy fiber terminals was revealed by monoclonal anti-P38.
 The described methods provided additional morphological evidence of the heterogeneity of the hereditary ataxias.
 Purkinje cell atrophy progressed from loss and simplification of the dendritic tree to disappearance of the cell body.
 While these cells appeared to be especially vulnerable, other neurons of the molecular and granular layers were not exempt.
 There was evidence that at least some extracerebellar afferents, such as mossy fibers, were also affected by the disease process.
