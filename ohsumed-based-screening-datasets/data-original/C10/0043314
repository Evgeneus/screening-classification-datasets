Migraine and epilepsy with infantile onset and electroencephalographic findings of occipital spike-wave complexes.
 An EEG finding of temporo-occipital or temporo-parieto-occipital spike-wave complexes, suppressed by eye opening, coexisting with classical migraine, was observed in 14 children; in 13 of these patients, seizures were present.
 Classical migraine, visual phenomena and seizures coexisted in different clinical patterns.
