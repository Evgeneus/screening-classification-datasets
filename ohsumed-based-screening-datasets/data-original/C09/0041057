Chemotherapy of metastatic and/or recurrent undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma with cisplatin, bleomycin, and fluorouracil.
 Undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (UCNT) is known to be radiosensitive and chemosensitive, but the latter has never been studied prospectively with phase II methodology.
 After an intensive work-up, 49 patients with recurrent (REC) and/or metastatic (MTS) UCNT were treated with three monthly cycles of cisplatin (CDDP) 100 mg/m2 day 1; bleomycin 15 mg intravenously (IV) day 1, and 16 mg/m2/d continuous infusion (CI) days 1 to 5; and fluorouracil (5FU) 650 mg/m2/d CI days 1 to 5 (PBF).
 Of the 49 patients, 33 were North African.
 The sex ratio was three males:one female, and the median World Health Organization (WHO) performance status was 1.6.
 In the 48 patients assessable for response, we observed nine (19%) complete responses (CRs) and 29 (60%) partial responses (PRs) (60%), for a 79% overall response rate (95% confidence interval, 68% to 90%) in the assessable group and a 78% global rate.
 There were eight CRs (24%) observed in the group without previous chemotherapy (33 patients) compared with one CR in the chemotherapy pretreated group (16 patients).
 Four patients are still alive without evidence of disease after 52+, 54+, 58+, and 58+ months, respectively.
 All of them had less than three bone MTS sites, and received radiation therapy in these sites.
 The results confirm the chemosensitivity of UCNT, and the observation of unmaintained long-term responders makes curability a possible consideration.
