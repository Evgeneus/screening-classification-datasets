Role of radiation therapy for 'juvenile' angiofibroma.
 Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA) is a rare benign neoplasm which occurs primarily in male adolescents and is characterized by aggressive local growth.
 The controversy concerning appropriate treatment for patients with juvenile angiofibroma persists.
 Radiation therapy and surgical resection have both been reported to be effective to control a high proportion of these tumours.
 The case reported here demonstrates a locally advanced JNA controlled by radiation therapy.
