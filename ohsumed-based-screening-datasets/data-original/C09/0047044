A circulating inhibitor of the platelet Na+,K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) enzyme in allergy.
 Previous investigations have documented a reduced activity of the sodium-potassium-stimulated adenosine triphosphatase enzyme (Na+,K+ ATPase) in platelet membranes of allergic subjects.
 The purpose of this study was to determine if the reduced Na+,K+ ATPase activity was due to an enzyme inhibitor.
 Na+,K+ ATPase activity of a particulate fraction of sonicated platelets was determined by spectrophotometry in asymptomatic adults with and without allergy.
 The Na+,K+ ATPase level (mean, nanomoles per microgram of protein per minute; +/- STD) of allergic subjects (0.9 +/- 1.3) was lower (p less than 0.001) than that of nonallergic subjects (3.9 +/- 1.6).
 In contrast, when the same platelet fractions were frozen before assay, Na+,K+ ATPase was higher (p less than 0.005) in allergic subjects (6.0 +/- 1.4) than in nonallergic subjects (3.6 +/- 2.0).
 An inhibitor of canine kidney Na+,K+ ATPase was detected in the buffer in which these platelet fractions were frozen, allergic subjects (0.5% +/- 0.4% inhibition per microgram of protein) compared to nonallergic subjects (0.04% +/- 0.08%; p less than 0.005).
 The level of inhibition correlated positively with the postfreezing increase in platelet membrane Na+,K+ ATPase, suggesting a freezing-induced displacement of an inhibitor from the membrane.
 Plasma from these same subjects inhibited Na+,K+ ATPase activity of normal platelets, allergic subjects (70% +/- 31% inhibition) compared to nonallergic subjects (13% +/- 16%; p less than 0.001).
 These data suggest that the transport-enzyme defect observed in platelets from allergic subjects was due to a circulating Na+,K+ ATPase inhibitor.
 In vivo Na+,K+ ATPase inhibition in allergy could have profound effects on intracellular cation concentrations and broad implications for pathogenesis.
