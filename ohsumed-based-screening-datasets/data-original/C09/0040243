Otolaryngologic approach to the diagnosis and management of otitis media.
 Otitis media is a common childhood disease caused by multiple factors.
 Understanding the pathogenesis of otitis media is important in the diagnosis and management of it.
 The mode of therapy should be chosen depending on the type and stage of the disease.
 Treatment options available to an otolaryngologist include antibiotics, tympanocentesis, myringotomy and tympanostomy tube insertions, adenoidectomy with or without tonsillectomy, exploratory tympanotomy, atympanoplasty, and mastoidectomy.
