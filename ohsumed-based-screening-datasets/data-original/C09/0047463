The "plateau effect" of cis-platinum-induced hearing loss.
 Cis-platinum-induced hearing loss has been reported to exhibit a "plateau effect" over the 2 to 8 kHz range.
 We examined serial audiometry data from 27 patients treated with cis-platinum.
 Although a plateau at 60 to 70 dB HL often occurred, this hearing loss was clearly exceeded in a number of patients.
 We identified 14 patients with sufficient cis-platinum-induced sensorineural hearing loss to evaluate a plateau limit to hearing loss over the 4 to 8 kHz range.
 Half of these 14 patients had hearing losses that exceeded the plateau level.
 More severe 4 to 8 kHz hearing losses did not correlate with number of treatments, cumulative dosages of cis-platinum, pre-existing hearing loss, radiation therapy, other chemotherapeutic agents, or even hearing losses below 4 kHz.
 Although cis-platinum therapy can induce a plateau of moderate hearing impairment for some patients over the 4 to 8 kHz range, a significant proportion of patients will experience more severe hearing impairment in this range, even after only one or two courses of cis-platinum.
