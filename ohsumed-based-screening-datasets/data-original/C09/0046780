Etiologic diagnosis in neurotologic disease.
 The inner ear is a converter (transducer) of mechanical to electrical energy for both hearing and balance functions.
 This task is accomplished as a result of the presence of the chemicals within the perilymph and endolymph.
 Maintaining normal hearing and balance function is dependent upon the availability of the proper chemicals to perform this transduction task.
 The inner ear functions as an internal body organ and its efficiency in regard to performing its tasks related to hearing and balance function are chemically dependent upon many body systems.
