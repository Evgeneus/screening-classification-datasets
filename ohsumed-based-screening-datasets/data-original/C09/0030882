The measurement and manipulation of intralabyrinthine pressure in experimental endolymphatic hydrops.
 Three to four months after unilateral surgical ablation of the endolymphatic duct and sac, endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures were measured in both the normal and hydropic ears of 11 guinea pigs.
 In normal ears, endolymphatic pressure always approximated perilymphatic pressure.
 Endolymphatic pressure exceeded perilymphatic pressure in all ears with hydrops, except one in which these pressures were equal.
 The effect of postural inversion on inner ear pressures were studied in both normal and hydropic inner ears.
 Normal ears showed endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure to rise equally during this maneuver.
 In hydropic ears, the difference between endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressure was notably reduced from measurements obtained in the prone position.
 This study indicates that an alteration in pressure regulation within the inner ear may be important in the pathogenesis and manifestation of experimental endolymphatic hydrops in the guinea pig.
 Physiologic mechanisms and clinical implications of these results are described.
