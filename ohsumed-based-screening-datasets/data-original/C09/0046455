Antibiotic/steroid ear drop preparations: a cost-effective approach to their use 
 Otorrhoea is a common otological complaint reflecting infection in the outer and/or middle ear.
 Guidelines as to which antibiotic/steroid ear drop preparation to use in a treatment regime are few and no studies comparing the different types of preparation are available.
 This paper reviews the antibiotic/steroid ear drop preparations used by consultant surgeons and general practitioners and presents a two fold rationale for deciding which preparation to use, based on microbial sensitivity and cost.
