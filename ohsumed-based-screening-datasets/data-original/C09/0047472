Posterior semicircular canal occlusion in the normal hearing ear.
 This report outlines our experience with posterior semicircular canal occlusion, a new operative procedure for intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).
 We postulate that the resulting solid canal "plug" prevents endolymph movement within the posterior canal, which effectively fixes the cupula.
 This selectively abolishes the receptivity of the posterior canal to both angular acceleration and gravity without influencing the other inner ear receptors.
 We previously reported the success of this procedure in two patients with BPPV and a co-existing profound sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear.
 Since that report, a slightly modified technique has been used to occlude six more posterior canals--five in normal hearing ears.
 While our follow-up times range from only 3 to 18 months, all eight patients continue to be relieved of their BPPV.
 Temporary mixed hearing losses occurred in three of the five ears with normal preoperative hearing.
 Hearing in all five patients ultimately returned to the preoperative state.
 We believe this procedure is a simpler and safer alternative to singular neurectomy for the treatment of intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo.
