Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum: biochemical characterization.
 A vegetative mass in the right nasal cavity of a 62-year-old man from Palma de Mallorca, Spain, was found to be due to Leishmania.
 The organism was isolated in culture and characterized by in situ hybridization, Southern blot hybridization, and isoenzyme analysis; it was thus demonstrated to be the most common enzyme variant 1 (MON 1) of Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum.
