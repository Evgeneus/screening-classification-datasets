A new technique for quantitative measurement of laryngeal videostroboscopic images.
 The objective measurement of laryngeal function and pathophysiology is one of the goals of current laryngeal research.
 We describe a new computerized tool for voice analysis systems that allows the quantitative analysis of individual videostroboscopic images.
 We describe this new technique compared with previous methods of videostroboscopic image analysis and discuss its clinical and research applications.
