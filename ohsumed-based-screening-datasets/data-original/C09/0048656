Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis involving the paranasal sinuses.
 Aggressive juvenile fibromatosis is a destructive, locally invasive process, with a propensity for local recurrence after inadequate excision.
 Although it does not metastasize, uncontrolled growth can eventually lead to death.
 The role for radiation and chemotherapy is controversial and these modalities are best reserved for advanced unresectable or recurrent lesions.
 The treatment of choice is en bloc surgical resection with wide margins.
