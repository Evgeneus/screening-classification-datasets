Acquired hypoprothrombinaemia and lupus anticoagulant: response to steroid therapy.
 An iliac crest bone marrow aspiration in a 24-year-old man was followed by severe haemorrhage into the iliopsoas muscle.
 A lupus anticoagulant and severe hypoprothrombinaemia, as well as clinical and laboratory pointers to suggest the presence of a systemic lupus erythematosus-like syndrome, were demonstrated.
 Therapy with prednisone was commenced following recurrent severe epistaxis.
 His prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin activity improved promptly and his bleeding ceased.
 The lupus anticoagulant is commonly encountered in the laboratory, but acquired hypoprothrombinaemia is extremely rare.
 The condition is reviewed and its treatment discussed.
