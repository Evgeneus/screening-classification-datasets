Esthesioneuroblastoma: surgical treatment without radiation.
 This study compares the treatment of two groups of patients diagnosed with esthesioneuroblastoma limited to the nasal cavity without evidence of cribriform plate erosion.
 Five patients were treated with radiation and extracranial excision, and eight patients were treated by craniofacial resection only.
 The incidences of local recurrence were 60% and 12%, respectively.
 The paper also presents a new staging classification for these tumors.
