Concentration of cefuroxime in serum and middle ear effusion after single dose treatment with cefuroxime axetil.
 Antimicrobial agents play an important role in the treatment of patients with acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion (OME).
 The study was undertaken to determine the concentrations of cefuroxime in the blood and middle ear effusions (MEE) of children between 6 and 12 years of age with acute otitis media and chronic OME after a single oral dose administration of cefuroxime axetil, the ester prodrug of cefuroxime.
 Cefuroxime axetil (250 mg) was administered 2 to 6 hours before either myringotomy for acute otitis media or myringotomy and tube insertion for chronic OME.
 Blood samples and middle ear aspirates were obtained from 31 children and the samples were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography.
 Cefuroxime was recovered in measurable concentrations in all serum samples and in 15 (79%) of the 19 MEE specimens analyzed.
 No correlation was seen between cefuroxime MEE concentrations and effusion type, bacteriology or serum concentrations.
 This study shows that cefuroxime does penetrate into MEE when OME is present and that therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in some patients.
