Human ultrasonic speech perception.
 Bone-conducted ultrasonic hearing has been found capable of supporting frequency discrimination and speech detection in normal, older hearing-impaired, and profoundly deaf human subjects.
 When speech signals were modulated into the ultrasonic range, listening to words resulted in the clear perception of the speech stimuli and not a sense of high-frequency vibration.
 These data suggest that ultrasonic bone conduction hearing has potential as an alternative communication channel in the rehabilitation of hearing disorders.
