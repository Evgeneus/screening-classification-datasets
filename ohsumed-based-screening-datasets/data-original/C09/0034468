Prospective analysis of masticatory function following lateral mandibulotomy.
 Based on clinical impressions and subjective reports by patients, it is generally accepted that a loss of mandibular continuity will result in decreased masticatory function while preserving continuity will result in maintenance of masticatory function.
 Surprisingly, there is a paucity of well controlled studies objectively evaluating masticatory function to support these statements.
 The purpose of this study was to objectively evaluate masticatory function in a patient who underwent surgical resection for cure of a tonsillar carcinoma where a lateral mandibulotomy was used.
 Masticatory performance and swallowing threshold were assessed using a 0.5 gm frito as the test food substance and a sieve analysis.
 The subject was evaluated pre and post surgery and post prosthetic rehabilitation.
 When compared with pre surgery function, masticatory function and swallowing threshold were maintained and enhanced with prosthetic treatment 1 year post surgery.
 Maintenance of mandibular continuity did have functional merit for the subject studied.
