Middle ear adenoma: tumour of mixed mucinous and neuroendocrine differentiation.
 Two cases of progressive hearing loss due to middle ear tumours are described.
 The histological characteristics numbered intraluminal mucin production and neuroendocrine features, as shown by argyrophilia and ultrastructural demonstration of dense core granules.
 These tumours have been known by many different names, reflecting the controversies relating to their presumed histogenesis and differentiation.
 The currently preferred designation is middle ear adenoma, and these two cases provide further evidence for dual lines of differentiation.
