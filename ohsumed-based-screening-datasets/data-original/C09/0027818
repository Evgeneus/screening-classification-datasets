Multiple Amb a I allergens demonstrate specific reactivity with IgE and T cells from ragweed-allergic patients.
 The relationship between the structure and abundance of an inhaled protein and its potential for causing an allergic response is unknown.
 This study analyzes Amb a I, a family of related proteins formerly known as Ag E, that comprise the major allergens of short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia).
 T cells isolated from ragweed allergic patients were shown to proliferate in response to purified Amb a I.1 protein from pollen in in vitro secondary cultures, demonstrating the presence of T cell stimulatory epitopes in Amb a I.1.
 Three recombinant forms of Amb a I (Amb a I.1, Amb a I.2, and Amb a I.3) obtained as cDNA derived from pollen mRNA were expressed in bacteria.
 All three recombinant forms were shown to be specifically recognized by pooled ragweed-allergic human IgE on immunoblots, confirming these gene products are important allergens.
 An examination of immunoblots probed with sera derived from allergic patients revealed a variation in IgE binding specificity.
 A minority of patients' IgE exclusively reacted with recombinant Amb a I.1, whereas most patients' IgE reacted with Amb a I.1 as well as Amb a I.2 and Amb a I.3 proteins.
 A detailed examination of the reactivity of T cells derived from 12 allergic patients to these recombinant Amb a I forms revealed that these allergens are all capable of stimulating T cell proliferation in in vitro assays.
 It is concluded that the allergic response to ragweed pollen in most allergic patients is composed of a reaction to multiple related Amb a I proteins at both the B and T cell levels.
