Nasal transit time in normal subjects and pathologic conditions.
 A radionuclide method using Tc-99m was used to measure the nasal transit time in 43 patients, including normal smokers and nonsmokers and those with various nasal or paranasal pathologies.
 The technique described was slightly modified from that already in use in various centers in order to enable more precise measurement.
 Measurement of transit time of a droplet of Tc-99m phytate on the nasal mucosa appears to differentiate patients with immotile cilia syndrome from normal controls.
 A positive test, however, can occur also in smokers and in patients with other nasal and paranasal problems.
 The test is reproducible, cost-effective, and noninvasive, enabling the clinician to make a more appropriate selection of patients needing further investigation.
