Radiotherapy of advanced laryngeal cancer using three small fractions daily.
 Since 1983, we have treated advanced (UICC stages III and IV) squamous carcinomas of the larynx by primary radiotherapy, using three small fractions a day, 3-4 h interfraction interval, 5 days per week.
 The early patients received doses per fraction of 1.5 Gy, and a total dose of approximately 70 Gy, given as a split-course over 6 to 7 weeks.
 While overall tumor control and laryngeal preservation was good, a number of severe late radiation reactions were seen.
 The schedule was then modified, with a reduction in the fraction size to 1.1 Gy, the total dose to 60 Gy, and the overall time to 4 weeks, with omission of the mid-treatment "split." Since 1986, we have treated 26 patients in this way.
 Acute reactions are brisk, but rapidly healing.
 Loco-regional control was achieved in 22 patients, only one of whom has relapsed to date, in a solitary node, salvaged by radical neck dissection.
 Four have died of uncontrolled loco-regional malignancy, and three of intercurrent disease while in clinical remission.
 No serious late morbidity has been observed in surviving patients, and vocal quality is good in the majority.
 These results suggest that this hyperfractionated and accelerated radiotherapy schedule may offer an acceptable nonsurgical, voice-preserving treatment for advanced laryngeal carcinoma; it can be used in a normally working radiotherapy department.
