Antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media.
 No single antimicrobial drug is best suited for all patients with AOM.
 Amoxicillin and TMP-SMZ, however, remain first-line drugs in the initial treatment of uncomplicated AOM in the non-neonate.
 In other situations the drug selected depends on the patient's age, associated illnesses, recent history of otitis media, and drug hypersensitivity.
 Pharmacokinetic studies of AOM treatment are essential in generating more precise recommendations for antimicrobial drug use.
