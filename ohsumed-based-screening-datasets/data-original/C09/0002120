Nonendoscopic percutaneous gastrostomy.
 Tight peritoneal adherence of the stomach to the abdominal wall as a prerequisite of percutaneous gastrostomy can be achieved by a newly developed cannula.
 It serves for puncture and fixation of the gastric wall.
 Thus, percutaneous gastrostomy can be established safely even in instances of an endoscopically nonaccessible stomach.
 Further applications of the device for the purpose of intestinopexy and facilitation of endoscopic procedures are being evaluated.
