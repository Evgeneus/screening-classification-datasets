Vestibular and postural findings in the motion sickness syndrome.
 The motion sickness syndrome constitutes varying degrees of subjective motion intolerance and three objective findings: hyperactive VOR (79%), hip sway strategy (60%), and positional nystagmus (42%).
 It is present in subjects who have a strong history of motion sickness.
 Vestibular rehabilitation appears to help control symptoms.
 The study also suggests an inheritance pattern, but a structured pedigree could not be constructed.
 Prospective studies are warranted to further establish the patterns of the motion sickness syndrome.
