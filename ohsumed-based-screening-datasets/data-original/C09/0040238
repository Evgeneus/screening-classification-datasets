Immunologic reactivity in the middle ear in otitis media with effusion.
 This article reviews the immunologic reactivity in the middle ear in both the human disease and in animal models of otitis media.
 It differentiates the role of immune complexes in otitis media in the animal model and in the human form of middle ear inflammation.
 The effect of immunization of the gut on the mucosal immune system in the middle ear is briefly explored, and the source of lymphocytes that make their way into the middle ear mucosa from other parts of the mucosal immune system and systemic immune system are briefly discussed.
 Finally, work from the author's laboratory on the immune response of children with recurrent otitis media due to nontypable Haemophilus influenzae is summarized.
