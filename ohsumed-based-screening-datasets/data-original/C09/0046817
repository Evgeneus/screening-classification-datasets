A comparison of the KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy vs. traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy.
 This study compared tonsillectomy by potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP/532) laser with tonsillectomy by traditional dissection and snare.
 Eighty-three consecutive patients who were candidates for a tonsillectomy were randomly assigned to one of four groups in a prospective study.
 The four treatments were bilateral traditional dissection/snare tonsillectomy, bilateral KTP/532-laser tonsillectomy, left laser tonsillectomy and right dissection/snare tonsillectomy, and left dissection/snare tonsillectomy and right laser tonsillectomy.
 Intraoperative comparisons were made between the two methods with regard to blood loss and operating time.
 Postoperatively bleeding and healing time were also recorded.
 A questionnaire answered on a daily basis assessed the patient's pain.
 Disadvantages of the KTP/532 tonsillectomy included increased cost, increased total operating time as a result of increased setup time and laser malfunctions, delayed healing, and no statistically significant improvement in level of pain.
 The sole advantage associated with the KTP/532 laser tonsillectomy was decreased blood loss, which may be significant for patients with a coagulopathy.
