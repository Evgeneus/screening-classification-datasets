Osteoma of the middle ear.
 Osteomas involving the middle ear and causing a functional disturbance are rare.
 We report a case of a patient with an osteoma arising from the lateral semicircular canal.
 The main symptom was vertigo and to halt this the defect of the canal was obliterated with a bone chip and fibrin glue after removal of the tumour.
