The limited accuracy of bone-conduction audiometry: its significance in medicolegal assessments.
 Accurate bone-conduction testing with masking is always difficult, but for clinical purposes limited accuracy suffices.
 However, when assessing claimants for compensation, extreme care is needed since even small apparent air-bone gaps are sometimes translated into financial abatement.
 This paper sets out the stringent test conditions required to achieve adequate precision.
 It also indicates the inaccuracies inherent in such tests, and recommends procedures for interpreting the significance of bone-conduction thresholds.
