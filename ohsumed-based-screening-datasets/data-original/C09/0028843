Use of serum markers in the diagnosis and management of laryngeal cancer.
 Many neoplastic diseases are reported to be accompanied by the presence or associated with an increase in biological substances identified as tumour markers.
 The most common markers implicated in head and neck cancers are CEA, TPA, LASA, SCC, CA 19-9, and ferritin.
 These markers (except SCC) were evaluated in 50 patients with a laryngeal carcinoma, in 20 patients with benign lesions, and in 20 healthy subjects.
 The results show for each marker assayed the following sensitivity values (true positives): CEA, 10%; CA 19-9, 30%; TPA, 30%; LASA, 90%; ferritin, 60%.
 Specificity (true negatives) was as follows: CEA, 85%; CA 19-9, 99.4%; TPA, 98%; LASA, 99.8%; ferritin, 97%.
 LASA and ferritin seem to be the most suitable markers for patient monitoring because of their higher sensitivity in all phases of cancer disease.
