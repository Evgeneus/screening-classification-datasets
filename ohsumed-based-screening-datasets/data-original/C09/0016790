Surgical treatment of laryngeal web with mucosa graft.
 Surgical treatment of laryngeal webbing varies with the extent and site of the web.
 An extensive one seems to be best treated by laryngofissure and skin or mucosa transplantation.
 Recent experiences with four cases of thick glottal webbing indicated that a mucosa graft was better for the voice result than a skin graft.
 For success in the airway and voice results, the salient points in surgery include 1) precise midline thyrotomy, 2) shaping of the vocal cord under fiberoptic control, and 3) mucosa grafting with the combined use of a pliable stent or fibrin glue for fixation.
