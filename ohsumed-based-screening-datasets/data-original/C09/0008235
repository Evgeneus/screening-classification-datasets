Direct extension of laryngeal carcinoma to the skin of the neck.
 Invasion of the skin of the neck by laryngeal carcinoma is relatively uncommon.
 Twelve cases of cancer of the larynx fungating through the cervical skin are presented.
 They mostly followed initial treatment by deep X-ray therapy or partial laryngectomy.
 A high tracheostomy was also considered to be a contributing cause for the occurrence of such a mishap.
 The management and follow-up of these patients is described.
