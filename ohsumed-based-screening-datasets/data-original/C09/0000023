Abnormal differentiation of human papillomavirus-induced laryngeal papillomas.
 We studied the proliferation and differentiation of human laryngeal papillomas, which are benign tumors induced by human papillomaviruses.
 Immunofluorescent stains of tissues for a number of differentiation-specific proteins showed abnormal differentiation.
 Papilloma tissue fragments in vitro showed a slightly decreased fraction of proliferating cells that incorporated tritiated thymidine and a markedly reduced incorporation of tritiated uridine when compared with normal tissue.
 We propose that papillomavirus infection results in normal basal cell proliferation but abnormal terminal differentiation and that this abnormality significantly contributes to the hyperplasia of the papillomas.
