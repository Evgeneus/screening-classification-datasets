The lymphocyte transformation test with type II collagen as a diagnostic tool of autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss.
 Immunological disorders of the cellular type can be diagnosed by the lymphocyte transformation test (LTT).
 An autoimmune mechanism of certain cases of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) can be evaluated by using human inner ear tissue as an antigen.
 Recent studies have shown that type II collagen plays an important role, not only in some autoimmune mediated rheumatoid diseases, but also as an antigenic substrate of inner ear tissue in autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss.
 This paper deals with results of the lymphocyte transformation test using type II collagen as antigen in 68 patients with progressive sensorineural hearing loss (PSNHL) and 68 healthy volunteers.
 Thirty-four patients showed a strong stimulation in the lymphocyte transformation test, in contrast to only four volunteers in the control group, two of whom had a history of rheumatoid arthritis.
