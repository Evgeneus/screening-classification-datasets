Clinical approach to treatment of otitis media.
 The author presents his experience of 10 years of practice with the treatment of otitis media.
 He expresses concern for the inconsistencies between articles written recommending treatment protocols for otitis media and actual clinical results from using those treatment protocols.
 Otitis media varies in its appearance from patient to patient, with its association to other continuous structures and other organ systems making it a challenging disease to correct and cure.
 Treatment must be tailor-made to fit the patient, and the physician needs to consider other professional opinions and emphasize follow-up care.
