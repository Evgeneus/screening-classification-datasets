Lower cranial nerve palsies. Potentially lethal in association with upper cervical fracture-dislocations.
 Palsies of the lower cranial nerves occurred in association with traumatic atlantoaxial dissociations in two patients.
 The fracture-dislocations sustained were rare injuries and the neurologic complications contributed greatly to their morbidity and mortality.
