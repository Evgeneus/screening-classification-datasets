The spontaneous course of nasal obstruction in patients with normal nasal airway resistance.
 Sixty-seven patients, candidates for septoplasty in the years 1976-1978 because of nasal obstruction and deviated nasal septum, but not having surgery because their nasal airway resistance was normal, were reviewed in 1982 and again in 1989.
 Between 1982 and 1989, 6% of the patients became free of their respective nasal complaints, and 18% of their nasal obstruction, the corresponding overall figures for the period between 1976 and 1978, and 1989, being 20 and 36%.
 In fact, the majority of the patients were suffering from vasomotor rhinitis and because in so many cases nasal obstruction tends to disappear as time goes on, a conservative waiting policy would seem to be an appropriate approach to treatment.
