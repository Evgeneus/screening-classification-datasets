Laryngeal cancer: diagnosis, treatment and speech rehabilitation.
 Cancer of the larynx occurs most often in men between 50 and 70 years of age.
 Cigarette smoking and alcohol are responsible for more than 75 percent of cases.
 Hoarseness is the most common presenting complaint.
 If hoarseness persists for more than two weeks, laryngoscopy is indicated.
 Clinical staging utilizes direct laryngoscopy, esophagoscopy and bronchoscopy to exclude synchronous malignancies.
 The five-year cure rate, with preservation of voice and glottic function, is as high as 90 percent if the lesions of the vocal cords are found in an early stage.
 Total laryngectomy is required for more extensive disease.
 Speech rehabilitation has been revolutionized by tracheoesophageal speech techniques.
