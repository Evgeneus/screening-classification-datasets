Immunotherapy abrogates the generation of eosinophil and neutrophil chemotactic activity during pollen season.
 In a group of 40 birch pollen-allergic patients with a history of rhinoconjunctivitis and wheezing during the pollen season, 20 were immunotherapy (IT) treated preseasonally with birch-pollen extract (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).
 Blood samples for determination of the levels of heat-labile eosinophil chemotactic activity (HL-ECA), heat-labile neutrophil chemotactic activity (HL-NCA), and heat-stable neutrophil chemotactic activity were collected before the season, at the beginning of the study, at the start of the season, at the peak, at the end, and after the birch-pollen season.
 The symptoms from rhinoconjunctivitis and airways, peak expiratory flow, and use of medication were recorded throughout the season.
 Significant increases of HL-ECA and HL-NCA were observed in untreated compared with IT-treated patients at the start of the season (p less than 0.0001 for both activities) and at the peak of the birch-pollen season (p less than 0.0005 and p less than 0.01, respectively).
 At the end of the season, HL-ECA levels were not significantly different between the patient groups, whereas HL-NCA levels were still higher in untreated patients (p less than 0.005).
 We conclude that IT completely abrogates the generation of HL-ECA and HL-NCA during a pollen season.
