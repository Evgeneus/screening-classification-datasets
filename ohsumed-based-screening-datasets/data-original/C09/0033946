Middle ear pressures of children with otitis media with effusion.
 Middle ear (ME) pressures were measured in 30 children with chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) transtubally with the use of a catheter pressure transducer (Mikro-tip, PC-330F).
 They were found to range from 40 to -185 mm H2O, the average being mildly negative (-54.33 +/- 59.04 mm H2O).
 About two thirds of these children had pulsating changes of ME pressure; the range of the pressure change was between 10 and 50 mm H2O.
 The ME pressure tended to be lower in ears with serous effusion than in those with mucoid effusion, but there was no significant difference between them.
