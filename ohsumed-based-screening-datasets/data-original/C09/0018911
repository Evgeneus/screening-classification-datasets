Nasal midline masses in infants and children. Dermoids, encephaloceles, and gliomas.
 Nasal dermoids, gliomas, and encephaloceles are uncommon congenital lesions that result from aberrant embryologic development.
 We have treated 46 children with these nasal lesions.
 In view of the potential intracranial connection, patients are at risk for intracranial infection, and early surgical correction is thus imperative.
 Neuroimaging studies may help to predict intracranial involvement.
