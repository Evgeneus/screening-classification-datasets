Otologic disease in AIDS patients: CT correlation.
 The contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans of the temporal bone and brain in 18 patients with otologic disease and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were retrospectively reviewed.
 Seven scans revealed middle ear and mastoid disease; three scans were consistent with central nervous system (CNS) pathology; and eight scans demonstrated no abnormalities.
 CT scanning was found useful in localizing otopathology and diagnosing CNS toxoplasmosis, aural polyps, osteomyelitis, mastoiditis, and middle ear effusion due to hypertrophic lymphoid tissue.
 The authors conclude that AIDS patients with sensorineural hearing loss should undergo contrast-enhanced brain CT scans to rule out CNS pathology; AIDS status does not alter criteria for CT scanning in patients with conductive hearing loss; and that images of the nasopharynx should be included on temporal bone CT scans of patients with conductive hearing loss in order to exclude eustachian tube obstruction by hypertrophic lymphoid tissue.
