Update on functional anatomy and pathology of human eustachian tube related to otitis media with effusion.
 New anatomic and histopathologic information regarding the eustachian tube and its surrounding structure as well as possible mechanisms of opening and closing function and dysfunction are discussed in this article.
 In the past two decades, much light has been shed on the relationship between anomalies of the eustachian tube and the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion.
 Now that a technique for obtaining specimens for any histopathologic study that includes the temporal bone as well as the eustachian tube is available, it is hoped that, by harvesting and examining a large number of such specimens, more information will be gained about the relation between eustachian tube pathology and eustachian tube dysfunction, particularly as it relates to otitis media effusion.
 Only in this way can the clinical management of otitis media be improved.
