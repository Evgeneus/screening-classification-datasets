Unusual cause of intranasal injury.
 Intranasal injury without external involvement is not common.
 To our knowledge this is the first reported case of such an injury, caused by an assailant's two fingers forced up the nostrils of our patient causing severe mucosal laceration and excessive bleeding.
 The patient died two weeks later.
