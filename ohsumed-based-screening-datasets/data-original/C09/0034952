Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: modes of presentation.
 Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignancy among the southern Chinese people and has a poor prognosis.
 The aim of this study was to describe in detail the presentation of NPC as found between 1984 and 1988 at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong.
 Our study confirmed that patients present with an advanced stage of malignancy; 70% were stage III to V.
 Eighty-two percent of patients were between 21 and 60 years of age.
 The symptoms often suggested benign disease and most patients would delay seeking treatment for at least 5 months.
 We recommend inspection of the nasopharynx with flexible nasoendoscopy for all persons in high-risk areas on a regular basis and advise a policy of active health education for both physicians and the general population to reduce the stage of NPC at first presentation.
