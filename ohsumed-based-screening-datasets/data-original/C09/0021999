Adenoidectomy in otitis media. A review.
 For many years adenoids were thought to affect adversely middle ear (ME) aeration by obstructing the eustachian tube opening, leading to ME infections and effusions.
 Consequently, the adenoids have often been removed in children suffering from ME diseases; indeed, adenoidectomy is still performed around the globe on millions of children annually.
 Opinions vary, however, on the usefulness of the operation in various ME diseases.
 The purpose of this study is to review the available studies concerning the relationship of adenoids to the ME as well as the effect and benefit of adenoidectomy on ME effusions and ME infections.
