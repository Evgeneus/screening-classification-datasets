Pseudocyst of the auricle. Case report and world literature review 
 We treated a patient with pseudocyst of the auricle and reviewed the 113 cases previously published in the world literature.
 Pseudocyst of the auricle is an asymptomatic, noninflammatory cystic swelling that involves the anthelix of the ear, results from an accumulation of fluid within an unlined intracartilaginous cavity, and occurs predominantly in men (93% of patients).
 Characteristically, only one ear is involved (87% of patients), and the lesion is usually located within the scaphoid or triangular fossa of the anthelix.
 Previous trauma to the involved ear is uncommon.
 The diagnosis may be suggested by the clinical features, and analysis of the aspirated cystic fluid and/or histologic examination of a lesional biopsy specimen will confirm the diagnosis.
 Therapeutic intervention that maintains the architecture of the patient's external ear should be used in the treatment of this benign condition.
