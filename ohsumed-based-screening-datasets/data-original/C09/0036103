The effect of treatment with ventilating tubes on language development in preschool children with otitis media with effusion.
 The effect of bilateral tube insertion on language development was studied in a randomized controlled trial of 43 preschool children with persistent bilateral otitis media with effusion (OME).
 Improvement in language scores was observed in both the treatment and non-treatment groups.
 There was a minor difference in favour of the treatment group which did not reach statistical significance.
 Although there is a growing consensus that otitis media with effusion can have negative effects on language development in young children, it has not yet been proved that this effect can be reversed by treatment with ventilating tubes.
