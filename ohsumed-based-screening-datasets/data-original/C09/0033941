Epiglottoplasty for reconstruction of posttraumatic laryngeal stenosis.
 Laryngeal stenosis secondary to blunt laryngeal trauma is mostly localized at the supraglottic and glottic levels.
 The epiglottis is ideally suited to reconstruct the defect after excision of supraglottic and glottic scar tissue and anterior thyroid cartilage.
 It is the conclusion of the authors that epiglottic reconstruction is an effective procedure for repair of laryngeal stenosis at the supracricoid level.
 Two case reports are given.
