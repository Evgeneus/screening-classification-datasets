Abolition of optokinetic afternystagmus by aminoglycoside ototoxicity.
 We studied optokinetic afternystagmus in eight subjects with loss of or impairment of vestibular function due to ototoxic antibiotics.
 We found that the initial amplitude, the time constant, and the slow-phase cumulative eye position of optokinetic afternystagmus were significantly reduced in the patients.
 Slow-phase cumulative eye position most reliably distinguished our patients' responses from those of a normal group.
