Low incidence of point mutation at codon 12 of K-ras proto-oncogene in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.
 Forty-two cases of squamous cell carcinoma arising in the upper aerodigestive tract were examined to determine the incidence and type of point mutation in codon 12 of the c-K-ras gene by using the polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide hybridization techniques on DNA extracted from paraffin blocks.
 DNA sequencing, in addition, was performed in 4 cases.
 No point mutation was detected in codon 12 of c-K-ras in the 42 squamous cell carcinomas we examined.
 According to the results of DNA sequencing of 4 cases, codon 13 also revealed no point mutation.
 Thus, point mutational activation of codon 12 of c-K-ras oncogene is an uncommon event in human upper aerodigestive tract squamous cell carcinoma.
