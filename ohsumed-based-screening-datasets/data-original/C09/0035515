Intracranial metastasis from carcinoma of the paranasal sinus.
 Carcinomas of the paranasal sinuses are locally invasive tumors that only occasionally metastasize.
 The tumor may spread intracranially by local invasion through the dura into the frontal lobes and extension along the vidian nerve.
 We describe two cases of cerebellar metastasis in patients with local recurrence and discuss the mechanism of spreading.
 It is possible that more aggressive treatment of these tumors, which results in longer survival, may be associated with an increased incidence of intracranial metastasis.
