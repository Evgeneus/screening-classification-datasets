Cricoid release in a preterm neonate 
 A baby born at 23 weeks gestation could not be extubated at 34 weeks and nine weeks intubation was causing laryngeal granulation.
 Anterior cricoid release saved the infant from a tracheostomy.
 The case is reported because of (a) the prematurity and small size of the neonate and (b) the microsurgical technique and non-penetration of tracheal mucosa, neither of which have been addressed in previous publications.
