Update: ansa cervicalis to recurrent laryngeal nerve anastomosis for unilateral laryngeal paralysis.
 Twenty cases of unilateral laryngeal paralysis are reported.
 Satisfactory follow-up intervals and data (videostroboscopy and glottographic analysis) were available on 12 patients.
 The excellent to normal phonatory quality achieved in many of these patients indicates that the ansa cervicalis to recurrent laryngeal nerve anastomosis is the procedure of choice in selected patients with unilateral vocal cord paralysis.
 Excellent medialization of the paralyzed cord, as well as correction of arytenoid malposition and thyroarytenoid muscle atrophy appear to explain the technique's success, since the reinnervated cord neither abducts nor adducts.
 We feel that this technique is the procedure of choice in younger patients, or those who use their voices professionally, since the phonatory quality achieved is superior to Teflon injection or Isshiki thyroplasty, and the technique is reversible.
