Ultrastructural evidence of a merocrine secretion in the human endolymphatic sac.
 The results of a light and transmission electron microscopic analysis of an endolymphatic sac (ES) from a patient suffering from episodic vertigo, tinnitus, and hearing loss are presented.
 A biopsy of the intraosseous portion of the ES was obtained during a translabyrinthine approach to section the vestibular nerve in the internal acoustic meatus.
 The material consisted mainly of tubular epithelial structures filled with heavily stained material.
 Pathologically dilated and degranulated rough endoplasmic reticuli and disaggregation of polyribosomes with accumulation of solitary ribosomes in the cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum suggested a disturbed epithelial cell protein synthesis.
 Ultrastructural evidence of an increased merocrine secretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES was noted.
 This made it possible to analyze the presumed intracellular secretory pathways.
 An increased number of intraepithelial lymphocytes and monocytes was observed.
 Since the inner ear had been subjected to surgical intervention before the vestibular nerve section, no conclusions can be drawn as to whether the patient's symptoms were related to the disturbed protein metabolism and hypersecretion of glycoprotein conjugates into the ES.
 The findings support earlier experimental results that indicate that the ES has not only a resorptive function but also a secretory one.
