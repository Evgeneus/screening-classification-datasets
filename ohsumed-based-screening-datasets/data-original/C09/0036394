Treatment of chronic mastoiditis by grafting of mastoid cavities with autologous epithelial layers generated by in vitro culture of buccal epithelium.
 Autologous cultured epithelial layers were established from biopsies from the mucosa of the cheek, a non-keratinizing region of the oral cavity.
 These were grafted to the unepithelialized mastoid cavities of nine patients with chronic mastoiditis and severe otorrhoea varying from two to 30 years' duration.
 All procedures were performed on an out-patient basis, with no anaesthesia except for topical anaesthesia for the mucosal biopsy.
 In seven of the patients the grafts took well, with complete resolution of the otorrhoea for a minimum follow-up period of eight months.
 In one patient there was a partial take of the graft with substantial improvement in the rate of discharge.
 The mastoid cavities of two patients were biopsied five months after grafting, and demonstrated a stratified squamous epithelium, with keratinization of the epithelium clearly evident.
