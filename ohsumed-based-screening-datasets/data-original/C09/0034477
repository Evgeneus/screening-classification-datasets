Correlates of vestibular evaluation results during the first year of life.
 Prenatal and perinatal correlates of abnormal auditory brainstem responses in neonates have been studied extensively.
 In contrast, vestibular function during the first year of life has received sparse attention.
 Using a specially modified vestibular test battery, 65 infants (17 low-risk, 48 high-risk) were initially evaluated during their first 6 months of life.
 Results revealed normal vestibular function in 46 infants (13 low-risk, 33 high-risk) and abnormal findings at either 3 or 6 months in 19 infants (4 low-risk, 15 high-risk).
 Correlations between vestibular results and variables such as auditory brainstem response results, birth history, and postnatal course in the neonatal intensive care unit were analyzed statistically.
 While some differences were mildly significant, none were highly significant.
 The lack of significant correlation between abnormal auditory brainstem response and vestibular results is of particular interest.
