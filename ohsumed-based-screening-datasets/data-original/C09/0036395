Mastoid obliteration with the temporoparietal fascia flap.
 Obliteration of persistently discharging open mastoid cavities is one surgical option to achieve a dry ear.
 All the currently described techniques involve the use of random pattern local tissue flaps or free grafts.
 Ten patients have undergone obliteration procedures using the vascularized temporoparietal fascia flap.
 This resulted in rapid epithelialization by six weeks in seven out of 10 cases.
 The remaining three patients have persistent non healed areas over the medial attic wall, but are not troubled by otorrhoea.
 The indications, technique and complications of mastoid obliteration by this axial pattern flap are described.
