Locally advanced paranasal sinus and nasopharynx tumors treated with hyperfractionated radiation and concomitant infusion cisplatin.
 Fourteen patients with paranasal sinus complex and nasopharynx tumors were treated at State University of New York Health Science Center at Brooklyn (Brooklyn, NY) with a regimen of split-course hyperfractionated radiation (120 cGy/fraction) and concomitant cisplatin infusion (5 to 7 mg/m2/24 hours).
 All of the patients had T4 tumors or massively recurrent disease with base of skull or facial bone involvement.
 Twelve patients were treated with curative intent receiving total doses of 6000 to 6960 cGy (modal 6750 cGy), whereas two patients were treated with less than 5000 cGy as palliation.
 Eleven of the 12 patients (92%) achieved a complete response, and 7 of 12 (58%) are alive at 35 to 72 months (mean, 47 months).
 Five patients are alive with no evidence of disease, and two with a local recurrence.
 Three patients died of distant disease, and two died from a local recurrence.
 When the response to treatment was analyzed based on tumor volume and radiation dose, only two of nine lesions measuring between 4 to 10 cm failed locally.
 The two palliative patients had almost complete local clearance of the disease but died at 2 and 8 months, respectively.
 In nine patients, the eye or optic nerve was included in the treatment field and received between 2000 to 6960 cGy.
 Only one of these nine patients had ophthalmic complication and this was confined to the cornea.
