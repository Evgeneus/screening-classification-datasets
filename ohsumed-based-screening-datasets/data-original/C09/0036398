Nasal endoscope in posterior epistaxis: a preliminary evaluation.
 The findings of a preliminary, prospective evaluation of the role of endoscopy in the management of adult posterior epistaxis are presented.
 A cohort of patients managed by the endoscopic technique was compared with a control group managed by the traditional methods of nasal packing or epistaxis balloons.
 The endoscope allowed visualization and direct treatment of previously undiagnosed posterior bleeding points.
 Patients managed by the endoscopic technique had a significantly shorter duration of in patient stay than those managed by traditional methods.
