Malignant tumours of the middle ear.
 The authors present 15 patients with middle ear malignant tumours, of which 13 were squamous cell carcinomas, one was a rhabdomyosarcoma and one a malignant lymphoma.
 In 11 of 13 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, long-standing chronic otitis media preceded the malignant process and only in 2 patients did the tumour develop without previous chronic infection.
 Most of the patients presented at an advanced stage of the disease: in 6 the tumour had destroyed surrounding bone, commonly involving the endocranium; in 7 the facial nerve was paralysed and in 8 patients there was total hearing loss.
 The diagnosis of malignant tumour was established before surgery in 5 patients, but 8 patients were operated upon for suspected chronic otitis.
 Three patients died without treatment and 10 were treated: 3 with radiotherapy because the tumour was inoperable, 3 had surgery only and 4 patients had surgery and received radiotherapy post-operatively.
 Of 7 operated patients only 2 are alive without signs of tumour.
 Our findings suggest that otologists should bear in mind this disease in patients with chronic suppurative otitis and accompanying suspected symptoms.
 In 2 patients with rare types of sarcoma of the middle ear the diagnosis of tumour was established at an advanced stage and they could not be treated.
