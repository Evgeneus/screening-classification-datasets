Vocal fold medialization by surgical augmentation versus arytenoid adduction in the in vivo canine model.
 There are a variety of methods for treating unilateral vocal cord paralysis, but to date there have been few studies that compare these phonosurgical techniques by using objective measures of voice improvement.
 Vocal efficiency is an objective voice measure that is defined as the ratio of the acoustic power produced by the larynx to the subglottic air power.
 Vocal efficiency has been found to decrease with glottic disorders such as vocal cord paralysis and carcinoma.
 This study compared the effects of vocal fold medialization by surgical augmentation to those of arytenoid adduction on the vocal efficiency, videostroboscopy, and acoustics (jitter, shimmer, and signal-to-noise ratio) of a simulated unilateral vocal cord paralysis in an in vivo canine model.
 Arytenoid adduction was superior to surgical augmentation in vocal efficiency, traveling wave motion, and acoustics.
