Arytenoid subluxation: diagnosis and treatment.
 Both arytenoid subluxation and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis (RLNP) may result from injury to the larynx, and they may be difficult to distinguish clinically.
 A patient with arytenoid subluxation who was initially believed to have RLNP was treated with medialization laryngoplasty 1 year after the injury.
 Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography effectively demonstrated the cricoarytenoid subluxation, which was confirmed by intraoperative electromyography (EMG) showing normal electrical activity in the thyroarytenoid muscle.
 Photographs from preoperative fiberoptic laryngoscopy are presented to identify the appearance of arytenoid subluxation.
 Computed tomographic findings and photographs from laryngoscopy of two patients with RLNP documented by intraoperative EMG evaluation are presented to help distinguish the clinical appearance of this disorder from arytenoid subluxation.
 An integrated approach to the diagnosis and treatment of arytenoid subluxation is presented.
