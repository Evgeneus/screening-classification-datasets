Gender influences subsite of origin of laryngeal carcinoma.
 The relationship of gender to laryngeal cancer is not well understood.
 We analyzed 688 laryngeal cancers diagnosed in Kansas from 1980 through 1989 for sex differences in subsite distribution (glottis, supraglottis, subglottis, and laryngeal cartilage) as well as survival, histologic grade, and age at diagnosis.
 The ratio of glottic to supraglottic tumors was 22.12:1 in men and 0.56:1 in women, a highly significant difference.
 Survival in glottic tumors was significantly better than in supraglottic tumors, but survival was not significantly better for women than it was for men.
 Glottic tumors were significantly more likely than were supraglottic tumors to be of low-grade malignancy for all subjects and for male subjects alone, but not for female subjects alone.
 Women were younger at time of diagnosis than were men, but not significantly so.
 Gender is an important factor in the genesis of laryngeal cancer.
