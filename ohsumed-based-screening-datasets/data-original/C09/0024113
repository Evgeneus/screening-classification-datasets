Intracordal Teflon injection: a question of timing.
 Intracordal Teflon injection is commonly performed for recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy.
 It is generally agreed that injection should not be performed for a period of six months from the onset of an 'idiopathic' paralysis.
 A case is presented in which recovery occurred late, after intracordal injection, with unfortunate results.
 Successful removal of the Teflon is described.
 The advisability of a longer wait before surgery for 'idiopathic' recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy is considered.
