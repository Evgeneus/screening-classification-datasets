Allergen-induced increase in nonspecific nasal reactivity is blocked by antihistamines without a clear-cut relationship to eosinophil influx.
 Antihistaminic compounds have been suggested to possess other properties besides H1-receptor antagonism.
 To evaluate whether two different antihistamines could inhibit local eosinophil infiltration and allergen-induced nonspecific nasal hyperreactivity, 15 subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis participated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study outside the pollen season.
 At steady-state levels of either 60 mg of terfenadine, twice daily, cetirizine, 10 mg once daily, or placebo, a nasal methacholine challenge was performed before and 24 hours after a nasal allergen challenge.
 The volume of the methacholine-induced nasal secretions was measured.
 The response to allergen was determined with a scoring technique.
 Cells from the nasal mucosal surface were harvested with the aid of a rhinobrush.
 Both antihistamines induced a similar (p less than 0.01) reduction in nasal symptoms after the allergen challenge compared with placebo.
 Both antihistamines inhibited the increased nonspecific nasal reactivity induced by methacholine 24 hours later (p less than 0.05).
 The allergen challenge induced an increase in surface eosinophils, which, however, appeared unaffected by any of the active treatments.
 Since histamine per se does not induce changes in nonspecific reactivity, we suggest that the antihistamines possess other properties besides being H1-receptor antagonists.
