Vocal quality of decannulated children following laryngeal reconstruction.
 Laryngotracheal reconstruction with expansion surgery is a reliable method for treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis in children.
 It allows for decannulation of the patient and restoration of vocal communication.
 Previous information regarding vocal quality in these patients has been scant.
 Sixteen children who underwent successful laryngotracheal reconstruction were evaluated using a standardized voice assessment during each of the following: phoneme prolongation, counting, storytelling, and spontaneous conversation.
 Interjudge ratings were obtained to establish reliability.
 The location and severity of the laryngotracheal stenosis and the method of treatment were reviewed.
 Twelve children have a functional voice compared to six preoperatively.
 Overall, vocal parameters suggested a particular pattern consisting of a lower than optimal pitch and a restricted pitch range.
 Laryngotracheal reconstruction does make oral communication possible for children who would otherwise have persistent tracheotomy.
 However, vocal quality appears to be disturbed in most of the patients.
