Needle aspiration and pressure sutures for auricular pseudocyst.
 Auricular pseudocyst is an asymptomatic cystic swelling of the upper portion of the auricle.
 Various therapeutic approaches have been employed with variable success.
 We report our results with nine patients treated by needle aspiration and bolstered pressure sutures applied over both aspects of the cyst for 1 week.
 Treatment resulted in complete resolution with no recurrence of the lesion in any of the patients.
 This procedure is simple, does not require an operating room setting, and is more comfortable and more acceptable aesthetically by the patient.
