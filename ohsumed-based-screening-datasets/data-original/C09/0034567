Detection of human papillomavirus in head and neck tumors with DNA hybridization and immunohistochemical analysis.
 The presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in oral, sinus, pharynx, and larynx lesions of Japanese patients was studied by Southern blot hybridization under less stringent (25% formamide, 42 degrees C) and stringent (50% formamide, 42 degrees C) conditions.
 Three samples from 10 benign tumors, and 3 of 30 malignant tumors, contained HPV DNA or HPV-related sequences.
 The HPV DNAs harbored in three laryngeal papillomas were HPV-11, -6, and -6 or -11, respectively.
 The HPV DNA and viral capsid antigens were easily detected by in situ hybridization, Western blotting, and peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining.
 However, neither the typical restriction pattern of HPV DNA nor viral antigen was identified in the malignant tumors, suggesting that subgenomic fragments remained integrated in the host cell DNA.
