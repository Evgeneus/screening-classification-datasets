Dehiscent temporomandibular joint.
 The appearance of an acute effusion in a well-pneumatized temporal bone directs attention to the nasopharynx and skull base.
 Two patients are described in whom dehiscence of the temporomandibular joint allowed herniation of the contents of the joint posteromedically, where they obstructed the middle ear entrance of the eustachian tube, the protympanum.
 This is, to the authors' knowledge, a previously unreported cause of an acute middle ear and mastoid effusion.
