A large-scale, office-based study evaluates the use of a new class of non-sedating antihistamines. A report from CEN 
 The two newest agents in the class of nonsedating antihistamines were studied in a wide variety of family practice patients.
 In a Phase IV, prospective, alternating sequence, open-label design, patients having allergic rhinitis (AR) were assigned to receive either astemizole (n = 659) or terfenadine (n = 639).
 The resultant treatment groups, typical of family practices, were comparable for demographics, signs and symptoms of allergic rhinitis, and clinical profile.
 The groups differed in that astemizole patients had a longer history of AR and a higher frequency of family history of AR.
 Patients who were treated for 3 to 8 weeks were grouped for analyses.
 The frequency and severity of the signs and symptoms of AR and patient complaints decreased markedly in both groups.
 Self-reported improvement in quality of life based on nine measures was the same for each group.
 No differences were seen between treatments when positive-rated outcomes were combined in the final overall assessment by physicians and patients.
 In rating the success of therapy, physicians' ratings of "excellent" and patients' ratings of "felt much better" were reported more frequently (P less than 0.05) for astemizole, while physicians' ratings of "good" and patients' ratings of "better" were reported more frequently (P less than 0.05) for terfenadine.
