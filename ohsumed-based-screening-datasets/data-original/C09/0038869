Spontaneous regression of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.
 This report describes the spontaneous regression of a biopsy-proved juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma that was first diagnosed when the child was age 11 years.
 The patient was followed up over a 12-year period during which he did not receive any therapy.
 Total involution of this lesion can be demonstrated by serial computed tomographic studies.
 Our report supports the theory of hormonal influence on this group of tumors and the possibility of spontaneous involution.
