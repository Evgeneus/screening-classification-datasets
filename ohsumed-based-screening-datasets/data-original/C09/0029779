Carcinoma of the larynx. Changing incidence in women.
 Laryngeal carcinoma has classically been considered a disease of men with a history of tobacco and alcohol abuse.
 Substantial increases in the incidence of laryngeal carcinoma have occurred among both men and women from 1947 through 1984.
 In men, the incidence has increased from 5.6 to 9.0 per 100,000 population and in women, from 0.5 to 1.5 per 100,000 population.
 We recently encountered three consecutive cases of laryngeal carcinoma in women at the Ben Taub General Hospital, Houston, Tex, diagnosed and treated over a 3-month period.
 Each woman had a long history of cigarette smoking, and two also had a history of alcohol abuse.
 These consecutive presentations of laryngeal carcinomas in women prompted us to examine our Cancer Registry Files from 1959 through 1973 and 1974 through 1988.
 Over these two 15-year periods, the male-to-female ratio declined from 5.6:1 to 4.5:1, reflecting a greater incidence among women.
