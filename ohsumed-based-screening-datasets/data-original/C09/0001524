Imaging of pharyngeal and laryngeal carcinomas with indium-111-labeled monoclonal anti-CEA antibodies.
 Localization of primary tumors, metastases, or recurrences in 13 consecutive patients with histological verification of squamous cell or adenocarcinoma was made with radioimmunodetection using monoclonal radiolabeled anti-CEA antibody.
 All surgical specimens stained immunohistochemically, except one, were positive for CEA.
 Of the known 19 tumor sites 17 were visualized in antibody scans.
 There were two positive findings that did not prove to be positive during 12 month follow-up.
 The scintigram findings did not correlate with CEA serum concentrations that, with one exception, were normal in all patients.
