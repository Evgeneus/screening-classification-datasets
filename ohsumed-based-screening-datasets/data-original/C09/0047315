Capnography for detection of endobronchial migration of an endotracheal tube.
 A patient is described in whom migration of an endotracheal tube into the right main bronchus was suspected when end-tidal carbon dioxide suddenly decreased from 28 to 22 mm Hg.
 Acute changes with migration of the endotracheal tube into the main bronchus were also studied in an animal experimental model.
 End-tidal carbon dioxide decreased and tracheal (inflation) pressure increased, with no change in tidal volume.
 Arterial blood gases showed time-dependent decreases in pH and oxygen tension and an increase in carbon dioxide tension.
