The inferiorly based superior tympanomeatal flap for removal of congenital cholesteatoma.
 We believe that the IB-STMF is preferable to the P-TMF for removal of a congenital cholesteatoma from the anterior superior portion of the mesotympanum.
 Though developing an IB-STMF may require extra time and special care to avoid tearing the flap, the exposure that is achieved affords the best chance for complete removal of the mass, thus decreasing the chance for persistence or recurrence of the lesion.
