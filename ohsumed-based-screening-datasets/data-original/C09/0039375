Wide vertical hemipharyngolaryngectomy with immediate glottic and pharyngeal reconstruction using a radial forearm free flap: preliminary results.
 We propose a new technique of wide vertical hemipharyngolaryngectomy which combines resection of laterally localized extended pharyngolaryngeal tumors with immediate microsurgical reconstruction using a radial forearm free flap, including the tendon of the palmaris longus.
 It eliminates the limitations of resections, which are usually performed to avoid closure difficulties of the resulting defect.
 In addition, the new technique avoids the use of tumor-neighboring structures for closure, fulfilling the oncological principles of surgery performed in this region.
 Our preliminary results show good restored deglutition and phonation.
 Postoperative irradiation does not seem to affect these results.
