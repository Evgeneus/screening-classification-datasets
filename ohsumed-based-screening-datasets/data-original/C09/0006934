Lovastatin. Warfarin interaction.
 Two patients who developed hypoprothrombinemia and bleeding due to lovastatin-warfarin drug interaction are described.
 Because of the wider use of lovastatin and warfarin, heightened clinical awareness of this potentially serious interaction must be publicized.
 Therefore, prothrombin time should be monitored diligently when warfarin is prescribed to patients receiving lovastatin.
