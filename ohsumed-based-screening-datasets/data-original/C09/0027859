Treatment of 'vasomotor rhinitis' by the local application of silver nitrate.
 A series of 52 patients were closely assessed prospectively to determine the effectiveness, untoward effects and patient acceptance of a new method of treatment of 'vasomotor rhinitis' by silver nitrate application.
 The patient's age ranged from 11 to 50 years except one who was 58 years old.
 The report describes the technique used and results obtained following the painting of the 'trigger area' of the nasal mucosa in patients with 'vasomotor rhinitis'.
 Each patient was evaluated regularly and the evaluation was based on both subjective response and clinical examination.
 Only cases who had rhinorrhoea and sneezing as presenting symptoms were selected.
 Silver nitrate (20 per cent) was used after topical anaesthesia, and patients received four applications.
 Successful relief was obtained in 88.5 per cent (53.0 per cent good relief; 34.6 per cent acceptable relief), while 11.5 per cent of the cases (6 out of 52 cases) had poor relief.
 No complication was seen among the patients during treatment and follow-up and no silver poisoning was detected.
