Three-dimensional reconstructed MR imaging of the inner ear.
 The three-dimensional Fourier transform fast imaging with steady precession (FISP) technique was used to obtain high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images of the temporal bone region and to generate three-dimensional reconstructed images of the inner ear.
 The three-dimensional reconstructed images of the inner ear were directly synthesized from two-dimensional images of the temporal bone region by means of an external processing computer.
 With use of three-dimensional reconstructed images and stereoscopic observations, structures inside the temporal bone region and the positional relationship among them were easily recognized.
 These structures are difficult to demonstrate with two-dimensional images.
 This three-dimensional method was also shown to be useful for recognition of disease and anatomic malformations in the temporal bone region.
