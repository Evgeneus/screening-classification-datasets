Long-term results of revision endolymphatic sac surgery.
 The results of revision endolymphatic sac surgery on 30 patients with unilateral Meniere's disease are presented.
 Good control is achieved in 73.3 per cent of cases at six months, falling to 56.7 per cent at one year and only 33.3 per cent by four years.
 The long-term results are disappointing but are more favourable if the initial surgery was successful, if the hearing remains fluctuant and improves on glycerol dehydration prior to the revision procedure and also if the sac is intubated.
 The current place of endolymphatic sac surgery is discussed and revision surgery only recommended for carefully selected cases.
