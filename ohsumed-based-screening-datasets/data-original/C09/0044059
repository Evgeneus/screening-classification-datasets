Oral vaccine therapy for pneumococcal otitis media in an animal model.
 We investigated whether mucosal IgA response in the middle ear cavity against Streptococcus pneumoniae type 19F is enhanced by use of enteric capsules, and whether the resulting mucosal immunity can prevent pneumococcal otitis media.
 Adult Hartley guinea pigs were employed.
 With intratympanic inoculation of 10(5) and 10(6) live S pneumoniae, the occurrence of pneumococcal otitis media significantly decreased in guinea pigs that received intraduodenal and intragastric immunization by enteric capsules.
 In these guinea pigs, the values of salivary IgA antibody titers against S pneumoniae were significantly greater, and histologic changes of the middle ear mucosa were also slighter than those of control guinea pigs.
 These findings indicate that oral vaccination by enteric capsules elicits mucosal IgA responses, as well as intraduodenal immunization, to prevent pneumococcal otitis media.
 These results suggest the possibility of clinical application of oral vaccination by enteric capsules for the prevention of middle ear infection.
