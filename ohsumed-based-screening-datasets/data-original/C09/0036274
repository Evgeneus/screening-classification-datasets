The pathophysiology of rhinitis. V. Sources of protein in allergen-induced nasal secretions.
 Allergic rhinitis is characterized by a profuse rhinorrhea in addition to paroxysms of sneezing, nasal congestion, and pruritus.
 To define better the sources of nasal secretion produced during rhinitis, nasal allergen challenges were performed on nine atopic subjects with seasonal rhinitis.
 A single dose of allergen was sprayed into one side of the nose, and nasal lavages were collected bilaterally for 7 hours.
 Nasal lavages were assayed for protein (total protein, albumin, lactoferrin, and lysozyme) and mediator (histamine and prostaglandin D2) content.
 Protein concentrations increased and remained elevated above baseline levels in both ipsilateral and contralateral secretions for up to 3 hours after allergen challenge.
 The proportion of albumin relative to total protein (the albumin percent) increased on the ipsilateral side, whereas the relative proportions of lactoferrin and lysozyme (the lactoferrin percent and lysozyme percent) increased on the contralateral side.
 Prostaglandin D2, but not histamine, increased selectively on the ipsilateral side.
 These data suggest that the ipsilateral protein secretory response is due to allergen-induced mast cell mediator release causing increased vascular permeability, whereas the contralateral protein secretory response is primarily a reflex-induced glandular secretion.
