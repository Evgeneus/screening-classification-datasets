Lymphadenosis benigna cutis resulting from Borrelia infection (Borrelia lymphocytoma).
 Swelling and erythema of the right pinna developed in a 7-year-old girl.
 Six months later a biopsy specimen showed a dense, diffuse lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate involving most of the dermis except for a thin Grenz zone.
 The appearance was consistent with lymphocytoma cutis.
 She had been bitten by a tick on the right ear in Switzerland 6 weeks before the onset of the lesion.
 Serologic tests by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Borrelia burgdorferi, done 6 and 11 months after the bite, yielded optical density readings of 1.04 and 0.65, respectively; indirect immunofluorescence yielded titers of 1:256 and 1:128.
 A Borrelia-like organism was identified by a modified Steiner stain; immunohistochemistry was noncontributory.
 The spirochetal origin of lymphadenosis benigna cutis is briefly reviewed.
