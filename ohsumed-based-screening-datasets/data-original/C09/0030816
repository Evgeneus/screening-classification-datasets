Prospective study of the complications of endoscopic laryngeal surgery.
 Patients undergoing 204 endoscopic laryngeal operations were studied prospectively to determine the incidence of complications.
 Twelve patients were considered to be at high risk of postoperative airway obstruction.
 Two of these patients had an elective tracheostomy.
 One required temporary reintubation in the recovery room.
 No case of respiratory obstruction occurred in a patient not considered to be in the high risk group.
 Mucosal haemorrhage or oedema was seen on postoperative indirect laryngoscopy in 31 per cent of patients.
 The commonest abnormality found was mucosal haemorrhage in the oropharynx.
