Arytenoidectomy and posterior cordectomy for bilateral abductor paralysis.
 Twelve patients with bilateral fixed vocal cords seeking decannulation of their tracheostomies were subjected to endoscopic correction of the compromised airway.
 They all had arytenoidectomy associated with posterior cordectomy whether as a primary or secondary stage procedure.
 Decannulation was achieved in all patients using the technique described.
