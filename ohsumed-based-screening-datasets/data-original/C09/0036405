Primary treatment of cancer of the larynx.
 Analysis of 3,445 cases of cancer of the larynx with a follow-up of 99.8 per cent shows that over a period in which the survival has improved neither the modality of the treatment nor the severity of the cancer has changed.
 Improved survival may be due to socioeconomic factors or an improvement in the quality of treatment.
