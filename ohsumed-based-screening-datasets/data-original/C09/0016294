Management decisions in laryngeal carcinoma in situ.
 Twenty-one patients with laryngeal carcinoma in situ (n = 12) or carcinoma in situ with microinvasion (n = 9) were treated with laser mucosal dissection of the vocal cords and/or superficial laser cordectomy.
 The normal architecture of the vocal cords was preserved because the depth of vaporization was usually superficial in these early cases.
 Five patients had recurrence, new tumor, or persistence of abnormal tissue that required additional laser surgical treatments.
 With a follow-up range of 6 months to 4 years, all patients currently are free of laryngeal abnormality, and no patient has needed open laryngeal surgery or radiation therapy.
 Transoral endoscopic laser resection of laryngeal carcinoma in situ with or without microinvasion should be the treatment of choice for these early lesions.
