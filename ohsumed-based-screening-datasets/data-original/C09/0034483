Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage in patients with rhinosinusitis.
 Toxic shock syndrome has been associated with rhinologic surgery and medical devices, and it has been linked to a circulating exotoxin of a toxogenic strain of Staphylococcus aureus.
 One hundred forty patients with rhinosinusitis were studied.
 Nasal cultures were obtained.
 The microbiological characteristics are described.
 The carrier rate for Staphylococcus aureus was 35%.
 Thirty percent of patients selected for surgery were Staphylococcus aureus carriers.
 Toxin-capable isolates were identified in 40% of those tested.
 Users of cocaine, topical decongestants, and steroid sprays had a statistically higher rate of Staphylococcus aureus carriage compared to nonusers.
 It is hoped that by identifying the population at risk and defining the factors associated with the development of toxic shock syndrome, a cogent policy of prevention can be established.
