Differences in clinical and immunologic reactivity of patients allergic to grass pollens and to multiple-pollen species. II. Efficacy of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, specific immunotherapy with standardized extracts.
 The IgE response of patients only allergic to grass pollens differs from response of patients allergic to multiple-pollen species.
 The IgE immunoblots to orchard-grass pollens confirmed that polysensitized patients had more proteins revealed than patients only allergic to grass pollens.
 To determine if both groups of patients present a different response toward specific immunotherapy (IT), a double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in 70 patients.
 Patients receiving the active treatment had a rush IT with either a standardized orchard grass-pollen extract or with a standardized mixed-pollen extract prepared, depending on the sensitivity of the patients.
 The maintenance dose was defined as that dose effective in grass-pollen IT in previous experiments.
 The same equipotent maintenance dose was administered for all pollen species.
 Symptom-medication scores during the pollen season and nasal challenge with orchard grass-pollen grains demonstrated that grass pollen-allergic patients had a significantly improved efficacy by comparison to placebo treatment, whereas polysensitized patients had a nonsignificant improvement.
 Serum grass-pollen IgG was significantly increased after IT in both treated groups.
 This study demonstrate that the response toward specific IT differs in patients only allergic to grass pollens by comparison to polysensitized patients.
