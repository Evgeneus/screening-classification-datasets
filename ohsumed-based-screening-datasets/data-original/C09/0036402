Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the tonsil: an immunohistochemical study.
 Twenty-one patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving the palatine tonsil were studied in an attempt to relate pathological data to clinical outcome.
 Eleven tumours were classified as low-grade and ten as high-grade on morphological criteria.
 The results of immunohistochemical investigations are presented; all tumours but one were of B-cell origin.
 None of the pathological factors studied were found to be useful prognostic indicators.
