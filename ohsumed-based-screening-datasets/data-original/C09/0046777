The dizzy patient: etiologic treatment.
 The basis for the vestibular complaint in dizzy patients should be viewed as having an etiology rather than a description of its clinical presentation.
 Effective treatment of vestibular disorders is based on the stabilization of the vestibular abnormality, to allow for central vestibular compensation.
 While not all of the etiologies for dizziness have been described, there are effective etiologic treatments available.
 These fit into categories of neurotransmitters, blood sugar and blood fat control, hormones, minerals, and treatments for autoimmune dizziness.
