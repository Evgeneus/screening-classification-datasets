Second primary tumours of the larynx following bronchial carcinoma.
 The occurrence of multiple primary malignancies in patients with laryngeal cancer is well known.
 The possibility that lung cancer patients may be at risk of subsequent laryngeal cancer is less well recognized.
 The possibility of laryngeal cancer developing later has implications for the follow-up of lung cancer patients.
 Three cases of subsequent laryngeal primary cancer occurring in survivors of bronchial cancer are presented and the implications are discussed.
