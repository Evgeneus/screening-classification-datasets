Radiographically confirmed cochlear otospongiosis among the Chinese.
 A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) study on 55 patients with surgically confirmed clinical otosclerosis confirms the existence of cochlear otospongiosis among the Chinese.
 Positive radiographic results of cochlear otospongiosis (13 ears, 12%) were found in patients with mixed-type deafness but in none with conductive hearing loss.
 Although there is a positive correlation between audiologic and radiographic findings, the HRCT results showed a lower positive rate and less severity than anticipated from the audiologic results.
 However, compared with the occurrence and extension of radiographic findings in similar studies of white people, it would seem to support our previous contention that the disease is indeed milder in Chinese people.
 Cochlear otospongiosis with extensive labyrinthine demineralization was found in three young patients with rapidly progressive hearing loss.
 This is important evidence of the overlooked fact that cochlear otospongiosis may also be one of the causes of sensorineural hearing loss in the Chinese.
 Thus, a high index of suspicion of the existence of this inner ear disorder is of paramount importance, and in such cases an HRCT study should be performed and sodium fluoride given to prevent further hearing deterioration.
