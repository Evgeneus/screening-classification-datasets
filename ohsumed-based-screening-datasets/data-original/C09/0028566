Extracapsular spread of squamous cell carcinoma in neck lymph nodes: prognostic factor of laryngeal cancer.
 Fifty-two patients with laryngeal cancer who underwent radical neck dissections were studied to provide further information on the prognosis of various clinical and histopathological parameters.
 Extracapsular spread (ECS) was found in 31% of patients with N1 nodes, and in 60% of patients with histopathologically positive nodes.
 The 5-year survival rate of histopathological findings was as follows: patients with no pathological evidence of neck metastasis (81%), patients with neck metastasis confined to the lymph node (no ECS) (76%), and patients with ECS (17%).
 The difference in survival rate between patients with no ECS and patients with ECS was statistically significant (P = .001).
 Staging classification, T-stage classification, the number of malignant nodes, the diameter of malignant nodes, and combined therapy had no prognostic importance.
 The most significant factor was the presence of extracapsular spread.
