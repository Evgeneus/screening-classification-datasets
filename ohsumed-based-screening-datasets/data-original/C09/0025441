Neonatal and pediatric microsubglottiscope set.
 A microsubglottiscope for infants and children has been developed for microlaryngeal surgery in the glottic and subglottic regions of the larynx.
 The universal handle allows selection of several sizes of blades to be used according to the patient's anatomic limitations.
 The tips of these blades have been designed specifically to give exposure to the subglottis and upper trachea under microscopic magnification.
 A needle adapter for jet ventilation has been included.
 The authors have used this instrument in young infants and children for diagnosis and for laser resection of subglottic stenosis, hemangioma, and suprastomal granuloma, and have found the exposure to be superior to that obtained with conventional microlaryngoscopes.
