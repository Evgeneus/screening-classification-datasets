Surgical treatment of chronic otitis media and Meniere's syndrome.
 Meniere's symptom-complex in conjunction with chronic otitis media (COM) has occasionally been encountered in otologic practice.
 This study compares the effects of various surgical techniques on patients with COM and Meniere's syndrome, primarily on incapacitating vertigo.
 One group of patients with incapacitating vertigo received endolymphatic system drainage procedures, either endolymphatic sac surgery (83 patients) or cochleosacculotomy (12 patients) simultaneously with surgery for COM.
 Another group (14 patients) had surgery for COM only.
 A comparison of the results for vertigo control between the two approaches indicates a significant difference in success rate in favor of endolymphatic system drainage procedures (80% versus 20%).
 COM is regarded as one of the causes of endolymphatic hydrops (EH).
 The results of this study seem to indicate both 1.
 the likelihood of the cause-and-effect relationship between COM and EH, and 2.
 the effectiveness of endolymphatic shunting procedures on control of incapacitating vertigo, thus supporting the contentions of other authors with regard to pathogenesis and sac enhancement in patients with COM and Meniere's syndrome.
