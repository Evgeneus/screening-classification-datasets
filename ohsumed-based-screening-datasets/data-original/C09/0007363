Allograft tympanoplasty: predictive value of preoperative status.
 The functional and anatomical results of a series of 181 consecutive allograft tympanoplasties for ears with drum perforation and an intact ossicular chain were retrospectively reviewed and related to preoperative factors.
 Drum closure was realized in 92% (166 of 181 cases evaluated 1 year after surgery), and 96.6% of the reconstructed drums were still intact 3 years after surgery (118 cases evaluated).
 An air-bone gap of less than 21 dB was reached in 79.6% (of a total of 162 cases) 1 year after surgery, and in 78% (of a total of 118 cases) 3 years after surgery.
 Age, contralateral pathology, the wet or dry status of the ear preoperatively, and the preoperative air-bone gap had no influence on anatomical results.
 The preoperative air-bone gap did not predict the postoperative air-bone gap.
 The influence of age and existence of contralateral pathology on hearing gain was only visible in some of the strictly defined patient groups.
 The wet preoperative status of the ear generally predicted lower functional gain.
