Basic principles and clinical applications of tympanometry.
 This article presents an overview of tympanometric measures using a 226-Hz probe tone, with an additional focus on complex admittance measures at 678 Hz and an introduction to multiple frequency tympanometry.
 Basic principles underlying all admittance measures are presented.
 The clinical implementation and interpretation of tympanometry is discussed.
