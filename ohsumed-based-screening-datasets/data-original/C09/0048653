Skin grafting of the larynx.
 Skin grafting as a method of restoring the lumen in cases of laryngeal stenosis has been promoted and practiced in the past.
 Lately, little has been heard of the method.
 I have personally used skin grafting in almost every case of repair of acute injury or chronic stenosis of the larynx in the last several years.
 The rationale for grafting is (1) to cover any areas of epithelial loss or dehiscence during the healing period, (2) to reduce the chance of prolonged granulation and subsequent contracture, and (3) to serve as a logical material to use as the interface between a stent and the lumen of the larynx.
 This report discusses the use of skin grafting in 20 cases of severe acute injury or chronic stenosis.
 Other procedures needed to enhance the stenotic lumen are also described.
 In this series, 17 patients are decannulated, one wears a plug continually, and two did not or could not complete the recommended therapy.
 Among those completing therapy, 100% are either decannulated or wear a plug.
