Acetazolamide-responsive vestibulocerebellar syndrome: clinical and oculographic features.
 Five patients who presented with long-standing episodic vertigo had ocular motor signs localizing to the vestibulocerebellum.
 In each patient, the episodic vertigo was either abolished or markedly decreased in frequency and severity with acetazolamide therapy.
 In 4, other family members had identical symptoms and signs.
 This syndrome is 1 of the few treatable causes of chronic episodic vertigo.
