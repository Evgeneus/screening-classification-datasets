Evaluation and management of stridor in the newborn.
 Stridor in a newborn should necessitate an immediate work-up to rule out a life-threatening airway obstruction.
 Three cases of newborns with stridor are presented.
 These cases emphasize the need for an immediate and thorough physical examination of any stridorous newborn, followed by radiologic studies and direct laryngoscopy.
 While other invasive procedures are frequently required for a precise diagnosis, a careful examination with special attention to the quality of the stridor often permits a more effective diagnostic approach in an atmosphere of appropriate urgency.
