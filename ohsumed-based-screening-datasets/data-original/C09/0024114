Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the larynx.
 Malignant fibrous histiocytomas of the upper respiratory tract are rare, aggressive mesenchymal neoplasms.
 We report a case of a glottic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the larynx on a 54 year old man.
 Only a few have been reported in the English literature.
 The clinical behaviour and degree of malignancy of these tumours cannot be predicted.
 Wide, aggressive excision of the tumour with a margin of normal tissue appears to be the treatment of choice.
 About two years after total laryngectomy the patient is well and free of disease.
