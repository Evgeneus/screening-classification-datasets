Effect of otitis media on infrared tympanic thermometry.
 This study was designed to determine if temperature readings using a new tympanic thermometer are affected by otitis media.
 These readings were also compared to a rectal or oral temperature.
 Eighty-four children with unilateral suppurative or non-suppurative otitis media diagnosed clinically by their pediatricians were enrolled in the study.
 Temperatures were measured in both ears using the Thermoscan PRO-1 Instant Thermometer and rectally or orally by a glass or electronic predictive thermometer.
 For 67 children with unilateral suppurative otitis media the mean temperature in infected ears was 0.38 degrees Fahrenheit higher than in uninfected ears (p = .005).
 Neither temperatures measured in affected nor those from unaffected ears differed significantly from oral or rectal control readings.
 For 17 children with unilateral non-suppurative otitis media there was no statistically significant difference between temperatures in affected and unaffected ears or between the temperatures in either ear and the oral or rectal control.
 Our data show that temperatures taken in ears with suppurative otitis media are slightly higher than those in normal ears.
 This difference is of minimal clinical significance and does not affect the accuracy when compared to oral or rectal control readings.
