Improved technique for a one-stage repair of significant defects of the ear.
 An improved technique for repair of severe acquired partial defects of the auricle in one stage is described.
 The common postauricular flap with its base on the margin of the auricular defect is usually unable to repair a severe partial auricular defect in one stage because of the limited length of the flap.
 The authors developed this technique by means of lengthening the flap with a piece of subcutaneous tissue of the scalp, so that the ear framework can be covered completely in one stage.
 All flaps in this group survived totally.
 Seven patients with severe acquired partial defects of the auricle underwent this procedure, and good results were obtained.
