Delayed hearing loss after surgery for acoustic neurinomas: clinical and electrophysiological observations.
 In a series of 26 patients with medium-sized and large acoustic neurinomas and documented hearing before surgery, 7 patients had preservation of hearing initially after the procedure but then developed delayed hearing loss.
 The most prominent intraoperative electrophysiological finding in these cases was a gradual deterioration of brain stem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP), especially of Wave V.
 Four additional patients with a similar gradual intraoperative loss of BAEP and severe postoperative hearing deterioration received vasoactive treatment after surgery (low-molecular weight dextran).
 In all 4 patients, including 1 patient with documented total deafness after surgery, hearing was preserved.
 Initial preservation of cochlear nerve function after the removal of an acoustic neurinoma does not guarantee postoperative hearing.
 Intraoperative BAEP help to identify patients at risk for delayed postoperative hearing loss.
 The pathophysiological mechanism can be attributed to disturbances of the microcirculation in endoneurial vasa nervorum caused by the mechanical manipulation of the cochlear nerve.
