The effects of phonosurgery on laryngeal vibration: Part I. Theoretic considerations.
 Surgical manipulation of the laryngeal framework (phonosurgery) is rapidly gaining interest and attention.
 To date, however, a comparative objective evaluation of the various phonosurgical techniques has not been reported.
 A theoretic model of the larynx, a four-mass model based on the work of Ishizaka (J Acoust Soc Am 1976;60:1193-8) and Koizumi et al.
 (J Acoust Soc Am 1987;82:1179-92), was developed and adapted to simulate laryngeal biomechanical behavior, as understood by current research.
 The model was then applied to a comparative evaluation of phonosurgical techniques.
 Input parameters that correlate laryngeal function and model simulation were developed.
 Surgical procedures were categorized according to their effect on these parameters.
 A model simulation of these techniques allowed comparison and prediction of the results of phonosurgery and a better understanding of the issues involved with surgical alteration of the voice.
