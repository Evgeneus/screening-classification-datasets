Prognostic factors in craniofacial surgery.
 From 1979 to 1989, 21 patients underwent craniofacial resection for malignancies involving the anterior skull base.
 Histologic types included 8 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 chondrosarcomas, 2 melanomas, 2 basal cell carcinomas, 2 adenocarcinomas, 2 poorly differentiated carcinomas, 1 malignant schwannoma, and 1 malignant hemangiopericytoma.
 Survival was 57%, with follow-up of 41 months.
 A 50% complication rate included osteomyelitis, cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, meningitis, brain abscess, epidural abscess, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone.
 Recurrent disease occurred in 9 patients (41%), the most reliable predictor being dural invasion indicated preoperatively by CT scan or at operation.
 Patients demonstrating dural involvement (N = 9) had a 22% survival rate, while patients without (N = 12) had a survival rate of 83%.
 The impact of dural invasion on long-term survival is emphasized.
 Though complications were frequent, long-term results were favorable.
