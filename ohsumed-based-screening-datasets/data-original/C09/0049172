Arachidonic acid metabolites in middle ear effusions of children.
 Middle ear effusions (MEEs) from 78 children (98 ears) with otitis media were examined for products of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, including leukotrienes B4, C4, D4, and E4 and prostaglandins D2 and E2, by high-performance liquid chromatography.
 Leukotrienes B4 and D4 were recovered most frequently: 59% and 54%, respectively.
 Leukotriene B4 was found in highest concentration, 1.29 +/- 3.46 ng/0.1 mL.
 The concentrations of leukotrienes B4 (p less than .03), (4 (p less than .01), and E4 (p less than .02) were significantly higher in culture-positive than in culture-negative MEEs.
 Neither the concentration nor the type of AA metabolite correlated with bacterial species isolated, chronicity of effusion, age of subject, or consistency of MEE.
 These data suggest that the AA metabolites are synthesized relatively frequently during otitis media of childhood.
 Leukotriene B4 is the most frequently detected AA metabolite in MEEs and is highly associated with the presence of viable bacteria.
