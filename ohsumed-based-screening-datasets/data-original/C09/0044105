Basaloid squamous carcinoma of the hypopharynx and larynx associated with second primary tumors.
 Basaloid squamous carcinoma is believed to be a histologically distinct variant of squamous cell carcinoma of the neck region with 11 cases reported.
 Two cases arising in the pyriform fossa and vallecula are reported, both of which were associated with second primary malignant tumors: esophageal small cell carcinoma and palatal squamous cell carcinoma, respectively.
 The authors suggest that basaloid squamous carcinoma may be associated with a high incidence of second primary tumors in the upper gastrointestinal tract or larynx.
