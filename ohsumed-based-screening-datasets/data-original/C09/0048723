Bacteriology of inadequately treated active chronic otitis media in paediatric age group.
 Haphazardly treated active otitis media was investigated bacteriologically in 214 children.
 Analysis showed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more prevalent than other micro-organisms.
 Candida was also found in appreciable quantity.
 The author contends that this was due to inadequate self treatment before these children reported in his hospital.
 He advocates that decision regarding the chemotherapeutic agent to be used should be based on culture and in vitro sensitivity.
