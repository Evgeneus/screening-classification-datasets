Resolution of otitis media with effusion with the use of a stepped treatment regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and prednisone.
 This double blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to determine whether intervention with a stepped regimen of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) and prednisone would prevent high risk children from developing chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) and recurrent acute otitis media.
 Forty-two children were enrolled, assigned to treatment with active drug or placebo and then examined at 2-week intervals.
 They received TMP-SMX (or placebo) during the first 2 weeks, TMP-SMX and prednisone (or placebo) during Weeks 3 and 4 for persistent OME and TMP-SMX (or placebo) for Weeks 5 and 6 if OME was still unresolved.
 After treatment 48% of active drug and 14% of placebo subjects resolved OME bilaterally (P less than 0.05).
 Active drug subjects also had fewer acute otitis media episodes than placebo subjects while receiving study treatment (P less than 0.01).
 Although this treatment regimen produced short term OME resolution, long term benefits were not demonstrated.
