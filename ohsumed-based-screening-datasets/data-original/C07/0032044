Benign fibro-osseous lesions in Paget's disease of the jaws.
 A clinicopathologic study of five patients with Paget's disease of the jaws is reported.
 All patients had well-documented cases of osteitis deformans with polyostotic involvement.
 Histologic studies of facial bones could be performed because surgery was necessary for either cosmetic or functional reasons.
 Three specimens consisted of maxillary bone, and two were mandibular.
 Microscopically, all cases showed multiple and irregular fibroproliferative lesions containing mineralized structures intermingled with bone characteristic of Paget's disease.
 The purpose of this article is to present these fibro-osseous lesions in relation to Paget's disease of the jaws and to emphasize their close resemblance to other benign fibro-osseous lesions of the jaws, especially cementifying and ossifying fibroma, and florid osseous dysplasia.
