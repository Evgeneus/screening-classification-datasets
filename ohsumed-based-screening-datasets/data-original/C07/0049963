Staple closure of the hypopharynx after diverticulectomy and total laryngectomy.
 The use of stapling devices to close hypopharyngeal defects was first published in 1969 but the technique does not seem to have gained much popularity among head and neck surgeons.
 Fifty-nine hypopharyngeal defects were closed using a linear stapler between January, 1984, and April, 1989, at the Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery of the University Hospital of Zurich.
 Twenty closures were performed following resection of hypopharyngeal diverticula, 39 following wide field laryngectomy.
 A total of 10 salivary fistulae was observed: 2 after diverticulectomy (10%), 3 after laryngectomy in nonirradiated patients (11%), and 5 after laryngectomy in irradiated patients (45%).
 These fistula rates are comparable with average rates quoted in the literature.
 Only after laryngectomy for radiation failure was the fistula rate unusually high.
 No other complications were seen that could have been attributed to this type of pharyngeal closure.
 Closure of a hypopharyngeal defect with a stapler is easier and faster than with traditional suture methods.
 Provided the patient has not been previously irradiated, staple closure of the hypopharynx appears to be as reliable as closure by standard techniques and can be safely recommended.
