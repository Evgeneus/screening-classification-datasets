Parotid gland and facial nerve trauma: a retrospective review.
 Included in this study are all patients with trauma to the parotid region seen at our center from 1979 to 1989.
 There was a total of five patients with injury to the parotid area: two patients with isolated facial nerve injury; one with isolated parotid duct injury; two with combined duct and nerve injury.
 There were four males and one female, with a mean age of 34 years (range, 16 to 62 years).
 The three patients with parotid duct injury required other procedures for associated trauma.
 A total of eight nerve branches were severed in four patients.
 Seven of the eight nerve branches (82.5%) were primarily repaired, with excellent functional results.
 Two of the three ductal injuries were repaired primarily over a stent, and one was ligated.
 No complications resulted from either treatment.
 Based on our clinical experience and review of the literature, we suggest that the treatment of parotid region injuries should include: 1) a complete initial assessment; 2) primary repair of parotid duct transection within 24 hours when possible; 3) primary repair of all facial nerve injuries, although delayed nerve repair remains a viable alternative; and 4) nonsurgical treatment of sialoceles and fistulae.
