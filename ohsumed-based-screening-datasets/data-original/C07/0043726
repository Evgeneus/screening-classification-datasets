Differences in salivary flow rates in elderly subjects using xerostomatic medications.
 Stimulated whole salivary flow rate (SWSFR) was measured in a group of elderly subjects who were examined for the use of xerostomia-inducing medications.
 SWSFR was significantly reduced in elderly subjects using one of these medications when compared with control subjects (0.94 vs 1.52 ml/min).
 Increasing use of up to four different xerostomia-inducing medications did not result in additional significant reduction of stimulated salivary flow rate.
 Psychotropic and diuretic agents were the most commonly used xerostomatic medications, and these were almost equally potent in reducing mean flow rate (0.79 vs 0.84 ml/min).
 The use of potentially xerostomatic medications did not affect decayed, missing, or filled surface scores or unstimulated whole saliva pH values.
 A weak, statistically significant, positive correlation (r = 0.39, p less than 0.01) was found between subject age and salivary flow rate in this population of elderly subjects, and this suggests that SWSRF is influenced more by factors such as medication than by aging.
