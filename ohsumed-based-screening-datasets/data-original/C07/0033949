Pharyngeal ulceration in AIDS patients secondary to cytomegalovirus infection.
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome are common and may present as retinitis, encephalitis, esophagitis, gastritis, enterocolitis, adrenalitis, or pneumonitis.
 Three patients are presented with pharyngeal ulcerations secondary to CMV.
 Similar cases have not been previously described in the literature.
 Symptoms, physical findings, and the treatment of this clinical entity are discussed.
 Although pharyngeal CMV ulcers are not life-threatening, they may herald multisystemic CMV infection that may require prompt antiviral chemotherapy.
