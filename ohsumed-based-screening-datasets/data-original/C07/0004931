The problem of the bifid mandibular condyle.
 In a survey of 1,882 prehistoric and historic skulls with 2,077 condyles, 7 double (bifid) mandibular condyles were found.
 One mandible with bilaterally bifid condyles is presented in detail.
 Possible causes and consequences of the anomaly are discussed.
 It is assumed that bifid mandibular condyles with anteroposteriorly situated heads are caused by early childhood fractures, whereas those with mediolaterally situated heads are caused by the persistence of connective tissue septa.
