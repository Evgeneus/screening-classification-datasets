Pedunculated soft-tissue mass on the alveolar gingiva [clinical conference]
 A case of peripheral ameloblastoma, a rare intraoral neoplasm, has been presented.
 The lesion appears most commonly as a mass on the mandibular lingual gingiva of patients in their fifth and sixth decades of life.
 The peripheral ameloblastoma does not share the aggressive nature of the intraosseous variant.
 The lesion has been overtreated in the past and warrants only a local supraperiosteal excision.
