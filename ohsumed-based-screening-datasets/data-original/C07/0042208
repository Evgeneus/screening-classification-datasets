Complex segregation analysis of nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate.
 This study was undertaken to examine the inheritance pattern of nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CL/P).
 Complex segregation analysis using the unified model as in POINTER and the regressive model as in REGD programs were applied to analyze a midwestern U.S.
 Caucasian population of 79 families ascertained through a proband with CL/F.
 In REGD, the dominant or codominant Mendelian major locus models of inheritance were the most parsimonious fit.
 In POINTER, besides the Mendelian major locus model, the multifactorial threshold (MF/T) model and the mixed model were also consistent with the observed data.
 However, the high heritability parameter of .93 (SD .063) in the MF/T model suggests that any random exogenous factors are unlikely to be the underlying mechanisms, and the mixed model indicates that this high heritability is accounted for by a major dominant locus component.
 These findings indicate that the best explanation for the etiology of CL/P in this study population is a putative major locus associated with markedly decreased penetrance.
 Molecular studies may provide further insight into the genetic mechanism underlying CL/P.
