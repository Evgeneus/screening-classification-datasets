Concurrent cisplatin, infusional fluorouracil, and conventionally fractionated radiation therapy in head and neck cancer: dose-limiting mucosal toxicity.
 After a preliminary dose-finding study involving 12 patients with advanced or locally recurrent head and neck cancer, 27 patients were treated on a phase II protocol, using fluorouracil 350 mg/m2/d by continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 5 days, followed on the sixth day by a 2-hour IV infusion of cisplatin 50 mg/m2, administered during the first and fourth weeks of radiation therapy to total doses between 60 and 64 Gy, using 2 Gy daily fractions.
 Eight of these 27 patients had American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging (AJCC) stage III disease, and 12 had stage IV disease.
 Four had recurrent disease after surgery.
 Three-year follow-up is now available.
 Twenty-one (77.8%) remitted completely following treatment, and 11 remain free of local and regional relapse at 3 years.
 Four have developed systemic metastases.
 Following successful salvage treatment in two cases, estimated determinate survival at 3 years is 64%.
 Acute toxicity was manageable with this regime.
 Eleven instances of grade 3 Radiation Therapy Oncology Group/European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (RTOG/EORTC) mucositis were observed, which caused interruptions to radiotherapy in only four cases.
 No late sequelae have so far been recorded.
 It is concluded that the protocol described is tolerable but probably did not cause a greater number of locoregional "cures" than would have been expected following conventional radiotherapy alone in this group of patients.
 The use of infusional fluorouracil with concurrent conventionally fractionated radiation therapy and cisplatin infusion results in mucositis that limits the dose of fluorouracil to levels that are probably subtherapeutic.
