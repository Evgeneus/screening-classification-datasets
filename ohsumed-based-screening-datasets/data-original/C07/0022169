Generalized pustular psoriasis in childhood. Report of thirteen cases.
 Generalized pustular psoriasis is rare in children.
 Less than 100 cases have been reported.
 We describe 13 children with this type of psoriasis.
 Seven had acute onset of widespread sterile pustules coalescing into lakes of pus with subsequent exfoliation (the Zumbusch pattern).
 This usually occurred in infancy and was difficult to control; recurrences developed several times per year.
 Three had the subacute benign annular pattern.
 They tended to be older and often had resolution within several years.
 Three had a mixed pattern with Zumbusch flares preceded by an annular or acral pattern.
 Most patients had an eruption preceding the generalized pustular psoriasis and often had precipitating factors.
 Generally, generalized pustular psoriasis has little serious chronic morbidity.
 The condition in most patients was well controlled with topical therapy.
 Systemic steroids were not helpful.
