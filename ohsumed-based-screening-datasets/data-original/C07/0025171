Low power laser biostimulation of chronic oro-facial pain. A double-blind placebo controlled cross-over study in 40 patients.
 The efficacy of low power laser stimulation in the treatment of chronic oro-facial pain conditions was investigated in a double-blind placebo controlled modified cross-over study in 40 patients.
 The laser was an invisible infrared (IR) diode laser with an emission at 904 nanometer (nm).
 Treatment effect was evaluated by means of VAS-scales and global assessment of pain.
 Outcome of treatment was correlated to changes in urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA).
 The clinical impression was that placebo was superior to laser stimulation.
 No statistically significant difference between the analgesic effect of the laser and placebo irradiation was found on VAS-scales.
 A significant (P = 0.05) increase in 5-HIAA excretion was found in the placebo group.
 It is concluded that the possibility of a substantial placebo response should be taken into consideration using 904 nm (IR) lasers for pain treatment in patients with this type of chronic oro-facial pain.
