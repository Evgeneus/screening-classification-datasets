Attitude variables of dentofacial deformity patients: demographic characteristics and associations.
 For patients to obtain satisfaction from surgical orthodontic treatment, a concordance needs to exist between the patients' concerns and expectations and the clinician's outcome measures of success.
 In this study, 231 patients 16 years or older were analyzed to define attributes of treatment that relate to patient satisfaction with outcome.
 The most prevalent patient concerns were related to facial and dental esthetics, and the effect of the dentofacial deformity on the quality of life was associated with a significantly higher motivation for surgical treatment.
