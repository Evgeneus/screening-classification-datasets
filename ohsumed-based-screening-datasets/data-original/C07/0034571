Acute pulpal-alveolar cellulitis syndrome V. Apical closure of immature teeth by infection control: case report and a possible microbial-immunologic etiology. Part 1.
 Das with Matusow and Goodall previously noted the rapid clinical apexogenesis of nonvital immature permanent teeth that are involved with an acute endodontic cellulitis.
 This apexogenesis was achieved by control of infection and by nonspecific intracanal medication without the use of calcium hydroxide.
 The case report confirms the clinical observations.
 The experimental canine endodontic cellulitis in a Cebus primate was induced as an immunologic pulp infection with a facultative Streptococcus species.
 The noted epithelial proliferation and organization into lacelike strands and bilaminar loops, similar to Hertwig's epithelial root sheath in root development, appear to be immunologic and genetic in origin, with an acceleration of the root maturation process.
