Periodontal disease and the family physician.
 Periodontal disease can be divided into two categories: gingivitis (inflammation of the soft tissue) and periodontitis (destruction of the alveolar bone).
 Swelling, erythema, bleeding and gingival recession are common signs of gingivitis.
 However, most patients with gingivitis are asymptomatic.
 When patients complain of tooth pain and mobility, they already have severe periodontal disease.
 Dental loss secondary to periodontal disease may result in inadequate mastication, impaired phonetics and loss of self-esteem.
 Patients should be counseled that good oral hygiene and regular dental examinations can prevent periodontal disease.
