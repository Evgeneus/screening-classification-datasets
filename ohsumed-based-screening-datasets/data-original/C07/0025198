Untreated cleft lip in an aged patient.
 An unusual case of unrepaired bilateral incomplete cleft lip in a 66-year-old female patient is presented.
 Since the cleft had been untreated for such a long time, the local anatomy was severely altered.
 For this reason, the situation was faced as an ordinary gap and was successfully repaired by advancement of the lateral segments of the lip and excision of the Burow triangles from the perialar region.
 Since there was no skeletal involvement, cephalometric findings were absent, so the interest of the case focuses on the age of the patient and the method of repair.
