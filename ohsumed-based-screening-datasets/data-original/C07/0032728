Apicectomy: a comparative clinical study of amalgam and glass ionomer cement as apical sealants.
 Healing capacity after apicectomy was investigated in a randomized clinical study of 105 teeth apically sealed with either amalgam or glass ionomer cement.
 The results were evaluated clinically and radiographically after 1 year.
 The success rate was high for both materials: 91% for amalgam and 89% for glass ionomer cement.
 Contamination with moisture and blood adversely affected the outcome for both materials and was significantly more frequent in unsuccessful cases.
