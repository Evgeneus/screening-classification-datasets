When a patient with a bleeding disorder needs dental work. How you can work with the dentist to prevent a crisis 
 Patients with bleeding disorders need close cooperation between their physician and their dental practitioner to receive safe, comprehensive dental care.
 When indicated, physicians must advise a compromised treatment plan to avoid deep injections or surgical procedures that may initiate a bleeding crisis in patients at risk.
 The conditions most commonly seen that require special consideration are long-term use of antithrombotic agents, platelet dysfunction caused by chronic renal failure, and congenital clotting factor deficiencies.
 Even these patients may undergo a high-risk procedure, such as periodontal surgery, with adequate precautions and preparation.
