The management of peritonsillar sepsis by needle aspiration.
 172 consecutive patients admitted with suspected unilateral peritonsillar sepsis were studied.
 Needle aspiration of the peritonsillar space was performed, and they were all then treated with intravenous antibiotics (usually benzylpenicillin).
 Any pus obtained was cultured.
 The aspiration was repeated if the patient was not improving after 24 h.
 A quantity of pus was aspirated at the first attempt from 91 patients (53%); 82 of these required no further aspiration but 7 required a further single aspiration and 2 required a further 2 aspirations before resolution of the sepsis.
 71 of the 81 patients (88%) from whom pus had not been aspirated, and who were therefore initially considered to have peritonsillar cellulitis, required no further aspirations.
 However, 6 subsequently drained pus spontaneously and 4 produced a positive aspirate on a second occasion.
 Four patients required a change in their antibiotic therapy.
 We have found the combination of needle aspiration and parenteral antibiotics to be an effective treatment of peritonsillar sepsis.
 All patients were spared the unpleasant and painful experience of an incision and drainage procedure.
