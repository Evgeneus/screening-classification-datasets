Apical closure of mature molar roots with the use of calcium hydroxide.
 Calcium hydroxide may induce apical root closure in affected mature teeth as well as in immature teeth.
 Once an apical hard tissue barrier is formed, a permanent root canal filling can be safely condensed.
 Two cases are described in which calcium hydroxide induced apical root closure in mature molar teeth where the apical constriction was lost because of chronic inflammatory process.
