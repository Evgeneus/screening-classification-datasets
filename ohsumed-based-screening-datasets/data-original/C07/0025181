Maxillary advancement for mandibular prognathism: indications and rationale.
 The surgical correction of mandibular prognathism has traditionally involved posterior repositioning of the mandibular body.
 This treatment approach corrects the skeletal disproportion at the expense of reducing facial skeletal volume and can unpredictably result in inadequately supported soft tissues with loss of skeletal definition.
 In an effort to avoid these sequelae of mandibular reduction, 18 patients diagnosed as having mandibular prognathism were treated with maxillary advancement surgery at the Le Fort I level.
 Mean patient SNB angle was 85.2 degrees, as compared with a normal 79 +/- 3 degrees.
 Maxillae were documented to be in normal position relative to both cranial base and Frankfort horizontal.
 The mean maxillary advancement was 6.9 mm, with a range of 4.5 to 8.8 mm.
 All patients required genioplasty to reduce vertical chin height and/or to laterally shift the chin.
 At the time of follow-up (mean 16.2 months), all patients retained cephalometric data suggestive of enlarged mandibles and excessive anterior facial divergence.
 However, maxillomandibular harmony and facial convexity had been restored without sacrificing skeletal volume.
 Treatment results demonstrated these faces to be skeletally well proportioned despite lower face protrusion that was beyond "normal." Postoperative appearances were characterized by a well-supported soft-tissue envelope and a highlighted skeletal foundation, creating angular, well-defined lower faces.
 These findings support the credibility of maxillary advancement as the procedure of choice in selected individuals with mandibular prognathism.
 Indications and an aesthetic rationale for this surgical approach are presented.
