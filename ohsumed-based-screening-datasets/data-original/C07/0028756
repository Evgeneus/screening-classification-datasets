Comparison of orthodox with fibreoptic orotracheal intubation under total i.v. anaesthesia.
 Fibreoptic orotracheal intubation was compared with orthodox laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation using a total i.v.
 technique with propofol in 60 ASA I and II patients.
 There was no significant difference between the two techniques in haemodynamic profile (before, during and following the intubation procedure) and incidence of postoperative sore throat.
 Minimal oxygen saturation was 96% during the study; maximal end-tidal PCO2 after intubation was 5.4 kPa.
 Intubation time was faster (P less than 0.01) in the orthodox group (30.7 (SEM 2.3) s) than in the fibreoptic group (52.7 (4.8) s).
