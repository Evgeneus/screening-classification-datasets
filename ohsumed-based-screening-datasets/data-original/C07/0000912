Proliferative mass found in the gingiva.
 The clinical course of peripheral ossifying fibroma is slow and the growth of most lesions is limited in size, usually up to 1.5 cm.
 Complaints are rare unless the surface becomes ulcerated, or the lesion compromises oral function or esthetic appearance.
 Treatment is surgical excision with close postoperative follow-up.
 Tooth extraction is seldom necessary.
 Proper surgical intervention, which includes excision of reactive tissue down to periosteum, affords a low recurrence rate of 14% to 16%.
