Study of human papillomavirus in oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma in the absence of tobacco and alcohol use.
 Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are implicated in the etiology of benign and malignant mucosal lesions in both human beings and animals.
 The oncogenic role of HPV in malignant cervical lesions is well supported by DNA hybridization techniques and epidemiologic studies.
 However, the role of HPV in oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma remains speculative.
 In this study the in situ hybridization technique was used to detect HPV genotypes 6 and 11; 16 and 18; and 31, 33, and 35 in tissue specimens from a study group consisting of 18 patients who were non-tobacco users, or non-tobacco and non-alcohol users, in whom oral epithelial dysplasia and epidermoid carcinoma developed.
 The hybridization findings were compared with those of a comparable control group of patients with similar lesions who had a history of tobacco and alcohol use.
 None of the study group cases was reactive with any of the DNA probes.
 Two cases of the control group showed positive hybridization with HPV DNA probe types 6/11 and 16/18.
 The implications of these findings are presented and discussed in an attempt to clarify the role of HPV in HPV-associated oral epidermoid carcinomas.
