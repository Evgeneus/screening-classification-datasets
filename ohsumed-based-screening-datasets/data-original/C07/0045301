Tissue plasminogen activator-associated lingual artery hemorrhage.
 Reported is the case of a patient with vertebrobasilar artery ischemia who received tissue plasminogen activator with resulting hemorrhage into the tongue and nearly exsanguinating hemorrhage from a branch of the lingual artery.
 Suggestions for immediate management of the hemorrhage as well as prevention are presented.
 As the use of thrombolytic agents increases and the list of their indications expands, unusual life-threatening hemorrhagic problems other than gastrointestinal or intracranial bleeding will be seen, and management decisions may be life saving.
