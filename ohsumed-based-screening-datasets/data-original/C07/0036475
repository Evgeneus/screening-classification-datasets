Sonography and scintigraphy in the diagnosis of diseases of the major salivary glands.
 This is a prospective study of 73 patients with diseases of the major salivary glands.
 The sonographic diagnosis could be confirmed by the course of the disease and/or the histologic result after operation in 67 (93%).
 In 29 patients, salivary gland scintigrams also were carried out.
 There was a tendency for signs of hypervascularization to be seen in patients with acute inflammation and reduction or loss of function in the presence of a chronic inflammation of the salivary glands.
 Scintigraphy did not provide diagnostic information on tumors of the salivary glands with regard to the type and location, with the exception of the Warthin's tumor.
 In selected cases it adds additional information, especially in functional therapy control.
