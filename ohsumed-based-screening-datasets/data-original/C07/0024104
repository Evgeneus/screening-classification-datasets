Long-term results of submandibular duct transposition for drooling.
 This study examines the long-term results and morbidity of submandibular duct transposition in drooling children.
 Twenty-two patients, aged 3 to 18 years, with neurological dysfunction and excessive drooling underwent submandibular duct transposition between 1984 and 1987.
 In January 1990, 20 patients were reviewed.
 Their degree of drooling pre-operatively, immediately post-operatively and currently was assessed.
 The rate of improvement and the occurrence of complications were noted.
 Drooling was 'much better' in the early post-operative period in 17 of the 20 patients, and this improvement was invariably noted within three weeks.
 In the three other patients drooling was 'better'.
 Deterioration occurred in only three patients over the entire follow-up period.
 Complications all occurred in the first 18 months following surgery; they consisted of salivary retention cysts in four and transient submandibular gland swelling in a fifth patient.
