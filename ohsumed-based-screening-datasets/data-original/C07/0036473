Management of oral submucous fibrosis: a conservative approach.
 Three hundred twenty-six patients with oral submucous fibrosis were divided into two groups and treated either with conventional submucosal injections of steroids and hyaluronidase, or with topical vitamin A, steroid applications, and oral iron preparations.
 The results were compared.
 The conventional treatment with injections was found to be hazardous, whereas the conservative treatment was found to be safe.
 Both treatments were purely palliative.
