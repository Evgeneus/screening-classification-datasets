Modified Le Fort I (maxillary-zygomatic) osteotomy: rationale, basis, and surgical technique.
 A modified version of the Le Fort I maxillary osteotomy is described.
 The esthetic and anatomic basis, the surgical technique, and possible complications are discussed and two representative cases are shown.
 This technique has been used to treat 38 patients with various degrees of combined maxillary-zygomatic deficiency in the last 3 years.
 Based on this experience, it is concluded that this procedure provides a predictable esthetic result and excellent skeletal stability with few intraoperative and postoperative complications.
 Furthermore, the need for simultaneous bone grafting or alloplastic implants, as in the conventional Le Fort I, is virtually eliminated using this osteotomy.
