How finishing affects glass ionomers. Results of a five-year evaluation.
 At least four cervical erosion/abrasion lesions were restored with glass ionomer materials in 30 patients.
 Some restorations were finished in 15 minutes, and some were finished 24 hours after placement.
 No significant differences were found after five years.
