Growth status of children treated for unilateral cleft lip and palate.
 Cephalometric distances, angles, and proportions were evaluated for 32 children 5 to 8 years of age treated for unilateral cleft lip and palate.
 The children were age and sex matched with untreated controls with normal skeletal relationships.
 The unilateral cleft lip and palate sample was treated by the same surgeon and orthodontist using the same techniques and appliances.
 Measures of overall facial proportions, facial convexity, and prognathism were not significantly different between the two groups.
 The primary group differences pertain to the posterior aspect of the maxilla, which is vertically short in the unilateral cleft lip and palate sample.
 Horizontally, the maxilla of the unilateral cleft lip and palate children was significantly longer, producing a steeper palatal plane.
 In addition, the zygoma and orbits of unilateral cleft lip and palate children were somewhat retruded; the posterior cranial base and total mandibular length also were longer in the unilateral cleft lip and palate children.
