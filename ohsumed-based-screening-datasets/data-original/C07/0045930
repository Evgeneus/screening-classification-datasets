Reduction of salivary flow with transdermal scopolamine: a four-year experience.
 Scopoderm transdermal therapeutic system (TTS) is applied to prevent nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness.
 Dry mouth is the most common side effect, appearing in up to two thirds of the patients treated.
 We have used this side effect to the benefit of patients with sialorrhea or with difficulties swallowing normally secreted amounts of saliva.
 More than 100 patients with tumors of the aerodigestive tract before and after surgery, and patients after parotidectomies, after tracheotomies, with peritonsillar abscesses, tonsillitis and pharyngitis, and neurologic disorders were thus treated.
 Reduced secretion of saliva was seen in 50% to 100% of the treatment groups.
 Other side effects were minimal and we recommend the use of scopoderm TTS for reduction of salivary flow.
