Identification and mapping to chromosome 1 of a susceptibility locus for periinsulitis in non-obese diabetic mice.
 Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) is a polygenic disease caused by autoimmune destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the islets of Langerhans.
 Its onset is preceded by a long and variable period in which lymphoid cells infiltrate the pancreas but first remain outside the islets (peri-insulitis) before invading them (insulitis).
 Among susceptibility loci, only the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) has been clearly assigned.
 Genetic study of the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse model for insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has revealed genetic linkage of insulitis and of early onset diabetes with two non-MHC loci mapping to chromosome 3 and 11 respectively.
 Here we report a close association of periinsulitis with a third non-MHC locus mapping to chromosome 1.
 Successive stages in the progression of diabetic disease thus appear to be controlled by distinct genes or sets of genes.
