Periodontium response to a root canal condensing device (Endotec).
 Two Macaca (fascicularis) monkeys were used to study the effect of two warm endodontic condensation techniques (Endotec and vertical condensation method) on periodontal tissues.
 The specimens were histologically evaluated at 3 and 32 days after the endodontic treatments were completed.
 In this study the periodontium was divided into coronal, middle, and apical thirds.
 Results indicated that there was no heat-related damage to periodontal tissues from either of the two methods employed.
 However, some Endotec specimens generated small, reactive inflammatory infiltrates that were restricted to the root canal opening or adjacent periodontal membrane.
 Similarly, some vertical condensation specimens developed periapical inflammatory processes as well, but they were more extensive and comprised the alveolar bone and marrow spaces.
