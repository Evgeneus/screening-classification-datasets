Contemporary management of a potentially lethal fetal anomaly: a successful perinatal approach to epignathus.
 Prenatal diagnosis of epignathus (a teratoma originating in the oropharynx) has been reported previously.
 However, in many of these cases the neonates succumbed to acute respiratory distress secondary to airway obstruction at the time of birth.
 We describe a case of antepartum diagnosis of epignathus using ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging as complementary techniques.
 The ability to accurately define the fetal anomaly permitted us to plan a unique strategy for peripartum management.
 After cesarean delivery of the infant from the uterus, the umbilical cord was not clamped and the fetoplacental circulation was left undisturbed.
 A tracheostomy was then performed, after which the umbilical cord was clamped and the infant was stabilized.
 Several hours later, a debulking procedure was performed in the operating room to remove the tumor from its attachment to the bony palate.
 Both mother and infant did well postoperatively.
 The ability to plan and perform a controlled tracheostomy while the infant remained oxygenated and ventilated proved to be lifesaving in this case.
