Intentional replantation: a successful alternative for hopeless teeth.
 An interesting case of intentional reimplantation, in which the distal root of a mandibular molar was reimplanted after hemisection, is reported for the first time.
 This root served as the distal abutment for a three-unit bridge.
 A 3-year follow-up revealed a successful outcome, with a clinically asymptomatic and functional tooth with no radiographic signs of resorption or ankylosis.
