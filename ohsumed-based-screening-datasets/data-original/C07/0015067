Asymptomatic periapical radiolucent lesion found in an area of previous trauma [published erratum appears in J Am Dent Assoc 1991 Feb;122(2):18]
 The case of an anterior mandibular radiolucent area, which unexpectedly yielded salivary gland tissue, is described.
 Salivary gland depressions in the posterior mandible are readily recognized because of their almost pathognomonic radiographic appearance.
 A salivary gland inclusion in the anterior mandible in the proximity of teeth may create a diagnostic dilemma where superimposed periapical pathosis is present.
 The clinical importance lies in the recognition and appropriate treatment of the lesion.
 For the anterior salivary gland inclusion, a biopsy and a microscopic examination provide the most reliable diagnosis.
