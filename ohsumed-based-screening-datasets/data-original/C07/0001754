The radiologic morphology of painful temporomandibular joints.
 A high frequency of remodeling changes was demonstrated radiographically in a series of patients having pain in the temporomandibular joint region.
 Radiologic morphologic differences between painful and asymptomatic temporomandibular joints were in frequency rather than type.
 Caution should be taken not to overestimate the significance of radiologic abnormality in patients with pain in the temporomandibular joint region.
