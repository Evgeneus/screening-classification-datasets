Antibiotic use in the treatment of non-streptococcal pharyngitis.
 Treatment of non-streptococcal pharyngitis (NSP) varies among physicians.
 Recent data regarding difficult-to-culture bacterial pathogens have increased interest in antibiotic treatment of NSP.
 This study examined physician behavior regarding antibiotic treatment of NSP in preparation for a prospective clinical trial.
 The records of 358 patients with pharyngitis-related diagnoses from a large private family physician practice and an urban hospital's housestaff clinic were reviewed.
 No significant relationship between the presence of streptococcus and the prescribing of antibiotics was found.
 Physicians gave antibiotics to 50% of patients with clinical signs and symptoms of pharyngitis.
 Many of these tested negative for streptococcus.
 Physicians used antibiotics effective against Mycoplasma and Chlamydia less than one half of the time.
 Projected costs of drug treatment for patients with NSP was $1,200.
 Family medicine educators are encouraged to monitor their own and their residents' antibiotic prescribing behaviors when treating common upper respiratory infections.
