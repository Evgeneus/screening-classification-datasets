Pulmonary oedema following relief of upper airway obstruction in the Pierre-Robin syndrome: a consequence of early palatal repair?
 Pulmonary oedema occurred following relief of an acute upper airway obstruction in an infant with Pierre-Robin syndrome undergoing cleft palate repair.
 We anticipate an increased prevalence of this phenomenon in view of the present trend for early palatal repair, and would advocate the routine use of a nasopharyngeal airway after operation in infants with severe micrognathia.
