Granulomatous sialadenitis.
 Granulomatous inflammation in salivary tissues is most often a response to liberated ductal contents, particularly mucin, in various degrees of obstructive sialadenopathy.
 Far less often is a granulomatous sialadenitis the result of specific infective granulomas or systemic granuloma-forming diseases.
 In these instances, the salivary parenchymal involvement is usually secondary to disease localization in regional lymph nodes.
