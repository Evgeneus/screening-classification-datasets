Hemorrhage following mandibular osteotomies: a report of 21 cases.
 Hemorrhage associated with mandibular osteotomies, especially to the extent that it becomes life threatening, is a rare occurrence and its risk is less than that following maxillary orthognathic surgery.
 Twenty-one cases of significant bleeding following mandibular sagittal split ramus osteotomies, vertical and oblique ramus osteotomies, and genioplasties are presented.
 Life-threatening hemorrhage associated with mandibular osteotomies is primarily an intraoperative problem and the incidence of major postoperative and recurrent hemorrhage is not as great as following maxillary osteotomies.
 Suggestions for the avoidance and treatment of these bleeding complications are discussed.
