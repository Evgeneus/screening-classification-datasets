Basaloid monomorphic adenomas.
 Monomorphic adenomas can be divided into basaloid and nonbasaloid type.
 With the exception of the canalicular adenoma, the basaloid monomorphic adenomas are preponderantly tumors of the major salivary glands, most often the parotid gland.
 The dermal analogue monomorphic adenomas, so named because of their histologic similarity to eccrine tumors of the skin, are a unique subset of the basaloid adenomas.
 They are often multifocal, recur frequently, may undergo malignant change, and can be part of a salivary-cutaneous tumor diathesis.
