Subacute necrotizing sialadenitis.
 Twelve cases of a heretofore unreported minor salivary gland disease have been reported.
 Although an infectious cause is suspected for this self-limiting inflammatory process, the actual cause remains unknown.
 It typically presents as a unilateral, erythematous, nonuclerated but painful, solitary firm swelling of the posterior hard palate.
 Patients are most often young white men who have spent several weeks in a new environment with a group of people living in close quarters such as military barracks.
