Further evaluation of radical surgery following radiotherapy for advanced parotid carcinoma.
 A series of 30 patients who have been treated for advanced carcinoma of the parotid gland using radiotherapy followed by radical surgery is presented.
 Three patients deteriorated during preoperative radiotherapy and remained unfit for surgery; the remaining 27 underwent radical parotidectomy with block dissection of the neck.
 Twelve patients received additional radiotherapy after operation.
 Of those patients undergoing surgery, three have been lost to follow-up, 17 have died and seven remain alive; the period of follow-up ranges from 3 to 133 months.
 Fourteen patients remained free of recurrent disease at death or when last seen, and six patients developed a local recurrence at a medium period of 10.5 (range 3-36) months after surgery.
 For all 30 patients, the cumulative proportion surviving for 5 years was 30 per cent.
