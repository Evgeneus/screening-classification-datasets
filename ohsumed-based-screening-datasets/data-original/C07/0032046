Ewing's sarcoma: metastatic tumor to the jaw.
 Metastatic tumors to the jaw are a rare occurrence.
 The incidence of metastatic Ewing's sarcoma to the jaw has been reported to be less than 2% of all cases of Ewing's sarcoma.
 Early detection of such lesions is difficult because the signs and symptoms do not appear until the lesion has progressed considerably.
 The treatment options are therefore limited to palliative care of the patient rather than cure.
 This article reports a case of Ewing's sarcoma that had metastasized to the mandible and reviews the literature.
