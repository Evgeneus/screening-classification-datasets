A rotational method of bilateral cleft lip nose repair.
 Repairs of the bilateral cleft lip nasal deformity have focused on lengthening the lower columella by adding lip, nasal structure, or a piece of ear.
 In these methods, the raised true columella worsens the dorsal dislocation of the lateral crura of the alar cartilages and the lateral and dorsal displacement of the alar domes.
 We believe that lengthening the upper columella from above is more anatomic and reasonable than lengthening the lower columella.
 A method for reconstructing the upper columella by medial and ventral rotation of the dislocated alar domes is described.
 Figi's "flying bird" incision was extended to the columellar base along the nostril margin.
 Through this incision, the lower one-third of the nose, including the alae and nostril floors, was undermined widely.
 The inner layers, the nostrils, were freed from the surrounding tissues, except in the region of the columella and the septum, and rotated medially in the opposite direction of Cronin's technique.
 The resulting nasal shape, involving the columellar length and the concavity between the nasal tip and lateral ala, improved in 11 patients.
