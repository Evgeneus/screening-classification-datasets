Effect of chitosan on lingual hemostasis in rabbits.
 Bleeding times were measured for bilateral (15 mm x 2 mm) tongue incisions in 14 New Zealand white rabbits.
 Using a randomized, blinded experimental design, one incision in each animal was treated with chitosan and the other was treated with control vehicle without chitosan.
 Extraoral bleeding and coagulation times were also measured for each animal preoperatively, postoperatively, and prior to killing to verify normal bleeding parameters and to evaluate possible systemic effects associated with topical application.
 Comparison of lingual incisions receiving the experimental substance versus those receiving control solution showed enhanced hemostasis manifested by a 32% (P less than .05) decrease in bleeding time.
