The vascularized fibula graft in mandibular reconstruction.
 The use of a vascularized graft from the fibula for mandibular reconstruction is presented.
 The great strength, pliability, and long vascular pedicle that characterize such grafts make them particularly suitable for this type of repair.
 The results in six cases were highly satisfactory.
 Masticatory function was well restored, without alteration of the facial contour, and with minimal sequelae at the donor site.
