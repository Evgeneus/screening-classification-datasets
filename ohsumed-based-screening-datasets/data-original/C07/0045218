Dental decay rates among children of migrant workers in Yakima, WA.
 The literature documents a significant decline in the prevalence of dental caries among children.
 Unfortunately, dental decay rates of children of migrant workers remain high.
 This study collected data from 885 migrant children in central Washington.
 This community is in the west coast migrant stream.
 The area is served by a health center funded through the community and migrant health center program.
 There is an active dental program provided through the health center.
 The children were found to have a high rate of dental decay.
 However, there was a high rate of treatment of this decay and a rate of sealants (a preventive measure) nearly three times the rate in the general population.
 Although dental decay remains a serious problem in the migrant community, the migrant health centers appear to be making a positive impact on the dental health of the children.
