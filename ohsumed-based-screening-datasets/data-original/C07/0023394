Pulpal response to tricalcium phosphate as a capping agent.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate tricalcium phosphate (TCP) as a pulp-capping agent.
 Two adult male beagle dogs were used for this investigation.
 Class I cavities were prepared in the posterior teeth and Class V cavities in the anterior teeth.
 With the use of a rubber dam and high speed with water coolant, minimal pulp exposures were created in both the experimental and control teeth, by means of a 1/2 round bur.
 Zinc oxide-eugenol was the temporary filling material used to restore all cavities.
 In each dog, five teeth served as control and were capped with the use of calcium hydroxide.
 In one dog, 10 teeth from two quadrants were capped with the tested material (TCP).
 In the other dog, 11 teeth were capped with TCP.
 Four teeth from the fourth quadrant in each dog were capped with a mixture of calcium hydroxide and TCP in a ratio of 1:1 by weight (50/50 group.) The two dogs were killed after 70 days.
 The histologic evaluation of the response to the capping agents and at the exposure site was recorded.
 A total of 39 teeth were evaluated in this study.
 It was found that TCP as a capping agent precipitated the highest mean inflammatory response and also demonstrated the highest percentage of reparative dentin formation.
