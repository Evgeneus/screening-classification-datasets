Generalized pustular psoriasis. A review of 63 cases.
 BACKGROUND--Sixty-three patients with generalized pustular psoriasis were hospitalized during a 29-year period.
 They were classified into four subgroups on the basis of onset and morphologic pattern of disease: acute (von Zumbusch), subacute annular, chronic (acral), and mixed.
 This division provides a better understanding of the variability of the disease and helps in choosing treatment.
 OBSERVATIONS--The average age at onset was 50 years; male and female patients were affected about equally.
 In 11 patients, flares were precipitated by localized infections.
 Approximately one fourth of the patients had complications; most were superinfections.
 The average stay in the hospital was 30 days; factors correlating with a long hospitalization were hypocalcemia, female sex, and a previous history of psoriasis vulgaris or pustular psoriasis.
 CONCLUSIONS--Whereas topical therapy was helpful, systemic medications were often needed.
 Coal tar, ultraviolet light, and psoralen-ultraviolet A may be effective; however, they must be used with caution, because they may exacerbate the disease.
