Tissue responses to degenerative changes in the temporomandibular joint: a review.
 The articular cartilage covering of the mandibular condyle and the articular eminence, as well as the tissue of the articular disc, may be affected by degenerative changes associated with osteoarthrosis.
 Degenerative changes of cartilage alter its physical properties and, as a result, affect its ability to withstand compressive and shearing stresses.
 Increased friction between the articular surfaces may impair joint movement and may elicit compensatory or pathologic responses of the cartilage and the adjacent tissues, such as capsule and ligaments, synovial membrane, subchondral bone, and associated musculature.
 In this review, these structural changes are described and related to common signs and symptoms of craniomandibular dysfunction, such as clicking, locking and instability, pain and tenderness, restricted ranges of mandibular motion, crepitation, deformity, muscle wasting, and changes of occlusion.
