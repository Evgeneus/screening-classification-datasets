Lack of impact of early antibiotic therapy for streptococcal pharyngitis on recurrence rates.
 To determine whether recurrence rates for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) pharyngitis are related to the time of initiation of antibiotic therapy, we randomly assigned 113 patients with GABHS pharyngitis either to a group that began a 10-day course of penicillin V at the time of diagnosis or to a group that began the same antibiotic regimen after a dealy of 48 hours.
 Follow-up throat culture specimens were obtained 4 days, 2 months, and 4 months after the completion of antibiotic therapy, as well as during any interim episodes of acute pharyngitis.
 Serotyping of all GABHS isolates was performed to distinguish between recurrences with homologous serotypes and new acquisitions with heterologous serotypes.
 There was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in age, gender, duration of illness before enrollment in the study, initial clinical presentation, or compliance.
 Of the 50 patients in the immediate-treatment group, 6 (12%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures.
 Of the 63 patients in the delayed-treatment group, 9 (14%) had homologous serotypes of GABHS isolated on one of the follow-up throat cultures.
 These data indicate that a 48-hour delay in the initiation of penicillin therapy for GABHS pharyngitis does not reduce the recurrence rate.
