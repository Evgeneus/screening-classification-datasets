Median lip fissure: etiology and suggested treatment.
 In a prospective study of 20 patients with median lip fissure, pedigrees were obtained.
 A hereditary predisposition for weakness in the first branchial arch fusion seems to exist.
 In some persons, more often in males than in females, this weakness eventually leads to development of a median lip fissure.
 The fissure becomes symptomatic when it is infected.
 In 10 patients the fissure was excised; in the other 10 patients excision was done in combination with a Z-plasty of the center of the lesion.
 The prognosis with the latter operation was superior to that with the former.
