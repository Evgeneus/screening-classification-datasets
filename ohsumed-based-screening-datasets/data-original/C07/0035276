Managing aphthous ulcers: laser treatment applied.
 The recurrent aphthous ulcer is a common oral ulcerative condition.
 Therapies are pharmaceutical in nature, remain palliative and do not alleviate pain.
 Carbon dioxide laser therapy was used to treat a minor form of the ulcer (canker sore); the laser therapy reduced or eliminated the pain and inflammation with normal wound healing.
