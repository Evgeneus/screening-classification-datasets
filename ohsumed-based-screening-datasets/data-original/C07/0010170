Pharynx: value of oblique projections for radiographic examination.
 The utility of oblique views for augmenting standard posteroanterior and lateral double-contrast radiography of the pharynx was examined.
 Over an 8-month period, two oblique views were added to the standard posteroanterior and lateral views of the pharynx during routine upper gastrointestinal studies in 102 patients divided into two groups.
 Group 1 consisted of 81 patients without suspected pharyngeal or esophageal disease who demonstrated what was considered to be normal anatomy on all radiographic views.
 Group 2 consisted of 21 patients who were known or suspected to have pathologic abnormality of the pharynx.
 The members of this latter group each demonstrated various abnormal pharyngeal anatomy on the standard views.
 In just over half of these cases the oblique projection contributed significant information not obtained with conventional views.
 Therefore, the authors conclude that oblique images are a beneficial addition to the diagnostic evaluation of patients highly suspected of having pharyngeal disease.
