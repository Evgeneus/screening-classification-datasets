Retrospective analysis of 135 secondary alveolar cleft grafts using iliac or calvarial bone.
 This retrospective study summarizes experience with 135 secondary alveolar cleft bone graft procedures over 8 years.
 The overall success rate was 83.7%.
 The group of patients (n = 108) that had particulate cancellous bone and marrow obtained from the iliac crest as donor bone had an 89.8% success rate.
 The group (n = 27) that had calvarial bone as the donor material had a success rate of only 63%.
 It is felt that inferior results with calvarial bone are probably related to the procurement technique.
 In both the iliac crest and calvarial groups, there was a trend toward declining success rates with advancing age of the patient.
 Morbidity associated with these procedures, consistent with other reported series, was low.
