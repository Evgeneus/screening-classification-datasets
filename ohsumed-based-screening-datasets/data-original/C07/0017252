Clinical and biologic effects of granulocyte colony stimulating factor in the treatment of myelokathexis.
 Successful treatment of a patient with myelokathexis, a rare form of chronic neutropenia associated with recurrent infections, is described.
 Rapid mobilization of bone marrow neutrophils and improved myeloid morphologic features were observed after treatment with human granulocyte colony stimulating factor.
 Transient thrombocytopenia and bone pain were observed during treatment.
 Although neutrophil chemotaxis, superoxide production, and FcRIII surface expression were reduced, the patient improved clinically after restoration of a normal neutrophil count.
