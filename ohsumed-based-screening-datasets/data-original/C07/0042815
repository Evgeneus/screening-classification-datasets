The effect of a chlorhexidine rinse on the incidence of alveolar osteitis following the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars.
 A prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was conducted with 139 patients (278 bilaterally impacted mandibular third molars) to determine the effect of a perioperative 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate rinse on the incidence of alveolar osteitis following surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars.
 A statistically significant 60% reduction in the incidence of alveolar osteitis was obtained in the chlorhexidine group compared with the placebo group.
 In most subgroups analyzed, chlorhexidine was associated with at least a 50% reduction in alveolar osteitis compared with control groups.
