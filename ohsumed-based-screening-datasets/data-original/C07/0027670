The role of definitive radiation therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the oral tongue.
 Between 1968 and 1985, 114 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue were evaluated in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Virginia (Charlottesville, VA); of these, 86 received treatment with curative intent.
 The majority were treated with radiation therapy alone, whereas the remainder were treated with radiation therapy with preoperative or postoperative surgery.
 There were 17 T1 primary malignancies, 40 T2, 27 T3, and 2 T4.
 Clinically positive adenopathy was present in 48% of the patients overall and ranged from 35% in the T1 group to 100% in the T4 group.
 Twenty-six percent of patients either presented with or later had second malignancies.
 At 36 months, the patient status was evaluated as dead of disease (37%), dead of intercurrent disease (23%), alive with disease (1%), and alive without evidence of disease (38%).
 Seventy-five patients received external beam therapy and 32 patients received an implant as either all or part of their treatment.
 Average doses were in the range of 6000 Gy.
 Adjusted local control rate at 3 years was not statistically different for different treatment techniques used on either T1 or T2 primary malignancies.
 The rates were 89% versus 88% for T1 lesions treated with definitive radiation therapy versus postoperative radiation therapy.
 For T2 primary malignancies, the rates were 67%, 71%, and 83% for the definitive, preoperative, and postoperative radiation therapy groups, respectively.
 For T3 lesions, there was close to statistical significance with the corresponding rates being 47%, 50%, and 100%, respectively.
 When the effect of implants was examined for T1 and T2 lesions, no difference in local control rate at 3 years was noticed with or without an implant.
 Survival was improved for the group presenting with positive neck disease when compared with the N0 group.
 The external beam severe complication rate was less than 5%, and the implant complication rate was 6%.
