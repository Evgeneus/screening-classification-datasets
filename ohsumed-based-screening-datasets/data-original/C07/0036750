Pathophysiology of cleft lip muscles following the initial surgical repair.
 Muscle biopsy specimens taken from the upper lip and perialar area during the time of secondary lip revision and studied by histochemical techniques demonstrate persistent connective-tissue and muscle abnormalities even at a distance from the cleft margins.
 Some of these changes are consistent with surgically induced denervation-reinnervation of muscle groups in the surgical field.
 Increased amounts of connective tissue also were found, most likely secondary to the original deformity and the subsequent surgical procedures.
 Both these changes may be important factors in subsequent abnormal growth and development of the underlying midfacial structures.
 This study also demonstrated the resolution of previously noted mitochondrial abnormalities found in the primary cleft lip patient.
