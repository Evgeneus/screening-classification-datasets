Is a single quinsy an indication for tonsillectomy?
 There has recently been some discussion on whether a single quinsy is an indication for tonsillectomy.
 This paper presents a retrospective study of 36 patients who presented with a quinsy over the past 37 years but did not have interval tonsillectomy.
 Prolonged follow-up shows that the rate of recurrence of a quinsy can double compared to the recurrence rate under 5 years.
 Despite this it remains relatively low and an uncomplicated quinsy does not warrant tonsillectomy.
