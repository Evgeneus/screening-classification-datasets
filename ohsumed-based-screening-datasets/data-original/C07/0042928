Oral habits. A behavioral approach.
 Thumb-sucking, pacifier use, and other oral habits are not so harmful or beneficial to the child to justify ill-timed aggressive discontinuance.
 Indeed there is ample time to guide the child to forming desired behaviors.
 In nearly every case success in habit management depends on the child making a personal commitment to discontinue the habit.
 Control can be placed in the child's hands after that decision is made.
