Hairy leukoplakia-like lesions following bone-marrow transplantation.
 Hairy leukoplakia (HL) also occurs in immunosuppressed post-bone-marrow transplantation patients, and in the presence or absence of Epstein-Barr virus.
 It may not always be diagnostic of HIV positivity.
 However, HIV status should still be determined in patients with HL.
