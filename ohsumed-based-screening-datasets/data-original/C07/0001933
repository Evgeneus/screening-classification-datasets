Geometrical planning for the correction of orbital hypertelorism.
 Orbital hypertelorism may be associated with a variety of deformities affecting several elements of the craniofacial skeleton.
 Shortness of the central portion of the face represented by a wide, short nose and anterior open bite is frequently combined with the exaggerated interorbital distance.
 With the mobilization of the two halves of the face it is possible to approximate the orbits, simultaneously elongating the center of the face and normalizing the maxillary alveolar ridge.
 A technique is described to plan the operation geometrically in order to predict accurately the skeletal correction, the change of the inclination of the eye slant, and the modification of the axis of the teeth.
