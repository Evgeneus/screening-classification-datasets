Unusual intramandibular neural tumor.
 Neural tumors within the jaw bones are exceptional.
 We present the histologic observation of a central mandibular tumor of neural origin.
 Immunohistochemistry confirmed the neural nature of the tumor, which had features of a schwannoma (neurilemmoma) together with ganglion cells as seen in ganglioneuroma.
 Moreover, the association with an intracranial tumor, possibly a meningioma, is emphasized.
