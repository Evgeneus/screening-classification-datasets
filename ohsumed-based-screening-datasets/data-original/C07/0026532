Perioperative management of paediatric microstomia.
 Paediatric microstomia may occur congenitally in the whistling face syndrome but is more often acquired after accidental thermal injuries such as biting an electrical extension cord or ingesting household lye.
 The surgical correction of microstomia includes separation and cosmetic reconstruction of the fused lips and postoperative oral splinting.
 Microstomia from lye ingestion may be associated not only with limited mouth opening but also with such severe intraoral scarring that common landmarks guiding either rigid or flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy are obscured, rendering oral and nasotracheal intubation difficult or impossible.
 We report a case of paediatric microstomia after lye ingestion in which conventional direct laryngoscopy, flexible fibreoptic laryngoscopy, and multiple blind nasal approaches to tracheal intubation were unsuccessful.
 However, tracheostomy was avoided and successful tracheal intubation was accomplished using a new rigid tubular pharyngolaryngoscope.
