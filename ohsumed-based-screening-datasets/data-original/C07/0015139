Severe preeclampsia presenting as dysphonia secondary to uvular edema. A case report.
 In addition to hypertension and proteinuria, generalized edema is seen commonly in women with severe preeclampsia.
 A patient presented to us at term with the complaint of dysphonia.
 Upon examination she appeared to be clearly preeclamptic and had a grossly edemetous uvula, which we think occurred secondary to generalized edema.
 This case might be the first reported one of preeclampsia presenting as dysphonia and of uvular edema in association with preeclampsia.
