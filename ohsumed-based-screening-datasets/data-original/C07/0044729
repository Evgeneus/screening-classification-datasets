The free tongue graft for correction of secondary deformities of the vermilion in patients with cleft lip.
 From January of 1985 to January of 1990, 31 patients with repaired cleft lip and secondary vermilion defects underwent 45 revisional procedures.
 A free tongue graft was utilized seven times in six patients (19 percent).
 Indications for its use were a V-shaped vermilion deficit or a "whistling" deformity associated with a sagittal vermilion deficiency and normal or insufficient lateral vermilion bulk.
 Of the seven free tongue grafts, none was lost.
 Three patients have required revisions, including repeat free tongue graft in one.
 Proper positioning of the graft along the free vermilion border has made color and texture match satisfactory.
 The free tongue graft is a simple and reliable means of transferring both vermilion bulk and surface mucosa.
 Introduction of the free tongue graft has eliminated the need for more cumbersome procedures, such as the Abbe flap or the tongue flap, in properly selected patients.
