Computerized digital enhancement in craniofacial cephalometric radiography.
 Application of digital radiologic imaging techniques to cephalometric assessment of the craniofacial skeleton is presented.
 Digital-enhanced and standard cephalometric radiographs were compared by osseous and soft tissue landmark analysis.
 Although both radiographic methods exhibited comparable accuracy at identifying bony landmarks, digital enhancement was consistently superior at delineating soft tissue relationships.
