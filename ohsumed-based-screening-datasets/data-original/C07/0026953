T cell subpopulations in the labial minor salivary gland histopathologic lesion of Sjogren's syndrome.
 The majority of T cells constituting the focal lymphocytic infiltrates in the labial minor salivary glands of patients with Sjogren's syndrome bear the helper phenotype (CD4); activation is expressed by class II (HLA-DR) MHC products.
 In our immunohistologic study of snap frozen minor salivary gland biopsies from 16 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome, it was shown that the majority (77%) of the infiltrating T cells exhibit the memory helper/inducer phenotype (UCHL-1) and express LFA-1 molecules.
 In addition most of the T cells express the alpha beta receptor while only 2.8% express the gamma delta receptor.
 Our findings suggest that these T cell infiltrates in patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome may explain the intense B lymphocyte hyperreactivity observed in the exocrine glands of patients with Sjogren's syndrome.
