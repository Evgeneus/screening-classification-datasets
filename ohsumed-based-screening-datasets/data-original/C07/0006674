Toxic streptococcal syndrome.
 The streptococcal toxic shocklike syndrome is a recently recognized, multisystem disorder that shares many of the features of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome, but is caused by toxins elaborated by group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus.
 We describe a patient who fulfilled the major criteria for the clinical diagnosis of toxic shock syndrome (fever, hypotension, multisystem dysfunction, and diffuse macular erythroderma followed by desquamation) and who demonstrated serologic evidence suggesting streptococcal infection.
 In patients presenting with clinical findings consistent with a toxic shocklike syndrome, the emergency physician should consider streptococcal infection as a potential etiology.
