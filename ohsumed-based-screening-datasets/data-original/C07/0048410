Preservation of facial contour during parotidectomy.
 Parotid surgery often leaves a facial contour deformity.
 Free abdominal dermal-fat grafts were used to preserve the facial contour of nine patients undergoing parotid surgery.
 This procedure is simple to perform and provides an improved cosmetic result without significantly increasing operative time or lengthening hospitalization.
 No troublesome fat absorption occurred postoperatively.
 The dermal-fat graft also serves as a barrier to regenerating neurons, thereby preventing postoperative gustatory sweating.
