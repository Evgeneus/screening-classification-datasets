Cardiohemodynamic and serum catecholamine response to surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars under local anesthesia: a randomized double-blind parallel group and crossover study.
 The aim of this study was to differentiate between the extent to which surgical stress and the epinephrine in local anesthetic solutions influence serum catecholamine, cAMP, and potassium levels, and contribute to changes in cardiohemodynamic parameters.
 One hundred sixty mg of articaine hydrochloride (4.0 mL of a 4% articaine hydrochloride solution) with two different epinephrine doses was injected into outpatients prior to removal of an impacted mandibular third molar in a randomized, double-blind parallel group and crossover design.
 The results showed that the amount of epinephrine absorbed from the intraoral injection site predominantly determined the serum epinephrine concentration.
 The anesthetic-induced increase in the serum epinephrine level did not correlate with changes in the cardiohemodynamic parameters under study at any time during the operative procedure.
 The serum cAMP changes correlated with those of epinephrine, whereas the serum potassium levels remained unchanged.
 The procedure of tooth extraction was a stressful event when the 1:200,000 epinephrine-containing anesthetic solution was used, showing that the risk of inducing a cardiovascular incident during oral surgery seems to be higher the greater the extent of operation and the lower the epinephrine dose in the anesthetic solution.
