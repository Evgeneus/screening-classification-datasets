Dental management of the patient with major depression.
 Major depression is a psychiatric disorder in which mood, thought content, and behavioral patterns are impaired for long periods of time.
 It is a common disorder, with an increasing prevalence among young adults.
 It may be associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate preventive oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental decay, advanced periodontal disease, and oral dysesthesias.
 Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease.
 Appropriate dental management necessitates a vigorous preventive dental education program, the use of saliva substitutes and anticaries agents containing fluoride, and special precautions when prescribing or administering analgesics and local anesthetics.
