Variations in the prevalence and extent of periodontitis.
 A national survey of employed adults showed a decrease in the extent and severity of periodontal disease in comparison with findings from earlier studies.
 Using data from that survey, this report evaluates the association of socioeconomic factors--race, education, income and dental insurance, as well as most recent dental visit--with the prevalence and extent of periodontal disease.
 Periodontitis was more prevalent and usually more extensive in persons who are black, have less education or had not seen a dentist in three or more years.
 Having dental insurance was not associated with better periodontal health.
