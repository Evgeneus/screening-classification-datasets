Postanginal sepsis with dysphagia.
 We have described a 10-year-old girl who had dysphagia followed abruptly by arthritis.
 Streptococcus pyogenes was identified as the pathogen by fasciotomy with bone biopsy, and a tonsillar fluid collection confirmed the diagnosis of postanginal sepsis.
 The patient was cured by a 6-week course of parenteral antibiotics.
