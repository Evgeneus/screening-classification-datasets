Adult linear immunoglobulin A disease manifesting as desquamative gingivitis.
 Desquamative gingivitis is a manifestation of various dermatoses, particularly lichen planus and mucous membrane pemphigoid.
 A rare example of adult linear immunoglobulin A disease manifesting as desquamative gingivitis is presented.
 Although the initial clinical features were typical of desquamative gingivitis, the persistence of ulceration after dental extractions was unusual, and the management of the oral lesions proved difficult.
 The clinical, immunopathologic, and therapeutic aspects of linear immunoglobulin A dermatoses are reviewed.
