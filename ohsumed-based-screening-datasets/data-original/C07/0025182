Orthognathic surgery in cleft patients treated by early bone grafting.
 For the past 25 years at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago a protocol has been followed for complete clefts that involves placement of an infant maxillary orthopedic appliance prior to lip closure, surgical closure of the lip, autogenous split-rib grafts to the alveolus to stabilize maxillary segments, and palatal closure, generally within the first year of life.
 The oldest 36 patients whose skeletal growth was for all practical purposes finished have been followed to determine the need for and type of orthognathic surgery.
 Of the total sample, 8 patients (22.2 percent) required some type of sagittal orthognathic surgery (1 patient in this group also required vertical maxillary alignment) and 2 patients required maxillary augmentation only in the form of an onlay graft.
 This report may serve as a baseline for others who wish to report on the incidence and type of orthognathic surgery in their cleft palate centers.
