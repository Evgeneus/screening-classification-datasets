Recurrent buccal space abscesses: a complication of Crohn's disease.
 A patient is described with generalized gastrointestinal involvement by Crohn's disease.
 Symptoms of recurrent ulceration and mucosal tags are well-described oral manifestations of Crohn's disease; however, in our patient recurrent facial abscesses, which required extraoral drainage, also developed.
 This complication has not previously been reported.
