Parotid sialography with a new Zonarc program.
 The use of panoramic zonography with the Zonarc-MLA and LAT-PA program for parotid sialography is presented.
 It provides curved layer tomograms, and shadows of the bony structures are therefore not disturbingly superimposed on the image of the sialogram.
 The visibility in the retromandibular region tended to be better.
 Radiation doses in plain film radiography are up to 60 times higher than in Zonarc radiography.
