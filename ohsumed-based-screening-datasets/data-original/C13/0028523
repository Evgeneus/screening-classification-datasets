Recurrent spontaneous pregnancy loss. Investigation and reproductive follow-up.
 Between July 1, 1985, and Dec 31, 1988, 187 women referred to the University of British Columbia Medical Genetics Clinical Unit for two or more consecutive, unexplained, spontaneous pregnancy losses were evaluated for seven categories of possible etiology.
 Follow-up of the total subsequent reproductive experience was obtained in 171 cases.
 For those who became pregnant, achievement of a live birth was tabulated according to the number of previous pregnancy losses, age at the investigation and abnormalities found in the investigation.
 Overall, 81.8% of those who became pregnant after the evaluation and with a known outcome or outcomes at follow-up had a live birth-78% of primary aborters (no previous liveborn infant) and 86.3% of secondary aborters (previous liveborn infant).
