CA 125 levels in abruptio placentae.
 The diagnosis of abruptio placentae is frequently difficult despite ultrasonography; additional diagnostic parameters would be useful.
 Maternal serum CA 125, which is believed to derive from the decidua, is elevated in the first trimester and immediately after delivery when placental separation occurs, possibly because of decidual disruption.
 Serum CA 125 was measured in 27 patients beyond 20 weeks' gestation who were first seen with vaginal bleeding and in 17 control patients of similar gestational age and labor status.
 Mean (+/- SD) CA 125 levels were higher (p less than 0.01) among patients with abruptio placentae (105.9 +/- 115 U/ml) than among those with alternate sources of bleeding (13.7 +/- 10 U/ml) or control patients (18.2 +/- 11.7 U/ml).
 Mean (+/- SD) serum CA 125 levels in seven control patients within 6 hours post partum (194 +/- 80.5 U/ml) were higher than those among patients first seen with abruptio placentae (p less than 0.01).
 Sensitivity and specificity of CA 125 for abruptio placentae were 70% and 94%, respectively.
 Our data support a decidual source for CA 125 and may indicate utility of CA 125 as a marker for abruptio placentae.
