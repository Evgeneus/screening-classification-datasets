Computed tomographic and ultrasonographic findings in women with acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
 Acute fatty liver of pregnancy is associated with complications that can influence antepartum management and necessitate delivery.
 To date, liver biopsy has been regarded as the "gold standard" for diagnosis.
 Radiologic evaluation of the liver has been suggested as a less invasive means of diagnosing this entity.
 Five patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy underwent ultrasonography; three underwent concomitant computed tomography (CT) of the liver.
 The liver appeared to be normal in all the patients undergoing CT evaluation and all undergoing ultrasonography except one.
 Normal liver examinations are not unusual findings in patients with acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
