Transvaginal ultrasonography versus hysteroscopy in the diagnosis of uterine submucous myomas.
 Seventy-one women with symptomatic uterine myomas, hospitalized for hysterectomy, underwent preoperative transvaginal ultrasonography and hysteroscopy to compare their reliability in the diagnosis of submucous myomas.
 After the operation, the surgical specimen was studied carefully and the results were compared with the preoperative diagnostic findings.
 Transvaginal ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94%; the predictive value of an abnormal ultrasound scan was 81% and that of a normal one was 100%.
 The sensitivity of hysteroscopy was 100% and the specificity 96%; the predictive value of an abnormal hysteroscopic finding was 87% and that of a normal result was 100%.
 Mapping of uterine myomas is more precise with transvaginal ultrasonography than with hysteroscopy, but the former method cannot distinguish between a myoma and an endometrial polyp.
