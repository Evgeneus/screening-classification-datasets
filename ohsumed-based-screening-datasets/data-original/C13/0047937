Hypertrophy of clitoral hood: presenting sign of neurofibromatosis in female child.
 Although clitoral involvement with neurofibromatosis is rare, all cases previously reported have described clitoral hypertrophy due to neurofibromas of the clitoral corpora.
 We report on a patient who had localized enlargement of the prepuce only, with no evidence of neurofibromatous infiltration.
 In all cases, diagnosis of clitoromegaly requires basic chromosomal and endocrinologic evaluation.
 However, recognition of its association with neurofibromatosis due to either neurofibromas of the genitalia or localized genital hypertrophy may spare the patient an unnecessary or invasive evaluation.
 Because of an association with urinary tract neurofibromas, the patient with genital involvement should have cystoscopy.
 Clitoroplasty with sparing of the neurovascular bundle and glans is the preferred method of management of the enlarged clitoris.
