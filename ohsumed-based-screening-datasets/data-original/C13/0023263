Inflammatory atypia on cervical smears. A diagnostic dilemma for the gynecologist.
 In light of the current controversy on the significance, follow-up and management of women with cervical smears showing "inflammatory atypia" (IA), a study was conducted to correlate the initial cytologic diagnosis of IA with the follow-up findings in colposcopically directed cervical biopsies and smears.
 From March 1988 through June 1989, 70 women had two consecutive smears reported as IA; all underwent colposcopy and cervical biopsy.
 In 58 patients (83%) the biopsies and smears obtained during colposcopy were negative for condyloma and/or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
 Ten patients (14%) had condylomas, and two (3%) had condylomas with CIN (one CIN I and one II).
 The initial IA smears from those 12 patients were reviewed retrospectively: 2 showed condylomas (they had been undercalled), 5 were "suggestive of condyloma" (the atypical cells were too few or poorly preserved for a definitive diagnosis), and 5 showed IA.
 None showed cytologic evidence of CIN, most probably because of sampling error.
 Our results suggest that colposcopy is warranted after two consecutive diagnoses of IA on cervical smears, considering that 17% of the patients in our study showed underlying intraepithelial lesions of the cervix.
