Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin-positive extragonadal germ cell neoplasia of the renal pelvis.
 A 56-year-old woman showed renal obstruction on the right side.
 Further examinations revealed a tumor of the renal pelvis.
 Nephroureterectomy on the right side was done.
 This extragonadal germ cell neoplasia had an immunohistochemically detected beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) expression.
 There were no other primary tumors or metastases.
 Although there were normal values after the operation, during the postoperative follow-up, the serum beta-hCG temporarily reached 2400 IU/l and then dropped to normal without detection of metastases.
 No further therapy was given.
 The patient was alive and well 1 year and 10 months after surgery.
 To the authors' knowledge, this is the first extragonadal germ cell neoplasia of the renal pelvis with secretion of beta-hCG to the serum.
