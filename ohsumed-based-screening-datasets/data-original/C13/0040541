One-blade rotation of a persistent posterior vertex.
 Fifteen women in labor at term with no evidence of protraction or arrest disorder successfully underwent a single-blade rotation of the fetus from occipitoposterior to occipitoanterior position.
 There were no failures, no fetal injuries, and no significant maternal trauma.
 This method of forceps rotation appears to be a safe alternative to current methods of managing occipitoposterior positions.
