High-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic disease. A new dose-intensive, multiagent chemotherapeutic regimen.
 Dose-intensive, multiagent chemotherapy for the treatment of high-risk gestational trophoblastic disease has evolved as the treatment of choice for these patients.
 High-dose methotrexate in combination with etoposide, dactinomycin, vincristine and cyclophosphamide (EMA-CO) has now been demonstrated to be superior to the traditional methotrexate, dactinomycin, cyclophosphamide chemotherapy in patients with prognostic scores of greater than or equal to 8.
 An attempt was made to improve upon the EMA-CO regimen by increasing the dose intensity of etoposide and adding cisplatin to the high-dose methotrexate, etoposide and dactinomycin.
 That regimen was used on four patients with ultra-high-risk gestational trophoblastic disease.
