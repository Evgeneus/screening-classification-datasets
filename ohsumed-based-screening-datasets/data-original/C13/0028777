Lower urinary tract reconstruction in patients with bladder exstrophy after failed primary treatment in early childhood.
 The results of neonatal surgery for bladder exstrophy are not very satisfactory.
 A significant percentage of patients present in later childhood or adolescence for correction of their residual deformities.
 We have reconstructed 26 patients, correcting their entire urogenital and cosmetic deformity in a one-stage procedure.
 The results show that one-stage total reconstruction is possible and is preferable to serial correction of the various individual abnormalities.
 The principles of surgical reoperation in adolescence are the same as those now established for the primary correction in neonatal life.
