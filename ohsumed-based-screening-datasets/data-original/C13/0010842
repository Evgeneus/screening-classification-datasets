Adult respiratory distress syndrome during pregnancy and immediately postpartum.
 From 1976 to 1983, the adult respiratory distress syndrome occurred in 14 patients during pregnancy or within a month postpartum.
 There were 8 survivors, giving a 43% mortality.
 All but 2 patients had obstetric-related precipitating events--labor problems, infections, eclampsia-toxemia, and obstetric hemorrhages.
 During emergency cesarean sections, 3 patients had respiratory problems that may have caused their respiratory distress syndrome.
 The average duration of mechanical ventilatory support was 16 days.
 Six patients had barotrauma with 1 patient sustaining an irreversible anoxic central nervous system injury.
 Infections were documented in 8 patients, 6 of whom had obstetric foci.
 There is a lack of information regarding the adult respiratory distress syndrome in this patient group.
 Though uncommon, it can cause substantial mortality and morbidity.
