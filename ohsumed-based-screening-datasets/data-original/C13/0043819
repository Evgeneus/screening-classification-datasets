Hysterosalpingography in the 1990s.
 All physicians involved in the evaluation and treatment of infertility rely heavily on the information provided by hysterosalpingography.
 For many years this study has provided images of the lumina of the fallopian tubes that are not available by other diagnostic means, and it also gives the most accurate outline of the uterine cavity.
 Hysterosalpingography will therefore continue to be a valuable study in the upcoming decade, and it is important now to take account of the many advances in technology that impinge on the execution and interpretation of this study.
 In this article we first update the continuing debate about elements of the study itself, involving techniques and the choice of contrast material.
 We also consider surgical advances, such as the widespread use of microsurgical reconstruction of the fallopian tube, that increase the demand for hysterosalpingography.
 Since radiologists are asked to evaluate the results of surgery, it is essential for them to be familiar with the postoperative appearances of the fallopian tube.
 Finally, we consider what must be by far the most important development of the 1990s, the continuing integration of hysterosalpingography with new interventional and imaging techniques.
 Fallopian tube catheterization expands the examination of the fallopian tube and offers new therapeutic applications.
 Transvaginal sonography and MR imaging have allowed noninvasive exploration of the female pelvis.
 Correlation of hysterosalpingography and MR imaging is particularly useful in the diagnosis of uterine myomas and congenital uterine duplication anomalies when surgery to preserve or enhance the reproductive capacity of the uterus is indicated.
 Sonography and MR imaging should be correlated with hysterosalpingography to provide a more efficient diagnostic and therapeutic approach to the common mechanical causes of infertility.
