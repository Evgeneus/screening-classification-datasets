Localization of trophoblastic disease with vaginal ultrasonography. A report of two cases.
 Two patients had elevated beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels and normal abdominal ultrasound examinations.
 In both instances transvaginal ultrasonography demonstrated a persistent nodule of trophoblastic disease confirmed at the time of hysterectomy.
 This new imaging modality can assist in the diagnosis of persistent trophoblastic disease in the uterus.
