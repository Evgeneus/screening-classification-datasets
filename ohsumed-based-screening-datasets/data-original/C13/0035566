Oxytocin augmentation of labor and perinatal outcome in nulliparas.
 Recent pharmacologic observations in vivo suggest the use of a lower starting dose (0.5-0.1 mU/minute) of oxytocin and a longer interval between dose augmentations (30-60 minutes) than previously advocated.
 In this study, a high-dose oxytocin protocol was used to augment nonprogressive labor in normal nulliparous women.
 The rate of oxytocin infusion started at 6 mU/minute and was increased by 6 mU/minute every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 40 mU/minute.
 Charts were reviewed of 1080 nulliparous women for whom the principles of active management of labor were followed and delivery occurred between March 1, 1986 and December 31, 1988.
 Four hundred fifty-six who required oxytocin augmentation in labor were compared with 624 who did not receive oxytocin.
 There were no statistically significant differences in birth asphyxia or perinatal morbidity.
