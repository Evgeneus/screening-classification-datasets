Abnormalities of colonic mucin secretion and metabolic changes after internal urinary diversion for bladder exstrophy. A prospective study.
 Ten patients with different types of internal urinary diversion for bladder exstrophy were studied prospectively in order to assess metabolic abnormalities and morphological, histochemical and lectin binding changes in the colorectal mucosa.
 The histochemical and/or lectin binding changes which were found in the majority of patients were identical to those observed in premalignant and malignant conditions of the colon.
 In some cases they were detectable 3 years after the initial examination but were completely absent from the colorectal mucosa of normal subjects.
 Metabolic disturbances (metabolic acidosis, increased anion gap, hyperchloraemia) were observed in a substantial number of asymptomatic patients.
 These findings stress the need for regular endoscopic, histological and metabolic follow-up in these patients and for life-long treatment with bicarbonate or citrate.
