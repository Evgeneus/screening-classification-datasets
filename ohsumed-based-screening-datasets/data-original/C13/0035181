The prognostic value and significance of preclinical abortions in in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer programs.
 Preclinical abortions occur in natural conceptions as well as in in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycles.
 Nevertheless, although known, this entity is ill defined.
 OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to propose a classification of these pregnancies on the basis of pathophysiological evidence and to evaluate their future clinical impact.
 DESIGN: Of 970 IVF-ET cycles, 114 cycles (11.7%) terminated in preclinical abortions.
 Abortions were divided according to peak beta human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) values into chemical abortions (52%) occurring 2 weeks after ET with beta-hCG values not higher than 21 mIU/mL and peri-implantation abortions (47%) terminating spontaneously 4 weeks after ET; the latter had higher beta-hCG values for a longer period of time but without any sonographic evidence of gestational sac.
 No woman in the two groups needed curettage.
 RESULTS: After a chemical abortion, the pregnancy outcome had better ongoing pregnancy rates (24.7%) in comparison with the 17% achieved in the total IVF-ET cycles.
 CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that these two groups most probably have different pathophysiological backgrounds and concomitantly different future clinical impacts.
