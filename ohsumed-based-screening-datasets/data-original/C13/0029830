Continuous infusion epidural analgesia for obstetrics: bupivacaine versus bupivacaine-fentanyl mixture.
 Continuous infusion epidural analgesia (CIEA) using a mixture of bupivacaine and fentanyl was evaluated in this randomized, double-blind study involving 75 nulliparous women by comparing the mixture (Group I, Bupivacaine 0.125% and fentanyl 4 micrograms.ml-1 -24 patients) with two concentrations of bupivacaine alone (Group II, bupivacaine 0.25% - 24 patients; and Group III, bupivacaine 0.125% - 27 patients).
 Epidural anaesthesia was established in Group I with 6 ml 0.125% bupivacaine with fentanyl 50 micrograms and in both Groups II and III with 6 ml 0.25% bupivacaine.
 In the women whose pain score (Visual Analogue Scale) decreased by at least 50% within 15 min, CIEA was given until delivery.
 The initial infusion rate in all three groups was set at 7 ml.hr-1, but was decreased in the event of motor block or excessive sensory level.
 For inadequate analgesia, bupivacaine 0.25% in 3 ml supplements was given every 30 min, as required.
 During the first stage of labour, 88% of women in Group I reported excellent or good analgesia compared with 92% of women in Group II (NS) and with 59% in Group III (P less than 0.05).
 The proportion of women reporting excellent/good analgesia during the second stage was approximately 65% in all three groups.
 The total cumulative dose of bupivacaine in Group I was 54 +/- 36 mg, compared with 107 +/- 47 mg for Group II (P = 0.001), and 71 +/- 41 mg for Group III (NS).
 Group I patients required less supplementation with bupivacaine than either Group II or III patients during the first stage but only with Group III patients during the second stage.
