Platelet-activating factor-acether is a component of human follicular fluid.
 OBJECTIVE: Platelet-activating factor-acether (PAF-acether) presence was investigated in 27 human follicular fluids (FFs).
 DESIGN: Aggregation of washed rabbit platelets was used to measure PAF-acether.
 Data were compared using Student's t-test.
 SETTING: Follicular fluids came from the in vitro fertilization program at Antoine Beclere Hospital, and PAF-acether was assayed at Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale, Unites 187 and 200, Clamart, France.
 PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: The study concerned five infertile women 29 to 39 years of age.
 INTERVENTIONS: Ovaries were stimulated with human menopausal gonadotropin under gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) action.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The height of platelet aggregation was compared between FFs and synthetic PAF-acether.
 RESULTS: Mean FF concentration of PAF-acether was 1,367 to 3,467 pg/mL among women.
 Values were higher for patients in a long than in a short GnRH-a protocol (P less than 0.05).
 However, PAF-acether concentration was not related to fertilization rate.
 CONCLUSIONS: Platelet-activating factor-acether is possibly involved in oocyte release from the follicle, a process occulted by follicular puncture.
