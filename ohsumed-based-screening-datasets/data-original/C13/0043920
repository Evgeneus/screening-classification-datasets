Funic reduction for the management of umbilical cord prolapse.
 The current management of umbilical cord prolapse centers on attempts to alleviate the pressure of the presenting part on the cord while preparation for cesarean section is being made.
 A 10-year experience in which there were vigorous attempts to accomplish safe vaginal delivery after the diagnosis of umbilical cord prolapse is presented.
 Eight cases of umbilical cord prolapse occurred, a frequency of 1 in 277 deliveries (0.37%), all of which had a normal immediate neonatal outcome.
 Vaginal delivery was accomplished in seven patients (87.5%); diagnosis was made in two of them when delivery was imminent.
 Five patients were more remote from delivery and had successful funic reduction (manual replacement of the prolapsed cord).
 Funic reduction is proposed as a potentially beneficial initial step in the management of umbilical cord prolapse.
