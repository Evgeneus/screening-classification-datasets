Serum levels of Hyskon during hysteroscopic procedures.
 Hyskon hysteroscopy fluid is used with the hysteroscope as an aid in distending the uterine cavity and in visualizing its surfaces.
 We correlated the amount of Hyskon used during hysteroscopy with both the instillation pressures generated within the uterine cavity and with serum levels of Hyskon in 11 healthy subjects.
 Serum levels in excess of 1000 mg% were measured at 30 min when an amount of Hyskon greater than 300 mL was used.
 Intrauterine Hyskon absorption and/or injection during hysteroscopy were found even after volumes of Hyskon as small as 50-100 mL were used.
 Serum levels were significantly higher with the larger amounts of Hyskon used in ablative procedures (P less than 0.01), as compared with serum levels seen with the smaller amounts of Hyskon used for diagnostic procedures.
 The injection pressures should be low to minimize the amount of intravascular injection.
 In cases in which extensive ablative procedures are necessary, we suggest that a two-stage procedure be considered.
 Because of the hypertonicity of Hyskon, intravascular volume expansion that may be larger than that seen during transurethral prostatectomy occurs.
