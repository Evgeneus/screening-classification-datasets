Obstructive acute renal failure by a gravid uterus: a case report and review.
 Acute renal failure caused from an obstruction by the gravid uterus is a rare complication of pregnancy.
 Only 13 cases have been reported.
 We report a case of obstructive acute renal failure in a patient at 34 weeks' gestation with a twin pregnancy complicated by polyhydramnios.
 The serum creatinine peaked at 1,078 mumol/L (12.2 mg/dL), higher than in the previously reported patients.
 The striking feature of her clinical course was the immediate resolution of anuria following amniotomy, thus avoiding the need for dialysis, ureteral stenting, or immediate surgical delivery.
 This patient illustrates the potential importance of increased uterine pressure on the ureters as a cause of significant obstructive renal failure during pregnancy.
