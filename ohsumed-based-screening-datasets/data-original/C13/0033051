The course of lymphocytic hypophysitis.
 A 27-year-old woman presented to our institution in her seventh month of pregnancy with complaints of headache and visual field disturbance.
 Workup revealed bitemporal hemianopia, a markedly enlarged pituitary gland on computed tomography scan, and biochemical evidence of partial hypopituitarism.
 At surgery, a biopsy specimen of the pituitary gland was taken revealing lymphocytic hypophysitis.
 The patient was treated with steroids and replacement doses of thyroid hormone.
 Visual fields improved postoperatively.
 A repeat computed tomography scan obtained 2 months after an uneventful pregnancy showed that her pituitary had regained normal size and contour.
 Over the next 9 months she had gradual recovery of all pituitary function.
 This case allowed us to follow and document the course of lymphocytic hypophysitis from its presentation as a macroadenoma with partial hypopituitarism to full recovery of both size and hormonal function of the pituitary.
 Lymphocytic hypophysitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pituitary mass or pituitary dysfunction presenting in pregnancy.
 In patients with suspected lymphocytic hypophysitis and a pituitary mass, a trial of steroids may be therapeutic.
