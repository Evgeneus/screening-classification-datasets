Continence in bladder exstrophy: determinants of success.
 We evaluated 19 female and 18 male patients with bladder exstrophy, who had completed staged reconstruction, had required no further surgery and underwent urodynamic studies.
 Of the male population 61% were continent based on a significantly higher urethral continence length (25.8 +/- 6.4 mm., mean plus or minus standard error) and a higher urethral closing pressure (69.4 +/- 5.8 cm.
 water) compared to the incontinent male population (11.4 +/- 3.1 mm.
 and 43.4 +/- 4.6 cm.
 water).
 No significant difference was noted in the bladder capacity of these 2 groups.
 Of the female population 57.9% were continent.
 They also demonstrated a higher urethral continence length (21.1 +/- 4.4 mm.) and a higher urethral closing pressure (62.7 +/- 10.2 cm.
 water) compared to the incontinent female subjects (8.4 +/- 2.5 mm.
 and 32.7 +/- 6.9 cm.
 water).
 Moreover, those who were continent had a significantly higher bladder capacity (201.2 +/- 39.5 ml.) compared to those who were incontinent (84.3 +/- 23.6 ml.).
 These findings support a multifactorial mechanism in achieving continence but they suggest that of all the factors urethral length may be the most important.
