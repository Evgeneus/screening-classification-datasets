Flow cytometric detection of tumor metastases during urologic surgery.
 Flow cytometric studies were performed on peripheral blood obtained before, during, and subsequent to urologic surgery.
 The results suggest that 7 of 11 patients had a brief period during surgical manipulation when they had cells from the primary surgical site in the peripheral blood.
 Concentration of such cells was generally less than 10(2)/mL even during the intraoperative period.
 These findings suggest that perioperative tumor seeding is a real concern, and that flow cytometry can be used to study maneuvers to reduce its incidence.
