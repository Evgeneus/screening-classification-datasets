Does prostaglandin confer significant advantage over oxytocin infusion for nulliparas with pre-labor rupture of membranes at term?
 Ninety-four nulliparous women with a poor cervical score (less than 6) who had premature rupture of membranes at term were randomized by sealed envelope into two groups.
 One group received immediate stimulation of labor with oxytocin infusion.
 The second group received two prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) 3-mg pessaries 4 hours apart, followed by oxytocin infusion, if necessary.
 The interval between initiation of therapy to onset of labor was significantly longer in the PG group, but the length of labor was similar in both groups.
 The maximum dose of oxytocin needed was significantly higher in the oxytocin group.
 The cesarean delivery rate in the oxytocin group was 14.9%, compared with 19.1% in the PG group (not significantly different).
 All seven cesareans in the oxytocin group and seven of nine in the PG group were for failed stimulation of labor.
 Neonatal Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit were similar in the two groups.
 The incidence of maternal and neonatal infection was small and was not different in the two groups.
 The use of PGE2 3-mg pessaries 4 hours apart, followed by oxytocin infusion if necessary, did not confer any benefit over the use of intravenous oxytocin in obstetric or neonatal outcome when both agents were started a few hours after admission.
