Differences in hypertension prevalence among U.S. black and white women of childbearing age.
 Hypertension and its sequelae complicate pregnancy and can result in poor perinatal outcomes.
 Overall, U.S.
 blacks are more likely to be hypertensive than whites, but the degree to which this is true among women of childbearing age (including teenagers) is unknown.
 Using data from the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES II), the authors describe hypertension prevalence rates for 422 black and 2,700 white reproductive-age women.
 The authors present observed data and also predicted prevalence rates derived by modeling the odds of hypertension using logistic regression statistical techniques.
 They find that black-white differences in hypertension prevalence are negligible among teenagers, but they are pronounced in the older reproductive ages.
 They estimate that twice the proportion of black women relative to white are hypertensive during pregnancy.
 Their results suggest that differential rates of hypertension between black and white women may contribute to the persistent excess infant mortality among blacks, but conclusive results cannot be determined from these data.
 These data are also valuable for the design and evaluation of screening, intervention, and followup programs for hypertensive disease among young women.
