Management and outcomes of pregnancies complicated by human B19 parvovirus infection: a prospective study 
 During a large statewide outbreak of fifth disease in Connecticut in 1988, 39 pregnant women were identified who had serologic evidence of recent human B19 parvovirus infection.
 The patients were followed up prospectively with targeted fetal ultrasonographic examinations to detect signs of fetal hydrops.
 Of these 39 pregnant women, 37 had healthy infants and two patients had miscarriages.
 None of the fetuses developed hydrops.
 We propose that pregnant women exposed to B19 parvovirus be tested for evidence of IgG and IgM B19-specific antibodies and that targeted fetal ultrasonography be considered when IgM antibodies are found.
 Percutaneous umbilical blood sampling and intrauterine transfusion can be considered in cases of B19 parvovirus-associated hydrops and anemia.
 The overall fetal loss rate in this prospective follow-up group was 5%.
