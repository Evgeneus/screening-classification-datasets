Brain in eclampsia: MR imaging with clinical correlation.
 Cranial magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed on eight consecutive patients with generalized tonic-clonic seizures caused by eclampsia.
 Each patient underwent serial neurologic examinations until all symptoms resolved.
 Six of those eight patients underwent follow-up MR imaging.
 These patients were compared with those in previous case reports of MR imaging abnormalities of the brain in eclampsia.
 MR imaging typically demonstrates bilateral hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images and iso- to hypointense lesions on T1-weighted images.
 MR imaging abnormalities are most commonly located in the distribution of the posterior cerebral circulation and are associated with visual disturbances.
 Basal ganglia and deep white matter lesions are less common and are associated with mental status changes.
 Most lesions seen at MR imaging in patients with eclampsia are reversible.
