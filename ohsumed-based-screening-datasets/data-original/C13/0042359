Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome: a clinico-pathological study.
 Twenty four patients with the vulvar vestibulitis syndrome formed the basis of this clinicopathological study.
 Entry dyspareunia was the constant presenting complaint and vestibular erythema with acute superficial tenderness the invariable clinical finding.
 In our series there was a marked predominance of Caucasians, patients were most often of social classes I and II and most frequently in the third decade.
 The results of laboratory investigation revealed that this syndrome has a diverse range of potential aetiologies including vulval infections, dysplasia and in one instance acute vasculitis.
