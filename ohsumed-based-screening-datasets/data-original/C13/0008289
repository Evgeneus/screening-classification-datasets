Vaginitis emphysematosa. A report of four cases.
 It has been hypothesized that vaginitis emphysematosa is a manifestation of trichomonal or Gardnerella infection.
 In support of this etiologic concept, four cases of the disorder are described showing the apparent curative effect of treating the associated infection.
 The linkage of these and other reported cases with conditions of impaired immunity suggests that immunologic factors are involved in the pathogenesis.
