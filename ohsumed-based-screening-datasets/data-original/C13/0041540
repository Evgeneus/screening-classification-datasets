Ethanol consumption inhibits fetal DNA methylation in mice: implications for the fetal alcohol syndrome.
 Acute ethanol administration (3 g/kg twice a day) to pregnant mice, from the 9th thru the 11th day of gestation, resulted in hypomethylation of fetal deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).
 Nuclei isolated from the fetuses of the ethanol-treated mice had lower levels of methylase activity relative to controls even in the presence of excess S-adenosylmethionine, which serves as the methyl donor for the enzyme DNA methyltransferase.
 Acetaldehyde, at concentrations as low as 3 to 10 microM, inhibited DNA methyltransferase activity in vitro.
 Since DNA methylation is thought to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression during embryogenesis, ethanol-associated alterations in fetal DNA methylation may contribute to the developmental abnormalities seen in the fetal alcohol syndrome.
