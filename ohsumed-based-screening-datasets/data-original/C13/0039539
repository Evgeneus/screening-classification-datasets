Comprehensive evaluation and treatment of 75 men referred to chronic prostatitis clinic.
 We investigated the role of genitourinary tract infections, structural and psychologic abnormalities in 75 men referred to a "chronic prostatitis" clinic.
 Patients had had symptoms for an average of eighty-three months and had received an average of ten weeks of antimicrobial treatment during the three months prior to evaluation.
 Specific infectious diseases, structural or functional causes were identified in 34 (45%) of the 75 patients.
 Genitourinary tract pathogens were isolated from 26 patients and inflammation was documented in urethral or prostatic secretions of 24 patients.
 Structural or functional abnormalities that merited treatment were identified in 8 cases.
 In addition, major criteria for depression were documented in 9 of 17 patients who agreed to this evaluation.
 Overall, a comprehensive approach to diagnosis led to specific treatment for 37 (49%) of the 75 men with chronic prostatitis, despite longstanding symptoms and failure of multiple prior courses of therapy.
