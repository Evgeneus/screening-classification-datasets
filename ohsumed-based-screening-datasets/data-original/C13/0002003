Can the status of tubal pregnancy be predicted with transvaginal sonography? A prospective comparison of sonographic, surgical, and serum hCG findings 
 Results of transvaginal sonography were compared prospectively with surgical findings and levels of serum human chorionic gonadotropin in 120 women with a proved tubal pregnancy.
 The most common sonographic finding was a saclike adnexal ring, which was seen in 74 of the women (61.7%).
 This finding was strongly associated with functioning trophoblasts and with an intact fallopian tube.
 In 39 of the women (32.5%) an adnexal mass with a complex texture was found.
 Of these 39 women, 20 had a tubal hematoma and six had a ruptured fallopian tube.
 The size of the tubal mass created by ectopic pregnancy was predicted precisely (r = .91, P less than .001), and transvaginal sonography enabled detection of hemoperitoneum with a sensitivity of 91% (68 of 75 women).
 This study suggests that the status of a tubal pregnancy can be predicted reliably on the basis of transvaginal sonographic findings.
