Failure of ovulation induction with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone and human menopausal gonadotropins in isolated gonadotropin deficiency.
 A 30-year-old woman with primary amenorrhea, hypothalamic hypogonadism, decreased sense of smell, and primary infertility failed to respond to pulsatile exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone.
 In addition, failure to respond to stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropins was consistent with concomitant ovarian failure.
 Perturbation of normal cellular migration during embryogenesis in the regions of the olfactory placode, yolk sac, hindgut, and gonadal ridge may explain both the hypothalamic defect and ovarian failure experienced by this woman.
 She demonstrates that gonadal failure need not be accompanied by elevated gonadotropin levels; nor do low gonadotropin levels necessarily indicate potentially responsive ovaries.
 These findings are consistent with the coexistence of isolated gonadotropin deficiency and ovarian failure in the same individual.
