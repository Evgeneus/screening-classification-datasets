Pregnancy in a hemodialysis patient with no residual renal function.

 The presence of significant residual renal function has normally been required for successful outcome.
 We report a pregnancy in a patient with complete anuria.
 Although birth occurred prematurely, fetal growth remained normal throughout gestation.
