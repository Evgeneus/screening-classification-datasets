Increased peripheral T lymphocyte activation in patients with karyotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine if soluble interleukin 2 (IL-2) receptor measured in serum by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) might be useful in managing patients with karyotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure.
 DESIGN: Prospective, controlled observation.
 SETTING: Tertiary care research institution.
 INTERVENTIONS: None.
 PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four patients with karyotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure comprised the study group.
 Forty-two healthy men and women comprised the normal reference group.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We measured peripheral T lymphocyte human leukocyte antigen locus-DR (HLA-DR) expression and IL-2 receptor expression using monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry.
 We measured soluble IL-2 receptor levels in serum using an ELISA.
 RESULTS: Consistent with previous findings, our patients had significantly higher HLA-DR expression on peripheral T lymphocytes (5.3 +/- 0.46) as compared with controls (3.5 +/- 0.34) (mean +/- SEM, P less than 0.01).
 Seven patients also had elevated IL-2 receptor expression on peripheral T lymphocytes (P less than 0.05).
 However, soluble IL-2 receptor levels in the serum did not differ significantly from normals.
 CONCLUSIONS: Patients with karyotypically normal spontaneous premature ovarian failure have a modest increase in peripheral T lymphocyte activation measured by flow cytometry.
 This degree of activation does not result in increased soluble IL-2 receptor release measured by ELISA.
