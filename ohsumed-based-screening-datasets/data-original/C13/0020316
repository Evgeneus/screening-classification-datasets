Low human chorionic somatomammotropin fails to predict spontaneous resolution of unruptured ectopic pregnancies.
 Early diagnosis of EP allows conservative medical and surgical therapy but also commits a proportion of patients whose EP would spontaneously resolve to therapeutic intervention.
 This prospective study examined the feasibility of not treating those EPs whose hCS level was low.
 However, three of eight subjects with EP required therapy.
 Thus, a single hCS alone cannot be used to identify which EPs required no therapy.
