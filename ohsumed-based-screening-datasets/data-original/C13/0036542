Comparing the yield of the standard Papanicolaou and endocervical brush smears.
 To compare the endocervical cell yield of the standard Papanicolaou smear and endocervical brush (Cytobrush) smear, cervical cytology smears using both techniques were obtained separately from each of 491 women between Aug 1, 1987, and Jan 31, 1990.
 The smear provided endocervical cells from 97% of the patients, while the Papanicolaou smear provided them from 64%.
 The brush was unsatisfactory (no endocervical cells) in 3% of the patients.
 In nine patients (2%) no endocervical cells were found on either specimen.
 In six patients (1%) the brush smear was unsatisfactory, while endocervical cells were found on the Papanicolaou smear.
 The study design precluded an adequate assessment of the sensitivity for detecting abnormal cells with the addition of the brush.
 The addition of an endocervical brush smear to the routine Papanicolaou smear appears to provide better sampling of the endocervical canal than does the standard Papanicolaou smear alone, using a cotton-tipped applicator.
