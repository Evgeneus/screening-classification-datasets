Placenta membranacea with placenta increta: a case report and literature review.
 The pregnancy of a patient with placenta membranacea associated with placenta increta and a live-born infant is described, and the literature covering placenta membranacea is reviewed.
 A total of 26 cases of placenta membranacea in the second and third trimesters have been reported.
 The condition appears to have an incidence of 1:20,000-40,000, and there have been 14 reported live births associated with this rare placental anomaly.
 Antepartum and postpartum hemorrhage were reported to complicate 83 and 50% of the cases, respectively.
 Approximately 30% of the cases involved some form of abnormal placental adherence.
