Granular cell tumors of the vulva.
 Granular cell tumor (GCT), although nearly ubiquitous, is seen infrequently in the vulva.
 A review of the surgical pathology files from Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia, from 1983 through 1987 identified eight cases of vulvar GCT.
 Five of the eight patients had more than one skin and soft tissue lesion.
 Two of the five had biopsy-proven multicentric GCT with a unique clinical course.
 One of the patients was a 32-year-old woman with multiple vulvar, lingual, laryngeal, bronchial and pulmonary GCT, necessitating multiple excisions and ultimately pneumonectomy.
 The second patient had multiple GCTs in the vulva and inguinal area and finally in both lungs, resulting in her death at age 39.
 No dependable microscopic features could be identified to distinguish benign GCT from its more aggressive variant.
 However, Feulgen DNA histomorphometry demonstrated aneuploidy in the patient with apparent lung metastases, whereas the tumors from patients with a benign course as well as from the patient with multiorgan involvement were diploid.
 In three of five patients who could be interviewed there was a history of soft tissue tumors in members of the family.
 The multifocal nature and possible familial component of GCT need to be explored further.
