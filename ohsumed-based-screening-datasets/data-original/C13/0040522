Quantification of cervical change: relationship to preterm delivery in the multifetal gestation.
 Prematurity is the major contributor to the very high perinatal morbidity and mortality associated with multifetal gestations.
 Antepartum cervical evaluation has been suggested as a way to better define the risk of preterm delivery in multifetal gestations.
 Weekly digital cervical examinations were performed in 86 twin and 7 triplet gestations that were being monitored in a special antepartum clinic.
 A cervical score was calculated from each examination by subtracting cervical dilatation in centimeters from cervical length in centimeters.
 Cervical scores decline gradually with advancing gestation and are influenced by parity and subsequent preterm delivery.
 Intervals until delivery decrease significantly with lower cervical scores.
 A cervical score less than or equal to 0 on or before 34 weeks' gestation was strongly predictive of preterm delivery (75%).
 Only 2 of 78 (2.6%) with a score greater than 0 were delivered within 1 week of the examination.
 Cervical scoring is a simple, quantifiable, reproducible, and safe method of evaluating preterm delivery risk.
 An understanding of the prognostic significance of specific cervical scores may be of value in determining the need for obstetric intervention.
