Tightening the screw: statutory and legal supervision of interhospital patient transfers.
 A federal statute governing the transfer of indigent patients from Medicare-enrolled hospitals was first enacted in 1986.
 Review of the statutory and other legal controls over interhospital transfers is precipitated by its recent amendment and the fining of a Texas physician for transferring a high-risk obstetric patient without following the statutory guidelines.
 These events are part of a pattern of increasing regulation of the practice of medicine.
 Physicians and hospital administrators responsible for hospital transfer policies should be aware of regulatory developments.
 Hospitals contemplating transfer of patients must develop transfer policies that comply with governing law, including state law.
 A transfer policy should provide guidelines as to when a patient is "stable for transfer".
 Patients may not be transferred unless a physician can certify that delay attendant to transfer will not be detrimental.
 Furthermore, the policy should specify the procedures to be followed to effect a transfer and any documentation that the physician will have to complete.
