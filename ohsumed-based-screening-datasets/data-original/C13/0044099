Adjuvant whole-abdominal radiation therapy in uterine papillary serous carcinoma.
 Nine patients from 34 to 74 years of age (median, 67 years of age) with uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) were treated with whole-abdominal radiation therapy (WART) on an adjuvant basis after cytoreductive surgery.
 All patients were treated with megavoltage photons to an abdominopelvic field to a median dose of 2500 cGy, with continued treatment to a whole pelvic field to a median dose of 4500 cGy.
 Three patients received additional boost to the vaginal apex.
 Follow-up time ranged from 6 to 31 months (median, 25 months) after completion of WART.
 Six patients had recurrent disease at 5 to 20 months (median, 7.5 months).
 Four of these patients died of their disease during the follow-up period.
 Three of six patients in whom treatment failed had disease at the vaginal apex.
 None of these patients received boost radiation therapy to that site.
 In contrast, two of three patients remaining disease free were treated with additional vaginal apex irradiation.
 Based on these results, the authors do not routinely recommend WART for adjuvant treatment of UPSC.
 They do, however, recommend vaginal apex irradiation for these patients.
