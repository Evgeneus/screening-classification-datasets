Eikenella corrodens chorioamnionitis.
 Eikenella corrodens was once considered a microorganism of little clinical consequence.
 But over the past decade, there has been a marked increase in the number of reports of serious infections caused by this organism.
 We present a case of E corrodens chorioamnionitis in a patient with intact membranes.
 This is the second known case of its kind to be reported in the medical literature.
 The true incidence of obstetric and gynecologic infections may be much higher than reported because of the organism's susceptibility to routine antibiotic regimens and the failure of some strains to exhibit characteristic colony morphology on solid agar.
