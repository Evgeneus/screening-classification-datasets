Uterine activity after preterm premature rupture of the membranes.
 Preterm premature rupture of the membranes complicates few pregnancies but is a major contributor to overall perinatal morbidity and mortality.
 Although a reduced incidence of preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes has been reported in women who had antepartum uterine activity monitoring, there are few data regarding uterine activity after preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes.
 Therefore daily uterine activity monitoring was performed in 101 consecutive women with preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes between 26 and 34 weeks' gestation.
 The mean gestational ages at rupture and delivery were 31.4 +/- 2.3 and 33.7 +/- 4.5 weeks, respectively.
 A significant increase in contraction frequency was identified within 24 hours of onset of preterm labor (p less than 0.005).
 A contraction frequency of four or more per hour predicted the onset of labor within 24 hours with a sensitivity of 72%, a specificity of 90%, a positive predictive value of 54%, and a negative predictive value of 95%.
 These results indicate that most women with preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes exhibit a baseline contraction frequency that is similar to that of women with intact membranes and premature labor.
 An abrupt increase in contraction frequency is a warning of impending labor.
