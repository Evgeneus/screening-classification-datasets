The use of cervicography in a primary screening service.
 The cervicography and concurrent endocervical brush smear results obtained in 1162 women screened at the Marie Stopes Clinic were analysed.
 Colposcopy and biopsy results were obtained for positive cases.
 A comparison was made with a group of 1007 women attending the same clinic for routine cytology only.
 Nearly 10% of women who were screened by cervicography had a technically defective cervicogram, the main single reason being that the view was obscured by blood.
 Routine cytology was positive in 1%, while cervicography was positive in 13%, where positivity was defined as a result leading to a recommendation for colposcopy.
 The false positive rate for cervicography was 26%.
 Even after adjustment, this difference was highly significant (P less than 0.0001).
