Reproductive outcome after unilateral tubocornual anastomosis and contralateral salpingostomy by microsurgery.
 A unilateral tubocornual anastomosis and a contralateral salpingostomy for unilateral proximal and contralateral distal occlusive disease yield similar fertility as does pure tubocornual anastomosis for proximal occlusive disease.
 Ascending inflammation is postulated as the mechanism for tubal occlusion, with distal sparing from disease if the initial insult results in initial occlusion of the proximal portion of the oviduct.
