Significance of oligohydramnios complicating pregnancy.
 Oligohydramnios is a serious complication of pregnancy that is associated with a poor perinatal outcome.
 Eighty pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios constitute the basis for this retrospective study.
 Forty patients had premature rupture of the membranes; of these, outcomes were good in 25.
 Twelve of 14 fetuses with oligohydramnios and intrauterine growth retardation survived.
 None of the nine fetuses with severe renal anomalies lived.
 None of the twins with twin-twin transfusion and oligohydramnios survived.
 Six pregnancies with oligohydramnios and premature separation of the placenta were identified; all of these resulted in fetal or neonatal death during the second trimester.
