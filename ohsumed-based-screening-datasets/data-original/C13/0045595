Clinical chorioamnionitis is not predicted by an ultrasonic biophysical profile in patients with premature rupture of membranes 
 A modified biophysical profile was assessed serially in 47 patients with premature rupture of membranes who were not in labor.
 This profile included fetal movement, fetal tone, fetal breathing, amniotic fluid volume, and placental grade.
 The most recent study, obtained within 2 days of delivery, was compared with pregnancy outcome as reflected by the development of chorioamnionitis and/or neonatal sepsis.
 No study patient received antibiotics, steroids, or tocolytics before labor.
 Neither the composite biophysical profile nor any of its components were found to be different between patients with and without clinical chorioamnionitis.
 Neonatal sepsis was not observed.
 These data do not support the use of the biophysical profile as a predictor of maternal infection.
