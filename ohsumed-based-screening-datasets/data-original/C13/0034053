Perinatal transmission of HIV-1: lack of impact of maternal HIV infection on characteristics of livebirths and on neonatal mortality in Kigali, Rwanda.
 We present the baseline results of a prospective cohort study on the perinatal transmission of HIV-1 in Kigali, Rwanda.
 HIV-1-antibody testing was offered to all women of urban origin delivering a live newborn at the maternity ward of the Centre Hospitalier de Kigali from November 1988 to June 1989; 218 newborns of 215 HIV-positive mothers were matched to 218 newborns of 216 HIV-negative mothers.
 The matching criteria were maternal age and parity.
 No differences in socioeconomic characteristics were observed between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women.
 HIV-positive mothers more frequently reported a history of at least one death of a previously born child (P less than 0.01) and a history of abortion (P less than 0.001).
 Most of the HIV-positive women were asymptomatic, but 72.4% of them had a CD4; CD8 ratio less than 1 versus 10.1% in the HIV-negative group (P less than 0.001).
 The frequency of signs and symptoms was not statistically different in the two groups, except for a history of herpes zoster or chronic cough, which was more frequent among HIV-positive women.
 The rates of prematurity, low birth weight, congenital malformations and neonatal mortality were comparable in the two groups.
 However, infants of HIV-positive mothers had a mean birth weight 130 g lower than the infants of HIV-negative mothers (P less than 0.01).
 The impact of maternal HIV-1 infection on the infant seems limited during the neonatal period.
