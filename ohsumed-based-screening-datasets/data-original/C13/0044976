National High Blood Pressure Education Program Working Group Report on High Blood Pressure in Pregnancy 
 This consensus report focuses the presentation, pathophysiology, and management of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy expanding on recommendations first presented in 1988 by the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure.
 Practicing physicians should determine whether a patient's hypertension during pregnancy falls into the classification of (1) chronic hypertension, (2) preeclampsia, (3) preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, or (4) transient hypertension.
 The distinction, for management considerations, is made between hypertension that is present before pregnancy (chronic and preexisting) and that occurring as part of the pregnancy-specific condition preeclampsia.
 When maternal blood pressure reaches diastolic levels of 100 mm Hg or greater, treatment should be instituted to avoid hypertensive vascular damage.
 The report includes a discussion of antihypertensive therapy specific to the chronic or acute hypertension occurring concomitantly with pregnancy.
 The roles of calcium supplementation and low-dose aspirin to prevent preeclampsia and chronic and transient hypertension are under investigation.
