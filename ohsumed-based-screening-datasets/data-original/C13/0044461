Failed bladder neck reconstruction: options for management.
 During the last 10 years 17 patients have been seen at this institution for persistent urinary incontinence after Young-Dees-Leadbetter bladder neck reconstruction.
 Of these patients 16 were born with classical bladder exstrophy and 1 with complete epispadias.
 Six patients underwent 1, 10 underwent 2 and 1 underwent 3 prior bladder neck procedures.
 As salvage procedures 8 patients underwent another Young-Dees-Leadbetter procedure, 1 repeat bladder neck reconstruction and augmentation cystoplasty, 3 augmentation alone, 4 bladder augmentation with creation of a continent abdominal stoma and 1 augmentation with implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter.
 Of the 8 patients who underwent a repeat Young-Dees-Leadbetter procedure 7 are dry for 3 hours or more and 1 is dry for greater than 3 hours on intermittent self-catheterization.
 All of those who are dry for greater than 3 hours are dry at night and 1 wears pads when engaging in strenuous physical activity.
 Of the 9 patients who underwent augmentation cystoplasty along with other adjunctive procedures 8 are continent for greater than 3 hours on intermittent catheterization, 6 are dry at night if they perform catheterization at bedtime and 1 remains totally incontinent after removal of the artificial urinary sphincter.
 Thus, with persistence and creativity a child with a previously failed bladder neck reconstruction or even multiple failed repairs can be made socially continent, providing a satisfactory alternative without resorting to urinary diversion.
