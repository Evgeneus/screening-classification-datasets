Candida sepsis in pregnancy and the postpartum period.
 Colonization of the vagina by Candida is common during pregnancy, while candida sepsis in pregnancy is rare.
 A case of candida sepsis complicating an abortion prompted us to review seven additional cases that occurred during pregnancy or the postpartum period.
 In four women candidemia developed during pregnancy or following abortion, while in the other four it developed postpartum.
 Seven women had an apparent predisposing factor, such as antibiotic treatment or an intrauterine device.
 The clinical course was difficult in four patients and ended in death in three instances.
 Both amphotericin B and 5-fluorocytosine proved effective for treatment.
