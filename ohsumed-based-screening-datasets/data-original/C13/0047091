CT appearance of the pelvis after cesarean section.
 Myometrial defects at the incision site after cesarean section may appear bizarre on CT scans, especially in the case of low transverse incisions, but may not indicate clinically significant dehiscence.
 These CT findings should be regarded as common in the patient without complications after cesarean section, so that unnecessary surgical intervention and additional treatment can be avoided.
