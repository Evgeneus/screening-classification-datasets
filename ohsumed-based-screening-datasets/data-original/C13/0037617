Uncertainty in illness theory: a replication of the mediating effects of mastery and coping.
 The purpose of this investigation was to replicate a test of the mediating functions of mastery and coping and to determine whether the relationships found in the initial test of the model would hold with a sample more heterogenous than the original sample.
 One hundred women receiving treatment for gynecological cancer participated in the investigation.
 Of the 14 relationships in the model, only 5 replicated significant paths and had overlapping confidence intervals.
 Two moderators were proposed to explain the differences between the initial and replication tests of the model and to improve the specificity of the theory.
