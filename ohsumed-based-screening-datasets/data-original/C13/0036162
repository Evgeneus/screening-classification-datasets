Are there antiendometrial antibodies in sera of women with endometriosis?
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize the antiendometrial tissue specific antibody response in endometriosis patients.
 DESIGN: Retrospective.
 SETTING: Industrial research laboratory.
 PATIENTS: Twenty untreated women with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis, 10 healthy women without symptoms of endometriosis, 12 women in whom laparoscopy failed to yield evidence of endometriosis, 10 healthy men, and 4 individuals with elevated titers of serum antinuclear antibodies.
 RESULTS: Several immunological methods have been employed including immunofluorescence, hemagglutination, enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assays, and protein blotting.
 Contrary to reports in the literature, results of these analyses have failed to demonstrate the presence of detectable levels of antiendometrial immunoreactivity in sera from patients with endometriosis.
 CONCLUSION: The association of endometrial autoimmunity with endometriosis remains to be established.
