Pemphigus gestationis (herpes gestationis): a case report.
 Pemphigus gestationis is a rare disease, probably of immunologic origin, that causes the placenta to absorb immunoglobulins and deposit them in its basement membrane.
 The resulting placental insufficiency leads to increased morbidity and mortality among the offspring of such patients.
 A case of pemphigus gestationis is presented, and the importance of early diagnosis is discussed.
