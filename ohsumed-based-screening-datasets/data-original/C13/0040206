Acute transient thrombocytopenia associated with cocaine abuse in pregnancy.
 A case is described of cocaine-induced severe transient thrombocytopenia associated with a hypertensive crisis at 21 weeks' gestation.
 Liver function tests and coagulation studies were all within normal ranges.
 Blood pressure was controlled with hydralazine.
 This clinical presentation, similar to severe preeclampsia, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute hypertension and low platelet count, especially in early gestations when preeclampsia is relatively rare.
 Unlike severe preeclampsia, for which active intervention and delivery are usually selected, cocaine-related hypertension-thrombocytopenia, especially in very premature gestations, may warrant conservative management.
