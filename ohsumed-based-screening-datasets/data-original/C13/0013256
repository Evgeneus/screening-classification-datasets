Ultrasonic morphology of the uterus and ovaries after treatment of invasive mole and gestational choriocarcinoma.
 Ultrasound imaging of the uterus and ovaries was performed on 41 patients after completion of apparently successful cytotoxic chemotherapy for invasive mole and choriocarcinoma.
 Uterine volume was calculated and the echopattern of the uterus and ovaries assessed.
 Forty-nine per cent of subjects had an abnormal uterine appearance and 20% had ovarian theca-lutein cysts.
 Two patients relapsed on follow-up but no predictive ultrasonic features could be established on uterine or ovarian morphology after chemotherapy.
