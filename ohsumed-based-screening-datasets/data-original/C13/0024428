Pregnancy outcome in patients with repeat visits to the labor observation area near term.
 Patients whose pregnancies are near term and who repeatedly visit the labor observation area but are found not to be in labor and have no clear diagnosis for their complaints remain a source of concern for the obstetrician.
 In order to determine whether this is a population with special perinatal risks, such cases were reviewed over a 4-month period at Charity Hospital in New Orleans.
 Seventy-one patients were identified who had repeatedly visited the labor observation area near term.
 Compared with those in the general obstetrics population, these patients had a significantly increased risk of cesarean section for "failure to progress." Repeat visitors to the labor observation area should be viewed as having a high risk for later abnormalities of active labor.
 Careful management of labor abnormalities in such patients could theoretically lower their need for cesarean section.
