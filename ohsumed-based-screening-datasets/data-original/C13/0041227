The intussusception salpingostomy technique for the therapy of distal oviductal occlusion at laparoscopy.
 A new technique of salpingostomy by laparoscopy for treatment of distal oviductal occlusion is described.
 This technique uses sharp dissection and can be performed rapidly.
 The intussusception salpingostomy is undertaken by making a relatively short incision in the hydrosalpinx and then prolapsing the tubal mucosa through this neostium.
 The borders of the incision thus act as a restrictive collar to maintain the mucosa in this newly everted configuration.
 In a series of 40 women subjected to this procedure, 22 were followed for more than 12 months postoperatively; the term pregnancy rate was 22.7%.
 This fertility is similar to that after salpingostomy by microsurgical laparotomy.
