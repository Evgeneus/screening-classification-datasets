Propofol in short gynaecological procedures. Comparison of recovery over 2 days after anaesthesia with propofol or thiopentone as sole anaesthetic agent.
 Recovery was assessed over 48 hours after anaesthesia with propofol or thiopentone as sole anaesthetic agent in 36 unpremedicated gynaecological patients.
 Immediate recovery, as measured by the Steward scale, was shown to be quicker for the patients given propofol.
 At one hour postoperatively the thiopentone group showed impaired visual-motor coordination on the aiming test (p less than 0.01) and dexterity task (p less than 0.05), and a slowing of reaction time (p less than 0.01).
 Patients given propofol showed only an increase in reaction time (p less than 0.05).
 By 2 hours the thiopentone group showed impairment only in the aiming task (p less than 0.05).
 No further significant impairment was detected at 4, 24 or 48 hours.
 However, patients reported symptoms throughout the 48 hours indicative of residual drug effects.
 There was a substantial practice effect with some tests which may have obscured impairment.
 It can be argued therefore that the better recovery profile after propofol is still evident at 24 hours.
