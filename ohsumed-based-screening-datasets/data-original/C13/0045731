Longitudinal study of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in hypertensive pregnant women: deviations related to the development of superimposed preeclampsia.
 A prospective longitudinal study of 25 pregnant women (30 pregnancies) with chronic hypertension, a group prone to development of preeclampsia, was conducted to explore the relationship between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the development of superimposed preeclampsia.
 In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia did not develop (17 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated, beginning in the first trimester and continuing throughout pregnancy as found previously in normotensive pregnant women (n = 58).
 Plasma estradiol and progesterone levels also increased progressively.
 In women with chronic hypertension in whom preeclampsia developed (13 pregnancies), blood pressure decreased and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system was stimulated in the first trimester as in the other groups.
 However, later in pregnancy significant differences were observed.
 Blood pressure began to rise in the second trimester.
 Initially the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system remained stimulated, but in the early third trimester, when preeclampsia was diagnosed, plasma renin activity and urine aldosterone excretion decreased, and atrial natriuretic factor increased.
 These data provide information that may be useful in the recognition of superimposed preeclampsia, and in the investigation of its pathogenesis.
