Influence of isradipine on the maternal and fetal cardiovascular system in hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.
 Nine pregnant women (aged 28.7 +/- 6.9 years) who had developed hypertension (blood pressure greater than 140/90 mm Hg) took part in an open pilot study with the new calcium antagonist isradipine.
 Dosage was started with 1.25 mg twice daily and was increased weekly to 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily until a diastolic blood pressure of less than or equal to 80 mm Hg was achieved.
 By the time of the last visit before term, blood pressure was significantly reduced to 129/79 mm Hg and heart rate had not altered.
 External cardiotocography indicated fetal well-being throughout the entire study.
 Doppler flow measurements showed no deterioration in A:B ratio, resistance index, and pulsatile index.
 All measurements in the newborn were within normal ranges.
 In conclusion, isradipine is a safe and effective drug for pregnant women and their fetuses in the management of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy.
