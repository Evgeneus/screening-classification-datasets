A comparative study of ethamsylate and mefenamic acid in dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
 The effects of ethamsylate and mefenamic acid on menstrual blood loss were compared in a double-blind trial in 34 women with menorrhagia.
 Both drugs produced statistically significant reductions in blood loss during the 3 months of treatment; the overall reduction was 20% in the ethamsylate group and 24% in the mefenamic acid group.
 Compared with pretreatment values, blood loss was significantly less in each of the 3 treatment months in the mefenamic acid group, but only in the second and third months of treatment in the ethamsylate group.
 However, more women had a clinically useful reduction in blood loss (greater than 40%) in the ethamsylate group.
 The onset of effect of mefenamic acid was rapid but ethamsylate showed a comparatively greater effect as the trial progressed.
 Cessation of treatment was followed by an increase in blood loss, more pronounced in mefenamic acid group who reverted to pre-treatment levels.
 A greater number of side-effects were reported with mefenamic acid.
