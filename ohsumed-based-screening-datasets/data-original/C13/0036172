Clomiphene citrate-induced gamete intrafallopian transfer with diagnostic and operative laparoscopy.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the efficacy of clomiphene citrate (CC) gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) with operative laparoscopy.
 DESIGN: Retrospective.
 SETTING: Private office and outpatient surgical center.
 PATIENTS: Sixty-two patients who were to undergo diagnostic and operative laparoscopy as part of their infertility evaluation underwent concomitant CC-stimulated GIFT.
 Any significant pelvic pathology was treated in conjunction with the GIFT procedure.
 RESULTS: The average number of oocytes retrieved per laparoscopy was 3.4 and an ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) of 24.6% was attained.
 Endometriosis, pelvic adhesive disease, and myoma were treated laparoscopically in conjunction with the GIFT procedure.
 CONCLUSION: Clomiphene citrate-induced GIFT in conjunction with diagnostic and operative laparoscopy results in an acceptable ongoing PR without significantly interfering with any operative laparoscopy procedure required.
