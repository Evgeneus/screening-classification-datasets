Chlamydia trachomatis: female pelvic infection.
 Chlamydia trachomatis is a bacterium that causes both symptomatic and asymptomatic infection.
 This infection has been associated with severe infections of the upper genital tract, such as salpingitis, which may be responsible for a significant number of cases of ectopic pregnancy and infertility.
 An unsettled question is the role of C.
 trachomatis in pregnant patients.
 In addition to causing cervicitis, it has been linked to chorioamnionitis, premature rupture of membranes, and premature delivery.
 However, chlamydial infection is an easily treatable disease.
 The main focus of prevention is appropriate prescreening of patients at risk.
