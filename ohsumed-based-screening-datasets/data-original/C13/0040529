Endometrial morphology in asymptomatic postmenopausal women.
 Few data are available regarding endometrial histologic features in asymptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
 This study encompasses endometrial biopsy specimens obtained from 801 such women before enrollment in a multicenter study of estrogen-progestin replacement.
 One endometrial cancer was found (0.13%); four additional biopsy specimens showed atypia (total 0.63%).
 The endometrium was atrophic in 373 (46.9%), proliferative in 133 (16.7%), secretory in 54 (6.8%), and hyperplastic in 41 (5.2%).
 Insufficient tissue for diagnosis was obtained in 195 (24.5%).
 We conclude that the yield for neoplasia is so low that screening endometrial biopsy is not justified in asymptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.
