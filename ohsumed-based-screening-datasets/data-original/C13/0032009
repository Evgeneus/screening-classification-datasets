Complement activation in relation to development of preeclampsia.
 Six hundred eighty-five primigravidas followed as a series had complement activation evaluated by the formation of anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) and terminal C5b-9 complement complexes in venous blood.
 Samples for complement determinations were obtained four times during pregnancy, in pregnancy weeks 12-16, 20-24, 28-32, and 34-36.
 Seven of the women developed preeclampsia and one of them the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP syndrome).
 Eleven others with uncomplicated pregnancies were selected as a control group.
 Plasma samples were taken from these 18 women at delivery and 1 and 7 days after delivery.
 At delivery, plasma C5a levels were significantly greater in the preeclamptics than in controls, and four of the seven preeclamptics had elevated plasma C3a values compared with controls.
 One week after delivery, these plasma anaphylatoxins had returned to normal.
 Elevations of the anaphylatoxins could not be detected before the women developed clinical signs of preeclampsia.
 No alterations in terminal C5b-9 complement complexes could be observed in the women with preeclampsia.
 However, the women who developed HELLP syndrome had elevated plasma concentrations of C3a, C5a, and terminal C5b-9 complement complex at delivery.
 These values returned to the normal range 1 week after delivery.
 We conclude that complement activation in the systemic circulation does not occur early in pregnancy and that plasma concentrations of C3a, C5a, or terminal C5b-9 complement complex cannot be used as predictors of preeclampsia.
