Complications of coexisting chlamydial and gonococcal infections.
 Physicians need to take every opportunity to educate their patients regarding the pathogenesis of sexually transmitted diseases and the risks of acquiring them.
 If the current epidemic of these diseases is to be curtailed, concurrent infections must be detected and treated according to the guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control.
 In addition, cultures should be obtained and appropriate treatment administered to sexual partners of patients treated for gonorrhea, acute urethral syndrome, mucopurulent cervicitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, nongonococcal urethritis, and epididymitis.
 Finally, screening should be done in patient groups at high risk for chlamydial infection.
