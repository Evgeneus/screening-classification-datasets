Arias-Stella reaction in fallopian tube epithelium. A light and electron microscopic study with a review of the literature.
 Most pathologists are familiar with the Arias-Stella reaction in the endometrium, because it is seen in approximately 25% of curettage specimens during early pregnancy.
 However, the Arias-Stella reaction is exceedingly rare in the fallopian tube, and may be confused with herpetic infection or malignancy.
 This may result in unnecessary therapy.
 The authors present a case of Arias-Stella reaction in the fallopian tube and discuss the differential diagnosis of this condition.
