Fetal akinesia deformation sequence (Pena-Shokeir phenotype) associated with acquired intrauterine brain damage.
 An infant with Pena-Shokeir phenotype was born to a cocaine-using mother.
 The pathologic findings included polyhydramnios, facial anomalies, arthrogryposis, camptodactyly, pulmonary hypoplasia, and tetralogy of Fallot.
 The neuropathologic findings were diffuse brainstem and spinal cord neuronal degeneration and focal cerebral infarction, consistent with acquired intrauterine ischemic damage.
