Abdominal-retroperitoneal sacral colpopexy for the correction of vaginal prolapse.
 Complete genital or vaginal prolapse affects a large number of middle-aged to elderly females.
 Satisfactory correction of prolapse with maintenance of vaginal patency has been a challenge to the pelvic surgeon for many years.
 We present a retrospective review of 147 patients undergoing abdominal sacral colpopexy using dacron graft or expanded polytetrafluoroethylene.
 The anatomical basis of repair, operative technique, and results are described.
 Ninety-three percent of the patients experienced long-term success over 5 years, including those with previous failed repairs.
 Both short- and long-term complication rates were acceptable.
 Only four patients experienced graft erosion, and only one of those had recurrent prolapse.
 Abdominal sacral colpopexy offers those affected with genital prolapse an opportunity for long-term relief, with maintenance of a patent vagina.
