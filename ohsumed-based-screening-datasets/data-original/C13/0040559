Fetal hypertension induced by norepinephrine infusion and umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms in fetal sheep.
 This study was designed to examine the effects of fetal hypertension on the umbilical artery pulsatility index.
 Fetal arterial blood pressure and umbilical venous pressure were measured in eight sheep, 3 to 5 days after surgery.
 Umbilical blood flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter around the common umbilical vein.
 Umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms were obtained either by an indwelling 5 MHz pulsed Doppler device (n = 4) or transcutaneously by a 4 MHz continuous-wave Doppler device (n = 4).
 Fetal blood pressure was raised by intravenous infusion of norepinephrine 10 micrograms/min during 5 minutes.
 Norepinephrine infusion resulted in elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures, accompanied by a bradycardia during the first 3 minutes.
 Umbilical blood flow, calculated placental vascular resistance, and umbilical artery pulsatility index did not change.
 After atropine administration, the norepinephrine-induced elevated arterial and umbilical venous pressures were accompanied by tachycardia, increased umbilical blood flow, and no change in placental vascular resistance and umbilical artery pulsatility index.
 It is concluded that fetal arterial hypertension provoked by norepinephrine infusion has no effect on placental vascular resistance, umbilical blood flow, and umbilical artery pulsatility index.
