Shoulder dystocia.
 Shoulder entrapment during delivery is a true obstetric emergency that can result in significant maternal and infant trauma.
 Fetal macrosomia, maternal obesity, maternal diabetes and prolonged second stage of labor are associated risk factors.
 Infant complications of shoulder dystocia include traumatic brachial plexus injury, humeral fracture, clavicular fracture and severe birth asphyxia.
 With fetal shoulder entrapment, the mother may have significant hemorrhage, fourth-degree perineal lacerations and endometritis.
 Maneuvers to release the shoulder include closed-fist suprapubic pressure, downward pressure on the posterior shoulder, rotation of the anterior shoulder to the oblique position, rotation of the posterior shoulder beneath the pubic symphysis, release of the posterior arm and anterior rotation of the fetal body.
