The parental origin of the single X chromosome in Turner syndrome: lack of correlation with parental age or clinical phenotype.
 We have used X- and Y-linked RFLPs to determine the origin of the single X chromosome in 25 live-born individuals with Turner syndrome.
 We determined that 18 individuals retained a maternal X (Xm) and that seven retained the paternal X (Xp).
 No occult mosaicism was detected.
 We found no differences in either maternal or paternal ages for the two groups.
 The ratio of maternal X to paternal X is just over 2:1, which is consistent with the expected proportion of meiotic or mitotic products, with equal loss at each step, given the nonviability of 45,Y.
 Six phenotypic or physiologic characteristics were assessed: (1) birth weight, (2) height percentile at time of testing, (3) presence of a webbed neck, (4) cardiovascular abnormalities, (5) renal abnormalities, and (6) thyroid autoimmunity.
 There were no significant differences in birth weights or heights between the girls who retained the maternal X or the paternal X.
 In addition, no differences between the groups could be appreciated in the incidence of the physical, anatomic, or physiologic parameters assessed.
