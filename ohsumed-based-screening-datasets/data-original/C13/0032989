Selective injection of contrast media: inflammatory effects on rabbit fallopian tubes.
 The inflammatory effects of fallopian tube catheterization and selective injection of seven contrast agents (ethiodized oil, diatrizoate meglumine 52%, diatrizoate meglumine 66%, iothalamate meglumine 60%, iopamidol, ioxitol, and ioxaglate) were evaluated in 88 rabbits.
 The contrast agent used was randomly selected and selectively injected after unilateral catheterization; the contralateral side was used for control.
 Pathologic inspection of right and left uteri with attached fallopian tubes and ovaries was done without knowledge of side of catheterization or duration of time since catheterization.
 The degree and location of inflammation were noted.
 Inflammation disappeared by 4 days in five of seven contrast agents.
 Iothalamate meglumine 60% and iopamidol required 2 weeks for disappearance of inflammation.
 Essentially no inflammation was associated at any time with ioxaglate.
 These findings suggest that all of these contrast agents would be clinically acceptable for direct injection into the human fallopian tube.
