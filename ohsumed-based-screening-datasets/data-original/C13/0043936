Pelvic denervation for chronic pain associated with endometriosis: fact or fancy?
 The efficacy of presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments in the treatment of chronic pelvic pain has been debated for decades.
 These procedures used to be done mainly in women with normal pelves, but more recently they have been performed during conservative surgery for treatment of endometriosis.
 In the 1980s the rapid spread of laparoscopic surgery has led to an increasing number of endoscopic denervations in patients with chronic pelvic pain associated with endometriosis.
 However, an analysis of literature data has failed to prove that presacral neurectomy and amputation of the uterosacral ligaments are effective and did not demonstrate better results with the use of lasers rather than electrocoagulation.
 Moreover, no valid comparison has yet been made between laparotomy and laparoscopic methods.
