Ulcerated anogenital hemangioma of infancy.
 Ten female infants were referred for symptomatic hemangiomas in the anogenital area.
 (One had had steroid treatment prior to consultation.) The natural history of these lesions is well known.
 Virtually all will spontaneously involute over a period of years.
 However, the lesions reported were particularly troublesome because of repeated ulcerations and subsequent pain.
 Prior treatment had been local wound care with antibiotic ointment and Telfa-type dressings.
 After referral from a family practitioner or pediatrician, argon laser treatment was performed in an outpatient setting.
 Eight of the 10 patients were treated with local anesthesia, and 2 had general anesthesia.
 All lesions healed in 1 to 5 weeks.
 No patients referred during this period were excluded from this series.
 All who received treatment were included.
 All the lesions involuted following treatment.
 In our estimation, the final result is identical to what may be expected after spontaneous involution of an ulcerated or infected hemangioma.
 The major difference is that involution occurred in a few weeks in laser-treated patients rather than a period of months or years.
 Ulcerated hemangiomas of the anogenital area have significant morbidity that can be efficiently avoided with the use of argon laser therapy.
 Lesions of the anogenital area have a strong predilection for females.
