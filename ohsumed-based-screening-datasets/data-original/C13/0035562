Chronic ulcerations following topical therapy with 5-fluorouracil for vaginal human papillomavirus-associated lesions.
 Applied topically to the vagina, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cream is an effective therapy for human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated lesions of the vagina including condylomata acuminata and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia.
 Although the acute side effects of 5-FU therapy are well recognized, long-term sequelae of intravaginal 5-FU use have not been described in detail in the literature.
 To assess the incidence and clinical course of 5-FU-related vaginal mucosal alterations, we studied 220 patients who underwent 5-FU therapy for HPV-associated lesions of the vagina.
 Eighteen women (8.2%) had epithelial ulcers 6 months after completion of the 5-FU treatment.
 The incidence of ulcers was higher in women who used 5-FU for longer than 10 weeks compared with those who used it for 10 weeks or less (9.6 versus 5.7%; P = .05).
 All but one of the mucosal defects were in the vaginal fornices and/or the periphery of the ectocervix.
 The ulcers were mostly singular and measured 0.5-7 cm in greatest diameter.
 Fourteen patients (77.8%) had symptoms related to the ulcers including a serosanguineous or watery discharge (55.6%), postcoital spotting or bleeding (44.4%), irregular bleeding unrelated to intercourse (16.7%), and pain (5.6%).
 Spontaneous healing of the ulcers was protracted.
 Office methods of therapy including estrogen creams and cauterizing agents failed to accelerate healing as compared with untreated patients.
 Excision of the ulcer and primary closure of the wound was curative in all four cases in which it was used.
 We conclude that topical 5-FU therapy may lead to troublesome chronic mucosal ulcers that tend to persist despite conservative treatment attempts.
