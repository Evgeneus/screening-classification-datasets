Effect of low-dose aspirin on vascular refractoriness in angiotensin-sensitive primigravid women.
 The hypothesis that an enhanced vasopressor response to angiotensin II in pregnancy may be corrected by suppressing production of platelet thromboxane A2 with low-dose aspirin was tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
 We studied 36 normotensive primigravid women with an elevated blood pressure response to intravenously infused angiotensin II at 28 weeks' gestation; 18 women received 60 mg of aspirin daily and the same number received matched placebo until 34 weeks' gestation, when angiotensin-sensitivity was again determined.
 In women taking aspirin, values of thrombin-induced platelet malondialdehyde production were approximately 10% of those determined in the placebo group, indicating marked suppression of thromboxane A2 synthesis.
 In the aspirin group vascular refractoriness to angiotensin II was restored in 14 of 17 treated women, by comparison with 5 of 15 women in the placebo group who had remained normotensive.
 These results support the hypothesis that prostacyclin/thromboxane imbalance is an important pathophysiologic factor in the development of the enhanced angiotensin-sensitivity associated with pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders.
