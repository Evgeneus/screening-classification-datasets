Methotrexate therapy for persistent ectopic pregnancy after conservative laparoscopic management.
 Persistent ectopic pregnancy is a recognized complication of conservative laparoscopic surgery.
 Three such cases were treated successfully with methotrexate and citrovorum factor rescue.
 All three patients experienced mild lower abdominal pain for a maximum of 36 hours; no other adverse effects were noted.
 More experience with this therapy will be necessary before subsequent fertility rates can be determined.
