HIV infection. Managing exposure risks for the obstetrician/gynecologist.
 Human immunodeficiency virus infection in women is geographically widespread throughout the US.
 Infected blood is the single most important source for HIV transmission in the health care setting.
 Occupationally acquired HIV infection appears to be an uncommon event, with prospective studies thus far reporting an incidence of 0.6 per cent or less.
 Strategies for preventing transmission of HIV infection in an obstetric/gynecologic setting are a matter of appropriate barrier protection, good infection control technique, and a large measure of common sense.
