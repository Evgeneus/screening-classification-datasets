Randomized, prospective trial of leuprolide acetate and conventional superovulation in first cycles of in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian transfer.
 Ovarian stimulation after pituitary suppression with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) has been effective in women who have exhibited a poor response to conventional superovulation strategies.
 Their effectiveness in unselected women undergoing their first cycle of in vitro fertilization or gamete intrafallopian transfer, however, remains to be established.
 To address this question, we randomized 114 women to one of two treatment protocols.
 Protocol 1 consisted of 100 mg of clomiphene citrate on days 5 to 9, followed by 150 IU human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) beginning on day 9.
 Protocol 2 consisted of daily GnRH-a beginning in the midluteal phase.
 Stimulation with 150 IU hMG commenced after pituitary down regulation and ovarian suppression were achieved.
 Human menopausal gonadotropin was continued in both protocols until adequate follicular development and serum estradiol concentrations were obtained.
 Protocol 2 patients reached egg retrieval significantly more often (87%) than Protocol 1 patients (61%), but the mean number of mature eggs retrieved and the pregnancy rate per retrieval were not significantly different between the two groups.
