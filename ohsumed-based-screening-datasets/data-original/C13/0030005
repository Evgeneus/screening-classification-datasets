Antisperm antibody binding to human acrosin: a study of patients with unexplained infertility.
 OBJECTIVE: Antisperm antibody binding to acrosin was investigated by Western Blotting.
 The clinical significance of this binding specificity was assessed in a 2-year clinical follow-up.
 DESIGN: Consecutive serum samples positive for antisperm antibodies by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunobead testing were evaluated for acrosin-binding specificity.
 SETTING: The patients were followed in an outpatient setting by private infertility specialists.
 PATIENTS: Sixty-five consecutive infertile referral patients with positive antisperm antibody were evaluated.
 Clinical follow-up was obtained on 8 of 9 females with evidence of antibody binding to acrosin and 19 of 26 females with no specific binding to acrosin.
 INTERVENTIONS: Prednisone therapy was given during six courses of intrauterine insemination with husband's sperm.
 All treatment decisions were made by private physicians independent of the acrosin-binding result.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pregnancy status was obtained as part of a 2-year follow-up.
 RESULTS: Acrosin-binding specificity was demonstrated in 10 (15%) of the 65 patients.
 Two of the 8 women (25%) with antibody binding to acrosin and 6 of the 19 women (32%) with antisperm antibodies but no specific binding to acrosin delivered normal children.
 CONCLUSIONS: Although antibody-binding specificity to acrosin could be demonstrated, a 2-year clinical follow-up showed no difference in pregnancy rates when compared with women with antisperm antibodies showing no binding specificity to acrosin.
