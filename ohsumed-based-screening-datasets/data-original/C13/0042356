Maternal plasma corticotrophin-releasing hormone--elevated in preterm labour but unaffected by indomethacin or nylidrin.
 The role of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) in preterm labour was studied in 23 women in preterm labour at between 26 and 33 weeks gestation who were randomly allocated to receive treatment with indomethacin (n = 11) or with nylidrin a beta-sympathomimetic agent (n = 12).
 Maternal plasma CRH in the preterm group (median 70, range 9-597 pmol/l) before therapy was higher (P less than 0.05) than that in 23 control pregnancies, without uterine contractions, matched for gestational age (median 51, range 4-127 pmol/l).
 CHR levels determined after 3 and 24 h of treatment showed a 10% decrease in the indomethacin group and 10-20% decrease in the nylidrin group, but these changes were not statistically significant.
 After cessation of uterine contractions during tocolysis, 12 women proceeded to give birth preterm (less than 37 weeks) and their pretreatment CRH levels (median 195, range 9-597 pmol/l) were higher (P less than 0.05) than those in women whose pregnancy proceeded to term (median 52, range 16-207 pmol/l).
 In another group of women, full-term labour was not accompanied by any changes in maternal CRH levels.
 Umbilical plasma CRH levels were 1.1-9.8% of the paired maternal levels and did not rise with advancing gestational age.
 Nor had the type of delivery (elective caesarean section before labour, or preterm or term vaginal delivery) any effect on fetal CRH levels.
