Human immunoglobulin therapy for preeclampsia associated with lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody.
 A patient with lupus anticoagulant and anticardiolipin antibody developed preeclampsia at 24 weeks' gestation.
 Therapy with human immunoglobulin (Ig) resulted in stabilization of preeclampsia and suppression of the lupus anticoagulant.
 Anticardiolipin antibody titers were partially suppressed.
 Preeclampsia worsened at 32 weeks' gestation, and a healthy infant was delivered.
 For patients with preeclampsia secondary to lupus anticoagulant before the fetus is viable, human Ig is a potential therapeutic option.
