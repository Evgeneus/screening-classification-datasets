Laparoscopic treatment of painful perihepatic adhesions in Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome.
 This report illustrates a case of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome associated with pelvic inflammatory disease in which the clinical symptom of right upper quadrant pain was severe and persistent despite appropriate antibiotic therapy.
 Because of the atypical course, an extensive work-up was performed to rule out other possible etiologies for the pain.
 In this context, a laparoscopy was performed and identified dense adhesions between the liver and the anterior abdominal wall.
 These adhesions were safely and successfully lysed using a KTP/532 laser through a second puncture site.
 After surgery the pain was completely resolved, with no further recurrence after 6 months of follow-up.
