Multicentric cloacogenic carcinoma: report of a case with anogenital pruritus at presentation.
 A case of multicentric cloacogenic carcinoma of the perianal skin and vulva in a 79-year-old woman is presented, and the embryologic basis for the multicentricity is discussed.
 Histologically, cloacogenic carcinoma can be differentiated from other small cell neoplasms that affect the area.
 Cloacogenic carcinoma should be considered a rare cause of anogenital pruritus.
 It is important to perform an early biopsy of anogenital lesions that do not respond to conventional therapy.
