Sexually transmitted diseases.
 Over the past two decades the incidence of STDs has dramatically increased in the United States.
 Most patients with these infections present first to primary care physicians.
 All physicians must be familiar with the common STD syndromes and the indications for specific diagnostic tests in order to provide a comprehensive treatment plan.
 Primary prevention strategies based on patient education and secondary prevention through judicious use of screening tests in appropriate settings can also limit the morbidity associated with STDs.
