Hypoxic acidemia, hyperviscosity, and maternal hypertension do not affect the umbilical arterial velocity waveform in fetal sheep.
 The effect of hypoxic acidemia, hyperviscosity, and maternal hypertension on the umbilical arterial velocity waveform was studied in 23 chronically catheterized fetal sheep.
 Fetal hypoxic acidemia induced by lowering the maternal inspired oxygen concentration (n = 7) caused no change in the ratio of systolic/diastolic blood velocity even when fetal arterial pH was as low as 6.8.
 Fetal blood hyperviscosity (n = 7) induced by exchange transfusion with packed maternal blood cells increased placental vascular resistance by greater than or equal to 50% but had no significant effect on the systolic/diastolic ratio.
 Similarly, maternal hypertension induced by intravenous infusion of angiotensin II to the ewe (n = 9) did not affect the systolic/diastolic ratio despite a 50% increase in maternal arterial blood pressure.
 We conclude that umbilical arterial velocity waveform abnormalities observed in growth-restricted human fetuses are probably not a direct result of fetal hypoxemia or hyperviscosity or maternal hypertension.
