Dopa reaction test in hair bulbs of fetuses and its application to the prenatal diagnosis of albinism.
 No information is available on the amount of tyrosinase normally present in fetuses.
 A dopa reaction test in hair bulbs from the scalp of normal fetuses obtained after abortion showed that tyrosinase is present in fetuses as early as 17 weeks.
 Only faint activity was detected in skin specimens other than from the scalp.
 This assay can serve as a quick and reliable method for the prenatal diagnosis of tyrosinase-negative albinism.
