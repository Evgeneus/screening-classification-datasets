Obstetrical anaesthesia for patients with the syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets.
 The syndrome of haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets (HELLP Syndrome) is a consequence of severe preeclampsia/eclampsia.
 The clinical course is characterized by an unusual presentation with abdominal pain, and manifestations of inadequate haemostasis and excessive bleeding are common.
 Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality are high.
 We report our experience with 33 patients over a five-year period.
 The mean gestational age (GA) of the pregnancies was 34 +/- 2.8 wk including 11 patients who delivered 12 neonates of less than 34 wk GA.
 The most common presenting complaints were right upper quadrant or epigastric pain in 25 patients (76%) and nausea or vomiting in 14 patients (42%).
 Diagnosis was missed or delayed in 12 patients (36%).
 Thirty-one patients (94%) were delivered by Caesarean section and a deteriorating maternal condition was the most common indication for operative delivery.
 Twenty-three patients received general anaesthesia, eight received epidural anaesthesia and there were no complications related to the anaesthetic.
 There was clinical evidence of abnormal haemostasis: seven patients had excessive blood loss at Caesarean section, two had postpartum haemorrhage, three developed DIC and four developed wound haematoma.
 The average decrease in haemoglobin concentration was 32 g.L-1 and twelve patients (36%) received blood transfusions.
 There was one stillbirth.
 There were no neonatal deaths but morbidity was prominent and related primarily to prematurity.
 Delayed or missed diagnosis is common in HELLP syndrome and a premature delivery by Caesarean section is usual.
