Management of deep venous thrombosis in the pregnant female.
 Deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities is an uncommon but dreaded complication of pregnancy which can present diagnostic and therapeutic problems to the treating physician.
 From January 1, 1985, to December 31, 1988, 7867 deliveries were performed at St.
 Luke's Hospital.
 Five of these patients were pregnant women who were treated for deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities.
 The women were either in their second or third trimester of pregnancy.
 The clinical diagnosis in each case was confirmed with duplex ultrasonography.
 Each patient was treated with 7 to 10 days of intravenous heparin therapy and then discharged on subcutaneous heparin therapy.
 There were no bleeding complications related to the heparin therapy.
 No patient developed a pulmonary embolism.
 Each patient delivered a normal child.
 The only complication was a heparin induced rash in one patient which resolved when a different preparation of heparin was used.
 The management of deep venous thrombosis in pregnancy is discussed.
