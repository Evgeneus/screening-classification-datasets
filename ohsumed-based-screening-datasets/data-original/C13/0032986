High-signal-intensity rim surrounding uterine leiomyomas on MR images: pathologic correlation.
 A high-intensity rim surrounding uterine leiomyomas was identified on T2-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images in five of 13 patients with histopathologically confirmed leiomyomas.
 These peripheral high-intensity rims were not associated with subject age or with size, location, or degeneration of the leiomyomas.
 Histologic examination revealed markedly dilated lymphatic vessels, dilated veins, edema, or a combination of these features to correspond to the location of the high-intensity rims.
 These benign causes of high intensity in the myometrium should not be confused with clinically important processes such as adenomyosis or invasion by endometrial carcinoma.
