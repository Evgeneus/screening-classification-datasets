Lymphography--current role in oncology.
 A review of the use of lymphography at this hospital, a major oncology centre, is presented.
 The advent of computed tomography has brought a dramatic reduction in the number of lymphograms currently performed for diseases such as lymphoma, testicular tumours and gynaecological malignancies.
 This study analyses the reasons for this decline, and concludes that valuable information can still be obtained from lymphography in certain selected groups of patients.
