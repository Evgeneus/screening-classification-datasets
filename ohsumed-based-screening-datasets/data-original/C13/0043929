Prenatal diagnosis of fetal cytomegalovirus infection.
 Twelve fetuses were evaluated with a combination of ultrasonography, amniocentesis, and blood sampling for possible cytomegalovirus infection.
 In seven the mother had a documented primary cytomegalovirus infection.
 All seven women had normal ultrasonographic findings and one fetus was found to be infected.
 In the other five cases fetal cytomegalovirus infection was diagnosed in association with abnormal ultrasonographic findings.
 There was no history of maternal infection in the latter group.
 All positive and negative diagnoses were confirmed and none of the six infected fetuses survived.
 In this series, the most reliable parameters of infection were the isolation of the virus from amniotic fluid and elevations of total immunoglobulin M and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in fetal blood.
 In the majority of infected fetuses cytomegalovirus-specific immunoglobulin M was not detected in blood.
 Prenatal diagnosis of fetal cytomegalovirus infection is possible with a combination of amniocentesis and fetal blood sampling.
