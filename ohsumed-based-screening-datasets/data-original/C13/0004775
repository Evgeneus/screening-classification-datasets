Herpes simplex virus type 2 meningitis without genital lesions: an immunoblot study.
 Two sexually active female patients presented with acute meningitis.
 The CSF abnormalities were severe and persistent.
 In spite of the absence of genital lesions, serological studies revealed a primary infection by herpes simplex virus type 2.
 An immunoblot study revealed intrathecal synthesis of anti-herpes antibodies early in the course of the disease.
