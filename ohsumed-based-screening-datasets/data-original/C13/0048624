Combined intrafallopian/intrauterine reduction of a quintuplet gestation.
 We describe the first successful outcome of a case of combined tubal and intrauterine quadruplet pregnancy in the literature.
 The patient's risk factors for combined pregnancy included a history of PID as well as the use of hMG therapy.
 A laparoscopic salpingectomy was performed, followed by a multifetal pregnancy reduction procedure.
 Two healthy infants were delivered at 37 weeks of gestation.
