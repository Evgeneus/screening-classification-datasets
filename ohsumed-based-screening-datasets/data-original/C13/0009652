Success of a program of routine prenatal screening for hepatitis B surface antigen: the first 2 years.
 Prenatal screening for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) restricted to women with defined risk factors for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection fails to identify many carriers.
 A centralized program of routine HBsAg screening for all pregnant women in Alberta was introduced in 1985.
 We collected and analysed data for the first 2 years of the program in Edmonton to determine the frequency of risk factors for HBsAg positivity, the proportion of multiparous HBsAg-positive women not identified in previous pregnancies, the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of providing immunoprophylaxis to infants at risk of HBV infection and the degree of success in inducing adequate protection.
 A total of 149 women (158 pregnancies) were found to be HBsAg positive.
 Risk factors were readily ascertainable for 85% of the women; the remaining 15% would not have been identified through risk-selective screening.
 The most common risk factors were Oriental ethnic origin, history of hepatitis, jaundice or multiple transfusions of blood or blood products, and occupational exposure to blood.
 Although 86% of the multiparous HBsAg-positive women had risk factors, only 7% had been identified in previous pregnancies.
 The Alberta program appears to be cost-effective.
 We conclude that only routine prenatal screening will identify all infants at risk of perinatal HBV infection and that a comprehensive public health program involving central laboratories, private physicians and public health staff can be highly effective and efficient in protecting infants against hepatitis B.
