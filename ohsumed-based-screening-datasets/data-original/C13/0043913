Vasopressin and operative hysteroscopy in the management of delayed postabortion and postpartum bleeding.
 Two women, one with refractory postabortion hemorrhage and the other with refractory postpartum hemorrhage, were managed with vasopressin, operative hysteroscopy, and a dilute vasopressin pack.
 Both patients had been treated by standard methods (i.e., dilation and curettage) and both were being prepared for a surgical intervention procedure.
 It was decided in both cases to try to slow the bleeding by injection of vasopressin paracervically and then performance of operative hysteroscopy.
 In both cases, the injection of dilute vasopressin paracervically when coupled with operative hysteroscopy was quite effective in determining the cause of the bleeding and was instrumental in avoiding major operative procedures.
