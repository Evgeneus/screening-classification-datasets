Surgical treatment of endometriosis at the time of gamete intrafallopian transfer.
 Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) was performed on 77 women with endometriosis in 92 cycles with or without concomitant laser therapy or electrofulguration of endometriosis.
 The pregnancy rates were 45% for laser cases, 25% for electrofulguration cases and 36.4% for GIFT only.
 The pregnancy rate for stage III endometriosis was 53% versus 14% and 47% for stages II and I, respectively.
 Although there was a trend toward an increased pregnancy yield with active therapy, no statistically significant difference was achieved.
 The postoperative fecundity in patients not conceiving with GIFT was poor for all the groups.
