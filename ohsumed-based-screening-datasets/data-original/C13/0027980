Issues in adolescent gynecologic care.
 Adolescence is a period of transition from childhood to adulthood.
 During this period, the potential for high-risk behaviors that may negatively impact on gynecologic health care are great.
 To enhance the potential for optimal care of this group of individuals, the physician must understand that (1) adolescents must be active participants in the decision making concerning their gynecologic health, (2) adolescents need to be able to communicate their concerns about gynecologic health in a confidential forum, and (3) there are areas of early gynecologic development and maturation for which anticipatory guidance is required.
