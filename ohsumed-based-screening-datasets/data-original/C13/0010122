Craniofacial anomalies in twins.
 Studies of twins provide insight into the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in the causality of structural anomalies.
 Thirty-five affected twin pairs were identified from a group of 1114 patients with congenital craniofacial deformities evaluated from 1972 to 1989.
 Forty-three of these 70 twins exhibited one or more craniofacial anomalies; these were analyzed for dysmorphic characteristics, zygosity, concordance, and family history.
 The anomalies were categorized into two groups: malformations and deformations.
 The malformations (n = 36) included hemifacial microsomia (n = 10), cleft lip and palate (n = 8), cleft palate (n = 4), rare facial cleft (n = 2), craniosynostosis (n = 2), Binder syndrome (n = 2), Treacher Collins syndrome (n = 2), craniopagus (n = 2), CHARGE association (n = 1), frontonasal dysplasia (n = 2), and constricted ears (n = 1).
 The deformations (n = 7) included plagiocephaly (n = 5), hemifacial hypoplasia (n = 1), and micrognathia (n = 1).
 Twenty-one monozygotic and 14 dizygotic twin pairs were identified.
 The concordance rate was 33 percent for monozygotic twins and 7 percent for dizygotic twins.
