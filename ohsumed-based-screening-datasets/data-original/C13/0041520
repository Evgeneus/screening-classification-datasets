Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus in children.
 The symptoms, findings, associated conditions, and treatment of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus were studied in 10 girls and one boy.
 Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a benign but chronic condition of the anogenital area of girls and, less frequently, of boys.
 The characteristic lesions are hypo-pigmented plaques in a figure-of-8 pattern surrounding the vulva and anus and often involving the natal cleft.
 The affected hypopigmented skin is sharply demarcated from the normal skin.
 Hemorrhagic, bullous lesions are uncommon.
 Fissures and ulcers are seen on the labia, between the labia, and on the perineum, anus, and natal cleft in many children and on the glans penis in boys.
 Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus causes painful defecation and anal and vulval bleeding.
 In two patients, one girl and one boy, anal stenosis due to lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and laxative treatment developed.
 Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus mimics sexual abuse and has led to false accusation and investigations.
 The anogenital lesions cleared in three patients at the ages of 9, 11, and 12 years, but lesions can persist into adulthood.
