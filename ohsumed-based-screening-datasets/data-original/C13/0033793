Making sense of dysfunctional uterine bleeding.
 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is abnormal vaginal bleeding originating in the uterus and caused by a hormonal mechanism.
 Other sources and causes of vaginal bleeding should be considered before the diagnosis is established.
 Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is diagnosed on the basis of the history and physical examination, supported by other investigations, particularly endometrial sampling.
 An appropriate management plan can be developed for each patient, depending on the ovulatory state, endometrial thickness and reproductive phase, as well as the quantity and duration of bleeding.
