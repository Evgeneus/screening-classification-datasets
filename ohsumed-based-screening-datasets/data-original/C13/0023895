Establishment and characterization of a new cell line TC-YIK originating from argyrophil small cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix integrating HPV16 DNA.
 A new cell line, designated TC-YIK, was established from YIK-1 tumor cells, derived from argyrophil small cell carcinoma (ASCC) of the uterine cervix, and serially heterotransplanted into nude mice, integrating human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) DNA.
 The population doubling time of TC-YIK was approximately 21.6 hours at the 119th subculture.
 Subcutaneous injection of 1 x 10(8) TC-YIK cells into nude mice yielded a solid tumor.
 The cytologic appearance of TC-YIK was similar to that of YIK-1.
 The TC-YIK cells contained argyrophil granules and neurosecretory granules in the cytoplasm and showed positive immunohistochemical staining for neuron-specific enolase, serotonin, and chromogranin.
 Thus, TC-YIK retained the histochemical characteristics of ASCC.
 The TC-YIK cells contained HPV16 DNA in a multiple-copy integrated form and actively transcribed the integrated HPV16 genome.
 Amplification of the c-myc oncogene was observed in the TC-YIK cells.
 These data suggest that TC-YIK is a useful in vitro experimental model of ASCC and that HPV16 and c-myc may play some role in the genesis of this malignant tumor and/or maintenance of the transformed TC-YIK phenotype.
