Doppler evaluation of umbilical and uterine-arcuate arteries in the postdates pregnancy.
 To assess the correlation between Doppler velocimetry and perinatal outcome in the postdates pregnancy, 75 women who were at least 41 weeks' gestation were evaluated twice weekly until delivery.
 Evaluation included Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical and uterine-arcuate arteries, as well as nonstress testing and amniotic fluid volume estimation.
 The mean umbilical artery systolic-diastolic ratio (S/D) was significantly higher in the pregnancies with subsequent abnormal perinatal outcomes than in those with normal outcomes (2.42 versus 2.19; P = .03).
 Using a receiver operating characteristic curve, an abnormal umbilical artery S/D was defined as 2.40 or greater.
 Using this value, sensitivity was 57.1% and specificity was 77.8%.
 Our study suggests that an umbilical artery S/D of 2.40, rather than the more traditionally accepted cutoff of 3.0, may be a useful threshold to identify those postdates pregnancies at high risk for abnormal perinatal outcome.
