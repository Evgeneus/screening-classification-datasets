A comparative analysis of the cycle fecundity rates associated with combined human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and intrauterine insemination (IUI) versus either hMG or IUI alone.
 Human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) superovulation combined with washed intrauterine insemination (IUI) has been advocated for the treatment of various forms of infertility when more traditional therapy has failed.
 To assess the relative efficacy of combined treatment with hMG and IUI compared with either hMG or IUI alone, pregnancy outcomes of the three treatment groups were compared in couples having infertility because of male factor, cervical factor, endometriosis, or unexplained.
 A total of 751 cycles were analyzed from 322 couples.
 The mean cycle fecundity rate associated with hMG/IUI therapy was significantly higher than either hMG or IUI therapy alone for all patients (hMG/IUI = 19.6%, hMG = 6.3%, IUI = 3.4%).
 The improvement in cycle fecundity rates with hMG/IUI therapy was also observed when the couples were separated by infertility diagnostic groups: male factor (hMG/IUI = 15.3%, hMG = 4.4%, IUI = 3.0%), cervical factor (hMG/IUI = 26.3%, hMG = 7.9%, IUI = 5.1%), endometriosis (hMG/IUI = 12.85%, hMG = 6.6%), and unexplained infertility (hMG/IUI = 32.6%, hMG = 5.5%, IUI = 0%).
 Moreover, in patients who had failed to conceive with hMG or IUI alone, the cycle fecundity rate when they were switched to hMG/IUI therapy equaled that of patients who received combined therapy from the onset.
 We conclude that cycle fecundity rates and cumulative pregnancy rates are significantly greater using a combination of hMG and IUI compared with either modality alone in the treatment of male factor, cervical factor, endometriosis, or unexplained infertility.
 Indeed, in couples with nontubal related infertility, cycle fecundity rates with hMG/IUI approach the rates seen with in vitro fertilization and gamete intrafallopian tube transfer.
