The long-term effects of radiation therapy on patients with ovarian dysgerminoma.
 A retrospective chart review and questionnaire study was undertaken to look at the long-term effects of radiation therapy in ovarian dysgerminoma patients.
 Forty-three patients and 55 controls responded to a questionnaire that detailed bowel, bladder, thyroid, menstrual, reproductive, sexual, and growth function.
 Statistically significant differences in the number of bowel movements were noticed when comparing patients with controls.
 The authors noticed no significant differences between cases and controls in bladder function.
 No thyroid disorders were attributable to mediastinal radiation therapy.
 Most patients with intact uteri bleed monthly on hormonal replacement.
 Three patients with a remaining ovary and uterus resumed menstrual function after substantial doses of abdominopelvic radiation therapy.
 No patients have conceived.
 The authors noticed a slight increase in dyspareunia in the treated group, but most patients were satisfied with their sexual function.
 One premenarchal patient exhibited a growth disorder.
