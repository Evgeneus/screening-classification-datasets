Cigarette smoking during pregnancy in relation to placenta previa.
 To evaluate the relationship between cigarette smoking and the occurrence of placenta previa, we used interview and medical record data to conduct a case-control analysis of 69 placenta previa cases and 12,351 controls.
 The unadjusted relative risk estimate of placenta previa for women reported to have "ever smoked" during pregnancy relative to nonsmoking mothers was 1.9 (95% confidence interval, 1.2 to 3.0).
 The risk rose after adjusting for potential confounders (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 5.5).
 In contrast to a previous report, the duration of smoking was not an independent risk factor for placenta previa.
 These results suggest that cigarette smoking during pregnancy is a determinant of placenta previa.
 Carbon monoxide hypoxemia, which is one possible mechanism for this association, may result in compensatory placental hypertrophy.
 Placentas with increased surface areas are more likely to cover the cervical os, causing placenta previa.
