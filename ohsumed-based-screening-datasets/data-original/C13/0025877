Parenchymal pulmonary endometriosis.
 Parenchymal pulmonary endometriosis is an extremely rare but well described condition.
 We present four new cases, and discuss the examination and treatment of these patients.
 We conclude that the condition may be underdiagnozed, and that it is a relatively harmless disorder.
 We propose treatment with progesterone as the first choice of treatment.
 None of our patients needed surgical treatment.
