Unexplained displacement of ipsilateral ovary and fallopian tube.
 During routine laparoscopy, the right fallopian tube and ovary were noted to be displaced.
 Ovarian and fallopian tube tissue were found on biopsy of adjacent omentum.
 The most probable cause is asymptomatic torsion of the right adnexum; therefore, evaluation of the renal system with intravenous pyelogram is probably not necessary.
