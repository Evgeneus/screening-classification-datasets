Extrapulmonary tuberculosis in an immigrant society: clinical and demographic aspects of 92 cases.
 Extrapulmonary tuberculosis accounted for 33% of all new cases of tuberculosis identified at the Soroka Medical Center in Beer Sheva, Israel, during a 10-year period.
 The most common types of extrapulmonary infection diagnosed were genitourinary tuberculosis (54% of patients), lymphadenitis (13%), pleural tuberculosis (9%), and tuberculosis of bones and joints (8%).
 Of 92 patients, 51% were Jews of Ethiopian origin, 29% were Jews of non-Ethiopian origin, and 20% were Bedouins.
 Thus, extrapulmonary tuberculosis remains a significant problem for Israel's heterogeneous population.
