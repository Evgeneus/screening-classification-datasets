Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections in women. Prevalence, risks and management at a South African infertility clinic.
 Chlamydia trachomatis, Mycoplasma hominis and Ureaplasma urealyticum infections not only jeopardize fertility but also pose a risk for infertility treatment and resulting pregnancies.
 Routine screening tests or empirical antibiotic treatment of infertile couples may be justified by the prevalence of these organisms.
 We studied the wives in 40 consecutive infertile couples.
 Monoclonal direct immunofluorescence (DIF) for C trachomatis was performed on fixed smears from endocervical swabs.
 M hominis and U urealyticum were isolated by inoculation of Hayflick (HF) medium, HF broth and Ureaplasma A7 agar with endocervical swabs.
 Using DIF, 11 (27.5%) specimens were positive, 25 (62.5%) were negative, and 4 (10.0%) were equivocal.
 DIF was repeated on smears from three of the last four patients; all three were positive for C trachomatis.
 One patient was lost to follow-up and excluded from the study.
 For the total 39 specimens the final results were 14 (35.9%) positive and 25 (64.1%) negative.
 M hominis was isolated from 3 (7.5%) endocervical swabs.
 None of the endocervical swabs yielded a culture positive for U urealyticum.
 Statistical analysis showed no correlation between the clinical history and presence of infection with any of the three organisms.
 The prevalence of 35.9% for C trachomatis was surprisingly high for an infertile population and, if supported by culture confirmation, justifies routine screening.
 The potential adverse effects of these organisms on the success rate of highly specialized infertility treatments are essentially unresolved.
 Since our analysis of cost effectiveness as applicable to our unit, all new infertile couples are treated empirically with lymecycline.
