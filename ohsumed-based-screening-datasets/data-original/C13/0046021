Management of low-grade cervical dysplasia during pregnancy.
 Fifty-five pregnant patients referred to my colposcopy service from 1985 to 1990 for biopsy-proven mild dysplasia were entered into a program of serial evaluations, including Pap test, colposcopy, and directed biopsy if indicated.
 The evaluations were done every 12 weeks during pregnancy and at 6 weeks postpartum to rule out new or occult invasive cervical cancer.
 By the time the postpartum biopsy was done, no such cancer had been detected.
 All 55 patients had mild dysplasia or less.
 I conclude that pregnant patients with biopsy-proven mild cervical dysplasia who have had adequate expert colposcopy and results of Pap test consistent with biopsy require only one antepartum colposcopy prior to postpartum reevaluation and treatment.
 Multiple interval cytologic and colposcopic studies with or without biopsy are unnecessary.
 The likelihood of invasive cervical cancer developing in these patients during pregnancy is negligible.
