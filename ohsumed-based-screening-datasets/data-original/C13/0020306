Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine in women with endometriosis.
 Young women with endometriosis have reduced cortical and trabecular bone mineral density of the wrist compared with age-matched controls.
 This conclusion was based on 41 subjects from one geographical location.
 The purpose of this study was to test this finding in a larger, more geographically diverse population.
 One hundred women with laparoscopically proven endometriosis were enrolled in this study for the evaluation of the efficacy of nafarelin, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.
 Patients were recruited from nine investigators across the United States and Canada, and bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was obtained at baseline, with 6 Hologic QDR (Hologic Inc., Waltham, MA) and a Lunar DPX (Lunar Radiation Corp., Madison, WI) instrument.
 The age of the women was 30.3 +/- 5.8 years (mean +/- SD); 91% were white.
 Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine was 1.1 +/- 0.11 g/cm2 (n = 85 Hologic QDR) and 1.2 +/- 0.93 g/cm2 (n = 15 Lunar DPX).
 Hologic bone mineral density was 104.8 +/- 11.0 and Lunar bone mineral density was 103.4% +/- 7.8% of normal values for age.
 To conclude, in a population based cross-sectional study of patients with endometriosis, we do not observe low bone mineral density of the lumbar spine by techniques that measure a combination of cortical and trabecular bone.
