Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization 
 Obstruction of the uterine (proximal) end of the fallopian tube is noted on up to 20% of hysterosalpingograms and has a variety of underlying causes.
 Definitive diagnosis and treatment in the past have required laparoscopy or laparotomy with tubal resection.
 Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization with fluoroscopically guided catheters has emerged as an improved method both for diagnosis and treatment in these patients.
 Technical success rates for overcoming the obstruction and visualizing distal tubal anatomy range from 76% to 95%.
 Pregnancy rates after the procedure vary depending on the patient populations studied; however, early results indicate a greater than 50% intrauterine pregnancy rate by 1 year.
 The rate of ectopic pregnancy is approximately 10% and that of early tubal reocclusion is less than 30%.
 Selective salpingography and fallopian tube recanalization is recommended as the first intervention in patients with obstruction of the proximal fallopian tube.
