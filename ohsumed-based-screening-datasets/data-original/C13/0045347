Anaesthetic management of myocardial infarction in a parturient.
 Myocardial infarction is encountered rarely during pregnancy, but when it occurs the event is life-threatening to both mother and fetus.
 Data on maternal and fetal outcome are limited, but overall maternal mortality approaches 35%, and 40% of deaths occur during the third trimester.
 We present a case of myocardial infarction occurring at 38 weeks gestation, and discuss the anaesthetic management of the problems encountered during labour and delivery.
