Conservative management of ectopic pregnancy: prospective randomized clinical trial of methotrexate versus prostaglandin sulprostone by combined transvaginal and systemic administration.
 In a prospective randomized study, 21 patients with an unruptured tubal pregnancy were treated with local and systemic injection.
 On the day of diagnosis, methotrexate (MTX) (1 mg/kg) or sulprostone (500 micrograms) were injected into the gestational sac under transvaginal sonographic control.
 The systemic component consisted of an intramuscular injection of MTX (1 mg/kg) 3, 5, and 7 days after local injection or of sulprostone (500 micrograms) on the 1st 2 postlocal injection days.
 Methotrexate therapy was successful in 8 of 12 patients and sulprostone therapy in 6 of 9.
 Laparoscopy was then performed on the 7 unsuccessful patients: 3 of them had pain and hemoperitoneum and 4 of them had rising human choriogonadotropin (hCG) levels.
 One stomatitis after MTX and one cramping abdominal pain were observed.
 Thirteen of 14 successfully treated patients had initial hCG levels less than 5,000 mIU/mL.
 At subsequent hysterosalpinography, 13 of 14 patients had normal tubal configuration and patency.
 Three of 10 patients who desired another pregnancy had already achieved a normal intrauterine pregnancy.
 These results suggest that MTX and sulprostone were equally effective, and medical approach for the unruptured ectopic pregnancy may be restricted to patients with hCG less than 5,000 mIU/mL.
