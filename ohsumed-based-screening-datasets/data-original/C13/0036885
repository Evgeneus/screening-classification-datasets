Transcervical endoscopic verification of congenital anomalies in the second trimester of pregnancy.
 Transcervical endoscopy was used to confirm prenatally diagnosed anomalies before elective termination of pregnancy.
 A complete anatomic survey was accomplished in 10 (70%) of 14 cases studied.
 Information was added to the ultrasonographic diagnosis in two cases, which changed the diagnosis in one fetus.
