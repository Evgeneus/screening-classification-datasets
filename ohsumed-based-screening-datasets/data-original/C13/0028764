Phospholipase activity in the endometrium of women with normal menstrual blood loss and women with proven ovulatory menorrhagia.
 The activity of phospholipase A2 types 1 and 2 and phospholipase C was measured in the endometrium of women with ovulatory menorrhagia and in those with normal menstrual blood loss.
 In both groups of subjects phospholipase A2 type 1 activity was significantly higher in the secretory phase than in the proliferative phase (P less than 0.001).
 The median activity (pmol/mg protein/min) for the proliferative phase was 27.6 in normal subjects and 40.4 in women with ovulatory menorrhagia and for the secretory phase the median activity was 144.5 in normal women and 138.1 in women with ovulatory menorrhagia.
 There was no difference between the two groups of women at either stage of the cycle.
 Phospholipase A2 type 2 activity was also higher in the secretory phase than in the proliferative phase (P less than 0.05 for normal subjects and P less than 0.001 for women with menorrhagia).
 The median activity (pmol/mg protein/min) for the proliferative phase was 94.4 (normal subjects) and 56.6 (women with menorrhagia) and for the secretory phase 148.3 (normal subjects) and 142.5 (women with menorrhagia).
 The activity of phospholipase A2 type 2 was significantly lower in the proliferative phase of women with ovulatory menorrhagia compared with normal subjects (P less than 0.05).
 Phospholipase C activity (nmol/mg protein/min) was significantly higher in women with ovulatory menorrhagia (median 8.2) compared with women with normal blood loss (median 5.5) (P less than 0.01).
