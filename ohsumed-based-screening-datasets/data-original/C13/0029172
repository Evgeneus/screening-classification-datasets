Pregnancy-induced changes in drug metabolism in epileptic women.
 The pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs may be altered during pregnancy, resulting in decline of serum concentrations and subsequent suboptimal control of seizures.
 We investigated changes which may occur during pregnancy in hepatic drug handling by comparing metabolic ratios of 15 pregnant epileptic women to 15 nonpregnant epileptic women, as well as 10 pregnant nonepileptic and 10 nonpregnant nonepileptic controls.
 We used the caffeine test to describe several enzyme activities: P450 1A2, xanthine oxidase, n-acetyltransferase and hydroxylation.
 For this end, ratios were calculated among a number of metabolites of the main demethylation pathway of caffeine.
 In addition, we measured D-glucaric acid excretion for specific characterization of antiepileptic drug metabolism.
 Paired comparison of epileptic women in late pregnancy and six to eight weeks post partum revealed statistically significant decreases in P450 1A2, xanthine oxidase and n-acetyltransferase activities, and a significantly increased hydroxylation activity during pregnancy.
 Twenty-one of the 30 epileptic women (70%) were found to be fast acetylators, whereas the normal distribution in the nonepileptic control groups was 50%.
 Excretion of D-glucaric acid was significantly increased in all epileptic patient groups as compared to the matched nonepileptic control groups.
 Importantly, it was also significantly increased in the pregnant nonepileptic control group as compared to the nonpregnant nonepileptic women.
 Overall, our results suggest that enzymatic pathways involved in antiepileptic drug metabolism tend to be increased during pregnancy as a potential cause for observed lower serum concentrations of these drugs.
