Alcoholism in women.
 Women differ from men in their drinking patterns and in the biologic consequences of alcohol use.
 Women more often drink at home and conceal their drinking behavior.
 Because women have a higher percentage of body fat and a lower percentage of body water than men, the same amount of alcohol causes more severe toxic effects in women than in men.
 Heavy alcohol consumption in women is associated with gynecologic dysfunction and fetal alcohol syndrome.
 Depression, anxiety or other psychiatric illness is also common in women alcoholics.
 Family physicians should be alert to the subtle behaviors that suggest alcoholism and be familiar with the available community resources and treatment options.
