Pregnancy after myocardial infarction: are we playing safe?
 The safety of pregnancy after myocardial infarction remains a significant dilemma for both the obstetrician and the cardiologist.
 Only 20 cases of pregnancy after myocardial infarction have been reported.
 To clarify this problem, we add our experience of four such cases in which conception occurred 9 months to 9 years after myocardial infarction with no previous consultation.
 Each woman had an uneventful pregnancy with no cardiac or obstetric complications related to the myocardial infarction.
 All patients were under the strict supervision of an obstetrician and a cardiologist during pregnancy in our conjoined antepartum-cardiologic clinic.
 The mode of delivery in all patients was related to the obstetric indications.
 Our experience and the accumulated experience in the literature demonstrate good prognosis for patients who conceive after myocardial infarction.
