Fetal breathing and development of control of breathing.
 Technical advances during the last several decades have greatly facilitated research into fetal physiology and behavior, specifically fetal breathing (FB).
 Breathing movements have been demonstrated in the fetuses of every mammalian species investigated and appear to be part of normal fetal development.
 In this review we focus on the methods of measuring FB and on some of the problems associated with these measurements and their interpretation.
 We also review fetal behavior, the role of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors in spontaneous FB, the fetal respiratory response to hypercapnia and hypoxia, and the transition to continuous breathing at birth.
 It is clear that in many ways the control of breathing movements in utero differs from that after birth.
 In particular, inhibitory influences are much more prominent before than after birth.
 Possibly this is due to the unique fetal situation, in which conservation of energy may be more important than any advantage breathing activity imparts to the fetus.
