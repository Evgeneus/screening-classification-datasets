The use of Histoacryl for episiotomy repair.
 Histoacryl-tissue adhesive (B.
 Braun Melsungen AG W.
 Germany) was used in place of skin sutures (2/0 chromic catgut, Ethicon Ltd, Edinburgh, Scotland) for episiotomy repair in a group of 20 women.
 This group was compared with two groups of women undergoing first and repeat episiotomy.
 Variables analysed included pain in the episiotomy site, pain while walking, sitting, sleeping, lying down, breast-feeding, micturating and defaecating.
 The Histoacryl group was superior with regard to all the variables.
 This simple, new method can reduce pain and inconvenience for patients, especially following the first delivery.
