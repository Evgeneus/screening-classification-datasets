Specific controversies concerning the natural history of renal disease in pregnancy.
 Whether or not pregnancy adversely affects the natural course of underlying primary renal disease, and whether fetal outcome is influenced by the type of renal disease per se are controversial issues.
 We retrospectively analyzed the fetal and maternal outcome in 148 women with various, biopsy-proven histological types of primary chronic glomerulonephritis (GN), including IgA GN (52 patients), membranous GN ([MGN] 20 patients), membranoproliferative type 1 GN ([MPGN] 58 patients), focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis ([FSGS] 13 patients), and minimal change nephrotic syndrome ([MCNS] 22 patients), who were pregnant (with a total of 290 pregnancies) after the clinical onset of GN, and in 104 women with reflux nephropathy (with a total of 254 pregnancies).
 Fetal outcome was poor in the presence of uncontrolled hypertension, nephrotic range proteinuria, and/or impaired renal function at conception or early in gestation, whatever the type of renal disease.
 An accelerated, more rapid than expected, worsening of maternal renal function was observed in five GN patients of whom four (two IgA, two MPGN) had serum creatinine (Scr) levels greater than 160 mumol/L (1.8 mg/dL) early in gestation, and in five patients with reflux nephropathy whose Scr at conception ranged from 180 to 490 mumol/L (2.0 to 5.5 mg/dL).
