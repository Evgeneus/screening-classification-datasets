Combination antimicrobial therapy in the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
 We compared the clinical and microbiologic efficacy of two broad-spectrum combination antimicrobial regimens in the treatment of 148 patients with acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
 Patients were randomized to inpatient treatment with either cefoxitin and doxycycline (n = 75) or clindamycin and tobramycin (n = 73).
 These antibiotics were administered intravenously for at least 4 days, and up to 48 hours beyond defervescence.
 Patients were discharged on a regimen of oral doxycycline or clindamycin in accordance with the intravenous regimen to complete a total duration of therapy of 2 weeks.
 Neisseria gonorrhoeae (53%) and Chlamydia trachomatis (31%) were the microorganisms that were isolated most frequently from the genital tract of enrolled patients.
 At follow-up, N.
 gonorrhoeae was isolated in two patients, and C.
 trachomatis was isolated in none.
 The overall initial favorable response rate to combination antimicrobial therapy was 98.5% (130/132) in patients with uncomplicated pelvic inflammatory disease and 81% (13/16) in patients with pelvic inflammatory disease that was complicated by tuboovarian abscess.
 A greater than 70% decrease in abdominal tenderness score occurred in 89% of 111 patients within 6 weeks of hospital discharge.
 There were no significant differences between antibiotic treatment groups in any response categories or in toxicity.
 During the initial hospitalization, five patients (three with tuboovarian abscess; one with a pyosalpinx, and one with intractable acute and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease) required surgical intervention.
 These results support the recommendation to use broad-spectrum combination antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of acute pelvic inflammatory disease.
