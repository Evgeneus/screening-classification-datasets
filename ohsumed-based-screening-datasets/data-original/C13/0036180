Failure of intrauterine insemination in a refractory infertility population.
 Intrauterine insemination by itself for multiple and/or severe infertility factors had no benefit over cervical cap with whole ejaculate or coitus in this study.
 The PRs for IUI and cervical cap with whole ejaculate or coitus were similar and low, suggesting that IUI by itself has limited, if any, utility in enhancing PRs in this type of infertility population.
 Couples attempting IUI should be advised about the low probability of achieving pregnancy.
 Ovulation stimulation and/or heterologous donor insemination, IVF, or gamete intrafallopian transfer may be beneficial therapeutic options.
