Ectopic pregnancy.
 The diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy is changing rapidly.
 More sensitive pregnancy tests and high-resolution transvaginal sonography are making the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy easier and earlier.
 In the future, we may become more confident with the ultrasound diagnosis of some ectopic pregnancies such that laparoscopic confirmation will not be required.
 These patients may be treated with systemic methotrexate.
 However, at the present time laparoscopy is essential for diagnostic confirmation of most ectopic pregnancies.
 It is senseless for a skilled laparoscopist to perform a diagnostic laparoscopy, remove the laparoscope, and then proceed with laparotomy or some nonsurgical treatment.
 There is sufficient evidence in the literature to demonstrate that laparoscopic management of ectopic pregnancies is equally safe, equally effective, and less traumatic than laparotomy.
 It should replace laparotomy as treatment for most ectopic pregnancies.
 Unfortunately, there are not enough trained laparoscopists to manage the 88,000 ectopic pregnancies per year in the United States.
 Operative laparoscopy deserves more emphasis in postgraduate and residency training programs.
