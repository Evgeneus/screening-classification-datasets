Polycystic ovarian syndrome: safety and effectiveness of stepwise and low-dose administration of purified follicle-stimulating hormone.
 OBJECTIVE: An attempt to induce ovulation with a single dominant follicle in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) patients.
 DESIGN: Comparing ultrasound and estradiol (E2) measurements during treatment with a low-dose protocol (using purified follicle-stimulating hormone, starting with 75 IU/d and increasing every 7 days by 37.5 IU/d) with those obtained following treatment with a conventional protocol using the same drug.
 SETTING: Specialist Reproductive Endocrine Unit.
 PATIENTS PARTICIPANTS: Eight PCOS patients of whom six had failed to respond adequately to the conventional protocol.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Rate of cancellation of cycles, number of leading follicles, and serum E2 concentration at the time of ovulation.
 RESULTS: Treatment with the low-dose protocol resulted in a significant reduction in the number of leading follicles (P less than 0.04), serum E2 concentrations (P less than 0.0002), and a higher rate of ovulation.
 As a result, five patients conceived compared with none in the conventional protocol.
 CONCLUSION: Using the low-dose protocol permitted induction of ovulation safely and successfully in a selected group of PCOS patients who were previously difficult to treat with the conventional ovulation induction protocol.
