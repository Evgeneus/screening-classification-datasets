Pregnancy in patients with a history of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 The present investigation was undertaken to study the relationship between pregnancy and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), with regard to possible reactivation of the disease, complications at delivery, and postpartum complications.
 Data on 76 pregnancies in 51 JRA patients were collected retrospectively.
 Comparison of pre-pregnancy disease activity with the course during gestation showed that pregnancy did not cause reactivation of the symptoms of quiescent JRA.
 Patients with minor symptoms at conception and the majority of those with active inflammation experienced improvement or total remission in the second half of gestation.
 Four JRA patients with active anterior uveitis had active eye disease during pregnancy also.
 Seventy-four of the pregnancies resulted in births of infants that were healthy and of normal birth weight; 1 infant had low birth weight and 1 was stillborn.
 Twenty children were delivered by cesarean section, and in 15 cases this was related to sequelae of JRA.
 A flare 3-6 months postpartum was reported after 45 pregnancies.
 However, in none of the patients whose disease was quiescent before or during pregnancy did this cause permanent reactivation of the JRA.
 Comparison of these 51 patients with 45 age-matched female patients without children revealed that disease severity and functional impairment were the limiting factors in the decision for or against having children.
