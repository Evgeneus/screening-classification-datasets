Prenatal diagnosis of fetal left ventricular aneurysm: a case report and review.
 Fetal echocardiography in a 30-year-old black woman, gravida 4, para 3, demonstrated left ventricular aneurysm.
 This was confirmed by color flow pulsed Doppler techniques.
 After delivery, neonatal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging further confirmed the diagnosis.
 The infant was followed closely and underwent surgical correction at 8.5 months of age.
 Before surgery, cardiac catheterization demonstrated normal hemodynamic function.
 A review of the literature revealed a paucity of information.
 Issues of prenatal diagnosis, antenatal surveillance, method of delivery, and neonatal follow-up are not well defined in either the obstetric or pediatric cardiology literature.
 A rationale for our approach to this complex problem is presented.
