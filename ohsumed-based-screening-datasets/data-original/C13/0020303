Detection of premature luteinization with serum progesterone levels at the time of the postcoital test.
 Poor cervical mucus (CM) may be caused by a number of factors, including premature luteinization, local cervical effects, and inadequate folliculogenesis.
 In an attempt to distinguish between these causes of poor CM, we obtained progesterone (P) levels at the time of postcoital tests (PCTs) in infertile women during spontaneous or clomiphene citrate (CC)-stimulated cycles.
 The amount of CM, viscosity, ferning, spinnbarkeit, and cellularity were each scored from 0 to 3 points on the day after detection of the urinary luteinizing hormone surge (luteal day 1).
 The charts of 46 such patients were retrospectively reviewed.
 Eleven control patients with good CM scores (greater than 10) had low P levels (less than 2.5 ng/mL).
 Of the remaining 35 cycles, 19 were marked by low P levels, and 16 were accompanied by P levels of greater than 2.5 ng/mL.
 Overall, 94.4% of CC-stimulated cycles versus 64.3% of spontaneous cycles had abnormal CM scores (less than 9).
 On the basis of these inappropriately elevated P levels, premature luteinization can be cited as the cause of poor mucus quality.
 In fact, premature luteinization may be responsible for some of the purported antiestrogenic effects of CC.
 Therefore, it is appropriate to draw a P level at the time of a poor PCT, particularly in cycles stimulated by CC.
