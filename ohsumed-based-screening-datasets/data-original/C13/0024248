Placenta previa is not an independent risk factor for a small for gestational age infant.
 Previous studies have presented conflicting evidence on the association between intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and placenta previa, with some groups reporting rates of IUGR as high as 16-19%.
 However, most of these studies failed to include a control population, included patients with other factors known to be associated with IUGR (eg, chronic hypertension, fetal anomalies, pregnancy-induced hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, etc), and/or did not confirm the patient's estimated gestational age.
 During the study period of January 1, 1980 through June 30, 1990, 54,969 deliveries occurred at the three affiliated hospitals of the Maternal-Fetal Medicine Division of the University of Connecticut Health Center.
 Review of the delivery records revealed 179 singleton pregnancies with documented placenta previa and without the above exclusion factors.
 One hundred seventy-one of these 179 study patients were compared with 171 women without placenta previa matched for confirmed gestational age, race, parity, and fetal sex.
 The incidence of small for gestational age (SGA) infants was 4.1% (seven of 171) in the study group and 5.8% (ten of 171) in the control group.
 Mean birth weights were 2559 and 2476 g, respectively.
 Neither difference was statistically significant.
 These results suggest that the prenatal diagnosis of an SGA fetus in a pregnancy complicated by placenta previa should not simply be attributed to abnormal placental implantation.
 Furthermore, routine ultrasonic examinations for growth in pregnancies complicated by placenta previa are not indicated.
