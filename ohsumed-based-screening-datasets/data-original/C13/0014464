Endometriosis of bladder after menopause.
 We report a rare case of endometriosis of the bladder in a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman.
 The patient had not received any exogenous estrogen therapy and the hormone levels were normal for a castrated female subject.
 Endometriosis of the bladder should be considered as a cause of an abnormal mass of the bladder even after menopause.
 This case documents that urinary involvement by endometriosis may persist even after years of a hormonally castrated state.
