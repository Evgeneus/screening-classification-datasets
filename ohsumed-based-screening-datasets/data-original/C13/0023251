Cervical screening with cervicography and the Papanicolaou smear in women with genital condylomata.
 Cervicography has been shown to be a very sensitive screening tool in the general population.
 Its value in screening a high-risk population was explored.
 One hundred five women seen with vulvar condylomata or a history thereof were offered a cervigram and Papanicolaou smear.
 Twelve patients had abnormal smears, whereas 53 had abnormal cervigrams.
 Colposcopically directed biopsies in the abnormal Papanicolaou group revealed cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) I in six patients and III in two.
 Cervicography-positive patients exhibited CIN I in 9 cases, II in 1 and III in 2.
 There was some overlap.
 Twelve patients had cervical condylomata without dysplasia.
 Cervicography, in addition to cervical cytology, should be considered for all women with vulvar condylomata.
