Treatment of ectopic pregnancy by transvaginal intratubal methotrexate administration.
 Twelve women with tubal pregnancies were treated with intratubal transvaginal methotrexate injection (1 mg/kg body weight).
 Serum beta-hCG levels decreased in all patients, and the resolution time from injection to undetectable beta-hCG levels was 14-120 days.
 In spite of declining serum beta-hCG and unruptured tubal pregnancy, two patients subsequently requested definitive treatment for their ectopic pregnancies and underwent surgery.
 Four of six women found to have a living embryo in their gestational sacs required a repeat methotrexate injection; one of these also required a local potassium chloride injection.
 The tubal pregnancies resolved in nine patients treated with methotrexate alone.
 During resolution, we noted a gradually increasing resistance index of the blood flow in the region of the gestation, but the tube became distended to 4.4 +/- 0.4 cm before gradually decreasing in size.
 No complications or side effects were encountered.
 These findings suggest that intratubal transvaginal methotrexate administration can provide a safe alternative to surgical treatment for patients with early unruptured tubal ectopic pregnancy.
 However, the presence of a living embryo makes the ectopic pregnancy more resistant to methotrexate treatment.
