Prenatal care comparisons among privately insured, uninsured, and Medicaid-enrolled women.
 Women without health insurance and those covered by Medicaid have been shown to obtain prenatal care later in pregnancy and make fewer visits for care than do women with private insurance.
 Factors that keep women from obtaining care include inadequate maternity care resources, difficulty in securing financial coverage, and the psychosocial issues of pregnancy.
 This study identified and compared prenatal care use patterns, insurance coverage changes, and psychosocial factors among 149 women in Minneapolis, MN, with private health insurance, Medicaid, and no health insurance.
 Little information has been available on the insurance status of women at the start of pregnancy and the paths subsequently taken to obtain financial coverage for prenatal care.
