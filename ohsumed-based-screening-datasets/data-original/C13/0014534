Spontaneous rupture of liver during pregnancy: current therapy.
 Spontaneous hepatic rupture secondary to severe pregnancy-induced hypertension is associated with a high rate of maternal and fetal mortality.
 Numerous types of surgical management have been described, but a uniform surgical approach has not been accepted.
 The purpose of this review was to examine modes of surgical therapy reported in the literature since 1976, as well as the 11-year experience at our institution.
 Twenty-eight cases were extracted from the literature and seven more were identified at our institution.
 The incidence in our population was one per 45,145 live births.
 Among 27 cases managed by packing and drainage, an 82% overall survival was achieved, whereas only 25% of eight patients undergoing hepatic lobectomy survived (P = .006).
 Hepatic hemorrhage with persistent hypotension unresponsive to blood products should be managed by evacuating the hematoma, packing the damaged liver, and draining the operative site.
 More aggressive surgical techniques, such as hepatic artery ligation or hepatic lobectomy, should be reserved for refractory cases.
