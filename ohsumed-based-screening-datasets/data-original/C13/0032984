Endometrial cysts: diagnosis with MR imaging.
 The value of 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in diagnosing endometrial cysts and differentiating them from other gynecologic masses was prospectively evaluated in 374 female patients with clinically suspected adnexal masses.
 A suggestive diagnosis of endometrial cyst was made when a cyst that was hyperintense on T1-weighted images exhibited homogeneous hyperintensity on T2-weighted images.
 A definitive diagnosis was made when a cyst that was hyperintense on T1-weighted images exhibited hypointense signal on T2-weighted images (shading) or when the lesion consisted of multiple hyperintense cysts on T1-weighted images (multiplicity) regardless of the signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
 Surgery was performed in 293 patients, and confirmation was obtained in 354 lesions.
 MR imaging enabled accurate diagnosis of 77 of 86 endometrial cysts and exclusion of the diagnosis of endometrial cyst in 263 of 268 other gynecologic masses with or without internal hemorrhage.
 The overall diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 90%, 98%, 96%, respectively.
 MR imaging seems to be an acceptable diagnostic test on which clinical decisions can be based in selecting treatment.
