Seroprevalence of human immunodeficiency virus in women admitted to the hospital with pelvic inflammatory disease.
 To assess the association of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with other sexually transmitted diseases we undertook an anonymous HIV antibody serosurvey of all women admitted to the hospital with pelvic inflammatory disease.
 All the patients were given HIV risk reduction information and offered voluntary antibody testing.
 Thirty-one consecutive patients were evaluated; 30 specimens were suitable for anonymous testing.
 Five of the 30 (16.7%) were seropositive on both an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot test.
 The majority of the patients expressed concern about their HIV risk; 23 (74%) requested confidential testing.
 Of those tested, five (21.7%) were seropositive; three had traditional risk factors (intravenous drug abuse and/or sexual contacts at risk), and two denied traditional risk factors but reported nonintravenous cocaine use and multiple sexual partners.
 Of the seronegative women, 33% reported nonintravenous cocaine use (many with multiple sexual partners).
 Preventing the heterosexual spread of HIV into this vulnerable population is a formidable public health challenge.
