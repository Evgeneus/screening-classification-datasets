Therapeutic dilemmas in the treatment of pelvic infections.
 The identification of pathogens and the early recognition of pelvic infections in patients after hysterectomy, cesarean delivery and vaginal delivery were analyzed.
 Criteria for administering cephamycin therapy were established, as were guidelines for evaluating the progress of the infection.
 In a comparative study of the safety and efficacy of cefmetazole and cefoxitin in 145 hospitalized patients with pelvic infections there were no significant differences between either the bacteriologic or clinical cure rates of the two antibiotics.
 Both were efficacious and safe for the treatment of obstetric-gynecologic soft tissue infections.
