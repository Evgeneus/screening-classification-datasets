Pregnancy after oocyte donation to a woman with ovarian failure and classical galactosemia.
 In summary, oocyte and pre-embryo donation may be used to establish pregnancy in women with galactosemia and ovarian failure.
 Reported is the first pregnancy after pre-embryo donation to a woman with classical galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency.
 Despite disturbances in galactose metabolism, the endometrial lining responded normally to exogenous hormone replacement and was receptive to pre-embryo implantation.
 Pregnancy support was provided by exogenously administered oral E2 and IM P for the initial 100 days, at which time placental hormone production solely maintained the gestation.
