Hormonal therapy before surgical treatment for uterine leiomyomas.
 Use of GnRH-A offers a promising medical approach to treating uterine leiomyomas.
 This therapy can be useful in selected patients, preserving fertility by delaying the need for imminent surgical treatment.
 In selected perimenopausal women, agonist therapy may, in fact, be an alternative to surgical intervention.
 Shrinking the size of myomas and reducing uterine volume with these agents have been reported to control symptoms of myoma, making myomectomy or vaginal hysterectomy a safer procedure.
 Used preoperatively, GnRH-A therapy can also reduce the risk of surgical complications and excessive blood loss.
