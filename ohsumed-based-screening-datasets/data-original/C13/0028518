Obstetric outcome in women after multiple spontaneous abortions.
 Obstetric outcome in 88 women with a past history of three or more consecutive pregnancy losses was studied.
 The results were compared to those in our total obstetric population for the same period (control group).
 The incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants, prematurity, low-birth-weight infants and toxemia in the study group was not significantly different from that in the control group.
 Gestational diabetes and chronic hypertension, however, occurred more frequently in the study group than in the control group (P less than .001).
 These data could be helpful in counseling women with repeated pregnancy loss.
