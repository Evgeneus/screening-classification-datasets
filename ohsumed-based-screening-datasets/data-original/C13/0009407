AIDS following mother-to-child transmission of HIV-2.
 Mother-to-child infection with HIV-2 is thought to be rare, and there have been few previous reports of transmission by this route.
 Reports of morbidity associated with HIV-2 infection in children are also rare.
 We describe eight children born to mothers who were infected with HIV-2; five developed AIDS, and three were still seropositive at 17-49 months of age.
 The only apparent route of HIV-2 transmission was from mother to child, except for one child who had been transfused.
 Three of the children with AIDS died, all having decreased CD4+ lymphocytes and mitogen responses.
 Further studies are needed to determine the prevalence and natural history of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-2.
