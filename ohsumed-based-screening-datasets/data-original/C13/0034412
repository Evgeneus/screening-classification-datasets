Postmenopausal hormone replacement with a combination estrogen-progestin regimen for five days per week.
 A group of 15 postmenopausal women who had not recently received estrogen replacement were enrolled in a study during which they received 0.625 mg of conjugated equine estrogen and 2.5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily from Monday through Friday of each week for six months.
 No treatment was given on the weekend.
 Endometrial biopsy specimens at the end of therapy revealed minimal growth of glands and stroma and a low mean mitosis count.
 Of the 12 women who completed the trial, 5 were completely amenorrheic, and only 4 of the 15 bled beyond the second month of treatment.
 Of those four, two spotted for only a few days.
 In the 12 women who completed the trial there was a significant increase in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and a nonsignificant lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 The results of this study indicate that comparative trials between this regimen and one in which the two drugs are given daily for seven days a week are warranted.
