The Lupron screening test: tailoring the use of leuprolide acetate in ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prognostic and therapeutic value of a Lupron (leuprolide acetate; Tap Pharmaceuticals, North Chicago, IL) screening test before ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF).
 DESIGN: Prospective.
 SETTING: Outpatient IVF program.
 PATIENTS: Eighty patients exhibited four early estradiol (E2) patterns.
 Patients with pattern A and B remained on a flare-up ovarian stimulation protocol.
 Patients with pattern C were randomized to three ovarian stimulation protocols.
 Patients with pattern D were treated with the flare-up protocol using a high pure follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) dose.
 RESULTS: Patterns, A, B, C, and D occurred in 44%, 16%, 25%, and 15% of the patients, respectively.
 The E2 pattern recurred in 77% of subsequent IVF cycles.
 Pattern A and B patients achieved a 41% (23/56) and 22% (5/23) ongoing pregnancy rate (PR) per stimulated cycle.
 An early luteal phase Lupron protocol had the best ongoing PR per stimulated cycle (10/27, 37%) in patients with a pattern C response.
 Pattern D patients had a 20% (5/25) ongoing PR per stimulated cycle.
 CONCLUSION: The Lupron screening test allows prospective selection of stimulation protocols in ovulatory patients undergoing IVF.
 Early E2 patterns A and B should be treated with the flare-up protocol.
 Pattern C patients benefit from the luteal phase Lupron protocol and pattern D patients benefit from a high pure FSH flare-up protocol.
