Acute effect of indoor exposure to paint containing bis(tributyltin) oxide--Wisconsin, 1991.
 In January 1991, a woman in Wisconsin contacted her local public health department to report that she and her two children had become ill after her landlord painted the walls and ceilings of two rooms of her apartment.
 Reported symptoms included a burning sensation in the nose and forehead, headache, nose bleed, cough, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting.
 The woman, who was in the third trimester of pregnancy, also complained of a persistent odor from the paint and provided an empty bottle of a paint additive used for mildew control.
 The label indicated that this product contained 25% bis(tributyltin) oxide (TBTO) as its only active ingredient.
