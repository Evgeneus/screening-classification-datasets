Luteinizing hormone bioactivity and variable responses to clomiphene citrate in chronic anovulation.
 In 18 women with infertility and chronic anovulation with normal gonadotropins, three different responses were observed to increasing doses (250 to 750 mg) of clomiphene citrate (CC).
 Follicle development and ovulation in 8, follicle development but no ovulation without human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in 6, and no response to CC in 4.
 Serum concentrations of bioactive luteinizing hormone (bioactive-LH), immunoactive (immunoactive-LH), follicle-stimulating hormone, and estradiol (E2) were measured and follicle growth was assessed by daily ultrasound.
 Findings were compared with 8 normal ovulatory controls.
 Folliculogenesis on CC therapy, based on our data, was 78%; however, only 44% ovulated spontaneously, 34% required hCG for follicle rupture.
 There were no apparent hormonal indicators to predict responders from nonresponders.
 The absence of an LH surge in the presence of follicles and sustained high E2 concentrations in 34% of patients may be associated with a decreased E2 sensitivity at the hypothalamic-pituitary level.
 Ultrasound easily identified patients who responded to CC with folliculogenesis but did not initiate an LH surge.
 Follicle rupture was achieved promptly by hCG administration.
