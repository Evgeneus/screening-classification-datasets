Prenatal genetic counseling.
 Continued advances in reproductive technology and prenatal diagnosis challenge genetic counselors in their provision of appropriate prenatal genetic counseling.
 Complex information must be communicated to the couple in a nondirective but supportive manner for the couple to make an informed decision.
 Often pertinent information must be gathered and disseminated in a short period of time as a pregnancy continues toward the point of viability, and options become limited.
 Prenatal genetic counseling strives to keep up with the changes in reproductive technology and prenatal diagnosis in an effort to meet the needs of the patient.
