Role of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis in intraabdominal abscess formation in the rat.
 Our concept of the pathogenesis of acute salpingitis and advanced pelvic infection, such as tuboovarian abscess, is evolving.
 Although Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis are thought to play a significant role in acute pelvic inflammatory disease, other microorganisms, such as aerobes and anaerobes, have repeatedly been reported to play a significant role, also, particularly in the patient with advanced disease.
 A study was designed to evaluate the pathogenesis, and particularly any synergistic role, of some aerobes and anaerobes with N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis abscess formation.
 Using the rat model developed by Weinstein and Onderdonk, the study demonstrated that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis alone do not produce abscesses.
 However, when combined with facultative or anaerobic bacteria, synergism with abscess formation is noted frequently.
 The data support the hypothesis that N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis initiate infection and that aerobic and anaerobic bacteria act synergistically to produce abscesses.
 In addition, microorganisms not inoculated were found to be recruited into the infectious process.
 The organisms may gain access to the peritoneal cavity via the lower genital tract or from transmucosal migration from the intestinal flora.
