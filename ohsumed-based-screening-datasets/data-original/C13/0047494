Meconium-stained amniotic fluid: a risk factor for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether meconium-stained amniotic fluid is a marker for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity.
 Amniocentesis was performed on 707 patients presenting with preterm labor and intact membranes.
 Meconium-stained amniotic fluid was present in 4.2% (30/707) of patients with preterm labor.
 The prevalence of positive amniotic fluid cultures was significantly higher in women with meconium-stained amniotic fluid than in women with clear fluid (33% [10/30] vs 11% [75/677]; p = 0.001; odds ratio = 4.01; 95% confidence interval = 1.6 to 9.4).
 Patients with meconium-stained amniotic fluid were also more likely to have failed tocolysis and delivered a preterm neonate more frequently than patients with clear fluid (83% [25/30] vs 38% (258/677); p = 0.0001; odds ratio = 8.1; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 24.4).
 We conclude that meconium-stained amniotic fluid is a risk factor for microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and preterm delivery in women with preterm labor and intact membranes.
