Tubal occlusion after inguinal hernia repair. A case report.
 Midtubal occlusion and infertility occurred subsequent to an inguinal hernia repair.
 Recognition of the traumatic etiology is important because other causes of midtubal obstruction, such as endometriosis, tuberculosis and adenomatoid tumor of the oviduct, may be considered contraindications to reconstructive surgery.
 Once recognized, the condition is highly amendable to microsurgical reconstruction.
