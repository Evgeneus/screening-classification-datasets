Changes in body composition with danazol therapy.
 Whole body lean and fat mass measurements by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry were performed in 14 premenopausal women undergoing danazol treatment for endometriosis.
 After 6 months, there was a significant increase in lean tissue mass.
 Body fat decreased but this was significantly less in the android (upper body segment) region than in the gynoid (lower body segment) region.
 Danazol thus has both anabolic and androgenic effects on body composition.
 Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry provides a new, noninvasive, and rapid means of studying body composition.
