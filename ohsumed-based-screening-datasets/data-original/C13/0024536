The current status of maternal and fetal blood flow velocimetry.
 Significant progress has been achieved in regard to normative data for uteroplacental and fetal blood flow velocity and the factors which may affect these observations.
 Associations have been demonstrated between abnormal indices of maternal and fetal blood flow velocity and pregnancy-induced hypertension, fetal growth retardation, fetal blood gas measures, and intrapartum clinical fetal distress.
 However, in general, the predictive power is modest and no evidence has yet been provided to indicate that these measures can be used as a screening test in the general obstetric population.
 Continuing research is highly desirable.
 At the present time, the use of Doppler assessment of blood flow in pregnancy should be limited to the investigational setting.
