Peritoneal fluid volume and sex steroids in the pre-ovulatory period in mild endometriosis.
 Twenty infertile women with laparoscopically confirmed mild endometriosis and ten women with tubal infertility underwent diagnostic laparoscopy 32 h after the onset of the endogenous luteinizing hormone (LH) surge during a spontaneous menstrual cycle.
 All visible peritoneal fluid was aspirated for assessment of volume and sex steroid content.
 There was no significant difference in peritoneal fluid volume or concentrations of oestradiol, progesterone and androstenedione between the two groups.
 Furthermore, in the endometriosis group there was no significant difference in peritoneal fluid volume and concentrations of sex steroids between those women who had been treated previously with danazol and those who were left untreated.
