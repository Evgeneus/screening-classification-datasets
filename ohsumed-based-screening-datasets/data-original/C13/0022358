Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA content in gestational trophoblastic disease.
 Flow cytometric analysis of nuclear DNA is a quick and accurate method of determining nuclear ploidy.
 This technique allows a clear distinction to be made between diploid and triploid hydatidiform moles.
 Additional ploidy aberrations, such as tetraploidy and aneuploidy, have also been reported in flow cytometric studies of hydatidiform moles.
 Recent investigations have suggested that aneuploidy in complete hydatidiform moles is associated with a high risk of persistent gestational trophoblastic disease.
 In addition to DNA ploidy analysis, cell cycle activity may be calculated from analysis of the DNA histogram.
 No significant correlation between clinical course and cell cycle kinetics has been demonstrated to date.
 By providing valuable DNA ploidy data, flow cytometric studies of hydatidiform moles may be helpful in the identification of patients at high risk of postmolar trophoblastic sequelae.
