Ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction during pregnancy.
 Many women with cerebrospinal fluid shunts are now reaching reproductive age.
 Shunt malfunction may occur during pregnancy, and management requires a well-planned, combined neurosurgical and obstetrical approach.
 We present a case of ventriculoperitoneal shunt obstruction manifesting during the third trimester managed successfully in a conservative fashion.
 The literature on ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction during pregnancy is reviewed.
