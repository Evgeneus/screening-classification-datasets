The prevalence, risks, and management of Chlamydia trachomatis infections in fertile and infertile patients from the high socioeconomic bracket of the South African population.
 OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis endocervicitis in an infertile population.
 DESIGN: Forty consecutive patients were enrolled in the study group and 41 in the control group.
 SETTING: The study was undertaken in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of the University of the Orange Free State, Bloemfontein, Republic of South Africa.
 PATIENTS: Infertile white females, visiting an infertility clinic in an academic hospital and fertile white female patients visiting an antenatal clinic.
 INTERVENTIONS: Endocervical swabs were taken, and monoclonal direct immunofluorescence for C.
 Trachomatis were done on each.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A difference was expected between the prevalence of C.
 trachomatis infection in the fertile and infertile population.
 RESULTS: In the study group, 14(35.9%) positive, 25(64.1%) negative, and 1 fallout were obtained.
 In the control group, 3 patients (7.32%) tested positive.
 CONCLUSION: Although no correlation was found between C.
 trachomatis infection of the female genital tract and the clinical history, it showed a significant correlation with infertility.
 This justifies routine screening tests and antibiotic treatment of positive infertile couples.
 Analysis of cost-effectiveness showed that empirical treatment of new infertile couples is justified in some populations.
