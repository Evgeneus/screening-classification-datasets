Decrease in luteal gonadotropin concentration in conception cycles after in vitro fertilization/gamete intrafallopian transfer.
 The concentrations of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were measured in the luteal phase of the cycle in patients undergoing ovarian hyperstimulation.
 In nonconception cycles, FSH and LH were increased in the late luteal phase compared with conception cycles in which both gonadotropins were suppressed.
 Estradiol (E2) and progesterone concentrations increased in pregnancy cycles and may be the sole cause for the decreased gonadotropin concentrations as shown by equivalent concentrations of LH and FSH in both pregnancy and nonpregnancy cycles after matching for E2 concentrations.
 Subjects who subsequently had twin pregnancy or a spontaneous abortion were compared with those with a successful ongoing singleton conception.
 There were no significant differences relative to LH and FSH between the three groups, although in twin pregnancy FSH tended to be lower at day 16 from oocyte recovery.
 It is concluded that suppression of LH and FSH in hyperstimulated pregnancy cycles occurs after the time of the rising human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations in plasma.
