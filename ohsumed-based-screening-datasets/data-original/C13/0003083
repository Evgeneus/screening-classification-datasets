Binding of anti-DNA antibodies and inhibition of glomerulonephritis in MRL-lpr/lpr mice by heparin.
 Heparin was found to inhibit the DNA binding of antibodies eluted from kidneys of both humans and MRL-lpr/lpr mice with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Treatment of MRL-lpr/lpr mice with low doses of heparin significantly inhibited renal damage.
 These results suggest that low-dose heparin might be useful in preventing renal damage in patients with lupus nephritis.
