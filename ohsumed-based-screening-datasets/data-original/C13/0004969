Intrapartum, intranasal cocaine use and acute fetal distress. A case report.
 Intrapartum, intranasal cocaine was used for relief of labor pains by a healthy woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy.
 Fetal hypoxemia and distress followed the event.
 A causal relationship between the intrapartum use of cocaine and the fetal distress was postulated.
 Cocaine abusers could benefit from hospitalization early in labor for close surveillance and monitoring, thus avoiding exposure to cocaine and its unpredictable systemic effects.
