Treatment of adenomyosis with long-term GnRH analogues: a case report.
 Presented here is the first reported case of biopsy-proved adenomyosis treated medically with long-term GnRH analogue.
 Uterine volume, as calculated by serial ultrasound measurements, was reduced by 65% after 4 months and remained small several months after discontinuation of therapy.
 Size reduction was accompanied by amenorrhea and relief of severe dysmenorrhea.
 Though not proposed as a substitute for surgery, GnRH analogue may be useful as a surgical adjuvant or for temporary reduction of symptoms.
