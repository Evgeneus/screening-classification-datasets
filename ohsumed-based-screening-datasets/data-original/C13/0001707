Ovarian suspension in massive ovarian edema.
 Massive ovarian edema is an uncommon condition found in young women that is speculated to occur as a result of incomplete ovarian torsion.
 We present the second patient to our knowledge to undergo ovarian suspension as a treatment for this condition.
 This approach succeeded after ovarian wedge resection had failed.
 Our patient remained symptom-free at 1 year of follow-up.
 Ovarian suspension should be considered when this pathologic entity is diagnosed.
