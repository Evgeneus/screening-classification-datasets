In vitro inhibition of esterase activity in amniotic fluid: comparison with bacterial cultures.
 Assessment of leukocyte esterase activity in amniotic fluid for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of chorioamnionitis has been demonstrated previously.
 We compared in vitro inhibition of esterase activity in amniotic fluid with bacterial cultures to identify the origins of the specific esterases released by the infecting organisms.
 One hundred forty-one samples were tested (90 uninfected, 51 infected).
 Each sample was evaluated for Gram stain, cultures, and an in vitro esterase assay followed by ebelactone inhibition.
 Forty-two patients had positive amniotic fluid cultures.
 Ebelactone produced varying degrees of inhibition of esterase activity (range, 20% to 60%) in the uninfected samples and in those infected with gram-negative organisms.
 There was no inhibition in the samples infected with gram-positive organisms.
 Thus different groups of bacteria may elicit the production of different and specific esterases in infected amniotic fluid, as shown by the differences in in vitro inhibition.
