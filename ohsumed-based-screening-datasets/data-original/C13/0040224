Ectopic ureter: a rare cause of purulent vaginal discharge.
 We report two cases in which urologic anomalies presented with vaginal discharge and fever in young women, aged 9 and 18 years.
 Both patients were ultimately diagnosed as having duplicated collecting systems with ectopic upper-pole ureters opening into the introitus.
 Although congenital urologic anomalies are a rare cause of vaginal discharge in young women, they should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with these symptoms.
