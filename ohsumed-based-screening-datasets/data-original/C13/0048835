Effect of maternal carbon dioxide inhalation on human fetal breathing movements in term and preterm labor.
 Induced maternal hypercapnia is a potent stimulus to fetal breathing movements in nonlaboring pregnant women.
 To determine the effect of maternal CO2 administration on fetal breathing movements during spontaneous labor, 14 healthy pregnant volunteers at term and 34 in preterm labor were recruited.
 If fetal breathing movements were markedly decreased or absent, the subjects were administered a prepared gas mixture of 3% CO2 in air.
 In term labor and in true preterm labor, fetal breathing movements were markedly decreased and could not be induced by maternal hypercapnia.
 Among women with suspected preterm labor, initial absence of fetal breathing movements and failure to evoke this response by maternal hypercapnia predicted delivery within 48 hours with a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 95.5%.
 Induced maternal hypercapnia fails to stimulate fetal breathing movements in true term and preterm labor and may assist in distinguishing between true and false preterm labor.
