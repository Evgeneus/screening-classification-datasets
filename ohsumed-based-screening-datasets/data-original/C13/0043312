Review article: migraine and pregnancy.
 A 27-year-old woman with no family or personal history of migraine presented with headache associated with unilateral paresthesias and blurred vision.
 This was her first, and so far only, attack of migraine with aura and led to the diagnosis of her pregnancy and to this review.
 Migraine can begin for the first time with pregnancy, particularly in the first trimester.
 Cases of migraine with aura are the most commonly reported.
 Preexisting migraine usually improves with pregnancy, particularly if it was associated with menstrual migraine.
 Headache occurs frequently in the post-partum period, particularly in known migraineurs.
 Migraineurs have no increased risk of complications during pregnancy and their children have no increased incidence of birth defects.
