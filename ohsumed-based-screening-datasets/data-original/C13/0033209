Psychosocial aspects of chronic, clinically unconfirmed vulvovaginitis 
 Women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis referred to a university vulvovaginitis clinic were assessed on psychological and social (including sexual) variables to determine whether differences existed among women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis, women with confirmed vulvovaginitis, and healthy controls.
 Eighty-three consecutive women with chronic symptoms of vulvovaginitis and 32 asymptomatic control women completed clinical examinations, cultures, and the following psychological tests or questionnaires: the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression Scale, the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, a sexual behavior and response questionnaire (Campion), and a study questionnaire.
 Statistical analyses (chi 2 and analysis of variance) were performed on the confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis and control groups of women.
 Women with confirmed and unconfirmed vulvovaginitis scored higher than control women on several psychological variables, but women with unconfirmed vulvovaginitis were found to be significantly more emotionally distressed on psychological tests and to report more discomfort during sexual intercourse than both women with confirmed vulvovaginitis and healthy controls.
 Psychosocial inquiry is important in the clinical assessment and management of such women.
