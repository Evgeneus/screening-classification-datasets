Massive evisceration: a complication following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation.
 This report describes a spontaneous vaginal vault prolapse in association with massive evisceration following sacrospinous vaginal vault fixation.
 Careful attention to surgical technique is critical to the success of the operation.
 In particular, good apposition of the vaginal vault to the sacrospinous ligament and adequate repair of an enterocele should avoid this complication.
