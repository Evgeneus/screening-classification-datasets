Serum nortriptyline levels in nursing mothers and their infants.
 The nortriptyline levels of seven depressed mothers and their breast-fed infants were obtained.
 Nortriptyline was not detected in the infants' sera.
 However, two of four infants evaluated developed low concentrations of 10-hydroxynortriptyline.
 No adverse effects were observed.
