Early repair of iatrogenic injury to the ureter or bladder after gynecological surgery.
 Contrary to the traditional doctrine of delayed intervention in post-hysterectomy injuries of the ureter or bladder, the policy at our department has been to operate as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made.
 Of 68 patients (25 with vesicovaginal fistulas and 43 with ureteral injuries) early intervention was possible in 40 (59%).
 Primary healing was obtained in all patients.
 These results suggest that there is no disadvantage in early repair.
