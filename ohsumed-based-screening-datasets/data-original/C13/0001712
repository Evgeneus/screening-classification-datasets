Giant-cell arteritis of the uterus with associated temporal arteritis: a case report.
 Giant-cell arteritis involving the uterus was identified incidentally upon hysterectomy and anterior colporrhaphy for uterine prolapse.
 Subsequently, the patient was found to have giant-cell temporal arteritis presenting with fever of unknown origin.
 Fourteen previous cases involving the female genital tract have been reported.
 There appears to be an association between constitutional symptoms of fever, weight loss, malaise, headache, and polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly women with uterine prolapse and giant-cell arteritis of the genital tract.
 The rare presentation of giant-cell arteritis in the female genital tract does not support invasive costly evaluation in asymptomatic patients.
 However, a thorough investigation for involvement of other sites, including appropriate treatment for generalized disease, should be undertaken.
