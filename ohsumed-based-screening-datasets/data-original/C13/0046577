The luteal phase after oocyte recovery in a spontaneous cycle.
 There is disagreement as to whether follicular aspiration and oocyte recovery leads to a defective luteal phase.
 A group of 20 women with mild endometriosis was studied over two consecutive spontaneous cycles.
 Follicular aspiration and oocyte recovery was performed 32 hours after the onset of the endogenous luteinizing hormone surge during the second cycle.
 There was little disturbance of the luteal phase or in the pituitary gonadal relationship in the aspirated cycle.
 Although a significantly lower serum progesterone was noted on day 8 of post-oocyte recovery, all results were within the normal range seen in the control cycles.
