Periurethral colonic-type polyp simulating urethral caruncle. A case report.
 A 50-year-old, black woman presented with a 1-cm, polypoid lesion on the posterior edge of the urethral meatus that had the gross appearance of a urethral caruncle.
 The histologic features, however, revealed a superficially ulcerated lesion composed of colonic-type mucosal glands with focal regenerative atypia in response to inflammation.
 A similar histologic pattern is also found in so-called solitary rectal ulcer syndrome and inflammatory cloacogenic polyps arising in the anorectal area.
 Based upon an English-language literature review, this case appears to be the second reported one of an intestinal-type polyp in this location.
 The patient had no further problems after excisional biopsy.
