Ten-year follow-up of patients with secondary amenorrhea and normal prolactin.
 A group of 46 patients with secondary amenorrhea without galactorrhea or hyperprolactinemia were studied retrospectively after being clinically categorized into four groups with the use of progesterone-induced uterine bleeding and measurement of serum gonadotropins and prolactin levels.
 The ability to have regular spontaneous menstrual cycles and to conceive was assessed after a follow-up period of 10 years.
 Patients who had been classified as having hypothalamic pituitary "failure" (hypoestrogenic amenorrhea) with low levels of circulating estradiol had a greater rate of recovery of spontaneous ovulation and menses when compared with patients who had been classified as having only hypothalamic pituitary dysfunction (euestrogenic amenorrhea).
 The patients with diagnosis of hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation or polycystic ovary syndrome generally required clomiphene citrate for induction of ovulation and almost all the patients with premature ovarian failure (hypergonadotropic amenorrhea) remained estrogen-deficient and unable to ovulate.
 Hyperprolactinemia or an identifiable pituitary adenoma has not developed in any of the patients to date.
