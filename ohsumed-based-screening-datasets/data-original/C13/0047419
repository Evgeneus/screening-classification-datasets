A pilot study of the use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog for triggering ovulation.
 Our study demonstrated the feasibility of using GnRH-a for triggering ovulation in women receiving hMG for ovulation induction: 11 of 13 patients had good pituitary LH and FSH surge followed by normal ovulatory P rise, and 4 became pregnant.
 In a selected group of patients, this method for triggering ovulation may be advantageous to using hCG.
