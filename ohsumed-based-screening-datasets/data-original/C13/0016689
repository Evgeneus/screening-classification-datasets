Phospholipase C activity in microorganisms associated with reproductive tract infection.
 Phospholipase C (lecithinase or phosphatidylcholine phosphorylase) catalyzes the hydrolysis of lecithin into phosphorylcholine and 1,2-diglyceride.
 Bacterial production of phospholipase C may damage reproductive tract tissues by both direct and indirect mechanisms.
 Use of the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine phospholipase C activity was determined in 204 isolates representative of those found in female genital tract.
 Multiple aerobic (28%) and anaerobic (28%) reproductive tract microorganisms showed phospholipase C activity.
 Phospholipase C-producing isolates included strains of Bacteroides fragilis, B.
 bivius, B.
 thetaiotaomicron, Gardnerella vaginalis, and group B streptococcus.
 Phospholipase C activity was heterogenous; not all isolates that belong to a particular species showed activity.
 Phospholipase C production may be a possible virulence factor produced by a number of microflora commonly implicated in various reproductive tract infections or conditions, as well as in some instances of preterm birth.
