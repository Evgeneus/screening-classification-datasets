Cesarean section by local anesthesia in patients with familial dysautonomia.
 We describe a 29-year-old patient with familial dysautonomia who underwent cesarean section because of severe intrauterine fetal growth retardation.
 The surgery was done after induction of local anesthesia to avoid the critical and sometimes fatal complications of general anesthesia known in patients with familial dysautonomia.
 Surgery was uneventful and almost painless.
 The postoperative period was without complications.
 Induction of local anesthesia for cesarean section may constitute a suitable alternative in patients with familial dysautonomia.
