Human immunodeficiency virus infection, women, and pregnancy. Ethical issues.
 Should women of childbearing age be screened for the presence of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus? If infected, should they be instructed not to become pregnant or not to bear children? Should pregnant women and their offspring be included in research protocols that explore ways to prevent or treat perinatally acquired HIV disease? This article examines ethical controversies related to HIV screening, counseling, and research and suggests that resolutions may come from achieving greater clarity about the ultimate goals of obstetric and gynecologic care.
