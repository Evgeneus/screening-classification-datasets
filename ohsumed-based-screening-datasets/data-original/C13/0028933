Ventilation in newborn rats after gestation at simulated high altitude.
 Pregnant rats were kept at a simulated altitude of 4,500 m (PO2 91 Torr) for the whole of gestation and returned to sea level 1 day after giving birth.
 During pregnancy, body weight gain and food intake were approximately 30% less than in controls at sea level.
 Measurements were made on the 1-day-old (HYPO) pups after a few hours at sea level.
 In normoxia, ventilation (VE) measured by flow plethysmography was more (+17%) and O2 consumption (VO2) measured by a manometric method was less (-19%) than in control (CONT) pups; in HYPO pups VE/VO2 was 44% greater than in CONT pups.
 In acute hyperoxia, VE/VO2 of HYPO and CONT pups decreased by a similar amount (15-20%), indicating some limitation in O2 availability for both groups of pups in normoxia.
 However, VE/VO2 of HYPO pups, even in hyperoxia, remained above (+34%) that of CONT pups.
 HYPO pups weighed slightly less than CONT pups, their lungs were hypoplastic, and their hearts were a larger fraction of body weight.
 An additional group of female rats was acclimatized (8 days) to high altitude before insemination.
 During pregnancy, body weight gain and food intake of these females were similar to those of pregnant rats at sea level.
 Measurements on the 1-day-old pups of this group were similar to those of HYPO pups.
 We conclude that newborn rats born after hypoxic gestation present metabolic adaptation (low VO2) and acclimatization (high VE/VO2), possibly because of hypoxemia.
 Maternal acclimatization before insemination substantially alters maternal growth in hypoxia but does not affect neonatal outcome.
