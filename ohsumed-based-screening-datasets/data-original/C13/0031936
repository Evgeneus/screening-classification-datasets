Second-trimester maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels and the risk of subsequent fetal death 
 BACKGROUND.
 The finding of an elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein during the second trimester of pregnancy may indicate that the fetus has died or is about to die.
 It is uncertain, however, whether the finding is associated with an increased risk of fetal death later in gestation independent of known causes of elevation, such as the presence of neural-tube defects or multiple gestation.
 METHODS.
 To address this question, we performed a case-control study of 612 women whose pregnancies ended in fetal death and 2501 women who gave birth to live infants, using reports from California vital statistics for 1987.
 All the women had signleton pregnancies and alpha-fetoprotein screening in the second trimester.
 RESULTS.
 Women with elevated levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy had an increased risk of fetal death, and the risk was increased until term.
 Women with the highest levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein--greater than or equal to 3.0 times the median value--had a very high risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 10.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 4.9 to 22.0) as compared with women who had normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein.
 Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels that were 2.0 to 2.9 times the median were also associated with an elevated risk of fetal death (odds ratio, 2.4; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.7 to 3.4).
 Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein were especially likely to be associated with fetal death in cases in which maternal hypertension or placental infarction was also present.
 CONCLUSIONs.
 An unexplained elevated level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein in the second trimester of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of subsequent fetal death, up to four to five months after alpha-fetoprotein screening.
