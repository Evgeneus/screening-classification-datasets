Lichen sclerosus and squamous hyperplasia of the vulva. A clinical study of medical treatment.
 One hundred thirty-eight cases of nonneoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva treated with medical therapy from 1984 to 1988 were evaluated at the University of Florence, Florence, Italy.
 The 67 cases of lichen sclerosus were treated with testosterone propionate or progesterone ointment for 32 weeks.
 The 31 cases of squamous hyperplasia were treated with corticosteroid ointment for 16 weeks.
 The 40 patients with lichen sclerosus associated with squamous hyperplasia were treated with corticosteroid ointment for 12 weeks and then with testosterone propionate ointment for another 20.
 To evaluate the efficacy of the treatments, the patients were examined before and after therapy.
 The evaluation took into account the symptoms and gross appearance of the lesions, which were given a score of 1-3.
 Considering all the cases evaluated, a total regression of symptoms occurred in 82 patients (59.4%), while a partial regression occurred in 37 (26.8%).
 Furthermore, there was a total regression of gross changes in 68 cases (49.3%) and a partial one in 43 (31.1%).
 The best results were obtained with squamous hyperplasia, which lichen sclerosus, alone or associated with squamous hyperplasia, yielded less successful results.
