Gynecologic sonography. Report of the ultrasonography task force. Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association.
 Sonography, because it is nonionizing, is the preferred imaging modality for the female pelvis.
 Traditionally, transabdominal, transcystic studies were performed However, development of transvaginal and transrectal transducers has led to enhanced imaging capabilities of the pelvis.
 These new technologies will likely improve our ability to understand gynecologic pathology.
 The clinical use of pelvic ultrasonography depends on a thorough understanding of normal anatomy and cyclical changes and on the relative limitations of the imaging modality in specifically characterizing pathologic processes.
 This article reviews the accepted role of pelvic sonography in gynecologic disease and provides a preview of some of the potential applications of recent advances in sonographic technology.
