Hemorrhoidectomy during pregnancy: risk or relief?
 Acute hemorrhoidal crisis can occur in the pregnant female.
 When medical therapy fails to relieve pain, operative intervention may be necessary.
 The surgeon, however, may be reluctant to operate due to potential complications to the mother and fetus.
 From July 1983 to July 1989, hemorrhoidectomy was performed in 25 of 12,455 pregnant women (0.2 percent) who delivered in our institution.
 Twenty-two women were in their third trimester, 80 percent were multiparous, and each had a remote history of hemorrhoidal symptoms, including intermittent pain, bleeding, and protrusion.
 Closed hemorrhoidectomy was performed under local anesthesia.
 The surgery was directed at removing only symptomatic disease, which included three quadrants in 14 patients, two quadrants in seven patients, and one quadrant in four patients.
 All patients experienced relief of intractable pain the day after surgery, except one patient who required a hemostatic packing during the immediate post-operative period.
 There were no other maternal or fetal complications.
 Subsequent follow-up for anorectal disease ranged from 6 months to 6 years.
 Six (24 percent) patients required additional hemorrhoid treatment.
 Hemorrhoidectomy in selected pregnant patients is safe in our experience.
