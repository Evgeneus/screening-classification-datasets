Parvovirus B19 infection of the fetus. Histology and in situ hybridization.
 Fetal tissues from 16 spontaneous abortions, two terminations, and one perinatal death, 18 of which were associated with maternal human parvovirus B19 infection, were examined for B19 infection by histology and in situ hybridization using a digoxigenin-labeled B19-DNA probe.
 In 15 spontaneous abortions and one termination, erythroblasts with intranuclear inclusions (lantern cells) reacted with B19-DNA by in situ hybridization.
 No internal or external fetal malformations were observed.
 Because 13 (86.7%) spontaneous abortions with lantern cells occurred between the 20th and 28th weeks of gestation, it is postulated that B19 infection may be a particular threat to the fetus during this stage of gestation.
