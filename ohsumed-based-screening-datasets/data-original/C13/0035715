Technique for US-guided fallopian tube catheterization.
 Various catheter techniques guided with fluoroscopy and ultrasound (US) have been developed to assist conception by opening fallopian tubes.
 The authors present a simplified US-guided technique with which they were able to catheterize a fallopian tube consistently and rapidly in 15 of 17 attempts by using a prototype catheter system that is in general use for sperm or embryo transfer.
