Impetigo herpetiformis associated with hypocalcemia of congenital rickets.
 A 30-year-old woman with congenital rickets and autosomal recessive ichthyosis developed impetigo herpetiformis in the second trimester of her first pregnancy.
 This condition was temporally related to her discontinuation of vitamin D supplements and subsequent hypocalcemia.
 No associated systemic symptoms were observed, and a healthy baby was delivered prematurely at 34 weeks' gestation.
 This report supports the association between hypocalcemia and impetigo herpetiformis and raises theoretical questions regarding a relationship between vitamin D metabolism and various epidermal hyperproliferative states.
