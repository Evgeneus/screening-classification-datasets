Human papillomavirus infections of the genital tract.
 Infection of the genital tract by HPV is a sexually transmitted disease of increasing prevalence.
 The association of HPV infection with genital tract malignancies is of great concern, and further studies are needed to clarify this association.
 Few investigators believe at this time that proof of a direct causative role exists for HPV in these cancers, but indirect evidence of such a role is abundant.
 There are many clinical forms of HPV infection of the genital tract, and few clinicians can easily recognize them all.
 Treatment of condyloma acuminatum is difficult and frustrating.
 Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is the safest and most effective therapy for most forms of condyloma acuminatum.
 Recurrence of condyloma acuminatum is common with all presently used forms of therapy, probably owing to latent HPV infection in normal-appearing skin.
 No form of treatment is ideal for all forms of condyloma acuminatum, but without continued efforts to find better therapeutic modalities and preventative measures, the epidemic of genital HPV infection will continue unchecked.
