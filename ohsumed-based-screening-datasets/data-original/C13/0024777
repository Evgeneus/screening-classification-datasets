Iodine-125 interstitial implants as salvage therapy for recurrent gynecologic malignancies.
 Twenty-one patients with the diagnosis of recurrent gynecologic pelvic malignancy from various primary sites were treated with iodine-125 (I-125) interstitial implants.
 Eighteen of these patients had been treated with a combination of surgery and radiation therapy for their primary malignancies and 90% had responded.
 Seventy-five percent had complete local responses.
 The overall survival time, volume-response relationship, and complications are discussed and the radioresponse of various histologic types is presented.
