Conservative treatment of vesicovaginal fistulas by bladder drainage alone.
 We describe 4 cases of conservative management of vesicovaginal fistulas occurring as a complication of abdominal and vaginal hysterectomy.
 In all cases treatment involved simple bladder drainage for periods ranging from 19 to 54 days.
 At follow-up all patients remained dry.
 Such spontaneous closure of vesicovaginal fistulas following adequate bladder drainage has not been previously reported.
