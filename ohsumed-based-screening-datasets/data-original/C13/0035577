Relationship between antepartum cocaine abuse, abnormal umbilical artery Doppler velocimetry, and placental abruption.
 We performed serial umbilical artery Doppler flow velocimetry studies on 314 women and grouped them according to history of antepartum cocaine abuse, placental abruption with antepartum cocaine abuse, preterm labor with antepartum cocaine abuse, preterm labor without antepartum cocaine abuse, and controls without preterm labor or antepartum cocaine abuse.
 Analyses excluded twin gestation, diabetes, and hypertension.
 The overall incidence of deliveries at or before 36 weeks was 28% (31 of 112).
 Thirteen (12%) of the infants were small for gestational age (SGA) and 33 (29%) were low birth weight (LBW).
 Almost all subjects with a history of cocaine abuse had normal systolic-diastolic ratios (S/Ds).
 All patients with abruption had abnormal S/Ds, as did 14 of 64 subjects who had preterm labor and a history of cocaine abuse.
 No abnormal S/Ds were found in the women with preterm labor or in controls.
 Among cocaine-abusing women, there was a significant correlation between placental abruption and abnormal S/Ds (P less than .05) and between abnormal S/Ds and the incidence of preterm birth and SGA and LBW infants.
