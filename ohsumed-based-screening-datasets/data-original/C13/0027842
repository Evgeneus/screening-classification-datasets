Antiviral activity and dose optimum of recombinant macrophage colony-stimulating factor on herpes simplex genitalis in guinea pigs.
 The antiviral activity of recombinant human macrophage CSF (M-CSF) against genital herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) infection in guinea pigs was investigated.
 M-CSF stimulates proliferation of human and guinea pig peripheral blood monocytes, specifically the plastic adherent esterase-positive mononuclear cells.
 When anti-HSV-2 activity of M-CSF was evaluated in guinea pigs by 6 daily injection (s.c.) of M-CSF at various doses (5 x 10(5) to 7 x 10(7) U/kg), we found 2 x 10(6) U/kg to be the optimum dose for protective efficacy against primary HSV-2 infection.
 Either at a lethal, 5 x 10(5) pfu, or sublethal 5 x 10(4) pfu of virus challenge, animals treated with the optimum regimen of M-CSF exhibited lower herpetic lesion scores (p less than 0.005), and lower mortality (p less than 0.025) than animals in placebo group.
 M-CSF treatment increased the HSV-infected cell killing activities of plastic-adherent mononuclear cells, indicating that in vivo administration of M-CSF may activate the antiviral effects of guinea pig macrophages that may play a role in protection against severity and mortality of herpetic disease.
