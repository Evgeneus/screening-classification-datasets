Recurrent abortion and the diagnosis of Wilson disease.
 We describe the first patient with Wilson disease and recurrent abortion who was effectively treated with oral zinc for both conditions.
 Between the ages of 21-26, this patient experienced seven successive unexplained abortions.
 At age 27, neurologic signs and liver function disturbances appeared.
 Wilson disease was diagnosed when Kayser-Fleischer rings were detected in the cornea.
 Decoppering therapy was instituted with zinc sulfate per os.
 By the age of 31, hepatic and neurologic signs had vanished.
 The patient conceived, and after an uncomplicated eighth pregnancy she delivered her first healthy child.
 Two years later, a ninth pregnancy was equally successful.
 The chance that Wilson disease may be the cause of recurrent abortion is small.
 However, because the disease is fatal if left untreated and because it is an underdiagnosed disease, we recommend screening for Wilson disease in cases of unexplained recurrent abortion when family history demonstrates consanguinity or neurologic, psychiatric, and/or liver disorders.
 A strategy to this end is proposed.
