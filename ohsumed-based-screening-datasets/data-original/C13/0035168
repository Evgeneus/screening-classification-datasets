Reproductive outcome after microsurgery for proximal and distal occlusions in the same fallopian tube.
 The reproductive outcome after microsurgery for both proximal and distal occlusions in the same fallopian tube has been reported in only small numbers of women.
 Our case series is in agreement with other series and shows that microsurgery for correction of both proximal and distal occlusions in the same fallopian tube yields only modest fertility and may predispose to ectopic tubal pregnancies.
