Increased inducibility of inflammatory mediators from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of women with salpingitis.
 To investigate whether immune system activation may contribute to the tissue damage observed in salpingitis, we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and quantitated production of the monocyte activation products tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1, and interleukin-6.
 Unstimulated cells from 7 of 20 women with salpingitis spontaneously released tumor necrosis factor at a concentration greater than 2 SD above the mean value produced by cells from 29 healthy donors.
 Interferon gamma (200 U/ml) further induced production of tumor necrosis factor from mononuclear cells of 11 women with salpingitis.
 In contrast, production of tumor necrosis factor by each of 23 other patients who lacked laparoscopic or clinical evidence of salpingitis was similar to that of the controls.
 In a subset of women whose cells were tested for production of other monokines, three of nine women with salpingitis spontaneously released interleukin-1 but none of the others did so.
 Four of nine patients with salpingitis also produced interleukin-6, but none of the others did so.
 None of the monokines were detected in serum from any subject.
 The results suggest that monocytes from women with salpingitis are primed in vivo and produce inflammatory mediators under conditions where monocytes from other women are poorly responsive.
 This increased monokine inducibility may contribute to the tubal damage that is the hallmark of salpingitis.
