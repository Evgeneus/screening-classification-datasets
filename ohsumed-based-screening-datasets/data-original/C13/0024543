The significance of amniotic fluid volume during intrapartum fetal acoustic stimulation.
 The relationship of intrapartum fluid volume to the fetal response to acoustic stimulation was investigated in 112 patients who were in the latent phase of labor.
 Amniotic fluid volume appears to play an insignificant role in the genesis of fetal heart rate decelerations that occur after fetal acoustic stimulation, regardless of the amount of amniotic fluid present.
