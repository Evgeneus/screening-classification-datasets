Delivery in an obstetric birth chair: a randomized controlled trial.
 OBJECTIVE--To determine whether nulliparae whose second stage of labour is conducted in an obstetric birth chair have a lower incidence of instrumental delivery than those using a conventional delivery bed.
 DESIGN--Randomized controlled trial using sealed, opaque envelopes for allocation.
 SETTING--Delivery ward in a busy teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS--1250 nulliparae with a singleton live fetus with cephalic presentation, without epidural anaesthesia, who had achieved full dilatation.
 INTERVENTION--Intention to conduct second and third stages of labour in either the Birth-EZ chair or the conventional delivery bed, as randomly allocated.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Primary measure: vaginal operative delivery; principal secondary measures: duration of second stage, perineal trauma, blood loss, women's views, and neonatal status.
 RESULTS--Delivery in the birth chair did not result in a reduction in operative delivery, overall.
 However, there was a reduction in vaginal operative delivery for fetal heart rate abnormality.
 There was no beneficial effect on perineal trauma or puerperal perineal pain.
 Post-partum haemorrhage was more frequent in the birth chair group.
 CONCLUSIONS--Delivery in the birth chair does not offer any obvious advantage to women over delivery on a bed.
