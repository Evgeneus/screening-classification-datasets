Brucellosis in pregnancy.
 Brucellosis in pregnancy is a rare entity.
 It has been associated with an increased risk of spontaneous abortion in animals and possibly humans.
 Among six patients with brucellosis in pregnancy, one requested termination of the pregnancy in the first trimester, one had a spontaneous abortion at 12 weeks that could not be directly related to brucellosis, and four continued their pregnancies with no significant increase in maternal or neonatal morbidity or mortality.
