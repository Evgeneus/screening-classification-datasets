Adult self-esteem and locus of control as a function of familial alcoholism and dysfunction.
 This study examines self-esteem and locus of control in adult children of alcoholics.
 We assessed these measures in 195 professional adults in relation to alcoholism and functioning in the family of origin.
 Although the presence of parental alcoholism was not a predictor of significant differences in adult self-esteem or locus of control, familial dysfunction was reflected in significant differences in self-esteem.
 This suggests that parental alcoholism does not necessarily result in personality differences in adult children.
