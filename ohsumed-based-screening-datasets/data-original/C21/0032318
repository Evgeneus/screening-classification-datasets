Anatomy of the accident scene: a prospective study of injury and mortality.
 This study of the accident scene focuses on the effects of vehicular deformity and restraint devices on occupant injury.
 In 500 patients evaluated in a Level I trauma center, seatbelts significantly reduced the likelihood of individuals' requiring the trauma center (P less than 0.0001).
 Seatbelts also significantly reduced the mortality rate of those who were transported to the trauma center (P less than 0.04).
 Dashboard intrusion correlated with pelvic (P less than 0.001) and femur (P less than 0.03) fractures, closed head injuries (P less than 0.001), and intraabdominal injuries (P less than 0.02).
 Steering wheel deformity correlated with pelvic fractures (P less than 0.001) and closed head injuries (P less than 0.005).
 Windshield violation correlated with closed head injuries (P less than 0.014) and spinal fractures (P less than 0.03).
 Irreparable vehicles correlated with pelvic (P less than 0.0001) and femur fractures (P less than 0.01), closed head injuries (P less than 0.0001) and intra-abdominal injuries (P less than 0.0001).
 The authors conclude that a careful examination of the accident scene for specific mechanisms of injury can lead to better prehospital care, more rapid and consistent diagnosis of injury, and improved patient outcome.
 Further prospective studies should accumulate data that will improve prehospital care, alert physicians to possible injury, increase community awareness of injury prevention, and improve vehicle construction.
