Repair of a traumatically amputated penis with return of erectile function.
 Repair of the amputated penis may be successful using macroscopic and microscopic surgical realignments.
 However, to date, no one has reported return of erectile function documented by nocturnal penile tumescence.
 We report a case of traumatically amputated penis with microscopic repair and return of erectile function documented by nocturnal penile tumescence.
 In addition, the current literature regarding microscopic versus nonmicroscopic repair is reviewed.
