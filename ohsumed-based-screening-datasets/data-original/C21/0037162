Swimming and the older athlete.
 Swimming is an organized, fast-growing sport and competitive swimmers are now found in abundance in all age groups.
 Including those athletes who do not compete in formal events (masters swimming program) and those participating in outside events (long-distance, channel swimming, triathlons, and so on), it may be one of the largest participant sports in this country.
 Injuries to the elite collegiate competitive swimmers have been well-documented.
 Considerations and injuries to the masters-level swimmer closely mirror those found in the younger athlete, but these injuries reflect the impact of tissue aging (degenerative disease).
 The preparticipation history and physical examination become more important.
 We are hopeful that this article will contribute to greater safety and enjoyment among all older swimmers.
