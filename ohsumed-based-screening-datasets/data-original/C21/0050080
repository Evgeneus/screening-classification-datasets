Indications for radiography in patients with acute ankle injuries: role of the physical examination.
 A prospective study was performed to test the hypothesis that a thorough physical examination can eliminate the need for a large number of radiographs obtained in patients with acute ankle trauma.
 Two hundred one patients were seen in the emergency department for acute ankle trauma and referred to the department of radiology for ankle radiographs.
 Radiology residents performed a brief but thorough physical examination of the ankle in all 201 patients.
 Solely on the basis of a strict set of physical examination criteria (examination for gross deformity, instability, crepitation, focal bony tenderness, severe soft-tissue tenderness, moderate or severe soft-tissue swelling, and ecchymosis), the radiologists determined whether or not the radiographs were indicated.
 All patients, irrespective of the physical examination, underwent ankle radiography, and the results were correlated with those of the physical examination.
 On the basis of the results of the physical examinations, 101 (50%) of the radiologic studies were not indicated.
 In only one of these patients was a fracture seen on radiographs.
 The radiograph in this case showed a small avulsion fracture of the dorsal aspect of the talus that was clinically insignificant (no cast or surgery was required).
 Our results suggest that a brief but thorough physical examination can eliminate the need for a large percentage of radiographs ordered in patients with acute ankle trauma.
