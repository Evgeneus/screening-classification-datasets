Arthrodesis of the ankle and subtalar joints.
 The late reconstruction of a complex nonunion of the distal tibial metaphysis, the ankle, or the subtalar joint was undertaken in five patients through a posterior surgical approach and the application of a blade plate into the os calcis.
 This technique was preferred as a salvage operation when the surrounding soft tissue envelope was compromised by the initial injury, previous surgical procedures, or infection.
 Each of the cases was notable for a segmental bone loss, an infected nonunion, or a collapse of the talar body.
 In the presence of a major soft tissue defect, the internal fixation was accompanied by the application of a microvascular free flap.
 The postoperative assessment of the posterior arthrodesis with the blade plate fixation was at an average of 33 months.
 Using a modification of the Boston Children's Hospital ankle scoring system, a preoperative and postoperative assessment was made.
 The criteria included an objective rating system based on the intensity of pain, the cessation of drainage, the degree of independent ambulation, and the roentgenographic documentation of union.
 The average preoperative score was 13 (range, 8-16).
 After arthrodesis, the average score was 44 (range, 40-48), with three patients rated excellent and two rated good.
