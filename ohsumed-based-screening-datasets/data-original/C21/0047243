Control of excessive lead exposure in radiator repair workers.
 In 1988, 83 automotive repair workers with blood lead levels (BLLs) greater than 25 micrograms/dL were reported to state health departments in the seven states that collaborated with CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in maintaining registries of elevated BLLs in adults.
 In 18 (22%) of these 83 persons, BLLs were greater than 50 micrograms/dL.
 Among automotive repair workers for whom a job category was specified, radiator repair work was the principal source of lead exposure.
 The major sources of exposure for radiator repair workers are lead fumes generated during soldering and lead dust produced during radiator cleaning.
 This report summarizes current BLL surveillance data for radiator repair workers and describes three control technologies that are effective in reducing lead exposures in radiator repair shops.
