Sperm retrieval by electro-ejaculation. Preliminary experience in patients with secondary anejaculation.
 Twelve patients with spinal cord injury and 2 diabetics with secondary anejaculation underwent 26 sessions of electro-ejaculation, using a technique which has previously been popular only in veterinary medicine.
 Ejaculate was obtained on 21 occasions.
 Semen quality was adequate for cryostorage on 9 occasions (8 patients); on 8 occasions (5 patients) it was used for immediate artificial insemination of the partner.
 To date, there has been 1 pregnancy resulting in a live birth.
