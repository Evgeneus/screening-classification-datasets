Spinal cord compression from a thoracic paraganglioma: case report.
 A 34-year-old man with a 4-month history of midthoracic back pain sought treatment for a recent onset of lower extremity paresthesia and stiffness.
 A myelogram and computed tomographic myelogram disclosed an extradural block at the level of the 8th thoracic vertebral body with involvement of the pedicles, lamina, and spinous process.
 A posterior decompression of the spinal cord with subtotal resection of a highly vascular tumor was performed.
 The tumor was identified as a paraganglioma.
 In a second stage, the remainder of the tumor was embolized preoperatively, and gross total excision and sequential stabilization of the spine with a Luque rectangle and sublaminar wires were performed.
 The patient has been symptom free and without signs of a recurrence in the spine for over 13 months.
 A large abdominal paraganglioma was recently resected from its probable origin from the adventitia of the abdominal aorta.
