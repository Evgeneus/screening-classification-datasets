Urine screening practices in methadone maintenance clinics. A survey of how the results are used.
 The urinalysis practices of 324 methadone maintenance clinics were surveyed using a brief self-report questionnaire.
 Results indicate that there is wide variability in collection practices and clinic responses to positive findings.
 Virtually all clinics provide counseling and revocation of take-home methadone doses as a response to positive urinalysis results.
 However, increase in urine screening frequency, methadone dose adjustments, contingency contracting, group therapy, and eventual discharge are interventions also used.
 The implementation of different interventions varied as a function of clinic size, city size, region of the country, and program funding source.
