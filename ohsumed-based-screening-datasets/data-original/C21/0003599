Post-traumatic acute renal failure, 1956-1988.
 Eighty patients with acute renal failure secondary to trauma treated between 1956 and 1988 are reviewed.
 The overall mortality was 46.3%.
 Factors associated with increased mortality were age, high Injury Severity Score, and injury to the abdomen and pelvic contents.
 The number of injuries, the delay between injury and the institution of dialysis, and the level of urea on starting dialysis did not affect mortality.
 The declining incidence of traumatic acute renal failure highlights the importance of prompt effective resuscitation of injured patients.
