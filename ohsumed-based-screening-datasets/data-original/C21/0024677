Selective antagonistic effects of exposure to bright light on the hypothermic action of ethanol.
 Flinders Sensitive and Resistant Lines of rats, which are differentially sensitive to the hypothermic effects of both muscarinic agonists and ethanol, were exposed to full spectrum artificial bright light for eight days, because exposure to bright light has been shown to blunt hypothermic responses to muscarinic agonists.
 There was a selective blunting of the hypothermic effects of ethanol, but no significant change in the intoxicating effects of ethanol, as measured by evaluation of the righting reflex.
 The selective effect of exposure to bright light on the hypothermic actions of ethanol suggests that bright light may be modifying the function of only a limited number of brain regions, including the hypothalamus.
