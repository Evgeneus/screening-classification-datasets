Patient compliance--a factor in facial trauma repair.
 The clinical records of 25 consecutive patients who were treated for facial trauma were reviewed and analyzed to ascertain what effect patient cooperation had on the outcome of facial fracture repair.
 The study was designed to establish the incidence of complications and to discover what factors contributed to untoward sequela in such patients.
 Overall, 15 patients (60%) were noncompliant in one or more aspects of their care.
 Six patients (24%) had significant postoperative complications associated with their facial injuries.
 Four of these patients were not fully cooperative.
