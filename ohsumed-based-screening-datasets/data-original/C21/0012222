Adult respiratory distress syndrome from organophosphate poisoning.
 A 46-year-old man after an accidental exposure to organophosphates developed florid adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
 A markedly suppressed level of pseudocholinesterase and red blood cell cholinesterase with profuse salivation and sweating confirmed the diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning.
 Within 48 hours, patient developed respiratory distress needing intubation.
 Despite maximum ventilatory support and positive end-expiratory pressure, hypoxia persisted, Swan Ganz (Baxter Healthcare Inc, Irvine, CA) pressures showed low pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and patient died on the third hospital day.
 An autopsy confirmed the picture of ARDS.
 Other potential causes of ARDS were excluded.
 Although rare, organophosphate poisoning should be added to the list of toxins causing ARDS.
