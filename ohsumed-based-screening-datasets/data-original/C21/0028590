Rupture of low transverse cesarean scars during trial of labor 
 We report eight cases of rupture of low transverse cesarean scars occurring during trials of labor.
 The cases occurred in five hospitals in the Denver metropolitan area during a 13-month period.
 The estimated incidence was 0.7% of planned trials of labor.
 Complications of rupture included one neonatal death, two cases of severe neonatal asphyxia, three maternal bladder lacerations, and one hysterectomy.
