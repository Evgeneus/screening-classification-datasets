Overview of work-related hazards in nursing: health and safety issues.
 Nurses working in hospital environments are exposed to a number of occupational health hazards.
 For five categories of hazards we present research-based documentation of potential and actual health-related problems, and avenues for health promotion and prevention of exposures.
 Both personal and organizational responsibilities for self-health protection are addressed.
