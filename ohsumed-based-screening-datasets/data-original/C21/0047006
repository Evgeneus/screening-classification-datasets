Diltiazem-induced psychosis and a possible diltiazem-lithium interaction.
 Calcium channel blockers are being used increasingly for a variety of cardiovascular problems.
 Diltiazem hydrochloride, a benzothiazepine derivative, has been reported to have a low incidence of adverse side effects.
 We report a case of acute psychosis associated with the use of diltiazem in a patient receiving lithium carbonate therapy.
 Both diltiazem hydrochloride and lithium carbonate have calcium antagonist effects in the central nervous system, and we review their mechanisms of action.
 A possible synergistic drug interaction between diltiazem and lithium is reported.
