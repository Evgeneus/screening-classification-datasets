Use of whole bowel irrigation in an infant following iron overdose.
 An 11-month-old, 11-kg infant presented to the emergency department after ingesting 130 to 150 mg/kg of elemental iron.
 Emesis was induced twice and the child was lavaged throughout a 4-hour period with some tablet return.
 An abdominal radiograph after gastrointestinal decontamination showed at least 16 whole iron tablets remaining in the stomach.
 Serum iron drawn 2 hours postingestion was 46.7 mumol/L.
 Blood glucose was 7.7 mmol/L and white blood count was 21,800 mm3.
 Despite a second lavage 8 hours postingestion, a large number of whole tablets were visualized in the stomach per radiograph.
 Whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (Golytely, Braintree Laboratories, Inc, Braintree, MA) was begun via nasogastric tube 14 hours after the ingestion.
 Serial abdominal radiographs showed tablet movement out of the stomach within 4 hours after initiating whole bowel irrigation.
 This case demonstrates the safety and efficacy of WBI in an infant when conventional gastrointestinal decontamination has failed.
