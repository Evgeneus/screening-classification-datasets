Snowmobile trauma: an eleven-year experience.
 Records of 88 patients with snowmobile injuries from 1977 to 1987 were reviewed to identify the types of trauma.
 Data collected included age, sex, method and degree of injury, use of safety attire, and risk factors.
 There were 77 males and 11 females.
 Seventeen (19.3%) were children under the age of 16.
 Poor driving judgment involved in the hitting of obstacles led to the majority of injuries.
 There were 106 fractures in 71 patients.
 Eighteen patients (25%) had more than one fracture.
 Eleven patients had loss of consciousness.
 Eighty-eight other injuries resulted for a total of 205 injuries.
 There were three fatalities.
 Results indicate that inexperience, prior use of alcohol, driver carelessness, excessive speed, and poor adherence to manufacturer recommendations were the leading contributors to the accidents.
