Extremity replantation.
 Although the success of replantation and revascularization is in part related to the length of the ischemic interval, it is important to bear in mind that microsurgical intervention must be given appropriate priority relative to the patient's other injuries.
 Very few patients die as a result of upper extremity trauma.
 However, the economic, psychologic, and physical debility of a chronic hand injury will be the ultimate handicap in patients who survive multisystem trauma.
 Therefore, management of the injured extremity has an important place in the overall scheme of trauma care.
