Beer versus mixed-drink consumption at fraternity parties: a time and place for low-alcohol alternatives.
 Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) measurements were taken of university students entering and exiting three fraternity parties: during each party, the rates of drinking beer and mixed drinks were monitored.
 The parties choose beer or mixed drinks to consume exclusively throughout the evening at no cost.
 Unbeknownst to the subjects, the following conditions were manipulated across successive parties: (1) at the first party (64 males and 43 females) the beer alternative had standard alcohol content (i.e., 7% alcohol by volume), (2) at the second party (70 males and 48 females) the beer was a low-alcohol beer (3% alcohol) and (3) at the third party (53 males and 41 females) the partiers were randomly assigned to a regular alcohol content conditions of beer or mixed drinks or to a low-alcohol content condition (i.e., 3% beer or mixed drinks made with 7/8-oz of distilled spirits).
 Since those assigned to the low-alcohol conditions did not consume more beverages than those in the regular alcohol conditions, a titration hypothesis was not supported and the exit BACs were significantly lower for partiers in the low-alcohol conditions.
 When females drank at the same rate as males, their exit BACs were significantly higher than those of males.
 Implications for DWI prevention are discussed.
