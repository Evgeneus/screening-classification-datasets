Use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in a Jehovah's Witness refusing transfusion of blood products: case report.
 Recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) administration to a Jehovah's witness refusing blood transfusions increased her nadir packed cell volume from 13% to 37% and reticulocyte count from 2% to 17.7%.
 R-HuEPO may provide an alternative safe and effective therapy in life-threatening anemia when blood transfusions are unacceptable to the patient.
