Chronic posttraumatic aortic pseudoaneurysm. Recognition before rupture.
 Few patients survive transection of the aorta caused by blunt trauma.
 However, among those who do are a small number who go on to live with an unrecognized pseudoaneurysm that may rupture at any time.
 Because these aneurysms may be mistaken for more common disease processes, such as hilar adenopathy, atherosclerotic aneurysm, or neoplasia, the authors describe radiographic findings that suggest the correct diagnosis.
