Cardiac function and metabolism after chronic alcohol consumption: adaptation, reversibility, and effects of verapamil.
 Hamsters were fed 50% alcohol instead of drinking water for up to 42 weeks (average serum alcohol levels were 0.12 +/- 0.06 gm/dl during the 42 weeks).
 One group of hamsters (28 weeks) was given verapamil 3 days before they were killed.
 Two groups were withdrawn from alcohol acutely (3 days before they were killed) at 14 and 28 weeks.
 High-energy phosphate compounds were studied in isolated hearts with 31P-MRS standardized by freeze clamping the tissue.
 Hemodynamics of the heart were monitored throughout the study.
 After 7 and 14 weeks of alcohol ingestion, developed pressure and the phosphorylation potential were depressed in the hearts of chronically treated hamsters.
 At 28 and 42 weeks developed pressure increased but was significantly below baseline values; however, the phosphorylation potential and [pH]i returned to baseline values at 28 and 42 weeks.
 Throughout the 7 to 42 weeks of alcohol ingestion the alcohol-treated hamsters had a significantly higher end-diastolic pressure as compared with control animals.
 Withdrawal of alcohol (3 days before the hamsters were killed) reversed the depression of developed pressure and the phosphorylation potential.
 Acute administration of verapamil (therapeutic dose 3 days before they were killed) to hamsters given alcohol for 28 weeks reversed the depressed hemodynamic values.
 Overall the data suggest an adaptation of the heart to continuing alcohol consumption, which was related to normalization of the phosphorylation potential and [pH]i and partial alleviation of functional depression.
