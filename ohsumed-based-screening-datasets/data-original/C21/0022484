Penile reconstruction for a victim of electrical injury with bilateral below-elbow amputations.
 We report on a young man who had complete loss of the penis and bilateral below-elbow amputations following severe electrical injury.
 Reconstruction of the penis was completed by using a deliberately tailored dorsalis pedis flap to solve the problems encountered by a migrated skin tube.
 Construction of a neourethra with release of the contracture was done simultaneously and brought about successful results.
