An objective criterion for the cessation of deferoxamine therapy in the acutely iron poisoned patient.
 The criteria for the cessation of deferoxamine therapy in the acutely iron poisoned patient are vague and imprecise.
 We have developed a urinary iron assay which is not confounded by the presence of deferoxamine and have established a reference range in non-iron poisoned deferoxamine treated human volunteers.
 When reported as a urine iron to creatinine ratio the results from isolated urine specimens can be utilized to guide deferoxamine therapy.
 This method is rapid, simple and inexpensive and utilizes equipment and reagents found in laboratories already providing emergency serum iron concentrations.
 We have found this assay to be useful as a criterion for the cessation of deferoxamine therapy in the acutely iron poisoned patient and as an objective indicator of a positive deferoxamine chelation challenge.
