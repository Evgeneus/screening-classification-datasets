Intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil. An unusual complication of a Hickman catheter.
 Venous access devices (VAD) have become an important tool in the management of patients with cancer.
 Multiple complications can occur as a consequence of insertion of a VAD.
 The authors report a case of a Hickman catheter perforating the wall of the superior vena cava into the pericardium, resulting in accidental intrapericardial infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
 Pericarditis and cardiac arrhythmias developed, but the patient did not have cardiac tamponade.
 She recovered from the event without apparent chronic cardiac dysfunction.
