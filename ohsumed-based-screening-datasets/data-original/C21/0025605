Ipsilateral radial head dislocation and radial shaft fracture. A case report.
 Dislocation of the radial head in an adult is an uncommon injury.
 The mechanism of injury is considered to be due to hyperpronation of the forearm.
 Fracture-dislocations of the forearm are well described and involve both the radius and the ulna.
 A dislocation of the head of the radius with an ipsilateral fracture of the shaft of the radius seems not to have been reported; the mechanism of injury can only be postulated.
