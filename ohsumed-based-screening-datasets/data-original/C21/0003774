Septic pulmonary emboli. A rare cause of bilateral pneumothorax in drug abusers.
 An intravenous drug abuser presented with bilateral pneumothorax.
 This is a previously unreported (to our knowledge) complication of septic pulmonary emboli secondary to right-sided endocarditis.
 This possibility must be considered in the differential diagnosis of pneumothorax in drug addicts.
