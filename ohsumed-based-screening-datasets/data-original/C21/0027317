Development of tolerance to inhibitory effect of ethanol on endothelium-dependent vascular relaxation in ethanol-fed rats.
 Rats were maintained on liquid diets containing ethanol (35% of total calories) or an equicaloric volume of sucrose instead of ethanol for 10 wk.
 Vascular strips of isolated rat aortas were mounted in organ chambers to record isometric tension.
 Ethanol in vitro inhibited the endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine and ATP in both pair-fed control and ethanol-fed rats.
 The inhibitory effect of ethanol was greater in the pair-fed rats.
 In addition, the magnitudes of these relaxation responses in the absence of ethanol in vitro in pair-fed rats were similar to those in the presence of ethanol in ethanol-fed rats.
 In the absence of ethanol in vitro, the relaxations in response to acetylcholine and ATP in the ethanol-fed rats were greater than in the pair-fed rats.
 These results suggest that chronic ethanol consumption can induce tolerance to ethanol-induced inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine and ATP, and that the relaxations can become adapted to the presence of plasma levels of ethanol, which may inhibit the relaxation in vivo.
 The augmented relaxation in the ethanol-fed rats may result from the mechanism causing tolerance to the inhibitory effect of ethanol.
