Poisonings in laboratory personnel and health care professionals.
 A case report of an unresponsive chemist presenting to the emergency department is presented; in retrospect, the patient was discovered to have intentionally ingested cyanide.

 Key diagnostic findings, in the absence of history of exposure, are discussed for these five agents.
