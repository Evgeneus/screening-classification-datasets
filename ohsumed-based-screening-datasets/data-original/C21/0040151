Child passenger restraint use and motor-vehicle--related fatalities among children--United States, 1982-1990.
 Although in recent years the increase in child safety seat use in the United States has saved lives of and prevented injuries to infants (children aged less than or equal to 1 year) and toddlers (children aged 1-4 years), the leading cause of death among U.S.
 children aged 1-4 years continues to be injuries to motor-vehicle occupants (1).
 These injuries account for the largest number of years of potential life lost before age 65 and the highest costs associated with pediatric injury (2).
 This report, based on data from the Fatal Accident Reporting System (FARS) (maintained by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), summarizes overall trends from 1982 through 1990 for motor-vehicle-related fatalities among children and lives saved by child passenger restraint use.
