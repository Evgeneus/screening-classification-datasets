Dextromethorphan poisoning reversed by naloxone.
 Dextromethorphan, a common ingredient in cough syrups, has rarely been described to cause toxicity.
 The authors describe an unusual case of a known asthmatic presenting with somnolence, who appeared to be in end-stage respiratory failure.
 Her partial response to routine naloxone, 1 mg, was surprising.
 However, additional naloxone was required to completely normalize the patient's mental status.
 The authors suggest naloxone be administered in doses of 0.4 mg or more intravenously in suspected dextromethorphan overdose.
