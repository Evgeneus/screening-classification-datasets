Liver lacerations--a marker of severe but sometimes subtle intra-abdominal injuries in adults.
 Experience with conservative management of solid viscus injuries from abdominal trauma in children has produced the impetus for a similar management in adults.
 To explore the implications of such a policy, we reviewed the records of 82 patients with hepatic injuries noted at laparotomy.
 Indications for laparotomy were positive findings on diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) or CT scan, or a history of penetrating trauma.
 The liver injuries were graded according to severity: grade I, 19 patients; grade II, 20 patients (low severity = LS); grade III, 14 patients; grade IV, 6 patients (high severity = HS).
 Twenty-three injuries were not classified by the operating surgeon.
 Of the 53 patients with blunt hepatic trauma, 23 (43%) had concomitant injuries that required operative intervention.
 Twenty-nine patients had penetrating liver injuries.
 Fourteen (48%) had associated injuries requiring intervention.
 Patients most likely to have nonoperative management, those with grade I and grade II liver injuries (LS), comprised 48 of the total.
 In this subgroup there were 26 (54.2%) associated injuries requiring operative intervention.
 Shock could not be used as a factor to differentiate patients not requiring operative intervention.
 Nineteen of the LS patients requiring operative intervention secondary to associated injury were never in shock.
 In adult trauma victims positive DPL findings secondary to minor hepatic injuries that might not require operative intervention serve as a marker for associated injuries that do require operation.
 The risk of nonoperative management of hepatic injuries based upon radiologic diagnosis is not the result of complications from the hepatic injury.
