Fishhook injuries: a prospective evaluation.
 A prospective study was conducted involving 100 nonrandomized, consecutive patients who suffered fishhook injury during the summer of 1990 in Alaska.
 Time of injury prior to admission to the emergency department, location of fishhook, method of removal, wound care, systemic antibiotic prophylaxis, anesthetic, tetanus immunization status, fishhook size, and complication rate were evaluated.
 Results of this study suggest that most fishhook injuries involve the hands or head and that postremoval wound care including oral antibiotic therapy may not be critical.
 Local anesthetics and simple removal techniques are adequate for nearly all fishhook injuries.
 Routine systemic antibiotic prophylaxis is not necessary for uncomplicated soft tissue injury due to fishhooks not involving cartilage or tendons.
