Classifying calcaneal tendon injury according to MRI findings.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 28 patients with suspected calcaneal tendon injury prior to treatment.
 None of the patients were involved in competitive sports.
 All underwent clinical examination, some had had ultrasound or CT scans.
 We identified four types of lesions: type I, inflammatory reaction; type II, degenerative change; type III, incomplete rupture and type IV, complete rupture.
 Thirteen of the 28 patients underwent surgery and the diagnostic findings were verified.
 We recommend that type I, type II and type III lesions be managed conservatively, while type IV lesions should be operated in the young and active patient.
