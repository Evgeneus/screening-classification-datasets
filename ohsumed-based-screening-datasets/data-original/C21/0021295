External fixation for intra-articular fractures of the distal radius.
 In a prospective study of 132 patients with an average age of 35 years, unstable intra-articular fractures of the distal radius were treated by external fixator.
 Only 15 cases required limited open reduction.
 Follow-up was for a mean of 42 months.
 There were few complications and 83% of patients had good or excellent results.
 There was a statistically significant correlation between the severity of the fracture and the clinical outcome, irrespective of radiological restoration.
 Articular and soft-tissue damage following violent compressive forces may lead to a degree of functional impairment.
