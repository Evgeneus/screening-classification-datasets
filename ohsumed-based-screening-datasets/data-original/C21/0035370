Rescue of experimental intrathecal methotrexate overdose with carboxypeptidase-G2.
 The carboxypeptidase G class of enzymes rapidly hydrolyze methotrexate (MTX) into the inactive metabolites 4-deoxy-4-amino-N10-methylpteroic acid (DAMPA) and glutamate.
 This study evaluated the use of carboxypeptidase-G2 (CPDG2) as a potential intrathecal (IT) rescue agent for massive IT MTX overdose.
 The CSF pharmacokinetics of MTX with and without CPDG2 rescue was studied in adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) using a nontoxic IT 5 mg dose (equivalent to 50 mg in humans).
 Without CPDG2 rescue, peak CSF MTX concentration was 2,904 +/- 340 mumol/L.
 Within 5 minutes of administration of 30 U IT CPDG2, CSF MTX concentrations decreased greater than 400-fold to 6.55 +/- 6.7 microM.
 Subsequently, groups of three monkeys received either 25 mg IT MTX (equivalent to 250 mg in humans) followed by 150 U IT CPDG2 or 50 mg IT MTX (equivalent to 500 mg in humans) followed by 300 U IT CPDG2.
 All animals survived without neurotoxicity.
 Our studies suggest that CPDG2 may prove to be an important addition to the currently recommended strategy for the management of IT MTX overdose.
