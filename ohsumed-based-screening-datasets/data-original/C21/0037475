Fatal acetaminophen poisoning with evidence of subendocardial necrosis of the heart.
 The authors describe a case of fatal acetaminophen overdose which occurred in a 16-year-old female.
 Her serum acetaminophen concentration 11.5 h postingestion was 154 mg/L.
 Antidotal therapy was unsuccessful, and after 9 days she died.
 Autopsy findings included centrilobular zonal liver necrosis, acute proximal renal tubular necrosis, and diffuse alveolar pulmonary damage.
 Her heart was transplanted into a young woman with congenital heart disease.
 The recipient expired 14 days after the transplant as a result of sepsis complicating bowel ischemia.
 The transplanted heart showed extensive subendocardial myocyte necrosis related to acetaminophen toxicity and not rejection.
