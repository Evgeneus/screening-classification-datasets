Four-part valgus impacted fractures of the proximal humerus.
 There is a specific type of displaced four-part fracture of the proximal humerus which consists of valgus impaction of the head fragment; this deserves special consideration because the rate of avascular necrosis is lower than that of other displaced four-part fractures.
 Using either closed reduction or limited open reduction and minimal internal fixation, 74% satisfactory results can be achieved in this injury.
