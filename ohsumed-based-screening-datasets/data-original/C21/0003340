Experimental study of starch-induced intraperitoneal adhesions 
 The effects of starch on the development of postoperative adhesions were examined in 144 Sprague Dawley rats.
 Groups of rats were injected intraperitoneally with suspensions of washings from starched gloves, starch-free gloves and starch-poor washed gloves, and after operative manipulation of the bowel.
 The incidence of adhesions was greatest (78 per cent) after laparotomy and injections of starch-rich washings and least when starch-poor (33 per cent) or starch-free glove suspensions (37 per cent) were used, confirming an advantage for washing gloves or switching to starch-free products.
