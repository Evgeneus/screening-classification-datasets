Isopropanol ingestion: a report of six episodes with isopropanol and acetone serum concentration time data.
 The disposition of isopropanol and its major metabolite acetone were observed in six isopropanol ingestion episodes among five patients.
 Serum admission isopropanol and peak acetone concentrations ranged from 16.5 to 220 mg/dL and 141 to 585 mg/dL respectively.
 Ingestions ranged from 120 to 300 mL of 70% isopropanol with concomitant ethanol ingestion in two episodes.
 The isopropanol and acetone apparent half-lives ranged from 2.9 to 16.2 hours (h) and 7.6 to 26.2 h respectively.
 Two episodes of isopropanol ingestion were observed within a 9 month period in patient one.
 Isopropanol terminal elimination rate constants were 0.043 and 0.085 per hour (per h) with no marked difference in acetone terminal elimination rate constants (0.025 and 0.033 per h).
 Discrepancy between the two isopropanol elimination rate constants reflected concomitant ethanol abuse with the first ingestion.
 Reductions in isopropanol and acetone half-lives were also noted among patients requiring ventilatory support.
