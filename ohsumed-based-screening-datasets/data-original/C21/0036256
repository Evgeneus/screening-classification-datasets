A locking nail for fractures of the humerus.
 We reviewed 19 patients treated for upper arm fractures using Seidel's locking nail system, which allows for early function after operation.
 The overall results were good with no cases of pseudarthrosis, infection or radial nerve palsy.
 All the patients regained full shoulder movements with no evidence of rotator cuff lesions.
