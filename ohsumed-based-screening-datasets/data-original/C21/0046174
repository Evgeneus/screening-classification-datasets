Sensitivity of in vivo X-ray fluorescence determination of skeletal lead stores.
 Eighteen patients with known past occupational lead exposure underwent parenteral diagnostic chelation with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and x-ray fluorescent determination of in vivo skeletal lead stores at the distal styloid process of the ulna and at the temporal base bone using a cobalt 57 source and measuring lead Ka x-rays.
 X-ray fluorescent lead measurements in both locations correlated with results of diagnostic chelation.
 Using a post-chelation urinary excretion of greater than 600 micrograms lead/24 h as the definition of "high-" lead stores, sensitivity of x-ray fluorescence at the wrist and temple was 56% and 39%, respectively.
