Treatment of forearm fractures by Hoffman external fixation. A study of 93 patients.
 Ninety-three patients with acute fractures of the diaphysis of one or both bones of the forearm were treated by a Hoffmann external fixator, using a half-frame configuration.
 Whenever possible, closed methods of reduction were used.
 The versatility of the Hoffmann external fixator allows multiple attempts and possible secondary resumption of the reduction.
 The half-frame configuration is stable enough, allowing the restoration and maintenance of the precise anatomy of the forearm bones and early active postoperative motion.
 The median length of retention of the external fixator was 13 weeks.
 Because of the elastic type of fixation, a solid periosteal callus was usually obtained.
 Non-union occurred in 8.5% of the patients.
 One refracture at the former fracture site was observed.
