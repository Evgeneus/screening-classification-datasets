Management of posterior urethral strictures secondary to pelvic fractures in children.
 Bulboprostatic anastomotic urethroplasty was performed in 20 children with posterior urethral strictures secondary to bony pelvic fractures.
 The approach was perineal in 4 children and transpubic abdominoperineal in 16, with good postoperative results in 100 and 62.5%, respectively.
 In some children the urethral disruption occurred within the prostate itself and not at the prostatomembranous junction.
 In such cases the proximal sphincteric mechanism may be at risk and immediate repair of the injury is advisable.
 In the case of common prostatomembranous disruption displacement of the urethra may be significant.
 In such cases a transpubic approach is preferable.
 If the proximal sphincteric mechanism is deranged, it can be managed at the same time.
