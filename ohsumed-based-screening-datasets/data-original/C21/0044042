HIV prevalence and risk behaviours for HIV transmission in South Australian prisons 
 During the latter half of 1989, HIV prevalence in South Australian prisoners was 1.4%.
 The prevalence of HIV infection across the prison system did not change significantly during 1989 but there was clustering of HIV-infected prisoners in some prisons.
 Almost half the prisoners from all of the South Australian prisons agreed to participate in our studies, from which we estimate that about 42% of prisoners engage in risk behaviours at least once while incarcerated.
 Prisoners estimated that 36% of all prisoners inject drugs intravenously at some stage during their stay and that 12% engage in anal intercourse at least once.
 Interviews with former prisoners who had a history of intravenous drug use revealed that about half had injected themselves while in prison, 60% shared needles and most did not clean shared needles adequately.
 Most of these prisoners injected themselves once a month or less frequently.
 The conditions for spread of HIV within the prison system exist but at the current prevalence of infection, transmission can be expected to be infrequent.
 The opportunity exists now to improve and expand preventive measures.
