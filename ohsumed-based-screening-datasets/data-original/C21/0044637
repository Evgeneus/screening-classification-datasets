Injuries to children and adolescents: impact on physical health.
 Disability resulting from injuries was examined in a health maintenance organization population of children and adolescents 0 through 19 years of age.
 The physical health status instrument from the Rand Health Insurance Study was used to evaluate functional outcome of patients seen in the emergency room and outpatient clinic.
 Overall, 55.1% of individuals had limitations in their usual activities during the week following injury; 16.4% and 3.8% were not yet back to full activities after 1 week and 1 month, respectively.
 Individuals 10 years of age and older had more functional impairment than did younger children.
 Restrictions were greatest for fractures/dislocations and sprains and for injuries due to sports, play/recreational activities, and falls.
