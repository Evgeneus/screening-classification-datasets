Avulsion of the rectus femoris tendon: an unusual type of pelvic fracture.
 We present the case of a 15-year-old boy evaluated in the emergency department after sustaining an acute hip injury during track and field practice.
 Pelvic radiograph demonstrated an avulsion fracture of the anterior inferior iliac spine.
 Review of the literature reveals this to be a well recognized, yet unusual and interesting injury.
