Transverse ligament rupture and atlanto-axial subluxation in children.
 We report four children aged two to nine years with traumatic tears of the transverse ligament of the atlas and atlanto-axial subluxation.
 This is extremely rare in this age group since trauma usually causes a skeletal rather than a ligamentous injury.
 The injuries resulted from falls or motor vehicle accidents, with considerable delay in diagnosis.
 Flexion radiographs showed atlas-dens intervals (ADI) of 6, 7, 8 and 13 mm; all four patients were treated by posterior fusion at C1-C2 after the failure of conservative treatment.
 In one child with quadriparesis and a fixed ADI of 13 mm, transoral anterior resection of the odontoid was performed before the fusion.
 Diagnosis of this traumatic lesion requires a high level of suspicion.
 Conservative treatment is likely to fail; surgical stabilisation is indicated.
