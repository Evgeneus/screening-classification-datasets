A geriatric-anesthesiologic program to reduce acute confusional states in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures.
 The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a geriatric-anesthesiologic intervention program for the prevention and treatment of acute confusional states (ACS) in elderly patients treated for femoral neck fractures.
 The intervention program was based on the results of previous prospective studies in similar patient populations.
 The outcome of the intervention, comprising 103 patients, was compared with that of an earlier study comprising 111 patients.
 The intervention program consisted of pre- and post-operative geriatric assessments, oxygen therapy, early surgery, prevention and treatment of peri-operative blood pressure falls and treatment of post-operative complications.
 The incidence of ACS was lower, 47.6%, in the intervention study compared with 61.3% (P less than 0.05) in the control study.
 Furthermore, the ACS that occurred in the intervention study was less severe and of shorter duration than that in the control study.
 The incidence of post-operative decubital ulcers, severe falls, and urinary retention was also lower.
 The mean duration of orthopedic ward stay was 17.4 days in the control study and 11.6 days in the intervention study (P less than 0.001).
 It can be concluded that the intervention program reduced the incidence, severity, and duration of ACS which resulted in a shortened orthopedic ward stay.
