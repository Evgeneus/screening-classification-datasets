Symptoms of anxiety in inpatient alcoholics with and without DSM-III-R anxiety diagnoses.
 Self- and observer-rating scales were administered to alcohol-dependent inpatients during acute withdrawal and regularly for 3 weeks.
 Following a structured diagnostic interview (SCID) at the end of the 3rd week of hospitalization, subjects were divided into two groups: a dual-diagnosed group (alcohol dependence and anxiety disorder) and an alcohol-only group (no other current Axis I diagnosis).
 The results demonstrated that the dual-diagnosed subjects experienced higher anxiety levels during and after acute alcohol withdrawal.
 All rating scales (i.e., Sheehan Patient Rated Anxiety Scale, Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory, Zung Rating Scale for Anxiety, and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety) were analyzed to obtain the best combination of sensitivity and specificity.
 Taken together, the results indicate that it may be possible to identify alcoholics who require additional psychiatric evaluation early in treatment.
 This would allow a treatment plan which could be used to address both psychiatric and substance abuse problems.
