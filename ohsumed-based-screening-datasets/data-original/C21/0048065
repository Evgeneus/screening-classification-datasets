Loss of antibodies against hepatitis C virus in HIV-seropositive intravenous drug users.
 A time-point survey of 262 ex-intravenous drug users (IVDUs) on methadone treatment showed serological evidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in 64%, hepatitis B virus in 74% and HIV in 36%.
 Analysis of previously collected frozen stored sera of the same patients showed that 31 further IVDUs had had anti-HCV antibodies in the past and had lost them in a time-dependent fashion.
 Most HCV seroreversion was detected in HIV-positive people: 20 out of 85 in the HIV-positive group versus 11 out of 18 in the HIV-negative group.
