A seromuscular stripping method to create a nipple valve without metal stapling for continent urinary reservoir.
 Urinary continence with a Kock or Mainz pouch is achieved by a nipple valve of the invaginated ileum which is usually fixed with metal staples.
 However, metal staples can cause various complications as a foreign body.
 The seromuscular stripping method, a new technique to create a nipple valve, was applied to 17 patients with bladder cancer in the construction of a continent urinary reservoir by the ileocolonic pouch (Mainz pouch).
 Metal staples were not used.
 The results were satisfactory except for 2 patients who became incontinent because of prolapse of the nipple in one and insufficient valve function due to ischemic change of the nipple valve in the other.
 Histology of the nipple valve from an autopsy case showed a good double layer nipple valve that functioned well to preserve continence.
