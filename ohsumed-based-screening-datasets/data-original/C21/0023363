Participation of serotonergic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of experimental neoplastic spinal cord compression.
 We evaluated the role of serotonin (5-HT) in neoplastic cord compression in paraplegic rats harboring a thoracolumbar epidural tumor.
 We measured serotonin and its major metabolite, 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid (5-HIAA), in the C-1 to C-7, T-1 to T-6, T-7 to T-12, and T-13 to L-3 spinal segments of tumor-free and tumor-bearing rats.
 In normal controls, a consistent rostral-to-caudal gradient for 5-HT and 5-HIAA was evident, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio remained constant.
 In paralyzed rats, 5-HT levels were unchanged, but the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio was elevated, especially in the compressed segments.
 Treatment with either dexamethasone or indomethacin delayed onset of paraplegia but had no effect on 5-HT metabolism.
 Blocking 5-HT receptors by cyproheptadine, evaluated 30 hours after onset of paralysis and treatment, resulted in a reduction in the high water content, vascular permeability, and prostaglandin E2 synthesis in the compressed cord.
 Early administration of cyproheptadine effectively delayed the onset of paraplegia.
 These data indicate that receptor-activated serotonergic mechanisms participate in the disruption of the blood-spinal cord barrier and that these effects can be manipulated pharmacologically.
