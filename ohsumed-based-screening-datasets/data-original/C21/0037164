Alpine skiing and the mature athlete.
 Alpine skiing is a popular sport enjoyed by millions of Americans annually.
 As the average age of the world population increases, so does the average age of the skier.
 The ever-increasing older group of skiers adds a new dimension to both the prevention and treatment of ski injuries.
 Several injuries, if not unique to the older skier, are more common in this group, and familiarity with the causes, treatments, risks, and avoidance of these injuries is essential for proper treatment.
 It is possible that with proper education, prevention, and physical training, the incidence of these injuries can be decreased to the level of the general population, and skiing will not be more hazardous to the older athlete.
