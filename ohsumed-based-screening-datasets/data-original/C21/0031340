Percutaneous cerclage wiring and interlocking nailing for treatment of torsional fractures of the tibia.
 A new method for treatment of torsional tibial fractures allows full weight bearing two days post-operatively.
 Percutaneous cerclage wiring (Gotzes method) is done after a manual anatomic reduction on a normal fracture table, followed by static interlocking nailing.
 Compared to other methods, no extensive exposure is necessary, which helps preserve the periosteal blood supply.
 These considerations, as well as an early axial pressure load and an almost absolute stability, might explain the roentgenographic and clinical evidence that bone healing with minimal callus formation occurs six to eight weeks postoperatively.
