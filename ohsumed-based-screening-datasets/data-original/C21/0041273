Lung injury resulting from a nonaccidental crush injury to the chest.
 A six-week-old infant presented with rib trauma and a lung contusion from a nonaccidental compressive chest injury.
 He developed an illness consistent with diffuse alveolar damage, which worsened over 26 hours.
 This was complicated by a pneumomediastinum, and the patient recovered with conservative management.
 The value of isotope bone scanning in addition to x-rays is discussed.
 Nonaccidental injury should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pulmonary contusion.
