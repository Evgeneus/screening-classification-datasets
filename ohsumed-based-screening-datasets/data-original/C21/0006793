Facial nerve monitoring in otologic surgery: clinical indications and intraoperative technique.
 While identification of the intratemporal portion of the facial nerve is mandatory in most otologic surgical procedures, inadvertent instrumentation, traction, or thermal injury may still result from inaccurate delineation, purposeful avoidance, or false protection of this critical structure.
 Improved functional preservation of the facial nerve has been achieved in acoustic neuroma surgery through the monitoring of evoked facial electromyographic activity.
 This technique may also be used during otologic procedures in which facial nerve manipulation is anticipated in the management of recurrent cholesteatoma, temporal bone trauma, congenital deformity, or purposeful access for cochlear implantation.
 Potential indications for using facial nerve monitoring in contemporary otologic surgery are detailed through illustrative case presentations, and necessary instrumentation and techniques are briefly reviewed.
 Intraoperative monitoring can assist the surgeon in isolating the facial nerve when chronic inflammation, traumatic injury, or anomalous development has resulted in distortion or absence of microanatomic landmarks.
