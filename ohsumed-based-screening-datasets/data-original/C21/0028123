Odontoid fractures treated by anterior odontoid screw fixation.
 While odontoid fractures are common injuries, disagreement exists regarding treatment.
 Some authors claim a high rate of pseudoarthrosis and have therefore recommended early posterior fixation and fusion.
 This, however, results in decreased cervical rotation.
 Therefore, it has been recommended that a more direct approach to the fracture be taken.
 Results on anterior screw fixation in 14 patients are reported.
 The technique was found to be especially useful in multiple trauma patients, patients who refuse halo treatment, and in some nonunions.
