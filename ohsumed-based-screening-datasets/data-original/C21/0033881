Male physical aggression as a function of alcohol intoxication and frustration: experimental results and methodological considerations.
 Forty-five undergraduate students were assigned to either an Alcohol, a Placebo, or a Control group.
 The alcohol dose was 0.80 g of 100% alcohol/kg body weight.
 Subjects were informed that they could win a sum of money depending on the performance of a partner.
 They then supervised the partner over a series of trials on a visual scan test and could influence the partner by either giving an uncomfortable electric shock (aggressive alternative) or a comfortable vibration (nonaggressive alternative) at each incorrect response from the partner.
 Both alternatives were said to be equally instrumental in reaching the goal of winning the money and both could be varied in intensity on a 10-point scale and without limits in terms of duration.
 Aggression was measured as number of aggressive responses chosen, and in terms of intensity and duration.
 Nonaggression was measured in terms of intensity and duration.
 Intoxicated subjects did not increase their aggression but all groups chose significantly more nonaggressive responses and did so with higher intensity and duration.
 Frustration did not significantly affect these types of responding.
 Results are discussed in terms of methodological considerations and the importance of using realistic experimental paradigms is stressed.
 Also, theoretical implications are discussed.
