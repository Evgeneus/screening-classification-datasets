Interlocking nailing for the treatment of femoral fractures due to gunshot wounds.
 Fifty-six patients who had a fracture of the femur due to a low-velocity gunshot injury were treated with interlocking nailing with the Grosse-Kempf nail.
 Patients who had an isolated fracture were treated by intravenous administration of antibiotics followed by delayed interlocking nailing.
 Ninety-three per cent of the fractures had Grade-III or IV comminution.
 At an average duration of follow-up of sixteen months (range, twelve to twenty-nine months), the results of closed interlocking nailing were excellent.
 All of the fractures united an average of twenty-three weeks (range, fourteen to forty weeks) after the nailing.
 There were no apparent infections in the entire series.
 There were two delayed unions and seven malunions.
 Five patients had a serious associated vascular injury; four of these five had interlocking nailing immediately after vascular repair.
 The fractures united without any residual vascular insufficiency.
