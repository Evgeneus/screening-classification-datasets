Lateral tibial rim (Segond) fractures: MR imaging characteristics.
 The magnetic resonance (MR) imaging characteristics of lateral tibial rim (Segond) fractures and their associated injuries were reviewed in 12 patients with radiographic evidence of this fracture.
 Bone marrow adjacent to the fracture emitted a focally abnormal MR signal, which indicated an injury of the lateral capsular junction.
 The Segond fragment, however, was seen on MR images in only four of 12 patients.
 Associated ligamentous and meniscal injuries identified with MR imaging and arthroscopy involved the anterior (n = 11) and medial (n = 7) cruciate ligaments and the lateral (n = 4) and medial (n = 1) menisci.
 Focal bone marrow edema was due to injury of the lateral capsular junction.
 MR imaging evidence of such edema should indicate the presence of a lateral capsular injury and fracture, if one has not already been demonstrated with conventional radiography.
 A high association of Segond fractures with tears of the anterior cruciate ligament was confirmed, and MR imaging signs of a Segond fracture may therefore be used as indirect evidence for tears of that ligament.
