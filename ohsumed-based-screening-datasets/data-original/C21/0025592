Some new trends of biomechanical studies in traumatology and orthopedics.
 This article presents four recent areas of research in biomechanics with clinical application.
 The first area describes quantification of the functional condition of the lower extremity using biomechanical parameters based on theoretical assumptions for a new mathematical model of walking.
 The second area describes the mechanism of spinal compression fractures from dorsal impact trauma.
 Preliminary data are derived from anatomic specimen studies.
 The third area is a description and justification of a new endoprosthetic design, including experimental observations on canine species, for total knee arthroplasties with a unique biomechanical design using a synthetic ribbon for creation of a "rolling joint." The fourth area of investigation deals with the normal and pathologic distribution of pressure on the plantar surface of the foot using an electronic measuring system, along with statistical indices; this system may be able to diagnose various foot deformities by automated methods.
