Effect of calcium-channel blockers on alcohol consumption in alcohol-drinking monkeys.
 Experiments were performed to determine the effect of the calcium-channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem on ethanol preference in monkeys.
 Two days of administration of 10 mg/kg verapamil but not diltiazem or saline significantly decreased ethanol intake in all monkeys tested.
 Chronic treatment with verapamil, but not saline, dose-dependently attenuated alcohol intake, without significantly influencing water intake.
 These findings suggest that verapamil exerts an inhibitory action on ethanol preference in chronically alcohol-drinking monkeys, possibly by interfering with Ca(2+)-channels and/or by interacting with the activity of certain central neurotransmitters.
