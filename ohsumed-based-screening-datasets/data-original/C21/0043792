External iliac artery rupture during angioplasty: control by balloon tamponade.
 Transluminal angioplasty, particularly of stenoses of the iliofemoral arteries, is an excellent technique with a success rate greater than 90%, an overall complication rate of less than 5%, and a low incidence of major complications.
 Of these major complications, arterial rupture is one of the most urgent.
 We have presented a case of external iliac artery rupture during angioplasty that graphically demonstrates the value of balloon tamponade in managing this potentially catastrophic event.
 The angiographer's sensitivity to the possibility of arterial rupture and prompt management, combined with close collaboration with the vascular surgeon, can lead to a good clinical outcome.
