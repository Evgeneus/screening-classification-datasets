Removal of radiation-induced cataracts in patients treated for retinoblastoma.
 Experience with removal of radiation-induced cataract in patients treated for retinoblastoma is limited.
 We retrospectively reviewed the records of 38 patients with retinoblastoma (42 eyes) who underwent removal of radiation-induced cataract from 1973 to 1989.
 Nineteen eyes (45%) without macular tumors or severe radiation complications had final visual acuities in the range of 20/20 to 20/50.
 One eye (2.4%) developed a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and four eyes (9.5%) were noted to have amblyopia after cataract removal.
 Three eyes (7%) developed retinoblastoma recurrence, one with extension of retinoblastoma into the subconjunctival space through the previous sclerotomy.
 Exenteration was performed and the patient was alive after 8 years.
 Cataract removal can be visually beneficial in selected patients with radiation-induced cataracts.
