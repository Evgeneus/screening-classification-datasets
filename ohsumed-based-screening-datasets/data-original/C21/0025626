Surgical correction of recurrent volar dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. A case report.
 Recurrent volar dislocation of the distal ulna is an unusual injury.
 The role of various anatomic structures in providing stability of the distal radioulnar joint is controversial.
 Surgical reconstruction of the distal radioulnar joint was performed in a 25-year-old woman.
 A sling procedure was performed along with reconstruction of the fibrous osseous canal of the extensor carpi ulnaris (ECU).
 The ECU appears to play a role in stabilizing the distal radioulnar joint.
 When dislocation of the ECU tendon is noted intraoperatively, reconstruction of the fibrous osseous canal should be done.
