Differences in drinking patterns associated with migration from a Greek island to Melbourne, Australia: a study of sibships.
 Siblings (and their families) who have migrated from the Greek island of Levkada to Melbourne, Australia reported markedly lower alcohol consumption (n aged 25-74 = 846, reported consumption 16 g/d for men, 2 g/d for women) when compared with the siblings (and their family members) who stayed on the island (n = 498, 54 g/d for men, 16 g/d for women).
 Median time since migration exceeded 20 years.
 Of nonmigrants, 73% drank wine and 88% of these produced all they consumed.
 They drank wine regularly with the two main meals each day.
 Some migrants managed a kind of self-sufficiency by home-pressing bulk-purchased grapes, but commoner responses were to purchase beer or wine or to cease drinking alcohol.
 Migrants who drank wine consumed less than half as much as comparable nonmigrants.
 The prevalence of drinking on special occasions was not lower in migrants, nor were the amounts drunk.
 Drinking contexts continued to be those traditional within Greek culture.
 Among nonmigrant men self-rated health was positively associated with alcohol consumption.
 In this culture, which has traditionally made heavy use of alcohol and used it primarily as a food, the level and pattern of use changed markedly under changed circumstances--such as the loss of true self-sufficiency and an altered temporal pattern of daily life.
