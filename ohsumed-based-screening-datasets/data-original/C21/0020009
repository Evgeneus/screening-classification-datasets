Tuberculosis in house staff. A decision analysis comparing the tuberculin screening strategy with the BCG vaccination.
 The BCG vaccination is not recommended for health-care workers in the United States.
 The current strategy against tuberculosis in tuberculin-negative house staff is an annual tuberculin screening test followed by chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid for a positive result.
 We performed a decision analysis that unequivocally concluded that the BCG vaccination leads to fewer cases of tuberculosis in this population over a 10-yr period.
 The BCG vaccine requires only an efficacy rate of at least 13.1% to prevent more cases of tuberculosis than the current strategy.
 This threshold value is independent of the annual tuberculin conversion rate.
 This study provides a framework, based on the best information in the literature, on which a well-informed decision regarding tuberculosis prevention can be made.
 Therefore, this analysis demonstrates that the BCG vaccine should be considered for tuberculin-negative house officers and medical students working in high risk areas of the United States.
