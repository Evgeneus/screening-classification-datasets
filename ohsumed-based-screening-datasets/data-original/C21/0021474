Controversies in the management of HIV-related illnesses.
 The care of patients who have HIV infection requires technical competence, skill in clinical decision making, a commitment to continuing self-education, the ability to collaborate with medical and community-based service providers, and attention to the psychological and ethical aspects of patient care.
 General internists bring these attributes to their work and will be increasingly involved in meeting the challenges presented by the AIDS epidemic.
 Controversial issues in the management of HIV illness include: assessment and management of latent syphilis in patients with intercurrent HIV infection; risk assessment and postexposure zidovudine prophylaxis of health care workers after occupational accidents; determination of the risk of reactivation tuberculosis in HIV-infected individuals; and treatment or nontreatment of infections with the Mycobacterium avium complex in symptomatic patients.
 Patients illustrating these management problems are presented by progressive disclosure; the points made in discussion by a panel of general internists and AIDS specialists are presented.
