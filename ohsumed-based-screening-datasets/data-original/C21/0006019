Acute obstructive jaundice in the multiple trauma patient.
 The appearance of acute jaundice in the multiple trauma patient may result from obstruction of the common bile duct by clot.
 Management of this problem may be hindered by a delay in diagnosis, especially where alterations in pigment load and hepatic clearance may have produced the jaundice.
 A high index of suspicion combined with the judicious use of various noninvasive imaging modalities may be helpful in making the diagnosis.
 The progression of jaundice in a patient suspected of having acute obstructive hemobilia should prompt rapid operative intervention.
 At laparotomy, cholangiography or common bile duct exploration should be done.
 Persistent bleeding should be managed initially with angiographic localization and transcatheter embolization; its failure would necessitate surgical control of the source.
