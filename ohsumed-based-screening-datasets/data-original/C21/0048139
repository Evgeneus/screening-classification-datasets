Gastroenteritis associated with consumption of raw shellfish--Hawaii, 1991.
 On January 2, 1991, 12 of 24 persons who attended one or more of three New Year's celebrations in Honolulu, Hawaii, had onset of gastrointestinal illness.
 An investigation by the Epidemiology Branch of the Hawaii Department of Health (HDOH) determined that the only common foods shared by participants were oysters and clams provided by one distributor.
