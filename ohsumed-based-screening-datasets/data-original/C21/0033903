Physical exercise after alcohol intake: effect on plasma catecholamines and lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptors.
 The combined effects of alcohol intoxication and intense physical exercise on the adrenergic system were studied in eight healthy male volunteers.
 Ethanol (0.8 g/kg body weight) was administered perorally to bring about a mean serum concentration of 21 mmol/liter (0.1%); each subject also participated in an identical control session without alcohol.
 Acute alcohol intake alone did not change the concentrations of plasma adrenaline or noradrenaline or the density, affinity, and functioning (ability to mediate catecholamine-stimulated production of cAMP) of lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptors.
 In contrast, acute ergometer exercise brought about an approximately 10-fold increase of plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations, a 2- to 3-fold increase of beta-adrenergic receptor density and an enhancement of isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP production.
 Alcohol intake immediately before the ergometer exercise did not modify these changes.
 In conclusion, acute physical exercise activates the human adrenergic system, with an increase of both plasma catecholamines and lymphocytic beta-adrenergic receptors.
 Moderate alcohol intoxication does not affect exercise-induced alterations of these parameters.
