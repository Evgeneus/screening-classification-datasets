Pediatric poisoning from over-the-counter imidazoline-containing products.
 We present two instructive cases of imidazoline poisoning in young children.
 Imidazoline decongestants, readily available in numerous non-prescription preparations, can rapidly produce toxicity from oral ingestion and topical application.
 Signs and symptoms depend on whether peripheral or central alpha 2-adrenergic receptor stimulation predominates.
 Timely diagnosis depends on a high index of suspicion and careful questioning about the availability of these over-the-counter products.
 Standard toxicologic management will prevent significant morbidity.
 No specific antidote exists.
