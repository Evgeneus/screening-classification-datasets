Evaluation of diagnostic peritoneal lavage in suspected penetrating abdominal stab wounds using a dipstick technique.
 The total protein content (g/l) and white blood cell count (cells/mm3) diagnostic peritoneal lavage was assessed using a urine dipstick in 46 patients with suspected penetrating abdominal stab wounds and equivocal physical examination.
 Those patients with a protein content greater than or equal to 1 g/l and white blood cell count of greater than 500 cells/mm3 were submitted to laparotomy while those with lower values underwent observation and repeat physical examination.
 In all, 26 patients had a positive lavage and significant injuries were found in 23 of these.
 Of 18 patients with a negative lavage, 17 were managed successfully without operation while one patient died from complications related to central venous catheterization.
 In two patients the lavage results were equivocal.
 One underwent a negative laparotomy and the remaining patient recovered uneventfully.
 The test has a 100 per cent sensitivity and 86 per cent specificity and provides an accurate, cheap, and rapid means of diagnosis of intra-abdominal injury in penetrating trauma.
