Dose-response studies with thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in abstinent male alcoholics: evidence for selective thyrotroph dysfunction?
 A reduced thyrotropin (TSH) response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) has been reported in subjects with a history of alcoholism whereas prolactin (PRL) responses have generally been normal.
 One hypothesis proposed to explain the reduced TSH response is down-regulation of pituitary TRH receptors.
 If this is correct, PRL response should also be diminished.
 To account for the different dose-response characteristics of TSH/PRL we have given four dosages of TRH (25, 100, 500 and 800 micrograms) to eight noncirrhotic, male alcoholics abstinent from ethanol a minimum of 28 days and to seven male control subjects.
 Across the TRH dose range the alcoholic subjects exhibited reduced basal TSH (p = .01) and a reduced TSH response (p = .0023) but no differences in basal and stimulated PRL levels.
 Alcoholic subjects had higher basal T4, T3 and FT4I values than did control subjects but covarying for T4, T3 and FT4I did not change the significance of either TSH or PRL findings.
 No significant differences in estradiol, estrone, testosterone, cortisol or glucose were noted between groups.
 The present study confirms the observation of a lower TSH response to TRH in abstinent alcoholics and indicates that the lower response cannot be overcome by increasing TRH dosage.
 The similar PRL response between groups suggests normal lactotroph function in noncirrhotic abstinent alcoholics and argues against the pituitary TRH receptor down-regulation hypothesis.
