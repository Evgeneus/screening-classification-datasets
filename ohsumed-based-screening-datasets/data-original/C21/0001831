Outpatient management of burns in children.
 The majority of burn wound management can be performed on an outpatient basis by the primary care physician or emergency physician.
 The physician, however, needs to know when to refer the patient for surgical evaluation and must be reasonably certain that the family will be compliant with wound care and follow-up.
 Fire prevention counselling still remains one of the most important aspects of burn management.
