Self-inflicted burns: a ten-year retrospective study.
 In this 10-year retrospective survey of 2216 admissions to a regional burn center, 15 patients (0.67%) had self-inflicted burn wounds.
 The burns were serious, with a mean abbreviated burn severity index of 11.2, and eight patients died of their injuries.
 Nine patients had a documented history of psychiatric problems, seven of whom had undergone a previous psychiatric hospitalization.
 A psychiatric assessment was obtained for 12 patients immediately after self-immolation, and all but one had a major psychiatric disorder.
 Seven patients had major depression and four had chronic paranoid schizophrenia.
 Motives were assessed, both by chart review and by interview of five available survivors and of relatives of nonsurvivors.
 Fewer than half actually intended to kill themselves; equally important was the theme of attempting to control internal psychotic states.
