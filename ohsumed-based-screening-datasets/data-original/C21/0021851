The toddler's cuboid fracture.
 The authors describe two proved and two presumed cases of cuboid fractures in toddlers.
 These children were seen because of their inability to bear weight on the affected foot following a fall.
 Initial radiographs were normal; however, early scintigraphy revealed focal uptake in the cuboid.
 Follow-up radiographs demonstrated characteristic sclerosis of the base of the cuboid.
 Cuboid fractures are another example of a toddler's injury that may be difficult to diagnose at initial physical and radiographic examination.
