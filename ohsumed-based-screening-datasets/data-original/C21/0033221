Eye injuries with metal missiles presenting to an emergency center: a three year study.
 The authors retrospectively evaluated 33 eye injuries due to metal missiles in 31 patients presenting to our emergency center over the last 3 years.
 Injuries occurred most frequently when the patients were grinding metal or working on their cars.
 The type of metal involved in the injury often dictates the type of ophthalmic reaction that will occur.
 A discussion of intraocular metallic foreign bodies with an emphasis on electroretinograms and metal analysis is presented.
