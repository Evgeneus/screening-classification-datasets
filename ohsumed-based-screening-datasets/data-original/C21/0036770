Combined vascularized fibula and peroneal composite-flap transfer for severe heat-press injury of the forearm.
 A free combined vascularized fibula and peroneal composite flap was transferred to the forearm in a patient with a severely damaged forearm following a heat-press injury.
 The operative technique, postoperative management, and subsequent clinical course are described, and the advantages of this method are outlined.
 Not only can the fibula now be used as a free vascularized bone graft in simple bone defects, but further applications, such as a combined fibula and peroneal composite flap, can be employed in the treatment of severely damaged forearms.
