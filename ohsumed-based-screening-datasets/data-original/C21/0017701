Evaluation of minor head trauma in children younger than two years.
 The recent medical literature emphasizes the limitations of skull films in the evaluation of minor head trauma.
 However, the emergency medicine literature places little emphasis on the particular risks in children younger than 2 years old with blunt head injury.
 These children have immature bone and unfused sutures that may increase risk of cranial injury and delayed complications.
 A case is presented to illustrate this point.
 Unlike severe head trauma, where evaluation is directed toward computed tomography, the literature continues to be controversial regarding the indications for skull radiographs and computed tomography in minor head trauma.
 The authors recommend a low threshold for radiographic imaging in blunt heat injuries in children younger than 2 years.
