Open reduction and internal rigid fixation of subcondylar fractures via an intraoral approach.
 Extraoral open reduction and rigid fixation of mandibular subcondylar fractures is controversial among surgeons.
 An intraoral approach with a percutaneous trocar and miniplates demonstrated satisfactory reduction.
 This technique can be more easily performed than a preauricular or submandibular incision, and risk of facial nerve damage is diminished.
 Early function with proper vertical dimension was restored with minimal postoperative morbidity.
