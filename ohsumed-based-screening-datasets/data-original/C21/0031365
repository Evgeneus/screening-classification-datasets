The antishock pelvic clamp.
 Unstable posterior pelvic ring disruptions are frequently accompanied by severe venous bleeding and hypotension.
 Mechanical stabilization has been shown to help reduce such blood loss.
 A new external fixator called an antishock clamp provides direct reduction and compression of such fracture-diastases about the sacroiliac joint.
 It is used acutely to rapidly stabilize the posterior pelvic ring in hypotensive patients.
 The simplicity of design allows the device to be applied in less than ten minutes in the emergency room.
 Most importantly, it does not interfere with the ability to carry out subsequent laparotomy or other required procedures.
 Although more clinical experience is needed, the clamp has provided hemodynamic stabilization accompanying fracture reduction.
 The device is not expected to be of benefit in the cases with significant bleeding of arterial origin.
