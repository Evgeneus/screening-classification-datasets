Garlic-in-oil associated botulism: episode leads to product modification.
 In February 1989, three cases of botulism occurred in persons who consumed garlic bread made from a garlic-in-oil product.
 Testing of leftover garlic-in-oil showed it to have a pH of 5.7 and to contain high concentrations of Clostridium botulinum organisms and toxin.
 This was the second episode of botulism associated with a low acid garlic-in-oil product which needs constant refrigeration.
 In response, the Food and Drug Administration has taken steps to prevent a recurrence by requiring that microbial inhibitors or acidifying agents be added to such products.
