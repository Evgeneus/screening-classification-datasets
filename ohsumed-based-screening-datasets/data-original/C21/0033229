The diagnosis and initial management of the fractured mandible.
 Mandibular fractures are the second most common facial fracture.
 The usual causes are interpersonal violence and motor vehicle accidents (MVA).
 Nearly all cases present to an emergency department for initial management.
 They are rarely life-threatening injuries and must assume low priority in the initial assessment and management of the severely traumatized patient.
 Following any resuscitation and exclusion of other significant injuries, a clinical and radiologic diagnosis of the facial injuries should be undertaken including assessment of the fractured mandible.
 Initial therapy should be directed at temporary immobilization and pharmacologic treatment, followed by referral for appropriate definitive care.
