Management of common finger injuries.
 Family physicians can manage most finger injuries, including uncomplicated fractures, proximal interphalangeal joint dislocations, closed tendon injuries and ligament sprains.
 Finger injuries that can cause long-term morbidity may present as minor sprains.
 Diagnosis requires a thorough history, systematic examination and radiographic evaluation.
