Uterine rupture.
 Uterine rupture is a sudden, unforeseeable event that carries a high rate of maternal and perinatal mortality.
 When the diagnosis of uterine rupture is suspected, prompt surgical intervention with an experienced pelvic surgeon and blood product replacement should be considered.
 At the time of uterine rupture, the patient should be evaluated for possible repair or hysterectomy.
 It appears, based on the aforementioned information, that repair is a reasonable consideration.
 In those patients who have undergone a repair, early delivery by elective cesarean after assessment of fetal lung maturity at or around 36 weeks gestation would appear prudent.
 In those patients with a prior cesarean, continuous electronic fetal monitoring to detect intrapartum fetal distress would appear prudent.
 In these patients fetal distress is the most common sign or symptom of uterine rupture and frequently precedes any other clinical manifestations of this complication.
