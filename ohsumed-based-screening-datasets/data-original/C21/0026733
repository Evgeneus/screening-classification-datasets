Enhancement of humoral immunity by heterologous lipid peroxidation products resulting from burn injury.
 Lipid peroxidation products (conjugated dienes) extracted from the plasma of scald-burned rats were injected intraperitoneally in mice before immunization of the mice with sheep erythrocytes.
 Five-day plaque-forming cell assays showed that mice receiving conjugated dienes isolated from the plasma of burned rats had enhanced specific immunoglobulin M antibody production compared to mice receiving dienes from normal rat plasma or sheep erythrocytes alone.
 These observations suggest that lipid peroxidation products in the plasma of burned animals may modulate the humoral immune response.
