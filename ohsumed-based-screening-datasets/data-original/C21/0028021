Traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation in children: review and report of five cases.
 Traumatic atlanto-occipital dislocation has usually been considered incompatible with life.
 However, reports on survivors stress the need for early clinical diagnosis of this condition, particularly in the context of multiple trauma, in order to avoid life-threatening diagnostic manipulations and to provide adequate treatment.
 Five instances of atlanto-occipital dislocation in children observed during the last two years prompted this report, since four of them survived only temporarily.
 The radiologic and computed tomographic (CT) findings have been reevaluated.
 Use of metrizamide CT is advised in clinically suspected cases with inconclusive radiologic workup.
