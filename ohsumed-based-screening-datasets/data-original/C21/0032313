The utility of cardiac evaluation in the hemodynamically stable patient with suspected myocardial contusion.
 Myocardial contusion following isolated blunt thoracic trauma (BTT) remains a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.
 To identify the presence of cardiac abnormality following BTT, 123 hemodynamically stable patients were prospectively evaluated with serial electrocardiograms (ECG) and cardiac enzymes (total CPK and CPK-MB).
 Gated cardiac radionuclide angiography (MUGA) scans were performed within 48 hours following admission.
 Patients included in the study sustained significant thoracic trauma identified by physical findings or mechanism of injury.
 Sixty-three patients (51%) were identified with either abnormal ECG, or abnormal total CPK, CPK-MB, MUGA scan, or combination of the above.
 Thirty-seven patients (58.7%) manifested an ECG abnormality defined as ST-segment or T-wave abnormality.
 Twenty-two patients (34.9%) had total CPK value greater than or equal to 50 International Units (I.U.) or CPK-MB fractions greater than or equal to five per cent.
 MUGA scan was abnormal (right ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 per cent and/or wall motion abnormality) in 12 patients (19%).
 Eight patients with MUGA scan abnormality had normal ECG and/or normal total CPK, CPK-MB values.
 Evaluation of all patients up to six months revealed no mortality, malignant arrhythmias, or cardiac failure.
