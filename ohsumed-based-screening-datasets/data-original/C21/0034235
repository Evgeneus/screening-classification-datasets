The relationship between large airway inflammation and airway metaplasia.
 To assess the role of acute inflammatory cells in large airways in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, we performed BAL (divided into aliquots) and mucosal biopsies on asbestos workers.
 They had evidence of asbestos-related lung injury.
 We found that acute inflammatory cells were significantly increased in the first aliquot.
 Ex-smokers had a greater percentage of PMN compared with nonsmokers and current smokers.
 The subjects were subgrouped with respect to biopsy-detected metaplasia.
 There was no difference between these groups for percentage or total number of PMN in the first aliquot.
 However, subjects with metaplasia had significant reduction in FEV1/FVC compared with those without.
 We conclude that there are significant differences in cells between the first and subsequent aliquots.
 Although inflammatory stimuli may be important in the pathogenesis of metaplasia, PMN present in the first aliquot could not be related to the severity of the metaplastic changes in these workers.
