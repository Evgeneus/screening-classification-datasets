Contributions of peritoneal lavage enzyme determinations to the management of isolated hollow visceral abdominal injuries.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of lavage amylase (LAM) and lavage alkaline phosphatase (LAP) in the identification of intraperitoneal hollow visceral injuries.
 DESIGN: Retrospective.
 SETTING: Level I trauma center, city/county institution.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Patients with hollow visceral organ injury following major blunt or penetrating trauma whose diagnostic peritoneal lavage was negative by lavage red blood cell and lavage white blood cell were negative.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-one patients with injury isolated to one or more hollow visceral structures underwent diagnostic peritoneal lavage; 28 were positive based on aspirate, lavage red blood cell count (greater than 100,000/mm3), or lavage white blood cell count (greater than 500/mm3).
 Of the remaining 23 patients, each of 11 with isolated small bowel injury had LAM greater than or equal to 20 IU/L and six of these had LAP levels greater than or equal to 3 IU/L.
 All six patients with colon injury and two of the patients with gallbladder injury had LAM less than 20 IU/L and LAP less than 3 IU/L.
 CONCLUSIONS: In patients with hollow visceral injury and otherwise normal diagnostic peritoneal lavage, elevation in LAM is highly specific for isolated small bowel injury.
 Lavage enzyme determinations appear unhelpful in the detection of colonic injury.
 We recommend routine enzyme determinations of lavage effluent as a marker for isolated small bowel injury.
