Drug-induced psychoses.
 Major causes of drug-induced psychoses include cocaine, amphetamines, phencyclidine, cannabinoids, LSD, mescaline, the so-called designer drugs, anticholinergic compounds, and steroids.
 Most drug-induced psychoses are managed with general supportive measures, reassurance, minimizing patient stimulation, and benzodiazepines as needed; however, specific antidotes such as physostigmine for anticholinergic poisoning or urinary acidification to enhance excretion of amphetamines or phencyclidine may be indicated in some patients.
 Any patient with a drug-induced psychosis must be evaluated carefully for evidence of other toxic effects of the drug in question.
