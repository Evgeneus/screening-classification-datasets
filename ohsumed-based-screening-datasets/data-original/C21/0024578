The donation and sale of blood by intravenous drug users.
 In spite of efforts to dissuade intravenous drug users (IVDUs) from donating or selling blood, some continue to do so.
 As part of a longitudinal study, 915 IVDUs in South Florida were interviewed concerning their history of donation or sale of blood and tested for antibodies to HIV-1 and HTLV-I/II.
 Approximately 17 percent had either donated or sold blood during 1985 through 1988; most contributors (80.4 percent) sold to commercial blood services.
 IVDUs who had donated/sold blood were more likely to be male and not in drug treatment than were those who had not contributed blood.
 IVDUs not in treatment at the time of interview were more likely than IVDUs in treatment to have sold blood.
 Of those who had donated/sold blood since 1985, 19.6 percent subsequently tested positive for antibodies to HIV-1 and 5.7 percent were positive for antibodies to HTLV-I/II.
 Increased effort is required to screen prospective donors and sellers, particularly at commercial blood banks.
