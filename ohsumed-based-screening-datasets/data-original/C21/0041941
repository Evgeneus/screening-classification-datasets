Atherogenic effect of barotrauma on in situ saphenous veins in monkeys.
 The objectives of this study were to determine whether veins subjected to barotrauma in situ undergo lipid uptake and morphologic changes to the same extent as veins grafted into the arterial circulation.
 Saphenous veins in seven stump-tailed macaque monkeys were exposed bilaterally and were circumferentially dissected free from surrounding tissue only at isolated sites.
 Segments of the veins were distended for 1 minute at hydrostatic pressures of 125 or 350 mm Hg.
 An undistended segment served as control.
 A cephalic vein graft was interposed in the femoral artery for comparison with in situ veins.
 The animals were fed a diet that sustains plasma cholesterol levels of approximately 225 mg/dl.
 Saphenous veins and the cephalic vein grafts were explanted at 3 months for biochemical and histologic analyses.
 Cholesterol content in undistended saphenous veins was similar to that in veins distended at 125 or 350 mm Hg--105 +/- 15, 122 +/- 14, and 109 +/- 30 micrograms/100 mg wet tissue weight, respectively.
 Cholesterol content in cephalic vein grafts, 473 +/- 122 micrograms/100 mg, was greater (p less than 0.001) than in saphenous veins at all distention pressures studied.
 There was no difference among the distention pressures in the intimal fraction of saphenous vein wall, with the pooled value being 20% +/- 12%.
 This contrasted with the value of 59% +/- 11% in cephalic vein grafts (p less than 0.01).
 Endothelial coverage of the luminal surface in saphenous veins was similar among the levels of barotrauma, with the pooled value being 83% +/- 15%.
 Less of the lumen was covered with endothelium in cephalic vein grafts, 46% +/- 18% (p less than 0.01).
 Slightly more medial fibrosis was observed in cephalic vein grafts as compared with saphenous veins (p less than 0.05).
 These data demonstrate that barotrauma alone does not cause veins that remain in the venous system to undergo the lipid uptake or morphologic changes that occur in veins grafted into the arterial circulation in nonhuman primates.
