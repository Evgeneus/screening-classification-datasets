Update: surveillance of outbreaks--United States, 1990.
 Although disease outbreaks are often preventable public health problems, no uniform national system exists in the United States for surveillance of outbreaks.
 In 1988, CDC's Epidemiology Program Office participated with the epidemiology programs in four states (Maryland, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington) in a 5-month trial of an electronic system for the timely surveillance of outbreaks (1).
 This report updates the initial trial by summarizing a pilot project of surveillance of outbreaks in nine states--Maryland, Mississippi, Missouri, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and Washington.
