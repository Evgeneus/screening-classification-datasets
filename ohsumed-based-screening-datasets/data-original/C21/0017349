Reflex sympathetic dystrophy after clavicle fracture: case report.
 Reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD) of the anterior chest wall is a rare entity.
 A MEDLINE search in all languages of the world's literature from 1966 to the present yielded no report of the association of clavicle fracture with this pain syndrome.
 Two cases are presented and the anatomic variations of the supraclavicular nerves in relation to the clavicle are discussed.
