A survey of color discrimination in German ophthalmologists. Changes associated with the use of lasers and operating microscopes 
 Color vision tests were performed on 211 German ophthalmologists during their annual meeting at Essen.
 The subjects also answered detailed questionnaires about their use of lasers and operating microscopes, and their ocular and general health.
 It was found that 33% of doctors who use lasers or operating microscopes have decreased color discrimination for colors in a tritan color-confusion axis (greater than 2 standard deviations above normal).
 There is a relationship between number of patients treated and the degree of threshold elevation.
 Thirty hours of using the operating microscope produces an increase in tritan threshold equivalent to one panretinal photocoagulation.
