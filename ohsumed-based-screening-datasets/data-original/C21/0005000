Acute aortic valvular incompetence following blunt thoracic deceleration injury: case report.
 Blunt trauma leading to aortic valvular incompetence is rarely encountered, with 27 cases reported to date.
 All cusps and commissures are involved to a similar degree.
 Treatment includes either reattachment of cusps to the annulus (80% recurrence of incompetence) or valvular replacement (no recurrence).
 Valve replacement is the treatment of choice for these patients.
