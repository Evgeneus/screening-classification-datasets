An unusual problem during surgical removal of a broken guidewire.
 At operation, it proved impossible using traction alone to remove an angioplasty guidewire that was lodged in an intermediate artery.
 The problem was solved by passing a Teflon catheter over the wire, thus protecting the left main coronary artery while freeing the entrapped distal end of the guidewire.
