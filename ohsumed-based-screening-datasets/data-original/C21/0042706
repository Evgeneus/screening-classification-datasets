Analysis of burns caused by long-term exposure to a heating pad.
 The potential for creating a second-degree burn by extended exposure to an electric heating pad was evaluated in a simple model.
 Extrapolation of empirical results from experiments in thermal burns and in hyperthermia indicated that a heating pad at the low power setting can produce a burn within a threshold time of approximately 12 to 20 hours.
