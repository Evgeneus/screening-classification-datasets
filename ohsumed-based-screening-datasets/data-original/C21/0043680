Types of posterior capsular breaks and their surgical implications.
 We studied the pathogenesis, clinical features, and management of posterior capsular breaks in 28 cataract patients during planned extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation surgery.
 In the age-related cataract group (17 cases), the posterior capsular breaks were fresh, caused by the irrigation-aspiration cannula.
 Located in the upper part of the posterior capsule, they had thin margins and tended to enlarge with continued irrigation.
 Nine (52.9%) of these breaks could be plugged with viscoelastic, and after dry aspiration, a posterior chamber lens was implanted successfully.
 Posterior capsular breaks in traumatic cataracts (11 cases) were preexisting but were detected only during surgery.
 Centrally located, they had thick fibrosed margins and remained the same size during irrigation- aspiration.
 The minimal vitreous herniation seen in four (35.3%) of these cases was managed by automated partial anterior vitrectomy through the break.
 A posterior chamber intraocular lens was implanted in all these cases.
