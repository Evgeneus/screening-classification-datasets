Bacterial translocation in trauma patients.
 Sepsis and multiple system organ failure (MSOF) are major causes of morbidity and mortality in trauma patients.
 Bacterial translocation induced by hypotension, endotoxemia, or burns is a reproducible phenomenon in the laboratory.
 The incidence of bacterial translocation to mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) in 29 critically ill patients was evaluated to determine its relationship to subsequent sepsis and MSOF.
 Bacterial translocation was documented in 3 of 4 patients who underwent laparotomy for gastrointestinal (GI) disease.
 No trauma patient (25 patients), even at second exploration 3-5 days after injury, had a positive MLN culture.
 Five patients died; 4 trauma patients, one with GI disease.
 Forty percent of the trauma patients had major complications, predominantly pulmonary infections with gram-negative bacteria.
 However, infectious complications and outcome were not related to MLN culture results.
 The classical progression of bacteria from the gut to the bloodstream via the MLNs may require time and gut mucosal injury.
 The data suggest that bacterial translocation to the MLNs is not a common occurrence in acutely injured trauma patients.
