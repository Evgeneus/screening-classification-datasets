The 72-hour examination as a predictor of recovery in motor complete quadriplegia.
 Twenty-nine C4 to C7 motor-complete spinal cord injured subjects were evaluated to determine whether the manual muscle test (MMT) performed within 24 hours of injury or at 72 hours after injury better predicts short-term functional muscle recovery.
 A single muscle in the zone of injury that had a muscle grade between 1 and 3, inclusive, was evaluated serially in each patient from admission to three months.
 Increase in muscle strength to grade 4 or better was defined as success.
 Outcomes were evaluated by the Fisher exact test.
 Using the less-than-24-hour MMT, 12 of 17 subjects with grade 3 muscle strength vs four of 12 subjects with grade 1 or 2 muscle strength achieved success (p greater than .05).
 Using the 72-hour MMT, all 11 subjects with grade 3 muscle strength vs five of the 18 subjects with less than grade 3 muscle strength achieved success (p less than .001).
 Short-term functional muscle recovery in the zone of injury in cervical motor-complete quadriplegia is better predicted by the 72-hour MMT than by the less-than-24-hour MMT.
