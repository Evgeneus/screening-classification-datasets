Lag screw fixation of mandibular angle fractures.
 This article presents a technique of applying lag screws for treating fractures of the mandibular angle.
 A review of 30 patients who had lag screws placed to treat such fractures showed that it is an extremely useful, but technique-sensitive, method of providing rigid internal fixation.
 The advantages and complications of this technique over bone-plate fixation are discussed.
