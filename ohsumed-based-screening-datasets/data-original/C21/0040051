Dysphoria in male alcoholics with a history of hallucinations.
 This paper examines severity of depressive symptoms, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory, in chronic alcoholics with and without a history of hallucinations.
 We found a) alcoholics entering alcohol treatment who have experienced hallucinations during detoxification report higher levels of subjective depression than alcoholics who have never experienced hallucinations, b) the level of subjective depression in alcoholics with a history of hallucinations remains higher at the end of inpatient alcohol treatment than in alcoholics without hallucinations, and c) hallucination is the important variable; alcoholics with blackouts, seizures, and delirium tremens, do not experience higher levels of depression during detoxification.
 The reporting of a significantly higher level of depressive symptoms by alcoholics with a history of experiencing hallucinations during withdrawal suggests that in some alcoholics, there exists a vulnerability for mood abnormalities which includes a predisposition toward other abnormal mental phenomena such as perceptual distortions.
