Welding arc maculopathy and fluphenazine.
 A 45-year-old male patient presented with a bilateral maculopathy following unprotected exposure of less than two minutes' duration to a manual metal arc welding unit.
 He had been receiving the drug fluphenazine for the previous 10 years for treatment of depression.
 We believe that the drug fluphenazine, which had accumulated in his retinal pigment epithelium, may have rendered him particularly susceptible to retinal photic damage.
