The transconjunctival approach for treating orbital trauma.
 Twelve patients with a variety of maxillofacial injuries were treated with a transconjunctival incision and lateral canthotomy for orbital floor, and inferior and lateral rim reconstruction.
 Mean follow-up was 12 months, during which time no immediate or delayed complications developed.
 The exposure and access was satisfactory in all cases for reduction and rigid fixation of both inferior and lateral rim through a single incision.
