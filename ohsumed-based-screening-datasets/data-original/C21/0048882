Evaluation of a synthetic wound dressing capable of releasing silver sulfadiazine.
 A silver sulfadiazine-impregnated poly-L-leucine wound dressing, AgSD-medicated wound dressing, was evaluated for antibacterial capacity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cytotoxicity to human fibroblasts and human epidermal keratinocytes.
 This wound dressing contained 0.4 mg AgSD/cm2.
 Antibacterial capacity was examined on experimentally infected wound surfaces (3.4 x 10(4) P.
 aeruginosa organisms/gm) on the dorsum of mice.
 The AgSD-medicated wound dressing showed effective bacterial control.
 Cytotoxicity was examined on a monolayer of cells formed in culture dishes.
 Cellular damage was reduced by the controlled release of AgSD from the hydrophobic poly-L-leucine sponge matrix of the AgSD-medicated wound dressing.
 Cytotoxicity of the AgSD-medicated wound dressing was much lower than that of 1% AgSD cream.
