Transplantation of an osteoarthrotendinous allograft with autogenous soft-tissue coverage for thumb reconstruction.
 A fresh-frozen thumb osteoarthrotendinous allograft and autogenous coverage were used to reconstruct a thumb.
 Immunosuppressants were not used.
 The components of the composite allograft are present and functioning 1 year post-operatively.
 Host cells have replaced and are replacing bone and tendinous structures.
 The "survival" of this osteoarthrotendinous allograft may have important implications in the treatment of patients with previous digital amputations, congenital absence of digits, and amputated digits that have failed replantation or are not replantable because of severely damaged vessels.
