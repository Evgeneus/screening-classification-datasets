Carboxyhaemoglobinaemia and pulse oximetry.
 We compared measurements obtained with a pulse oximeter (SpO2) against values obtained from a CO-oximeter in a patient with carbon monoxide poisoning.
 SpO2 was equal to the sum of the oxyhaemoglobin (HbO) and carboxyhaemoglobin (HbCO) values over the range of HbCO from 30 to 1%.
 This confirms the experimental findings that pulse oximeters measure HbCO as HbO.
 The patient was treated with oxygen (FlO2 = 50%) and recovered without any sequelae.
 Under these circumstances, the half-life of HbCO was approximately 2 h.
