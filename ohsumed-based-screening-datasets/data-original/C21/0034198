Treatment of nonunion by percutaneous injection of bone marrow and demineralized bone matrix. An experimental study in dogs.
 Successful treatment of nonunited fractures remains a major clinical challenge.
 Because bone marrow and demineralized bone matrix (DBM) are capable of stimulating osteogenesis, experiments were designed to test the effectiveness of bone marrow or DBM or both when injected percutaneously into a canine nonunion model.
 Six-millimeter segmental defects were created in the midtibial diaphysis of 24 adult mongrel dogs and held distracted by external fixation.
 For comparative purposes, a 0.5-mm osteotomy was created in five dogs.
 Five weeks later, the 6-mm defects were injected with either saline, autogeneic marrow, DBM powder, a composite of bone marrow and DBM, or treated by open grafting techniques with autogenic cancellous bone.
 Healing of the defect was evaluated roentgenographically, biomechanically (three-point bending), histologically, and biochemically 13 weeks postsurgery.
 Marrow and DBM stimulated defect healing.
 However, the combination of bone marrow with DBM produced a synergistic response in the defect, which was greater than the sum of either marrow or DBM alone.
 Healing in the composite-grafted dogs was comparable to those treated by standard cancellous bone grafting.
 These data suggest that percutaneous injection of bone marrow and DBM may be a potential alternative that offers numerous advantages over standard open grafting techniques in the treatment of fractures with nonunited defects.
