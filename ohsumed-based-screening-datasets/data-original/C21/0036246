Pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid treated by the Matti-Russe operation. A long-term review of 77 cases.
 We report the long-term results of the Matti-Russe operation for pseudarthrosis of the scaphoid in 100 cases, reported previously by Mulder in 1968.
 Clinical results for 77 patients and radiographic data for 74 were reviewed at 22 to 34.8 years after surgery.
 In general, there was satisfactory relief of pain and stiffness but some patients had limitation of motion and reduced grip-strength, with usually slight osteoarthritic changes.
 There was poor correlation between subjective, objective, and radiographic results but 88% of the patients were satisfied with their results.
