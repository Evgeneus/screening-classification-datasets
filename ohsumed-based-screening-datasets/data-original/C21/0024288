Industrial back pain complaints. A broader perspective.
 Industry has looked to medicine for assistance in developing screening and prevention programs to reduce the problem of industrial back injuries.
 Unfortunately, little is known about the pathology underlying most back symptoms, and few risk factors for industrial back pain complaints have been clearly and consistently identified.
 These limitations in knowledge have placed obvious constraints on the design of effective intervention programs.
 Recent information on the importance of perceptions of the nonphysical work environment and other psychosocial factors provide a broader perspective of the industrial back pain problems that may lead to more enlightened and effective approaches.
