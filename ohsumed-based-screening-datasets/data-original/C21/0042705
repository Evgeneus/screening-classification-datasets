Current thoughts on the assessment of protein metabolism in humans.
 An understanding of protein metabolism is crucial in increasing knowledge about wound healing and functional recovery after burns.
 Recent advances in the clinical study of protein metabolism were addressed at a conference sponsored by the Shriners Burns Institute that took place March 7 to 8, 1990.
 New methods of clinical study of protein metabolism involving various isotopic labeling techniques were discussed.
 Conference participants concluded that advances in quantitation techniques and modeling approaches promise a better understanding of human protein metabolism, but also thought that current techniques still have limitations.
