Observer variation in the radiographic classification of ankle fractures.
 We recorded inter- and intra-observer variations in the classification of ankle fractures by the Lauge Hansen and Weber systems.
 Radiographs of 94 patients were classified independently by four observers.
 The observer variation was calculated by kappa statistics, which corrects the obtained values for the agreement expected by chance.
 There was an acceptable level of agreement for the overall classification into both systems.
 For the staging of supination-adduction and supination-eversion fractures in the Lauge Hansen system the agreement was poor.
 The results indicate that future classification systems should be subject to reliability analysis before they are accepted.
