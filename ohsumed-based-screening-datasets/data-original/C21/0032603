Addiction to and dependence on benzodiazepines. Diagnostic confusion in clinical practice and research studies.
 Considerable confusion continues to surround basic concepts for abuse, addiction, tolerance, and dependence.
 Clinicians may be making decisions about prescribing these medications without clear definitions and distinctions.

 Moreover, they may occur together or independently and are not etiologically related.
 Abuse is improper use outside the standard norms.
 Abuse implies a violation component and a control over the use of the drug.
 Addiction is a preoccupation with the acquisition and compulsive use of and a pattern of relapse to drugs is spite of adverse consequences.
 Pervasive to the criteria is a loss of control over drug use and a lack of volitional component in the drug use.
