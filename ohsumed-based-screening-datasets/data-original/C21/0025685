Spontaneous favorable outcome of tracheal laceration.
 We present the case of a 57-year-old woman with a huge tracheal laceration after intubation.
 With simple supportive therapy, the laceration healed in ten days, and the patient made an uneventful recovery.
 At the three-month follow-up, no sequelae were observed.
