Early orthopedic intervention in burn patients with major fractures.
 Surgical treatment of concurrent orthopedic trauma in burn patients is controversial.
 During a 10-year period, 101 patients were treated for major fractures and burn injuries.
 Twenty-eight patients with 34 fractures were treated with early operative fixation.
 The mean TBSA burned was 20%.
 Ten fractures were open (4 grade I, 5 grade II, and 1 grade III) and 24 were closed.
 Seventy-five percent of patients had a definitive orthopedic procedure within 24 hours of burn.
 Intramedullary nails were used in 13, ORIF in 15, external fixation in 3, and percutaneous fixation in 4.
 Ten patients had burns overlying the fracture site and the surgical incision was made through burned tissue.
 Four were associated with open fractures.
 Two orthopedic complications occurred: nonunion of a femoral neck fracture and angulation of a tibial plateau fracture.
 The goal of orthopedic management in the polytrauma burn patient is to achieve early reduction to allow optimal wound care and early patient mobility.
 A team approach to patient selection and management is mandatory.
