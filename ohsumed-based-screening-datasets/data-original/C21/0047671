Metabolic and immune effect of vitamin E supplementation after burn.
 The effect of dietary vitamin E supplementation was studied in burned guinea pigs.
 Forty-four guinea pigs bearing a catheter gastrostomy received a 30% total body surface area full thickness flame burn and were given identical enteral diets (175 kcal/kg/day) except for the amount of vitamin E.
 Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 received 0, 4 mg/kg/day (approximately equivalent to guinea pig's RDA) 20 or 100 mg/kg/day of vitamin E respectively.
 After 14 days of enteral feeding, there were no significant differences between groups in the body weights and the weights of carcass, gastrocnemius muscle, liver, and spleen.
 Resting metabolic expenditure on PBD 3, 6, 9, and 12 was similar in all groups.
 No statistical differences were seen in ear-thickness response to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene and lymphocytic proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin.
 However, mucosal weight and protein content in group 1 were significantly less compared to groups 2 and 4 (p less than 0.05).
 Anemia was also significantly greater in group 1.
 Histologic examination of the intestinal wall, however, did not yield any physical differences associated with the addition of vitamin E to the diet.
 This study suggests that vitamin E supplementation in diets of burned animals may have a beneficial effect on maintenance of intestinal mucosa and erythrocyte counts over a wide-dose range.
