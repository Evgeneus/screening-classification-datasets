Cervical spondylotic myelopathy: treatment with posterior decompression and Luque rectangle bone fusion.
 Cervical spondylotic myelopathy appears to result from a combination of factors.
 The two major components are 1) compressive forces resulting from narrowing of the spinal canal, and 2) dynamic forces owing to mobility of the cervical spine.
 There is substantial evidence to suggest that the repetitive trauma to the spinal cord that is sustained with movement in a spondylotic canal may be a major cause of progressive myelopathy.
 Utilization of extensive anterior procedures that remove the diseased ventral features as well as eliminate the dynamic forces owing to the accompanying fusion have grown in popularity.
 Cervical laminectomy enlarges the spinal canal, but does not reduce the dynamic forces affecting the spinal cord, and may actually increase cervical mobility, leading to a perpetuation of the myelopathy.
 The authors propose the combination of posterior decompression and Luque rectangle bone fusion to deal with both the compressive and the dynamic factors that lead to cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
 Ten patients who had advanced myelopathy underwent the combined procedures.
 Nine of the 10 experienced significant neurological improvement, and the 10th has had no progression.
 The combination of posterior decompression and Luque rectangle bone fusion may offer a simple, safe, and effective alternative treatment for cervical spondylotic myelopathy.
