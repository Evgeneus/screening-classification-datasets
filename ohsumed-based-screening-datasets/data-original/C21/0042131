Firearms and adult, domestic homicides. The role of alcohol and the victim.
 An epidemiological study was conducted to characterize adult, domestic homicides committed with firearms and to determine the role of alcohol intoxication in the likelihood of becoming a homicide victim.
 Data on 129 homicides in Ohio occurring between 1982 and 1985 were collected from police departments of major cities, the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections, and county medical examiners.
 Forty-eight offenders were interviewed.
 Temporal and geographical patterns are discussed, as well as offender-victim relationships and the characteristics of the firearms used.
 High levels of blood alcohol in the victims suggest that alcohol is a risk factor for becoming a homicide victim, although data on alcohol consumption patterns in the population are necessary to advance this association.
