Flexible bronchoscopic removal of radioccult polyurethane foam, with pneumonitis in a hyperventilated lobe.
 An intellectually delayed adult ingested and aspirated a large quantity of polyurethane foam, developing acute respiratory failure in association with partial airway obstruction.
 The foam was identified by flexible bronchoscopy and successfully removed from the bronchus intermedius and left mainstem bronchus with a retrieval basket.
 This facilitated normalization of blood gases and eventual recovery.
 However, the unobstructed right upper lobe became infiltrated radiographically, presumably resulting from regional hyperinflation and/or occult focal aspiration.
