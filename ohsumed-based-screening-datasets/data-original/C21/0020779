Repair of Achilles tendon ruptures with a polylactic acid implant: assessment with MR imaging.
 An investigational tendon repair device composed of a polymer of lactic acid (PLA) is currently undergoing multicenter clinical trials for use in repairing rupture of the Achilles tendon.
 The advantages of the PLA device include high tensile strength and the induction of a rapid proliferative tissue response resulting in a shorter rehabilitation period than with conventional surgical repair.
 We reviewed 16 MR examinations performed in 10 patients 3-35 months after repair to characterize the MR appearance.
 All 16 T1-weighted sagittal images revealed a thickened fusiform tendon with streaks of moderate signal within the tendon corresponding to the PLA device and its surrounding collagenogenic response.
 The double-echo T2-weighted axial images at the mid tendon level demonstrated progressive changes in the signal pattern of the central portion of the tendon that reflected the maturation of the healing tendon.
 All tendons repaired with PLA implants were uniformly hypertrophied relative to the contralateral normal side because of the induced proliferative collagenogenic ingrowth.
 Two follow-up MR examinations were performed in six patients and showed mean reductions in tendon caliber of 24% and 30% at the mid and inferior levels.
 MR imaging of the Achilles tendon repaired with PLA implants shows a diffusely thickened tendon with streaks of signal within the tendon that distinguish it from tendons repaired by conventional techniques.
