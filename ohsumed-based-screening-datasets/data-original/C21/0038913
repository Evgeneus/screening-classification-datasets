Prospective study of porous-coated anatomic total hip arthroplasty.
 Seventy-five uncemented porous-coated total hip prostheses were implanted in 64 patients.
 The results were reviewed after a mean follow-up period of 47 months (range, 40-64 months).
 The mean preoperative rating was fair, and the mean postoperative rating was excellent.
 There were six dislocations.
 Ten patients had mild thigh pain at one year; by two years, the pain had resolved in six patients.
 Neither moderate nor severe limp nor significant loosening of beads was observed.
 Only one patient had progressive radiolucent lines.
 The high rate of dislocation may be related to a compromise of acetabular position to obtain bony fixation in acetabula early in the series.
 The clinical results were encouraging.
