Compound tibial fractures with bone loss treated by the Ilizarov technique.
 We report our experience of the use of the Ilizarov technique to treat nine patients with severe compound tibial fractures.
 The mean defect in bone was 6.3 cm, and four cases were infected.
 All nine patients had satisfactory union and function without the use of bone grafts or antibiotics.
 The Ilizarov technique was very satisfactory; there were no major complications.
