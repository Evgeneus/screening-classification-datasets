"Beaten to death". An autopsy series of homicidal blunt force injuries.
 Although gunshot is by far the most common means of homicide in the United States, significant numbers of homicides are also perpetrated by other means.
 Blunt-force injuries are produced by a variety of objects, including hands and feet and many different weapons.
 Some of these objects produce distinctive patterns of injury of potential evidentiary value.
 This paper presents a series of 20 consecutive blunt-force homicides in adults.
 Seventy percent (14 cases) of the victims were men.
 Thirty percent (six cases) followed an argument or altercation.
 A number of the weapons used were "weapons of opportunity" seized in the course of the incidents.
 Sixty-nine percent (nine cases) of known assailants were acquainted with their victims.
 Few characteristic patterned injuries were seen.
 Not surprisingly, craniocerebral trauma was the most common cause of death.
 One half (10 cases) the victims survived their assaults for varying periods of time.
 Homicides due to blunt-force injury still pose a significant challenge for the forensic pathologist, who must obtain a complete and accurate history of the fatal incident, interpret patterns of injury and other findings at autopsy, and correlate all of the findings to make an accurate ruling of the cause and manner of death.
