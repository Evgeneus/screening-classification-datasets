A combined rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap and vascularized iliac bone graft with double vascular pedicles.
 Although a free vascularized iliac bone graft has been successfully used for the reconstruction of large bone defects, there is a serious problem of how to repair in one stage patients having a large bone defect with a very wide skin defect.
 A free combined rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap and vascularized iliac bone graft with double vascular pedicles seems to be one of the most suitable methods for patients having large defects of both bone and skin.
 Based on our patient, the main advantage of this flap is the extreme width of the skin territory.
 The pedicle vessels are large and long, and the donor scar can be made in an unexposed area.
 This flap should be considered for use in one-stage reconstructions of large defects of both bone and skin in the leg region.
