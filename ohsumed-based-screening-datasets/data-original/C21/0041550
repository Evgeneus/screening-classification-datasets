Ethanol inhalation and dietary n-6, n-3, and n-9 fatty acids in the rat: effect on platelet and aortic fatty acid composition.
 The effects of 18-carbon n-6, n-3, and n-9 fatty acid diets and ethanol exposure on the fatty acyl composition of platelets and vascular tissue were examined.
 An experimental design was devised to control the dietary content of 18-carbon fatty acids.
 The levels of 18:3n6, 18:3n3 and 18:1n9 were varied by a formulation of dietary oils which contained similar proportions of 18:2n6.
 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a purified diet containing 11% by weight of either borage oil (BOR) rich in 18:3n6, linseed/safflower oil (LSO) rich in 18:3n3, or sesame oil (SES) rich in 18:1n9 for 7 weeks and exposed to ethanol vapors by means of inhalation for the final 6 days of the dietary regimen.
 Moderate blood ethanol levels of 118 +/- 6.6 mg/dl were obtained.
 Total lipids were extracted from platelets and aortae, and the fatty acid distributions were analyzed by gas chromatography.
 BOR feeding resulted in increases in the proportion of n-6 fatty acids (18:3n6, 20:3n6, 20:4n6) in platelets and aorta.
 Animals fed the LSO diet had increased levels of n-3 fatty acids (18:3n3, 20:5n3, 22:6n3).
 The SES-based diet resulted in an increase in 18:1n9 in both aorta and platelets.
 Following ethanol exposure alone, the most marked change in the fatty acid profile was a decrease in 20:4n6 in the platelet.
 This effect was not observed in rats supplemented with BOR.
 No significant changes were observed in the aortic fatty acid content at this level of ethanol exposure.
 The results suggested that, in the rat, a diet enriched with BOR effectively prevented ethanol-induced alterations in platelet fatty acid composition.
