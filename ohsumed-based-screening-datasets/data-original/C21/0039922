Percutaneous injury during dermatologic surgery.
 An anonymous survey was conducted among 100 randomly selected fellows of the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery.
 Forty-one respondents provided information about their experience with percutaneous injury.
 Causes of injury during 6278 invasive procedures performed during a 1-month period included suture needlesticks (two injuries), injection needlestick (one), needle recapping (one), scalpel blade (one), skin hook (one), and an injury during the transport of an instrument (one).
 Dermatologic surgeons were more likely to injure their dominant fingers.
 Attitudes of dermatologic surgeons were surveyed regarding operating on patients while the physician or assistant was actively infected with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, herpetic whitlow, or paronychia caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
 Dermatologic surgeons believed that they should be allowed to operate while infected with human immunodeficiency virus (41.5%), hepatitis B virus (40%), herpetic whitlow (25%), and paronychia caused by S.
 aureus (20%).
 Few dermatologic surgeons would disclose preoperatively to patients infections present in themselves or in operating team members that were due to human immunodeficiency virus (29.4%), hepatitis B virus (27.8%), herpetic whitlow (28.6%), or paronychia caused by S.
 aureus (33.3%).
