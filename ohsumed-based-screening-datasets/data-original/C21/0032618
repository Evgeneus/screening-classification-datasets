Pharmacists' poison prevention advice to the elderly.
 Up to 36% of childhood ingestions take place in grandparents' homes.
 We surveyed the 1544 registered pharmacists in the state of Nebraska by a mailed anonymous questionnaire concerning their poison prevention practices with the elderly.
 Of the 26% respondents, 75% always or usually gave older adults a choice of child-resistant containers but estimated that 65% chose non-child-resistant containers.
 Fifty-two percent reported that they asked older adults about children who could possibly ingest medications, and 59% reported that they had poison prevention material available.
 However, over 50% of pharmacists reported that they neither actively counseled nor handed out poison prevention material to the elderly, and only 9% reported that they specifically advise older adults about poison prevention.
 If all pharmacists targeted poison control education to the elderly, childhood poisoning by drugs could be reduced by one-third.
