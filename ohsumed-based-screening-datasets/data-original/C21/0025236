Characteristics of the ideal antibiotic for prevention of wound sepsis among military forces in the field.
 Prompt administration of antibiotics is of the utmost importance in the treatment of wounds inflicted during a war or disaster.
 A single injection of a broad-spectrum drug with a long half-life should be given prophylactically to personnel on the battlefield to provide bactericidal coverage from the earliest possible moment after injury occurs.
 The antibiotic must remain effective at least throughout the period of transport to hospital and surgery.
 Use of antimicrobial agents will never replace careful surgical debridement, and these drugs should be used again later only if a bacterial infection develops.
 Other considerations include the choice of a drug that penetrates tissue thoroughly, is simple to store and administer, is easily available, and is cost effective.
