Urinary continence in spinal injury patients following complete sacral posterior rhizotomy.
 Complete sacral posterior rhizotomy was carried out in 15 spinal injury patients in conjunction with implantation of sacral anterior root stimulators.
 All patients were incontinent pre-operatively and had video-pressure cystometry before and at regular intervals after surgery.
 Detrusor hyper-reflexia was totally abolished in all but 1 patient following rhizotomy and 87% no longer require any form of incontinence appliance.
 Deafferentation produced adverse changes in vesicourethral function and even when rhizotomy was complete, continence could not be guaranteed.
 The pre-operative state of the bladder neck and distal sphincter mechanism had an important bearing on future continence and those patients with a closed bladder neck and no previous sphincterotomy had the greatest chance of becoming continent after deafferentation.
 The majority of patients in this series are now fully continent, representing a transformation in their quality of life; it is recommended, however, that to optimise the success of rhizotomy precise pre-operative evaluation and selection of patients are essential.
