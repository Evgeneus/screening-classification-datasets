Effects of recombinant human growth hormone on donor-site healing in severely burned children.
 The beneficial effects of growth hormone on wound healing in severely burned children were studied.
 Forty patients who were 2 to 18 years old, with 40% or more total body surface area (TBSA) and 20% or more TBSA full-thickness flame or scald burns, were randomized in a double-blind study to receive placebo or 0.1 mg/kg/day recombinant human growth hormone (rHGH) until the first donor site healed or to receive 0.2 mg/kg/day rHGH or placebo from admission throughout hospitalization.
 Patients receiving 0.2 mg/kg/day rHGH demonstrated significantly higher serum IGF-1 levels at 4.8 +/- 1.7 U/mL compared to placebos at 1.6 +/- 0.4 U/mL (p less than 0.05) and a significant decrease in donor-site healing times compared to placebo (p less than 0.05).
 Length of hospital stay (LOS/%TBSA) was decreased from 0.80 +/- 0.10 days/%TBSA burned in the placebo group to 0.54 +/- 0.04 days/%TBSA burned in the 0.2 mg/kg/day treatment group (p less than 0.05).
 This translates, for the average 60% TBSA burned patient, to a decrease in LOS from 46 to 32 days.
