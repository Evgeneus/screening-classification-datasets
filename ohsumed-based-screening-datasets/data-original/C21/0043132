Sequential and simultaneous "in series" hemodialysis and hemoperfusion in the management of theophylline intoxication.
 Hemodialysis and hemoperfusion have been evaluated, and both are effective in removing theophylline.
 We report two consecutive cases of theophylline intoxication in which the sequential treatment of charcoal hemoperfusion and hemodialysis is contrasted to the simultaneous "in series" treatment of hemodialysis and charcoal hemoperfusion.
 Analysis of the two methodologies shows that the combined in series technique offers several advantages, including increased extraction efficiency, decreased time of hemoperfusion cartridge saturation, and rapid correction of electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities, and that it is well tolerated clinically.
 Simultaneous hemodialysis and charcoal hemoperfusion should be considered in cases of extreme theophylline intoxication.
