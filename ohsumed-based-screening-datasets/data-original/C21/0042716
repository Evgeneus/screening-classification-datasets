Analysis of materials for splinting of the thermally injured patient.
 Good results have been achieved in the treatment of patients with burns with new splinting materials and proper splinting techniques.
 This article focuses on the thermoplastic splinting materials Clinic and Spectrum (Northcoast Medical Inc., San Jose, Calif.) and the comparable thermoplastic products Polyform (Smith & Nephew Rolyan, Inc., Menomonee Falls, Wis.) and Orthoplast (Johnson & Johnson Orthopedics, New Brunswick, N.J.).
 Qualities such as self-bonding, recyclability, and rigidity were tested for these materials.
 Splint rigidity was measured by a calibrated hook scale and determined by the force per pound needed to bend the material 20 degrees.
 Spectrum and Clinic products were judged more economical and, we contend, they are therefore better choices for splinting the thermally injured patient.
