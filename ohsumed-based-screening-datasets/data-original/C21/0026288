Late recovery of function after oculomotor nerve palsy.
 We studied three patients who developed oculomotor nerve paresis from different causes.
 Each patient improved somewhat over several months, after which there was no further improvement for at least six months.
 Although the pareses were thought to be stable after the period of no improvement, each patient subsequently had further improvement in both motility and alignment with resolution of diplopia in primary position and in more than one of the cardinal positions of gaze.
 Patients with oculomotor nerve paresis may improve further after an initial period of improvement followed by several months of stability.
