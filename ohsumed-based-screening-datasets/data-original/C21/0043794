Severe frostbite caused by Freon gas.
 We have reported a case of severe frostbite due to direct exposure to liquid Freon gas (monochlorodifluoromethane), a fluorinated hydrocarbon widely used as refrigerants, propellants, and industrial solvents.
 The patient was treated for severe third- and fourth-degree frostbite to the hand.
 The severity of the injury was apparently the result of direct through-and-through injury from exposure to the liquid (boiling point -40.5 degrees C) and a possible systemic vasoconstrictive effect on arterial smooth muscle due to inhalation of Freon gas.
