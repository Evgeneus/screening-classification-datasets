Lateral distraction injuries to the thoracic and lumbar spine. A report of three cases.
 Three patients sustained a lateral distraction injury to the thoracic or lumbar spine.
 These injuries were associated with multiple fractures of the ribs and extremities as well as with thoracic and abdominal visceral injuries.
 No patient had an injury to the spinal cord or cauda equina.
 The injuries to the spine were successfully treated with open reduction of the unilateral subluxation of the facet joint and with internal fixation with Harrington instrumentation.
 Fusion was achieved with the spine in anatomical alignment, without any complications, in all three patients.
