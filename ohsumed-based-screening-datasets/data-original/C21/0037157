 Rowing is a strenuous sport that has a significant injury rate among competitive participants.
 Consequently, older individuals who are anticipating beginning recreational rowing should start with a thorough physical examination by their physician.
 Because the back and knees are the most frequently injured areas, an orthopedic assessment of these regions is indicated in those individuals who have had previous patellofemoral or low back pain.
 All prospective rowers should begin with a general conditioning program that addresses lower extremity and abdominal strengthening, flexibility, and aerobic conditioning.
 A thorough understanding of the proper mechanics of rowing is essential to avoid potential injury.
 Rowing is a satisfying sport that offers excellent physical exercise and cardiovascular benefits.
 Older individuals should be encouraged to row, but also should be aware of the variety of injuries this sport may produce.
