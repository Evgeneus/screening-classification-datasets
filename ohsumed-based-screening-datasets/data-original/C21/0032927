Toe-to-thumb transfer: a new technique.
 Our technique combines the advantages of two proven techniques of the wraparound flap and vascularized joint transfer while offering a more normal thumb, both functionally and cosmetically.
 Its advantages are as follows: 1.
 A more normal-looking thumb with good length 2.
 Preservation of motion through joint transfer 3.
 Maintenance of growth potential through transfer of vascularized epiphyses 4.
 Minimal donor-site morbidity.
