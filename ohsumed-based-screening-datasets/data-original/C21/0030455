The prevalence of atopy and hypersensitivity to formaldehyde in pathologists.
 Sixty-three pathologists in active practice in the province of Alberta, Canada, provided a history regarding atopy and sensitivity to formaldehyde.
 Serum samples were assayed for total IgE level and the presence of IgE with specificity toward timothy grass, cat, house dust, and formaldehyde.
 Twenty-nine of the subjects (46.0%) gave a history of atopy that was confirmed in 12 by either IgE level or a positive radioallergosorbent test.
 Twenty-nine (46.0%) complained of formaldehyde sensitivity.
 In this study, no pathologist had allergen-specific IgE directed against formaldehyde, and there was no evidence of a tendency for atopic subjects to be more prone to sensitivity to formaldehyde.
 However, this may be related to a deliberate reduction in exposure by individuals experiencing adverse effects.
