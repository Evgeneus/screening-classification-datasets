Bonding of hydroxyapatite-coated femoral prostheses. Histopathology of specimens from four cases.
 We examined specimens of hydroxyapatite-coated femoral prostheses from four patients who had died within nine months of implantation for fractured neck of femur.
 Histology showed newly formed immature bone overlying the hydroxyapatite coating with new trabeculae bridging to the endosteal bone layer.
 In the diaphysis, where there had been contact between the hydroxyapatite and the cortex, there was dense, firmly anchored bone with an haversian architecture.
 In other places the newly formed bone had a trabecular structure, containing bone marrow tissue with normal cellularity.
 It appeared that biological osseointegration had taken place.
