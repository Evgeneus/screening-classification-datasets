Intraocular foreign bodies: results of 27 cases.
 Twenty-seven consecutive cases of various kinds of perforating injuries with foreign bodies, referred to the Ophthalmology Department of Hacettepe Medical School between January 1984 and April 1988, were evaluated retrospectively.
 Whenever technically possible magnetic extraction was the preferred method of removing the foreign body.
 Thirteen (48%) eyes developed endophthalmitis, 18 (66.6%) eyes developed traumatic cataract, and eight (29.6%) eyes developed retinal detachment after the trauma.
 Twelve (44.5%) eyes had a visual acuity of 1/10 or better after the appropriate medical and surgical treatment.
