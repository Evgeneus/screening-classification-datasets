Chronic wounds and delusions of parasitosis in the drug abuser.
 Plastic surgeons are routinely consulted about the care of difficult or chronic wounds.
 Most of these wounds have a physiologic basis and are treated according to basic wound-healing principles.
 Patients with factitious wounds are difficult to treat and present diagnostic dilemmas.
 We present a case and review of the literature of drug-induced delusions of parasitosis to inform plastic surgeons of this important entity and for consideration in the differential diagnosis of chronic wounds.
