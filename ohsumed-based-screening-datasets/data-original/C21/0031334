Profiles of spinal cord injury and recovery after gunshot injury.
 Prospective motor and sensory examinations were conducted on 135 patients with neurologic deficits caused by spinal cord injuries resulting from gunshot wounds.
 Annual follow-up motor and sensory examinations were conducted for 67 patients.
 The neurologic data (motor and sensory neurologic levels of injury, zone of injury, and completeness of lesion) were assessed in terms of the vertebral level of injury, region of injury, bullet caliber, direction of bullet entry, and whether the bullet penetrated the spinal canal, completely traversed the spinal canal, or entered and remained lodged in the spinal canal.
 Seventy-seven of the patients sustained complete lesions and 58 sustained incomplete lesions.
 Anatomically, 19.3% of the injuries were in the cervical region, 51.8% in the thoracic, and 28.9% in the thoracolumbar.
 In 93 cases, the neurologic level was at least one level higher than vertebral level of injury.
 Although twice as many individuals were shot from the back as from the front and from the left as from the right, the point of bullet entry did not appear to be related to the severity of the injury.
 At the annual follow-up examinations, 66.7% of the patients with complete lesions and 64.0% of the patients with incomplete lesions had no improvement in the neurologic level of injury.
 Nevertheless, there was a significant (p less than 0.0001) improvement in the American Spinal Injury Association motor index scores one year after injury.
