Acute silicosis due to inhalation of a domestic product.
 A 20-yr-old woman with no history of pulmonary disease presented with acute dyspnea and fever.
 After various investigations and treatments the symptoms persisted and a lung biopsy was performed.
 Pathologic analysis disclosed the presence of silicotic crystals within lung tissue and mediastinal lymph nodes.
 The patient admitted having repeatedly inhaled a domestic scouring powder rich in silica during the preceding 6 months.
 This is the first report of acute pulmonary silicosis developing after exposure to a common household product.
