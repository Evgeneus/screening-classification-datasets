Biomechanical properties of resorbable poly-L-lactide plates and screws: a comparison with traditional systems.
 Poly-L-lactide (PLA) plates and screws were tested in vitro in porcine ribs for uniaxial pullout and four-point bending strength.
 Results were compared to conventional systems (stainless steel and titanium).
 The biomechanical testing suggests that PLA screws have properties suitable for fixation of sagittal split osteotomies.
 Poly-L-lactide plates have indications in areas of low stress and noncompressive load.
