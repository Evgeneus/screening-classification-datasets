HIV-1 prevalence in selected Tijuana sub-populations.
 To assess the prevalence of HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus) infection among high-risk populations in Tijuana, Mexico, HIV-1 antibody status was determined and information on risk behavior was obtained from 1,069 individuals in three high-risk groups.
 The prevalence of HIV-1 among 415 prostitutes was 0.5 percent; 410 prisoners, 1.2 percent; 233 homosexual/bisexual men, 11.6 percent; and 106 intravenous drug abusers, 1.9 percent.
 The potential for spread of HIV-1 exists in Tijuana despite the current relatively low seroprevalence of HIV-1.
