Is vitamin D necessary for skeletal integrity in the elderly?
 Serum 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations were reduced in elderly patients with femoral neck fractures, irrespective of the presence of osteomalacia.
 This reduction was not attributable to a decrease in vitamin D binding protein.
 The low rate of bone turnover in these elderly patients might reduce the requirement for vitamin D and protect against the development of osteomalacia.
 Serum vitamin D metabolite concentration cannot be used as a screening test for osteomalacia in these patients.
