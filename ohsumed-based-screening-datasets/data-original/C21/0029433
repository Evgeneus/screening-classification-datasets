Avulsion injuries of the thumb.
 Avulsion amputations of the thumb are generally thought to have a worse prognosis after replantation than other amputations.
 We report the results of 17 thumbs that had an avulsion amputation and were replanted.
 Fourteen of the 17 survived (82 percent).
 Our experience indicated that the survival rate was improved by restoring continuity of at least two veins and two arteries, using a Y-shaped vein graft and the princeps pollicis artery for the source of arterial circulation.
 Nerve grafts were used to bridge defects in avulsed digital nerves.
 When possible, avulsed tendons were reattached to their muscle.
 Key pinch strength was 60 percent of normal, and grip strength was always less than that of the normal hand.
 The age of the patients and the cold ischemia time had no significant effect on either survival or function of the replanted thumb.
 When excellent venous backflow occurred immediately after the vessel repair and continued for at least 20 minutes, the thumb always survived without complications.
