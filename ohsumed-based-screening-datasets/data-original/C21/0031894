Drinking patterns and drinking-related problems of Mexican-American husbands and wives.
 The present research builds on previous studies' findings of alcohol-related gender differences between Mexican-American men and women, through examination of drinking levels, norms and related problems within the context of marriage and family.
 A survey of husbands and wives in 206 married couples randomly selected from eligible households in East San Jose, California, was carried out.
 Highlights in our findings include significant gender differences in reports of drinking patterns, frequency of heavier drinking, tangible consequences of drinking and expectancies regarding alcohol.
 Most notably, correlations were found between husbands' and wives' quantity-frequency drinking measures, the frequency of heavier drinking, tangible consequences of drinking and expectancies regarding alcohol.
 Although men have higher levels of drinking and greater drinking-related problems, husbands' and wives' patterns are correlated with one another.
 These links between spouses' drinking-related variables have important implications for family prevention and education about alcohol use.
