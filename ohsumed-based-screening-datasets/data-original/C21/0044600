Techniques for application of tissue adhesive for corneal perforations.
 We describe a modified technique of using cyanoacrylate adhesive to seal corneal perforations.
 Easily performed at the slit lamp, its advantages over previously described methods include a smooth, contoured collagen surface overlying the adhesive, which is easily wet by the tear film.
 Even greater comfort and protection are provided by the addition of a hydrophilic bandage lens or collagen shield.
