Aztreonam pharmacokinetics in burn patients.
 The pharmacokinetics of aztreonam in eight adult patients with severe burn injuries (total body surface area burn, 49% +/- 21% [mean +/- standard deviation]) were studied.
 The time of initiation of study following burn injury was 7.0 +/- 1.4 days.
 Four patients at first dose and at steady state were studied.
 Aztreonam concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, and a two-compartment model was used to fit the data.
 No significant differences in any pharmacokinetic parameters between first dose and steady state were observed.
 Volume of distribution of the central compartment after first dose (0.14 liters/kg) and volume of distribution at steady state (0.31 liters/kg) were approximately 30% higher than those reported for other patient populations.
 Total drug clearance and renal drug clearance when normalized to creatinine clearance (CLCR) were similar to those previously reported for other critically ill patients.
 CLCR was strongly correlated with renal drug clearance (r = 0.94) and total drug clearance (r = 0.95).
 The extent and degree of burn (percent second or third degree burn) were poorly correlated with all pharmacokinetic parameters with the exception of the volume of distribution at steady state, which was correlated with both total body surface area burn (r = 0.95) and percent second degree burn (r = 0.83).
 Aztreonam pharmacokinetics are altered as a result of thermal injury; however, CLCR can be used to assess the clearance of aztreonam in burn patients.
