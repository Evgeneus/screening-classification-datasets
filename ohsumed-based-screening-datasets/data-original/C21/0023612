Pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta: a case report and review of the literature.
 Pseudoaneurysm of the abdominal aorta is a rare finding, accounting for only 1% of all abdominal aneurysms.
 Abdominal pseudoaneurysms have been reported only in males, and two-thirds of the cases are the result of penetrating trauma.
 Pain, abdominal mass, and vascular occlusion are the most common presenting signs and symptoms.
 The interval between injury and rupture may range from hours to years, and accordingly, a high index of suspicion is needed to make the diagnosis.
