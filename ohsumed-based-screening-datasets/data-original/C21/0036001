The effect on pulmonary function of tangential field technique in radiotherapy for carcinoma of the breast.
 Twenty-five patients treated by lumpectomy and radiotherapy for Stage I breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective study to measure the effects of tangential field irradiation on pulmonary function.
 Fractional doses of 2 Gy to a total of 50 Gy were administered with the tangential technique.
 An additional 10 Gy (2 Gy x 5) was given as direct booster.
 Dynamic and static lung volumes, distribution of ventilation and gas transfer were measured before irradiation and at varying intervals up to 1 year after the completion of therapy.
 There was a small, but statistically significant decrease in the forced vital capacity (mean 63 ml) and the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (mean 79 ml) measured 3 months after irradiation (p less than 0.05).
 These changes were reversed within 1 year.
 The reduction in total lung capacity (mean 240 ml) after 3 months was nearly significant (p = 0.06).
 The remaining variables did not change to a significant degree.
 We conclude that a slight restrictive ventilatory impairment may occur when a combined tangential and direct booster technique is applied.
 The changes are, however, small and reversible, and imply no clinical importance.
