Topical application of honey in treatment of burns.
 A total of 104 cases of superficial burn injury were studied to assess the efficiency of honey as a dressing in comparison with silver sulfadiazine gauze dressing.
 In the 52 patients treated with honey, 91 per cent of wounds were rendered sterile within 7 days.
 In the 52 patients treated with silver sulfadiazine, 7 per cent showed control of infection within 7 days.
 Healthy granulation tissue was observed earlier in patients treated with honey (mean 7.4 versus 13.4 days).
 Of the wounds treated with honey 87 per cent healed within 15 days as against 10 per cent in the control group.
 Relief of pain, a lower incidence of hypertrophic scar and postburn contracture, low cost and easy availability make honey an ideal dressing in the treatment of burns.
