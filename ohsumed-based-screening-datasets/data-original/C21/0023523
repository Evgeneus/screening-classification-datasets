Ocular motor abnormalities from head trauma.
 Head injuries cause the hospitalization of 200-300 persons per 100,000 population per year.
 Ophthalmologists provide diagnostic and therapeutic care to those trauma victims with damage to the globe, optic nerve, orbit, and ocular motor system.
 Eye movements can be affected by damage at any level of the central nervous system or peripheral motor unit.
 Comprehensive ocular motor assessment of the trauma patient can substantially contribute to the understanding of the patient's injury, recovery, and rehabilitation.
 This review examines all aspects of head and face trauma that can lead to ocular motility disturbances.
