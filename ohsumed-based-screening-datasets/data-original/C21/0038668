Outcome of complex vascular and orthopedic injuries of the lower extremity.
 Thirty-two patients undergoing limb salvage procedures for complex vascular and orthopedic injuries of the lower extremity were studied in order to identify prognostic indicators for delayed amputation in this select group.
 A high incidence of nerve (38%), soft tissue (66%), and remote injury (47%) was noted.
 A comprehensive and integrated approach to vascular, orthopedic, and plastic reconstruction was utilized.
 Of the 32 patients studied, 1 (3.1%) died as a result of remote injury and sepsis.
 Amputation was required in 9 patients (28%), while 13 (56%) of the patients with limb salvage showed persistent functional or neurologic deficits.
 Infection was the most significant factor associated with amputation (p less than 0.0005) and was not avoided by the perioperative use of antibiotics.
 Delayed amputation resulted in a significant extension of total hospitalization (p less than 0.005).
 The authors favor an aggressive approach to limb salvage with IIIC injury but recommend early amputation in the presence of significant nerve disruption.
 An attentive use of tissue debridement, intravenous antibiotics, and early wound coverage is needed to limit infection.
