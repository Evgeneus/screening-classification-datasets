Penetrating carotid injuries--a wartime experience.
 Thirty-nine patients with penetrating carotid injuries were treated between 1975 and 1987.
 All were war victims.
 On admission 27 (69%) had no neurologic deficit (group I), 8 (20.5%) had a mild neurologic deficit (group II), and 4 (10.5%) had a severe deficit (group III).
 Repair was undertaken in 38 of 39 (97.5%) patients, and carotid ligation was performed in 1 case (2.5%).
 Associated injuries were found in 25 (65%) patients.
 All patients survived.
 At the time of discharge all group I and II patients had a normal neurologic examination.
 One patient in group III recovered completely, whereas two had significant improvement.
 One patient remained unchanged.
 We conclude that repair should be attempted in all patients with carotid injuries who are seen early (less than 120 minutes) after the accident.
