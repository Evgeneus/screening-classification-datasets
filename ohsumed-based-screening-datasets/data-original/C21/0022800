Transseptal catheterization technique: a simple safety procedure.
 The major complication of transseptal catheterization, that of inadvertent perforation of other structures, can best be avoided by maintenance of the correct needle tip position during introduction and maneuvering of the assembly.
 The addition of a needle-stop to the transseptal needle shaft and a sterile ruler to check its present position assures the maintenance of the needle tip position, freeing the operator's concern for accurate location of landmarks.
 The method of utilizing and setting the needle-stop is described.
