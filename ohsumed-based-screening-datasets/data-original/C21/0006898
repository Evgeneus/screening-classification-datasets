Medical management of acute traumatic rupture of the aorta.
 Surgical reconstruction is the treatment for acute traumatic aortic rupture and should be accomplished immediately in most patients.
 In patients in whom concomitant injuries or the development of life-threatening complications preclude safe and successful aortic reconstruction, pharmacological intervention to reduce the risk of free aortic rupture may be considered.
 Surgical reconstruction can then be more safely performed under controlled elective circumstances.
