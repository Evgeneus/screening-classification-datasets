Penetrating keratoplasty after ocular trauma.
 We reviewed the records of 41 patients who underwent penetrating keratoplasty for a corneal opacity caused by trauma between Jan.
 1, 1983, and Dec.
 31, 1988.
 Most of the patients were young males whose average age was 35 years.
 Common tools accounted for many injuries (14 of 41, 34%).
 Sixteen injuries (39%) were work-related.
 Thirty-six patients (88%) had corneal scars from a perforating injury, four patients (10%) had corneal edema, and one patient (2%) required emergency penetrating keratoplasty for extensive tissue loss.
 Of the 39 patients with one year of follow-up, 31 (82%) maintained clear corneal grafts.
 Rejection occurred in nine of 39 patients (23%) and only three (33%) of the rejections resolved.
 Visual outcome was favorable with 20 patients (51%) attaining best-corrected postoperative visual acuity of 20/20 to 20/40, nine patients (23%) attaining visual acuity of 20/50 to 20/100, and ten patients (26%) attaining visual acuity of 20/200 or worse.
 Preoperative retinal disease (six of 39, 15%), astigmatic errors (five of 39, 13%), graft failures (four of 39, 10%), and postoperative glaucoma (12 of 39, 31%) adversely influenced the outcome.
 Although the prevalence of postoperative complications is relatively high, good visual results can be obtained in patients who undergo penetrating keratoplasty after ocular trauma.
