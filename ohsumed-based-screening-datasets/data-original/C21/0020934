Ocular injuries caused by elastic cords [published erratum appears in Arch Ophthalmol 1991 Jun;109(6):878]
 Five patients with ocular trauma due to elastic cords with attached metal or plastic hooks were evaluated over a 13-month period.
 Injuries included hyphema, angle recession, lens subluxation, choroidal rupture, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and scleral rupture.
 Two patients suffered penetrating ocular injuries, and three patients had final visual acuities of 20/200 or less.
 This series emphasizes the potential severity of ocular injury due to these commonly used devices and reiterates a modification in design that might decrease the likelihood of accidental trauma from elastic cords.
