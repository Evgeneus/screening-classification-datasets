Relapsing systemic infection due to Rhodococcus equi in a drug abuser seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus.
 A case of recurrent multisystemic infection due to Rhodococcus equi in a patient with antibody to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) but without AIDS is reported.
 This case, which occurred in a woman with a history of alcohol and drug abuse, is, to our knowledge, the first such case described.
 The infection involved the lungs, kidneys, brain, and bloodstream.
 Despite several courses of therapy with antibiotics to which her isolates of R.
 equi were susceptible in vitro, the patient experienced multiple relapses before her death.
 On the basis of this case and a few others reported in HIV-infected patients, we recommend an initial antibiotic course at least 6-8 weeks in duration, and we suggest that combination antibiotic treatment be considered.
 We also suggest that infection with R.
 equi be included in the diagnostic criteria for AIDS.
