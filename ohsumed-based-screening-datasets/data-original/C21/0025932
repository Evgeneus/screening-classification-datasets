The transmandibular implant: a 13-year survey of its use.
 During the period from August 1976 until July 1989 the transmandibular implant was introduced in a total of 31 oral and maxillofacial surgery departments in the Netherlands and 1,466 patients were treated.
 This study includes 1,356 treated patients from 28 departments.
 The treatment course of 1,201 patients (89.6%) was uneventful.
 Of the 157 complications, 58 related to the anatomic contour of the mandible, 49 to the surgery, 25 to the prosthetic reconstruction, 8 to the psychosocial attitude of the patient, 8 to the use of medication, 5 to trauma, and 4 to the presence of a skin graft.
 Treatment of the complications included removal of the implant in 44 patients; in 106 patients the complication was treated satisfactorily.
 In the remaining 7 patients, hypesthesia was present.
 The reasons for the removal of the 44 implants were infection (11), operative error (5), premature loading of the implant (3), insufficient width of the mandible after a visor osteotomy (1), loss of osseointegration caused by the prosthesis (14), psychological problems (4), trauma (3), drug-related gingival hyperplasia (2), and inexplicable pain (1).
 The present survey shows a consistent success rate of 96.8%.
