Experience with penile fractures in Saudi Arabia.
 Seven patients with penile rupture were treated surgically within a 9-month period.
 All were operated on as emergencies, with successful results, except in 1 case which was associated with urethral rupture.
 Sexual performance was satisfactory in 6 of 7 cases.
