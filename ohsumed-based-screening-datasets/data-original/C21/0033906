Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (Ahd-2)-associated DNA polymorphisms in mouse strains with variable ethanol preferences.
 The genotype-dependent response of mice to ethanol has been well documented.
 Cytosolic acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH-2) increases in some strains while decreasing in others with ethanol treatment.
 Further work suggests that the mRNA for ALDH-2 (Ahd-2 mRNA) levels are altered following ethanol feeding in a strain-dependent fashion.
 This report identifies differences in Ahd-2 at the genomic DNA level among different strains of mice.
 Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) associated with the Ahd-2 locus were found for the restriction enzymes EcoRI, HindIII, Pst I and Rsa I.
 The mouse strains included in this study could be categorized into two groups based on their overall Ahd-2 associated DNA banding patterns.
 Strains C57BL/6J, C57BL/6J*, C57BL/10J and BALB/c form group 1 while strains C3H/HeJ, C3H/HeSnJ, 129/ReJ, Csb, SW and DBA/2J form group 2.
 With the exception of BALB/c, group 1 represents alcohol preferring strains while group 2 are alcohol avoiding strains.
 Additional work will be required to determine the physiological significance (if any) of these RFLPs and their possible relationship to ethanol preference and avoidance.
