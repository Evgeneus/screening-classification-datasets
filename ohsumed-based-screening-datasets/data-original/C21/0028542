Traumatic facial injuries with steering wheel loading.
 This study was conducted to evaluate the biomechanics of facial fractures caused by steering wheel loading.
 Twelve intact fresh human cadaver heads were impacted onto standard or energy-absorbing steering wheels with a custom-designed and validated vertical-drop apparatus.
 Either zygoma was impacted once at a velocity of 2.0-6.9 m/s.
 The specimens were oriented to permit a direct comparison between pretest and posttest radiography, and two-dimensional and three-dimensional CT images.
 Bone mineral content was determined, and biomechanical forces, accelerations, and deformations were recorded.
 More severe fractures were associated with higher forces on the zygoma.
 With increasing velocities, fractures initiated at the zygomatic region propagated to other unilateral regions such as the mandible and orbit or to the contralateral side.
 Less facial trauma was observed with energy-absorbing steering wheels compared with standard wheels at similar impact velocities.
 Bone mineral content did not correlate well with specimen age or with fracture severity.
 Clinically significant fractures were identifiable on 3-D CT images.
 The flexibility of 3-D CT in evaluating the spatial extent of facial abnormalities in different orientations may have significant impact in planning surgical procedures.
