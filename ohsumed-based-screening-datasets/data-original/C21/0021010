Sonographic detection of foreign bodies of the extremities.
 A prospective study to assess the accuracy of ultrasound in the detection and localization of foreign bodies of the extremities was undertaken.
 Forty-five patients with clinical suspicion of foreign bodies were included in the study.
 Among 20 patients with radio-opaque foreign bodies, ultrasonic detection of foreign bodies was achieved in 19 patients.
 In 25 patients, with no radiographic evidence of foreign body, ultrasonic detection of foreign bodies was made in seven patients and among these foreign bodies were confirmed and removed at surgery in five patients.
 Accurate pre-operative ultrasonic localization of foreign bodies was carried out in three patients.
