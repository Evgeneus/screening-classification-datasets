Neurogenic bladder in neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
 Urinary retention or incontinence is not an infrequent clinical finding in patients with neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
 We studied the pathophysiology of this voiding disorder by urodynamic testing.
 It revealed involuntary bladder contraction and rigidity of external sphincter (dyskinesia).
 These findings are analogous to those in Parkinson disease patients and support the dopamine deficiency theory as the cause of neuroleptic malignant syndrome.
