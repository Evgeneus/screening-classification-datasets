Toward reducing pediatric injuries from firearms: charting a legislative and regulatory course 
 Each year in the United States, approximately 3000 children and adolescents younger than age 20 die as a result of homicides, suicides, and unintentional injuries from firearms.
 The young children, relatives, neighbors, and friends of the 30,000 adults killed by firearms each year in the United States are also affected by this uniquely American epidemic.
 It is estimated that half of all American homes contain 200 million firearms, including 60 million handguns.
 Increasingly, pediatricians are becoming involved in efforts to reduce the prevalence of injuries from firearms, as parent educators, experts on children and adolescents, and advocates in the political process.
 This commentary is intended to aid in the last of these roles.
 The advocacy goal is identified as reducing the accessibility of guns in the environments of children and adolescents.
 The pros and cons of 17 possible approaches--ranging from mandatory safety courses in schools to handgun bans--are presented.
 It is concluded that, while there is no perfect approach, many available approaches will help; there is every reason to be both bold and optimistic.
