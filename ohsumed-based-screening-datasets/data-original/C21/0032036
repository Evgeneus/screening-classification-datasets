Carotid cavernous fistula after minimal facial trauma. Report of a case.
 The carotid cavernous fistula has historically been associated with extensive facial trauma as a result of direct or indirect forces.
 Most fistulas of traumatic origin develop as a result of a fracture through the base of the skull, which produces a force causing laceration of the internal carotid artery in the region where it approximates the cavernous sinus.
 We report a case in which apparently minimal head trauma resulted in the development of a carotid cavernous fistula.
 The rather innocuous presentation of this complication requires particular attention by the caregiver in assessing the patient sustaining maxillofacial trauma.
