A subluxing arthropathy associated with the anti-Jo-1 antibody in polymyositis/dermatomyositis.
 Of 180 patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) seen at the University of Pittsburgh and affiliated hospitals since 1975, 21 of 100 tested positive for the anti-Jo-1 antibody.
 Sixteen of the 21 patients were women and 18 were white.
 Fifteen had adult PM, 4 had myositis in overlap with scleroderma, and 2 had adult DM.
 Evidence of interstitial lung disease was found in 12 of 18 anti-Jo-1 positive patients (67%), but in only 15 of 79 anti-Jo-1 negative patients (19%) (P less than 0.0002).
 The 21 anti-Jo-1 positive patients were divided into 3 separate groups based on the observed articular findings.
 Four patients had a deforming, predominantly nonerosive arthropathy with subluxations of the distal interphalangeal joints, especially the thumbs.
 Eight patients had a nondeforming arthropathy primarily affecting the small joints of the hands, wrists, shoulders, and knees.
 Those with deformities had a longer duration of arthritis compared with those with nondeforming arthropathy (mean 14.5 years versus 3.3 years).
 Nine anti-Jo-1 positive patients had no joint arthropathy.
 Three of 4 patients with deformities have required articular reconstructive surgery for subluxation, with 2 having associated subcutaneous calcinosis.
