Pregnancy following spinal cord injury.
 Each year about 2,000 women of childbearing age in the United States have a spinal cord injury.
 Only a few mostly anecdotal reports describe pregnancy after such an injury.
 In a retrospective study of 16 women with a spinal cord injury, half of whom have a complete injury and about half quadriplegia, 25 pregnancies occurred, with 21 carried to full term.
 The women delayed pregnancy an average of 6.5 years after their injury, with an average age at first pregnancy of 26.8 years.
 Cesarean section was necessary in 4 patients because of inadequate progress of labor.
 In 5 deliveries an episiotomy and local anesthesia were required, 7 required epidural anesthesia, including all cesarean sections, and 10 did not require anesthesia.
 Several complications have been identified in the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum periods including autonomic hyperreflexia, premature labor, pressure sores, urinary tract infections, abnormal presentation, and failure to progress.
 Ultrasonography and amniocentesis were used selectively.
 Women with spinal cord injuries can have healthy children, although there are significant risks and these women have special needs.
