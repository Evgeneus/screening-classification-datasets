Asbestos exposure and asbestos-related pleural and parenchymal disease. Associations with immune imbalance.
 The study hypothesis was that asbestos exposure and asbestos-related pleural plaques and interstitial disease are associated with (1) immune imbalances favoring helper-inducer T-cell subsets in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and (2) T-lymphocyte accumulation in BAL.
 One hundred twenty-two asbestos-exposed subsets (AES), including 27 nonsmokers (NS), were evaluated and compared with 10 unexposed normal subjects.
 Data were collected on medical, smoking, and occupational histories, physical examination, spirometry, lung volumes, single-breath DLCO, chest films read by a "B" reader, and T-lymphocyte characterization in blood and BAL using flow cytometry analysis of monoclonal-antibody-treated cells.
 On average, AES were 47 yr of age and had 23 yr of asbestos exposure.
 Fifty-eight (48%) had pleural thickening, and seven (6%) had profusion greater than or equal to 1/0.
 In blood, asbestos-exposed NS had lower total and percent CD8 and lower total CD3 than did normal subjects.
 In BAL, asbestos-exposed NS had higher total CD3 than did normal subjects.
 Among AES, increased asbestos exposure was associated with increased percent CD8 in BAL and decreases in both percent lymphocytes and total CD8 in blood.
 Increase in CD4/CD8 ratio in BAL were associated with pleural thickening.
 In those seven with profusion greater than or equal to 1/0, there was increased percent CD4 in blood and decreased percent CD8 in BAL.
 These results suggest immune imbalance favoring helper-inducer T-cell subsets in association with asbestos exposure systemically and with pleural plaques in BAL.
