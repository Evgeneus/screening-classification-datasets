Rationalising the management of swallowed coins in children.
 OBJECTIVE--To assess the management of swallowed coins in children and identify aspects that could be improved.
 DESIGN--Study of records of three hospital departments for 1986-90.
 SETTING--Accident and emergency, radiology, and operating theatre departments in a children's hospital.
 SUBJECTS--50 children reported to have ingested coins.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Radiological investigations performed, position of coin, symptoms of child, and surgical intervention.
 RESULTS--50 children were recorded to have swallowed coins during 1986-90.
 Five children had only chest radiography, five only abdominal radiography, and 40 had both.
 A coin was detected in the oesophagus in 15 children, six of whom had symptoms, and below the cardia in 26, none of whom had symptoms; no coin was seen in nine children.
 Eleven children had further abdominal radiographs despite the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms; one child had a coin removed from the stomach.
 CONCLUSIONS--Children are being unnecessarily exposed to radiation and surgical intervention, and a consensus on management of swallowed coins is needed.
 Most children require only a single chest and neck radiograph.
