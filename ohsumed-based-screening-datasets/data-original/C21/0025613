Autologous marrow injection as a substitute for operative grafting of tibial nonunions.
 Autologous marrow injection was used to stimulate healing in 20 ununited tibial fractures over a five-year period.
 The technique was employed in conjunction with cast immobilization in ten cases and intramedullary nail fixation in ten cases.
 Marrow stimulated a callus formation sufficient to unite eight of the ten nonunions immobilized with casts and all ten of the fractures immobilized by intramedullary nails.
 Bone-marrow injection was as effective as past open autologous grafting but with considerably fewer disadvantages.
 The technique provides a promptly renewable and reliable source of osteogenic stem cells with numerous advantages compared with standard open-grafting techniques.
