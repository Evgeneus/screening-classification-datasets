Role of basal insulin in the regulation of protein kinetics and energy metabolism in septic patients.
 We have investigated the role of basal insulin concentration on leucine kinetics (determined by means of 1-[13C]leucine) and energy metabolism (determined by indirect calorimetry) in eight septic patients by reducing insulin (and glucagon) secretion by somatostatin infusion.
 Basal glucagon concentration was elevated (744 +/- 381 pg/mL), and insulin concentration was normal (10 +/- 4 microU/mL).
 Basal resting energy expenditure (REE) was 151 +/- 8% that of predicted basal energy expenditure, and leucine appearance (Ra), oxidation, and nonoxidative disposal rates were all elevated above the normal ranges.
 Somatostatin infusion reduced insulin concentration by 52% and glucagon concentration by 64%.
 This resulted in a significant increase in the rate of leucine oxidation from 0.96 +/- 0.08 to 1.18 +/- 0.14 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.01), and nonoxidative leucine disposal decreased from 2.95 +/- 0.18 to 2.67 +/- 0.17 mumol/kg/min (p less than 0.01).
 Somatostatin infusion also caused significant increases in REE and fat oxidation from 1310 +/- 100 to 1505 +/- 128 kcal/m2/day (p less than 0.05) and from 1.72 +/- 0.24 to 2.41 +/- 0.41 mg/kg/min, respectively, and a slight decrease of carbohydrate oxidation from 1.51 +/- 0.49 to 1.31 +/- 0.49 mg/kg/min.
 These metabolic responses can be attributed to the reduction in insulin concentration, because they are in the opposite direction of changes that would occur as a consequence of a reduction in glucagon concentration.
 We conclude that the basal insulin plays an important role in attenuating net protein loss and energy expenditure.
