A practical technique for the fabrication of transparent bite mark overlays.
 A quick, inexpensive, and accurate technique for generating transparent overlays, using office photocopy machines, for use in bite mark case analysis is presented.
 The critical step in the fabrication process involves determination of the accuracy of the product produced by the photocopy machine.
 A reliable method for making such a determination is discussed.
