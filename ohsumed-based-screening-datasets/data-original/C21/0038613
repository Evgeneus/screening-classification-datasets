Lumbar facet fracture as a possible source of pain after lumbar laminectomy.
 This study compared 50 patients with lumbar facet fractures and continued pain after lumbar laminectomy with a postlaminectomy control group without facet fractures.
 Computed tomographic analysis compared variables including direct measurements of bone resection.
 Average follow-up between surgery and postsurgical computed tomographic examination was 3.2 years.
 In the fracture group, more than one half of the bone immediately above the flare of the inferior articular process at the level of the laminectomy, measured in a medial to lateral direction, had been resected.
 No one in the control group had more than one quarter of this bone removed (P = .0001).
 Lumbar facet fractures may be one cause of late postlaminectomy pain.
 Caution in resection of a particular area of bone may avoid this problem.
