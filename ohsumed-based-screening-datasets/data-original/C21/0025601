Dislocation of the peroneal tendons in neonates and infants.
 Twenty-three cases of dislocation of the peroneal tendons were found during routine orthopedic examinations of neonates and infants.
 All but one case was without foot deformity.
 One case was treated with a cast, and the others received no treatment.
 Follow-up observations revealed that the dislocations resolved spontaneously in almost all cases.
 This condition seems to be not as rare as had been previously considered.
 Dislocations of the peroneal tendons in neonates and infants without foot deformity should be untreated and allowed to resolve spontaneously.
