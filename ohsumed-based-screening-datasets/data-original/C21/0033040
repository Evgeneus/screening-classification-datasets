Penetrating craniocerebral missile injuries in civilians: a retrospective analysis of 314 cases.
 Analysis of 314 cases of penetrating craniocerebral missile injuries in civilians revealed a high rate of early mortality, with 228 victims having died at the scene and a further 38 dead within 3 hours.
 Surgery was performed in 44 patients who had a preoperative Glasgow Coma Score of at least 4.
 Out of the 26 survivors, all operated upon, 19 had an adequate recovery (score of 0-3 on the expanded Glasgow Outcome Scale).
 Vigorous resuscitation and early surgery often resulted in useful survivals and occasionally in spectacular recoveries.
 However, the high mortality rate on the scene or soon after the injury restricted the possibility of effective management to a minority of cases.
