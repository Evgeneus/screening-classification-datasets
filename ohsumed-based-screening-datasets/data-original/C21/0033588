Early immobilization of mandibular fractures: a retrospective study.
 This study reviews the treatment outcome of 204 fractures in 131 patients over a 33-month period.
 In the total group, an infection rate of 4.4% was experienced, which is comparable with other reports.
 However, in complaint patients immobilized within 72 hours of injury, there was a 0% incidence of bone infection in 111 fractures treated by closed reduction and a 2% (one case) incidence of bone infection in 50 fractures treated by open reduction.
 Thus, of the of 161 fractures treated by closed and/or open reduction with early immobilization in complaint patients, the incidence of posttreatment bone infection was 0.6%.
 It was not significant whether teeth in the line of fracture were retained or removed.
 This study supports the principle that compound fractures of the mandible should to be immobilized within 72 hours of the initial trauma.
