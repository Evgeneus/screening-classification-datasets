Poisonous snakebite in central Texas. Possible indicators for antivenin treatment.
 Sixty-seven patients hospitalized for poisonous snakebite between 1975 and 1990 were managed by elevation, tetanus prophylaxis, intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and often by a limited excision of the bite site in the Emergency Department, with sequential laboratory studies as needed.
 Antivenin was used for systemic envenomation, and 23 of the 67 patients (34%) received 133 vials.
 Thirteen of the twenty-three patients (56%) had adverse reactions to the antivenin.
 Two significant observations arose.
 First age was an indicator.
 Eleven of eighteen patients 12 years or younger (61%) received antivenin, whereas 12 of 49 patients older than 12 years (24%) received antivenin (p = 0.0085, Fisher's exact test).
 Second species of snake was an indicator.
 Sixty-two snakes were identified (93%).
 Of 39 rattlesnake (Crotalus and Sistrurus) bites, 20 patients received antivenin (53%), but of 23 copperhead and water moccasin (Agkistrodon) bites, only three patients (12.5%) received antivenin (p = 0.0025).
 Antivenin may be indicated for use in systemic rattlesnake envenomation, especially in younger patients.
