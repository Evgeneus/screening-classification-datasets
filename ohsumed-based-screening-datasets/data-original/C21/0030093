The treatment of temporomandibular joint internal derangements using a modified open condylotomy: a preliminary report.
 A modified open condylotomy was used to treat 44 patients who presented with painful temporomandibular joints, and in whom the clinical and arthrographic findings were indicative of disc displacement.
 A total of 64 joints (20 bilateral) were operated on.
 Postoperatively, the patients showed an overall improvement in their functional symptoms.
 Ninety-one percent of patients had improvement in clicking and popping, and 96% reported decrease in locking.
 Complaints related to pain and headache were improved 85% and 95%, respectively.
 The modified technique, as well as the anatomic basis for its use, are discussed.
