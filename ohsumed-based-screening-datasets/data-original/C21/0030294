The spectrum of liver and spleen injuries in children: failure of the pediatric trauma score and clinical signs to predict isolated injuries.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine whether potentially life-threatening intra-abdominal injuries occur in the absence of multisystem trauma in children, and to determine the usefulness of physical examination and a pediatric triage score in the assessment of liver and spleen injuries in children.
 DESIGN: Retrospective study.
 SETTING: Admissions to a children's hospital from October 1982 through September 1989 who were found to have liver or spleen injuries.
 Seventy-seven patients were identified; 55 were male, 22 were female.
 Mean age was 9 years and 3 months (+/- 56 months) with a range of 22 months to 20 years, 4 months.
 Clinical signs were recorded and a Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) were calculated for each patient.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (70%) had a spleen injury, 18 (23%) had a liver injury, and five (7%) had both liver and spleen injuries.
 Patients were managed without surgery in 63 of 77 cases (82%); two died.
 Fifty-one of 77 patients (66%) received an ISS of 18 or less; 26 patients (34%) received a score of more than 18.
 Forty-four of the 51 patients (86%) with an ISS of 18 or less had a normal pulse (120 or less); 48 of the 51 (94%) had a normal systolic blood pressure (90 mm Hg or more).
 A strong negative correlation (r = -0.80; P = .001) was found between the two scores for children with multiple severe injuries (ISS of more than 18); there was poor correlation (r = -0.04; P greater than .05) between the two scores for isolated liver or spleen injury (ISS of 18 or less).
 CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that liver or spleen damage may be present in children without other injuries and must be considered with a high index of suspicion, and that neither the initial clinical findings nor the PTS reliably predicts liver or spleen injuries in children with focal abdominal injuries.
