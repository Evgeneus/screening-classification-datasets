Fracture of the base of the little finger metacarpal: importance of the "ball-catcher" radiographic view.
 A case of fracture of the base of the little finger metacarpal is presented.
 These unusual fractures are not easily detected on the routine three-view "hand-series." Physicians should be aware of the AP oblique (Norgaard, or "ball-catcher's") view, which is helpful in detecting these fractures.
