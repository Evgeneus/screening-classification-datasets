Cervical spine fractures and maxillofacial trauma.
 Cervical spine fractures are a serious complication of maxillofacial trauma because of the high potential for mortality and neurologic morbidity.
 This study reviewed 563 patients with facial fractures treated by the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at a level I trauma center and identified 11 concomitant cervical spine fractures (2.0%).
 These patients were almost exclusively male (91%), white (100%), between 20 and 35 years of age (64%), involved in a motor vehicle accident (91%), with a concomitant mandibular fracture (91%).
 The examination, diagnosis, and management of patients with cervical spine injuries are discussed.
