Early mobilization of ankle fractures after open reduction and internal fixation.
 The effect of early mobilization and unrestricted weight bearing on final ankle motion in 51 operatively stabilized ankle fractures was prospectively investigated.
 Patients were treated with an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) or a cast.
 Full weight bearing was unrestricted in both groups.
 Thirty-two fractures received an AFO and 19 received a cast.
 The follow-up period ranged from 2.3 to 66 months, with a median of eight months.
 At the final follow-up examination, the motion in the AFO-treated group was not functionally different from that of the cast-treated group.
 However, 72% of the patients treated in an AFO compared with 37% of patients treated in a cast had ankle dorsiflexion greater than 15 degrees (p = 0.014).
 No complications were directly related to the AFO.
 No loss of reduction occurred in any patient.
 The results of this series indicate that early motion of a fractured ankle treated operatively does not affect ankle motion.
 Early motion was not associated with increased morbidity or loss of reduction.
