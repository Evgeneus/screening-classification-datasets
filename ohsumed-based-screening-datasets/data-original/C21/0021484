The value of arthrography in the decision-making process regarding surgery for internal derangement of the temporomandibular joint.
 In this study, the clinical and arthrographic findings from 43 internally deranged temporomandibular joints (TMJs) were compared with the intra-surgical observations.
 In 40 of 43 joints, arthrography did not provide any additional information useful for diagnosis or treatment.
 In six joints, the problem was misdiagnosed.
 Only in three joints did arthrography demonstrate the existence of perforation in the posterior attachment that had not been suspected during the clinical examination.
 Because of the doubtful importance of arthrographic information for the decision-making process, it is suggested that the method be applied only in cases in which clinical examination and plain radiographs have failed to uncover the signs and symptoms indicative of a TMJ disorder.
