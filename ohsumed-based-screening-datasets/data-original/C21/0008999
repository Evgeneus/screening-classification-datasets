Ocular trauma caused by exploding glass bottles containing dry ice and water.
 We treated three patients with severe ocular injuries caused by exploding glass bottles containing a mixture of dry ice chips and water.
 One patient had a corneal laceration and traumatic cataract with several retained intraocular glass fragments.
 The second had a scleral laceration without corneal or lenticular involvement.
 The third suffered a corneal-scleral laceration, with a total retinal detachment.
 Following surgery, two patients recovered 20/20 vision; the third patient regained only light perception.
