Rupture of the oesophagus during cricoid pressure 
 Rupture of the oesophagus occurred during the application of cricoid pressure at induction of anaesthesia when the patient vomited.
 The patient, who was bleeding from a gastric ulcer, was found to have a lower oesophageal tear which, although repaired at operation, resulted in a fatal mediastinitis.
