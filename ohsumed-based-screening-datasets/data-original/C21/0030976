Dual diagnoses: psychiatric syndromes in alcoholism and drug addiction.
 Concomitant psychiatric illness and alcohol or drug addiction are difficult to diagnose and treat.
 Alcohol and drug problems are significantly underdiagnosed in medical and psychiatric populations, while psychiatric disorders may be underdiagnosed in alcohol- and drug-addicted patients.
 An understanding of addiction and psychiatric disorders is essential for successful treatment of the comorbidity of these disorders.
 Alcohol or drug addiction frequently produces significant psychiatric syndromes, which may resolve during periods of sobriety.
 The combination of addiction and established psychiatric disorders is less common.
