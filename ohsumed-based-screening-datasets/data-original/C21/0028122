Direct anterior fixation of dens fractures with a cannulated screw system.
 Anterior screw fixation of dens fractures appears to be an optimal method of treatment for these injuries.
 Anatomic dens fracture reduction with stable internal screw fixation satisfies the established principles of the AO/ASIF.
 Iatrogenic trauma is minimized by the use of an anterior surgical approach, and no supplemental bone grafting is required.
 This procedure is quite prone to complications when performed improperly or in contraindicated situations.
 The use of meticulous surgical technique along with a newly designed cannulated screw system has evolved this procedure into an established form of treatment at our department.
 Since 1982, 23 patients were treated with direct screw fixation of dens fractures.
 The overall rate of fracture union was 92.3%, and fracture resolution averaged 5.5 months.
 The major complication rate of 17% (4/23) resulted from inappropriate use of this technique.
 The 11 most recent cases, all of which involved stabilization with cannulated screws, resulted in only a single complication (9%) and an average fracture healing time of 3.5 months.
 A recommended operative technique for anterior screw fixation of dens fractures will be presented along with a discussion of potential sources of difficulty or failures.
