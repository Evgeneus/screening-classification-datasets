Enhanced potency of receptor-selective opioids after acute burn injury.
 Dose-response curves of three receptor-selective opioids were established in a group of nonburned and a group of burned rats.
 Morphine (mu-agonist), biphalin (mu- and delta-agonist), and U50488H (kappa-agonist) were administered to each group, and analgesia was measured by tail flick latency testing.
 Each opioid had a significant increase in potency (i.e., a decrease in ED50 values) in the burned (15% body surface area) compared with the nonburned groups.
 Moderate doses of each drug (i.e., ED50 doses estimated from nonburned group data) in each case augmented stress-induced analgesia in the burned group.
 Analgesic doses failed to prevent a significant increase in plasma beta-endorphin and corticosterone after larger surface area (25%) burns.
 Regardless of receptor specificity, opioid analgesic potency is increased acutely after burn injuries.
