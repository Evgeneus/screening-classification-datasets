Gastrointestinal pathology in adult iron overdose.
 The gastrointestinal effects of iron overdose have been described in children.
 They may occur acutely, ranging in severity from mucosal injury to complete infarction, or several weeks later, as obstruction due to stricture formation.
 They typically occur in the stomach or proximal small bowel.
 We describe an adult example of both, each occurring in the distal portion of the small intestine.
 Both patients had ingested enteric-coated iron preparations and both experienced significant, protracted abdominal pain.
 Thus adults as well as children are at risk for severe gastrointestinal complications after iron overdose.
 Significant protracted abdominal pain should alert the clinician of its possibility.
 Damage to distal areas of the bowel can occur with complete sparing of proximal portions particularly if the iron is an enteric-coated preparation.
