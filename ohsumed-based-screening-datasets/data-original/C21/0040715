Perforation of the globe--a complication of peribulbar anaesthesia.
 Peribulbar anaesthesia has been recommended as a safer alternative to retrobulbar anaesthesia.
 We report a case of perforation of the globe sustained during peribulbar anaesthesia which resulted in blindness.
 Orbital injections are potentially dangerous, be they peribulbar or retrobulbar.
 To minimise the risk, short, blunt needles are advocated for the peribulbar route.
