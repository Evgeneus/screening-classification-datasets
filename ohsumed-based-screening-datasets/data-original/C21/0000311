Factors influencing the results of open reduction and internal fixation of tibial plateau fractures.
 Forty-three displaced tibial plateau fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation.
 The fractures were classified into four groups, and the clinical results were evaluated using a standard 100-point knee rating system.
 The average follow-up period after surgery was 2.7 years.
 Overall there were 35 excellent, five good, three fair, and no poor results.
 In five of eight knees with a less than excellent score, the results were due to the technique of fracture fixation or the absence of a bone graft.
 There were ten postoperative complications, but only one ultimately affected the clinical result.
 Fourteen patients required removal of implants.
 Roentgenographic analysis showed that six knees had mild degenerative changes, two had moderate, and two had severe degenerative changes.
 There was no statistically significant association between the fracture type and a less than excellent result.
 The absence of bone grafting, however, was associated with a less than excellent result.
 Bicondylar fractures had a mean range of motion of 110 degrees, 18 degrees less than that of all other types of fracture combined.
