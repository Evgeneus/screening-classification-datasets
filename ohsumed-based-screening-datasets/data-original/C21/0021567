Taiwan National Poison Center survey of glyphosate--surfactant herbicide ingestions.
 Between January, 1986 and September, 1988, the Taiwan National Poison Center recorded 97 telephone consultations (49 male, 48 female) on cases of ingestion of glyphosate-surfactant herbicide concentrate containing the isopropylamine salt of glyphosate (N-phosphonomethyl glycine, CAS 1071-83-6) and a non-ionic tallow amine surfactant.
 Eleven of the cases resulted in fatalities, all among those attempting suicide.
 The average amount ingested by survivors was 120 +/- 112 mL and by nonsurvivors was 263 +/- 100 mL (p less than or equal to 0.0001).
 The average age of survivors was 35 +/- 15 years compared to 54 +/- 11 years for fatalities (p less than or equal to 0.0002).
 Irritation of the oral mucous membrane and gastrointestinal tract was the most frequently reported effect.
 Other effects recorded were pulmonary dysfunction, oliguria, metabolic acidosis, hypotension, leukocytosis and fever.
 Fourteen patients received either atropine or pralidoxime plus atropine despite the fact that glyphosate does not inhibit acetylcholinesterase.
 Thirteen percent of patients received a urine test for paraquat or treatment customarily used for paraquat ingestion, possibly reflecting similar initial presentations following ingestion of these two herbicides.
 Laboratory differentiation is essential if any doubt exists about which herbicide was ingested.
 Patients ingesting large volumes of concentrated glyphosate-surfactant herbicide formulations require close observation and supportive treatment.
