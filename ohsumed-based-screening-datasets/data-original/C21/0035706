Vacuum phenomenon simulating meniscal or cartilaginous injury of the knee at MR imaging.
 In five patients undergoing magnetic resonance imaging of the knee after athletic injuries, the authors identified a vacuum phenomenon that simulated medial meniscal or joint compartment cartilaginous abnormality.
 A cadaveric knee was injected with air, and the findings were re-created.
 The presence of air or gas between the articular surfaces of the tibia and femur can simulate meniscal or cartilaginous injury.
