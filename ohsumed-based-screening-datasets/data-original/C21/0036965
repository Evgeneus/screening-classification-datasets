Evaluation of liver function tests in screening for intra-abdominal injuries.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To determine the utility of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) in predicting intra-abdominal injury in blunt trauma patients.
 DESIGN: Descriptive review of 309 blunt trauma admissions during study period.
 SETTING: A 1,000-bed Level I trauma center in a major metropolitan area.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Consecutive adult blunt trauma admissions to the trauma service.
 INTERVENTIONS: Serum levels of study enzymes were measured at initial evaluation and subsequent hospitalization.
 Results of all intra-abdominal evaluations were recorded.
 MAIN RESULTS: Significantly greater numbers of patients with SGOT and/or SGPT elevated to more than 130 IU/L had associated intra-abdominal injuries as compared with patients with enzyme elevations of less than 130 IU/L (52% versus 8%).
 All 18 patients with liver injuries had one or both enzymes elevated to more than 130 IU/L.
 Higher enzyme levels were more frequently associated with liver injury.
 CONCLUSIONS: Elevation of serum levels of the study enzymes is a marker for intra-abdominal injury.
 Levels in excess of 130 IU/L are relative indicators of abdominal computed tomography scan.
 Levels of less than 130 IU/L are unlikely to be associated with liver injury.
