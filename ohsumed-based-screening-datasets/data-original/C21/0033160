Serum amylase determination and blunt abdominal trauma.
 To determine the value of serum amylase sampling as an indicator of intra-abdominal injury, the records of 940 consecutive victims of blunt trauma were retrospectively reviewed.
 The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value were poor in the determination of intra-abdominal injury, whether accompanied by craniofacial injury or not.
 It was concluded that routine serum amylase determination is of no value in the clinical management of the patient suffering blunt injury.
