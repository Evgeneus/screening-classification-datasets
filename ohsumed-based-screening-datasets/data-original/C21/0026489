Severe hepatocellular dysfunction following cyproterone acetate therapy.
 Cyproterone acetate (CPA) is a widely used drug in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma.
 Although it is generally well tolerated, liver toxicity has been recognised as a complication of long-term use.
 We report 3 patients with severe hepatocellular damage due to CPA therapy, 2 with fatal fulminant hepatitis.
