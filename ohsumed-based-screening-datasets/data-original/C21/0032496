Injury due to uncontrolled acceleration of an electric wheelchair.
 Approximately 750,000 disabled individuals use electrical platform mobility aids (wheelchairs) for adaptive transportation.
 Because there are no mandatory standards for platform mobility aids and wheelchairs, these adaptive transportation aids are prone to potential design and maintenance problems.
 An injury caused by uncontrolled acceleration of a platform mobility aid is reported.
 Examination of the platform mobility aid identified a defect in its speed control regulator that has been subsequently corrected by the manufacturer.
