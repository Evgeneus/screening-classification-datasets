Epidemiological characteristics of subarachnoid hemorrhage in an urban population.
 Several risk factors for unfavorable outcome from subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) have been identified.
 The prevalence of such risk factors varies among ethnic groups and among men and women.
 The influence of ethnic background and gender as factors in the outcome after SAH has not been adequately studied and is the focus of the present investigation.
 Outcome in 145 consecutive patients was dichotomized as good and moderately disabled vs severely disabled, vegetative, and dead.
 A multiple logistic regression model was used to examine the factors of gender, ethnic group (white and non-white), age, admission neurological grade, pre-existing hypertension, and intravenous drug abuse.
 Our data reveal that hypertensive, white males, with a history of intravenous drug abuse, have a high risk of unfavorable outcome following SAH.
 These observations are important for the design and interpretation of future studies relating to SAH.
