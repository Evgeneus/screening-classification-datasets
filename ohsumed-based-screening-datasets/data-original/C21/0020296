Cyclic antidepressants, lithium, and neuroleptic agents. Pharmacology and toxicology.
 Cyclic antidepressants, lithium, and phenothiazines are frequently prescribed to psychiatric patients.
 Emergency department physicians must be familiar with these medications, and the pharmacologic and toxicologic characteristics of them are discussed.
 Cyclic antidepressants are the primary cause of drug-related death in the United States, with sodium bicarbonate recognized as the treatment of choice.
 Lithium toxicity may be subtle, and treatment is generally supportive in addition to volume replacement with normal saline and hemodialysis for significant intoxications.
 A neuroleptic overdose is managed primarily with supportive care.
 Neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be considered in any psychiatric patient presenting to the Emergency Department.
