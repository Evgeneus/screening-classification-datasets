Comorbidity of psychiatric diagnoses in anorexia nervosa.
 The comorbidity of psychiatric diagnoses was examined with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule in 62 women who participated in a 10-year follow-up study of anorexia nervosa.
 Sixty-two age- and sex-matched controls, their parents, and parents of the anorectic probands were also interviewed with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule.
 There was a statistically significant comorbidity of the affective and anxiety disorders with anorexia nervosa.
 The first-degree relatives of the anorectic probands had significantly more alcoholism and total number of psychiatric diagnoses compared with the first-degree relatives of controls.
 There were two mothers with bulimia nervosa, two cases of anorexia nervosa and two of bulimia nervosa in other first-degree relatives of anorectic probands, and no cases of eating disorders in the first-degree relatives of controls.
