Spontaneous rupture of the stomach in an adult.
 We have reported a case of spontaneous rupture of the stomach in an adult.
 Immediate onset of severe upper abdominal pain after overindulgence in food and drink along with radiographic evidence of pneumoperitoneum and the clinical findings of massive abdominal distention, epigastric tenderness, shock, and occasionally subcutaneous emphysema should suggest the possibility of gastric rupture.
 The treatment is simple, but mortality is high when surgical intervention is not rapid.
