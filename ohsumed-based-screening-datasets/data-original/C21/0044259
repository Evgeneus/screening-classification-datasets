Need the thumb be immobilised in scaphoid fractures? A randomised prospective trial.
 Immobilisation of the thumb is widely believed to be important in the management of fractures of the carpal scaphoid.
 To assess the need for this, we randomly allocated 392 fresh fractures for treatment by either a forearm gauntlet (Colles') cast, leaving the thumb free, or by a conventional 'scaphoid' plaster incorporating the thumb as far as its interphalangeal joint.
 In the 292 fractures which were followed for six months, the incidence of nonunion was independent of the type of cast used.
