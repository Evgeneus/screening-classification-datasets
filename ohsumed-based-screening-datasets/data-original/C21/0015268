Embolism of cerebral tissue: a cause of coagulopathy and cerebral infarction? Report of a case.
 We report a case of potentially survivable closed head injury, which was complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation and bilateral cerebral infarction.
 Autopsy disclosed pulmonary emboli composed of cerebral tissue.
 We suggest that the entry of brain tissue into the systemic blood circulation caused severe disseminated intravascular coagulation, with consequent thrombosis of cerebral veins and spreading infarction.
