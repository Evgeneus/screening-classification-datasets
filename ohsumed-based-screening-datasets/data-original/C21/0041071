"Directed" emergency room thoracotomy: a prognostic prerequisite for survival.
 The results of 163 patients (49 SWs, 85 GSWs, 29 blunt trauma) who had resuscitative thoracotomy in the emergency room (ERT) were reviewed to reassess the indications for the procedure.
 The Revised Trauma Score (RTS) of the patients ranged from 0 to 3 in 138, 4 to 8 in 21, and greater than 8 in four.
 No patient with blunt trauma survived.
 Sixteen patients [12 (24.5%) with stab wounds and 4 (4.7%) with gunshot wounds] were eventually discharged, an overall survival of 9.8%.
 Eight of the survivors were without vital signs on arrival at the emergency center and one of them had only signs of life at the scene.
 Survival was best when the site of penetration was thoracic (n = 84) and the ERT was "directed" at potential cardiac injury.
 Fifty-six of these patients (66.6%) did have cardiac wounds with tamponade and 12 of them survived (21.4%).
 Two of the remaining 28 patients, both with pulmonary injury, were salvaged.
 This was significantly (p less than 0.001) higher than in patients with head and neck (n = 4), abdominal (n = 19), or multiple site (n = 40) injury when the ERT was nondirected.
 Two of the five patients (40%) with extremity vascular injuries survived after ERT was successful in restoring a cardiac rhythm.
 These data suggest that in patients without vital signs, ERT "directed" at potential cardiac injury based on thoracic penetration is an important prognostic prerequisite for survival.
 Emergency room thoracotomy is not beneficial in blunt trauma and its role in penetrating abdominal injuries remains unproven.
