Bacterial translocation and its relationship to visceral blood flow, gut mucosal ornithine decarboxylase activity, and DNA in pigs.
 The relationship of bacterial translocation to gut blood flow and mucosal integrity was studied in pigs.
 Three groups of miniature pigs were studied: sham injured (controls) (n = 7), 50% mechanical reduction in blood flow to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac artery (CA) (n = 6), and a 40% third-degree cutaneous flame burn (n = 9).
 Forty-eight hours after injury, animals were killed and organ samples obtained for analysis.
 Bacteria of the same biotype as that found in the intestinal lumen were present in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of 9 of 9 burned pigs and 5 of 6 pigs undergoing partial vascular occlusion.
 The DNA content and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity were increased in the colon mucosa of animals from both the reduced-flow and burn-injured groups compared with control animals.
 Decreased blood flow to the gut may contribute to the development of bacterial translocation.
 In addition, intestinal regenerative capacity remains intact 48 hours after injury.
