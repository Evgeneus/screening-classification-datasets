Management of blow-out fractures of the orbital floor [editorial]
 The management of orbital fractures has long been controversial.
 In some cases, surgical repair is required, and early repair is more successful than secondary reconstruction.
 In other cases, slow resolution of diplopia over four to six months obviates surgery.
 In an editorial and two separate articles, the authors elucidate indications for and results of the early vs.
 late surgical repair of orbital blow-out fractures.
