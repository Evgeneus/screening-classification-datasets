Occupational asthma in a pharmaceutical worker exposed to hydralazine.
 A pharmaceutical worker developed asthma when exposed to hydralazine, an antihypertensive drug.
 The diagnosis of occupational asthma was supported by specific inhalation challenges, which produced a late asthmatic reaction and an increase in bronchial responsiveness.
 No evidence of an IgE or an IgG dependent mechanism could be found.
