A nineteen-year review of nurse-authored abstracts presented to the American Burn Association. Implications for the future.
 The previous investigations of nurse authors have impact on and provide guidance for the future paths of research endeavors.
 A review of the past 19 years of American Burn Association abstract presentations was performed to identify nurse-authored presentations and describe their nature and content.
 Nurse authors were identified on 18% of all abstracts presented and were primary authors of 7.7% of all abstracts presented.
 Those who collaborated most frequently with nurse authors were other nurses (41%) and physicians (37%).
 Descriptive studies were most frequently presented, followed first by reports and then by experimental designs.
 Fewer than one half of the reported studies possessed statistical support for their findings.
 Nurse authors are most frequently investigating issues of direct patient care, such as wound management, medications, complications, and psychosocial issues.
