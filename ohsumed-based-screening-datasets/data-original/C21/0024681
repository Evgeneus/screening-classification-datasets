Teenage heavy drinkers: alcohol-related knowledge, beliefs, experiences, motivation and the social context of drinking.
 During 1988 and 1989 a survey was conducted of the drinking habits and alcohol-related beliefs of a national sample of teenagers in England.
 Data were obtained from 6,244 respondents virtually all aged 14-16.
 Heavy drinkers were significantly more likely to report drinking in a mixed sex group than were other teenagers.
 They were also more likely than others to have drunk illegally in licensed premises, and were distinctive from other teenagers in relation to their self-reported reasons for drinking and their alcohol-related beliefs.
