Per Primam thumb replantation for all patients with traumatic amputations.
 Forty-two complete thumb replantations performed between 1980 and 1984 were reviewed.
 The mean follow-up time was 14 months.
 Replantation was attempted for all thumb amputations regardless of mechanism or severity of injury.
 Sixteen (38%) failed intraoperatively or postoperatively.
 Thumbs with narrow zones of injury showed a significantly higher survival rate than those with wide zones of injury.
 Eighty percent of those with poor arterial flow intraoperatively ultimately failed, despite pharmacologic treatment and multiple vein-graft anastomoses.
 Two thumbs with no vein repairs ultimately survived.
 Reexploration for loss of perfusion succeeded in 60% of cases.
 Total metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal active motion postoperatively averaged 68 degrees.
 Median static two-point discrimination returned to 11 mm.
 Avulsed thumbs survived in 46% of cases.
 Replantation should be attempted in all cases of thumb amputation, as success cannot be predicted by mechanism or severity of injury.
 Thumbs with poor intraoperative flow (20%) or no venous return (50%) can survive and should not be primarily amputated.
 Vein grafting is not mandatory if shortening allows anastomoses to be tension free.
 Prompt reexploration of acute vascular occlusions is worthwhile.
