Mandibular fractures in the pediatric patient.
 Seventy-three patients were admitted to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Pa) between January 1979 and June 1989 with a diagnosis of mandibular fracture.
 Data were obtained through a retrospective review of these cases.
 The cases were divided into three age groups that reflected the developing structure of the mandible and the maturation of the dentition.
 A trend toward a greater number of fractures and a predominance of males is shown with increasing age.
 Child abuse is a relatively frequent cause of fractures throughout all groups.
 Associated injuries are more common in young children, except in cases where abuse has been documented.
 The high osteogenic potential of the pediatric mandible allowed conservative management to be successful in 25% of younger patients and was responsible for a low complication rate overall.
