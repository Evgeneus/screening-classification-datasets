Spinal epidural hematoma causing cord compression after tissue plasminogen activator and heparin therapy.
 Bleeding is the most serious complication of thrombolytic therapy and limits its usefulness.
 We have reported a case of epidural hematoma, a rare occurrence after combined therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) and heparin.
 We emphasize that in patients treated with thrombolytic agents, any trauma may increase the risk of bleeding.
 The sudden onset of back pain and neurologic deficits should alert the clinician to the possibility of spinal hematoma with cord compression.
