Acute ethanol intoxication decreases the likelihood of resuscitation from cardiac arrest in rats.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Acute ethanol intoxication has been shown to depress myocardial performance in both laboratory and clinical studies.
 The present study was designed to examine the effect of acute ethanol intoxication on resuscitation of rats subjected to cardiac arrest.
 Rats were given 1.2 g ("moderately intoxicated") or 2.4 g ("highly intoxicated") of ethanol/kg, or distilled water ("nonintoxicated" rats).
 Using a standardized technique, we induced cardiac arrest.
 CPR was then attempted using chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions.
 Resuscitation was said to be successful if BP returned spontaneously within 6 mins of institution of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions, and if systolic BP was 50% of its prearrest level within 10 mins of discontinuation of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions.
 Mean +/- SD serum ethanol levels were 121.3 +/- 12.9 mg/dL (26.3 +/- 2.8 mmol/L) (moderately intoxicated rats) and 254.4 +/- 34.6 mg/dL (55.2 +/- 7.5 mmol/L) (highly intoxicated rats).
 RESULTS: Resuscitation was successful in 75% (15/20) of nonintoxicated rats, 46.7% (7/15) of moderately intoxicated rats, and 33.3% (5/15) of highly intoxicated rats.
 The difference in resuscitation rates was significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with either intoxicated rats as a group (p = .021) or highly intoxicated rats (p = .019), but was not significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with moderately intoxicated rats.
 CONCLUSION: Acute ethanol intoxication appears to decrease the likelihood of successful resuscitation in a dose-dependent fashion.
