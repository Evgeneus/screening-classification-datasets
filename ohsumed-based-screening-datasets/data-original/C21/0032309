Trauma center closure: effects on an adjacent trauma center.
 The effects of the closure of a busy trauma center on an adjacent university trauma hospital were analyzed.
 Significant increases were found in monthly volume (P less than .01) and frequency of penetrating injuries (P less than .05) and significant decreases in patients with insurance coverage (P less than .01) and numbers requiring intensive care (P less than .01).
 The authors conclude that trauma center closures have significant and measurable effects which influence allocation of scarce resources within remaining hospitals and generate pressures to transfer patients to overburdened public facilities.
 Transfers undermine continuity of care and education and further threaten the integrity of the trauma system.
