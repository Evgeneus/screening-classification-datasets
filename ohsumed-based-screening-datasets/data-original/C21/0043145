Management of suspected ocular laceration or rupture.
 The records of 95 consecutive patients with suspected ocular laceration or rupture managed by a single surgeon were reviewed.
 A total of 86 patients were found to have a laceration or rupture, of whom 79 were followed up, for an average of 6.4 months.
 In 32 eyes (40%) the final visual acuity was 20/40 or better, and in another 32 the final acuity was less than 5/200.
 Eyes with lacerations had a better visual outcome than those with rupture due to blunt trauma.
 Of the 26 eyes operated on for suspected blunt rupture 6 (23%) were found not to have a rupture.
 Ruptured eyes were more likely than nonruptured eyes to have abnormal anterior chamber depth, vision less than hand motion and hyphema.
