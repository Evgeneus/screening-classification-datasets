The wound healing curve as a practical teaching device.
 Fundamental concepts of clinical wound healing are commonly misunderstood.
 A hypothetical curve that describes the relationship between wound perfusion and risk of infection is constructed as a teaching device.
 Although many factors influence this curve, the most important are the presence of bacteria, dead space, necrotic tissue and motion.
 Subjecting the curve to clinical illustrations enhances its value as a tool for medical education.
