Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test: a comparison of conventional versus computer-administered formats.
 The equivalence of paper-and-pencil-administered and computer-administered versions of the Self-Administered Alcoholism Screening Test (SAAST) was investigated with alcoholic inpatients and nonalcoholic psychiatric outpatients.
 When the two formats were administered in counterbalanced order, total score mean differences were nonsignificant.
 In addition, mean differences on a short-form version were also nonsignificant.
 Equivalence was also determined by comparing the two formats in terms of classification agreement (i.e., classification of subjects into alcoholic and nonalcoholic categories).
 Agreement between the two formats was 95% in both the total score and short-form versions.
 Implications of these results as well as the advantages and disadvantages of using computer-administered alcoholism screening tests are discussed.
