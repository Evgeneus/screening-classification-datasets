The bactericidal power of the blood and plasma of patients with burns.
 Patients with burns are unusually susceptible to bacterial infections, but so far there is no satisfactory explanation for this lack of resistance.
 Since resistance to infection involves many different mechanisms, examination of individual components of the immune system may not sufficiently explain the underlying reasons for increased susceptibility.
 The use of whole blood for antibacterial tests has the advantage that all the immune systems present in that fluid compartment can take part in the bactericidal effect.
 Tests with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus showed no evidence that the bactericidal power of the blood and plasma of patients with burns was less than that of normal control plasma.
 This suggests that the solution to the problem of increased susceptibility to infection in patients with burns does not lie with the blood but must be looked for elsewhere.
