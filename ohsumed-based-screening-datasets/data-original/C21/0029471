Plain film of intracardiac foreign bodies: the blurring effect.
 We report two cases of gunshot wounds of the chest, in each of which a bullet was retained in the pericardial sac.
 Because the bullets appear to be out of focus, one may think they are in the cardiac chambers, but the images of bullets retained in the pericardial sac may also be blurred due to the spinning effect of the heartbeat on the bullet.
