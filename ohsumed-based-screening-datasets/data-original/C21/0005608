Replantation: an analysis of 29 teeth.
 The results of replantation of 29 teeth are described.
 Maxillary incisors constituted 85% of 27 permanent teeth.
 The period between avulsion and replantation ranged from within an hour to 86 days, but the actual extraoral period was within 5 hours in all but one case.
 Nineteen of the 27 permanent teeth were functioning for 7 months to 6 years and 7 months postoperatively.
 Root resorption was the cause of tooth loss in five cases.
 The incidence of root resorption seemed to increase with the increase of the extraoral period, but it was not affected by the period between avulsion and replantation, the condition of supporting tissues, the degree of root formation, and the type and period of splinting, indicating multiple factors involved in determining the prognosis of replanted teeth.
 In conclusion, every effort should be made to preserve avulsed teeth even in unfavorable conditions.
