Comparison of the ability of adult and pediatric trauma scores to predict pediatric outcome following major trauma.
 The Pediatric Trauma Score (PTS) has been identified as the only accurate and adequate means of predicting outcome in pediatric trauma.
 In answer to the increasing number of trauma patients arriving at local hospitals, the ability of the adult Trauma Score (TS) to predict pediatric trauma outcome was tested.
 Of the total 2,604 pediatric trauma cases in the North Carolina State Trauma Registry, 441 had both a PTS and TS available for analysis.
 The primary measures of outcome were emergency department and hospital dispositions.
 Logistic regression demonstrated that TS (R2 = 0.50) was a stronger predictor of pediatric outcome and PTS (R2 = 0.35) for emergency department disposition and TS (R2 = 0.63) with PTS (R2 = 0.51) for hospital disposition.
 The correlation between TS and PTS was high (R = 0.8).
 Stepwise discriminant analysis demonstrated that TS was the stronger predictor of outcome and the PTS added only 9% (partial R2 = 0.09) more accuracy to TS for emergency department disposition and only 6% (partial R2 = 0.06) for hospital disposition.
 The results of this research demonstrate that TS is a useful method of predicting outcome in pediatric trauma.
 The use of both scores for each patient does not increase the predictive value of the scores.
