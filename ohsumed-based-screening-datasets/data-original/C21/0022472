Displaced orbital roof fractures: presentation and treatment.
 Of 457 patients with facial fractures admitted by the plastic surgery service from 1986 to 1988 at Wayne State University, there were seven displaced orbital roof fractures in five patients.
 All presented with supraorbital rim fractures, inferior dystopia, limitation of supraduction, upper eyelid ptosis, and diplopia.
 Proptosis was present in four orbits in three patients.
 One of these patients had an orbital floor fracture.
 However, enophthalmos was present in three orbits in two patients with associated zygoma and floor fractures.
 Two patients had intracranial neurologic injuries, but no ocular injuries were seen.
 Patients underwent frontal craniotomy and removal of the supraorbital rim for exposure.
 The orbital roof was reconstructed with outer-table cranial bone grafts.
 Associated fractures were repaired.
 Mean follow-up was 21.4 months.
 In all patients, the inferior dystopia, proptosis or enophthalmos, limitation of supraduction, and diplopia were corrected.
 In one patient, residual mild eyelid ptosis was seen.
 No residual neurologic or ocular injury was seen.
