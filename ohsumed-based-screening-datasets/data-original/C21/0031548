Increased frequency of infection after open reduction of fractures in patients who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus.
 In a prospective study of 214 patients who had elective extensive operations for fractures, we compared the relative frequencies of postoperative infections in the seventeen patients who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus and had associated clinical symptoms, in the twenty-six patients who were seropositive and had no associated clinical symptoms, and in the 171 patients who were seronegative.
 The relative frequency of postoperative infection was significantly higher in patients who were seropositive and had associated clinical symptoms (four of seventeen) than in patients who were seronegative (eight of 171) (Fisher exact test, p = 0.01).
 In all patients who were seropositive and had a postoperative bacterial infection, treatment with antibiotics was effective.
 The results of this study suggest that people who are seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus and have associated symptoms are at increased risk for postoperative infection.
