Resedation after bolus administration of midazolam to an infant and its reversal by flumazenil.
 A 4-month-old infant was sedated with bolus doses of midazolam, and after initial apparent complete arousal, became unresponsive and hypotonic.
 Administration of flumazenil enabled differentiation of a residual drug effect from an intracerebral event.
