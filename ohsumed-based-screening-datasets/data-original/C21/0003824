Neurologic complications of alcoholism.
 Neurologic and myopathic complications of alcoholism are multiple and diverse, affecting both the central and peripheral nervous systems.
 In the ED, initial concern is for diagnosing readily reversible causes and ruling out possible life- or limb-threatening etiologies.
 A rapid assessment of the ABCs, a fingerstick blood glucose determination, and, in cases of AMS, the administration of intravenous naloxone is indicated.
 In almost every instance of a potential neurologic complication, intravenous thiamine replacement is indicated initially, along with the parenteral administration of folic acid and the other B vitamins, including nicotinic acid and pyridoxine.
 Metabolic screening with electrolytes, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, liver enzymes (AST, alkaline phosphatase), bilirubin, arterial blood gases with carboxyhemoglobin determination, and a complete blood count are often warranted.
 Special tests such as CT scan, CK, ammonia, or toxicologic screens are indicated in specific instances.
 In terms of physical examination, attention to the presence of focal neurologic findings is paramount because of the possibility of a subdural or epidural hematoma.
 It is important not to miss meningitis and a low threshold for treatment or lumbar puncture should be maintained.
 Specialized consultation and referral are needed only after stabilization and appropriate tests are performed.
 If an organized approach to the evaluation of an alcoholic with neurologic symptoms is undertaken, occult disease will not be missed and outcomes will be improved.
