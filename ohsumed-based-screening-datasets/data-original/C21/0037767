Use of infant walkers. Board of Trustees, American Medical Association.
 Infant walkers are used by many parents because of the convenience they provide in keeping children occupied.
 Unfortunately, parents may develop a false sense of security that leads to diminished vigilance over the safety of their infant.
 Although most injuries that result from walkers are minor, serious trauma from head injuries, lacerations, and burns does occur occasionally.
 The American Medical Association recommends that physicians counsel parents on the risk of injury that can occur from the use of infant walkers and inform parents that these devices do not either promote bipedal ambulation or offer a substitute for careful parental supervision.
