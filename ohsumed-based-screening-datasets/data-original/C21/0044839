Isolated avulsion of the popliteus tendon. A case report.
 We have reported a rare case of an isolated avulsion of the popliteus tendon.
 In this case the avulsed tendon was associated with a large osteochondral fragment that was easily relocated and fixed anatomically.
 We believe that the popliteus tendon is important to the mechanics of the knee.
 We would recommend the treatment as presented in this case should one of these rare cases be encountered.
