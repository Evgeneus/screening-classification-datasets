Neuralgic amyotrophy in association with radiation therapy for Hodgkin's disease.
 We describe 4 patients with Hodgkin's disease who developed neuralgic amyotrophy in the setting of radiation therapy.
 In contrast to tumor progression or radiation plexopathy, the symptom onset was abrupt and occurred within days to weeks of receiving radiation treatments.
 There is an association between Hodgkin's disease, radiation therapy, and neuralgic amyotrophy.
