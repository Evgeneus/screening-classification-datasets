Gunshot injuries to the hip and abdomen: the association of joint and intra-abdominal visceral injuries.
 A retrospective review of all gunshot injuries to the hip at our medical center over a 24-year period was performed.
 Adequate information and radiographs were available for 49 patients.
 Of these, five patients (10.2%) had associated abdominal visceral injuries.
 These five patients were examined at an average of 5.9 years after their injury, and compared by utilizing the Harris Hip Score rating.
 Radiographs were also obtained.
 Four of these five patients (80%) had initially developed infections in their hip joints, with all four having poor functional outcomes, with an average Harris Hip Score of 48.5 from their hip injury.
 Careful initial evaluation and aggressive surgical and antibiotic treatment are recommended to prevent these poor results.
