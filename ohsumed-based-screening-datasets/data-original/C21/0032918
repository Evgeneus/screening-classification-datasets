Microsurgical toenail transfer to the hand.
 Free nonvascularized toenail grafts have been used to reconstruct congenital or traumatic nail defects of the thumb or finger.
 Unfortunately, these transfers often result in deformity or atrophy.
 To avoid these undesirable results, microsurgical free vascularized toenail transfer was performed in 10 patients, 3 for congenital nail absence and 7 for traumatic nail defects.
 Patient age averaged 17 years (range 2 to 32 years).
 In contrast with previous reports, the whole big or second toenail complex without pulp was used in reconstruction.
 All 10 nails were successfully transferred with complete survival.
 No digits required reexploration.
 There were no donor- or recipient-site problems.
 Follow-up averaged 3 years, with a range of 14 months to 5 years and 4 months.
 Appropriate nail growth occurred in the congenital patients.
 No atrophy of the nail complex was found as long as sufficient bony support was present (9 of 10 cases).
 Whole free vascularized toenail transfers for reconstruction of congenital and traumatic nailbed defects achieve excellent aesthetic results while maintaining normal hand function.
