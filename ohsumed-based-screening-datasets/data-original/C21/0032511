Infections transmitted by large and small laboratory animals.
 Although zoonotic spread of infectious disease continues to occur in laboratory animals used in biomedical research, reported outbreaks have been minimized with the advent of rigorous veterinary and husbandry procedures, the use of commercially reared animals, and the institution of appropriate personnel health programs.
 Maintaining animals in modern facilities with appropriate safeguards against introduction of vermin and biologic vectors is also important in preventing zoonotic disease in personnel.
 Nevertheless, established zoonotic agents, newly discovered microorganisms, or new animal species not previously recognized as carriers of zoonotic microorganisms are encountered, and the potential for spread of infectious disease from animals to humans still exists.
 Active dialogue between veterinarians and physicians regarding the potential of zoonotic disease, the species of animals that are involved, and the methods of diagnosis, is an indispensable component of a successful preventive health program involving personnel who deal with laboratory animals.
