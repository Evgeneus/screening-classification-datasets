Acamprosate appears to decrease alcohol intake in weaned alcoholics.
 Five hundred and sixty-nine alcoholics were included in a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized multicenter study of the effects of Acamprosate (calcium acetylhomotaurinate (CA), 1.3 g/day) on indicators of alcoholic relapse after withdrawal.
 One hundred and eighty-one patients in the CA group versus 175 in the placebo group completed the three-month study.
 The major efficacy criterion was plasma gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), as an indicator of recent alcohol ingestion.
 This analysis was completed by criteria concordance analysis on a number of indicators of alcohol intake.
 Patients in both groups were similar initially.
 After 3 months of treatment, the patients in the CA group had significantly lower GGT (1.4 +/- 1.56 versus 2.0 +/- 3.19 times normal, P = 0.016).
 All significant differences (P less than 0.05) or trends (0.10 greater than P greater than 0.05) were in favor of a superior effect of CA over placebo.
 The major side-effect of CA was diarrhea (present in 13% of CA patients versus 7% of placebo, P = 0.04).
 CA proved superior to placebo on the evolution of markers of alcohol ingestion at three months, in this large-scale multicenter study.
 It could be a new modality in the drug therapy of alcoholism, not involving an antabuse effect, an antidepressant action, or conditioning.
