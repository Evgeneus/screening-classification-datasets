Nosocomial measles infection in a pediatric hospital during a community-wide epidemic.
 From Jan.
 1, 1988, through Dec.
 31, 1988, a total of 89 cases of measles were observed at Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, and 37 patients were admitted to the hospital.
 Of the 37 patients, six were not initially thought to have measles, which resulted in exposure of 107 patients and 24 personnel.
 Of the exposed patients, measles developed in four.
 One nosocomially infected infant died of pneumonia.
 Another exposed patient was subsequently admitted to another hospital with unrecognized measles, which led to exposure of an additional eight patients.
 Of seven employees in whom measles developed, two required hospitalization because of pneumonia.
 Two hundred eleven employee days were lost because of measles exposure or infection.
 Infection control interventions included prophylaxis of exposed patients, employee education, and measles immunization for susceptible personnel.
 Of 1103 hospital personnel considered susceptible to measles, 800 received monovalent measles vaccine.
 No secondary cases of measles occurred in hospital personnel who received appropriate prophylaxis.
 We conclude that infection control programs aimed at mandating measles immunity in hospital employees at risk should be instituted.
