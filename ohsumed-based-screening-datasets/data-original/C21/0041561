Serum beta-hexosaminidase isoenzyme: a sensitive marker for alcohol abuse.
 Serum beta-hexosaminidase (Hex) isoenzymes analyzed by enzyme immunoassay were investigated in a group of alcoholics (n = 38) hospitalized for detoxication, in another group of alcoholics (n = 22) abstinent between 6 days and 10 years and in a reference group (n = 20).
 Hex "B" isoenzyme was elevated in all 38 patients hospitalized for detoxication but only 35 of these had total Hex values above the upper limit of the reference group.
 The Hex A isoenzyme, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase showed considerable overlap between these patients and the reference group.
 In the group of 22 abstinent patients only one had an increased level of Hex A, Hex "B," and total Hex, whereas 10 had gamma-glutamyltransferase values above the upper limit of the reference group.
 It is concluded that Hex "B" is a useful marker for alcohol abuse.
