Traumatic asphyxia.
 During a 5-year period, we treated 14 cases of traumatic asphyxia.
 There were 12 male and 2 female patients ranging in age from 2 to 32 years.
 Most suffered crushing injuries at work or were run over by motor vehicles.
 Mild to severe cervicofacial cyanosis and petechiae developed in all patients.
 A fear response was reported by 12 of the patients.
 Subconjunctival hemorrhage was also found in 12 patients.
 Nine patients had tachypnea and 7 complained of dyspnea.
 Most of the patients suffered some associated injuries including 8 head injuries, 7 pulmonary contusions, and 6 cases of blunt abdominal trauma.
 Less-associated injuries were rib fractures, brachial and radial nerve injuries, hemothorax, and pneumothorax.
 The hospital stay ranged from 4 to 28 days (mean, 14 days) and follow-up from 10 to 60 months (mean, 32 months).
 Treatment for traumatic asphyxia included measurement of arterial blood gases, oxygen supplementation, and intubation with mechanical ventilation.
 The patients' recovery conditions were relative to the severity of injury and the associated injuries.
