Standard v lightweight wheelchair propulsion in spinal cord injured patients.
 Twenty-six male SCI subjects (six quadriplegics, eight "high paraplegics," and 12 "low paraplegics") propelled both standard and lightweight wheelchairs at a "sprint pace" (Sp) for 400 feet, and at a "duration pace" (Du) for four continuous minutes.
 Pulse, blood pressure and respirations were measured before and after each trial, and V was calculated.
 Appropriate training and rest periods were given; order of wheelchair testing was randomized.
 A questionnaire was later administered.
 Variations in pulse, systolic blood pressure, and respirations were significant between myelopathic levels (P less than 0.01), but were not affected by the type of wheelchair used.
 Quadriplegic V was less (P less than 0.01) than that of either paraplegic group for Sp and Du trials; for Sp, lightweight wheelchair V is faster (P less than 0.01) than standard wheelchair V for all groups.
