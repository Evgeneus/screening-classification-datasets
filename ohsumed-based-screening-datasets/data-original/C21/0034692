Spinal trauma.
 Spinal trauma is classified according to the mechanism of injury and the presence or absence of stability.
 A variety of imaging modalities, including radiography, conventional tomography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging are available for assessment of the injured spine.
 This article discusses the role of these various methods in evaluating osseous, ligamentous, and neural damage.
 Common injuries are described at the upper and lower cervical, thoracic, and thoracolumbar regions.
