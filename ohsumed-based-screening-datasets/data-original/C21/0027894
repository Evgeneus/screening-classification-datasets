Autogenous vein graft repair of injured extremity arteries: early and late results with 134 consecutive patients.
 Autogenous vein tissue is recognized as the preferred material for extremity revascularizations that require the use of a conduit.
 However, the results after vascular repair of injured extremity arteries with autogenous vein interposition or bypass grafts have not been well defined.
 This study was done to determine both the early and late patency and limb salvage rates as well as the graft infection rate of autogenous vein repairs of injured extremity arteries.
 The records of 134 consecutive patients with acute extremity arterial injuries requiring repair with a reversed autogenous vein graft over a recent 5-year period were reviewed.
 Follow-up graft patency was defined by the presence of a palpable pulse and an extremity Doppler-derived pressure index of greater than or equal to 0.9 distal to the arterial repair.
 Cumulative patency was assessed by the life-table method.
 Acute graft thrombosis occurred in two patients, one of whom underwent successful graft thrombectomy.
 Four patients (3%) required extremity amputation: one patient with a thrombosed vein graft and three patients with patent vein grafts but nonsalvageable limbs as a result of myonecrosis (2) or osteomyelitis (1).
 No perioperative graft infections occurred.
 One hundred twenty-eight patients (97%) had an intact extremity and a patent vein graft at the time of hospital discharge.
 One hundred three patients (80%) were examined at 30 days, and all grafts were patent.
 Seventy-three patients (57%) were available for follow-up at intervals exceeding 6 months, and 40 patients (31%) were followed-up for periods exceeding 24 months.
