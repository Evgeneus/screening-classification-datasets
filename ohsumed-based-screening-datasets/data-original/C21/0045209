Providing cost efficient detoxification services to alcoholic patients.
 The literature was reviewed to determine whether social model detoxification programs are safe and adequate for treating persons with alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
 The alcohol withdrawal syndrome has three stages.
 Each stage, more severe than the last, is reached by a smaller percentage of those withdrawing from alcohol.
 The literature showed that the majority of alcoholics can be detoxified safely in social model programs.
 These programs presented two main benefits, program cost efficiency and the patients' increased commitment to treatment compared with those treated at medical model programs.
 Medically operated detoxification programs appeared necessary for patients with a severe withdrawal condition at intake (abnormal blood pressure and pulse) and those with a history of severe withdrawal symptomatology.
 The results of the review reiterated the importance of screening clients at intake to ensure the safety of the patient and the appropriateness of the detoxification program.
