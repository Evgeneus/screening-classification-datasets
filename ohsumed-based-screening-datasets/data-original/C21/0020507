Class C firework injuries in a pediatric population.
 Class C fireworks are those which can be readily purchased by the public.
 Between July 1971 and August 1988, 23 patients were admitted to our institution with firework injuries.
 Fourteen patients (60.9%) sustained injuries related to Class C fireworks.
 All patients were males with a mean age of 9.0 +/- 3.6 years, with a total body surface area (TBSA) burn of 18 +/- 20% with 10 +/- 15% being full thickness.
 Thirteen of the 14 patients required hospitalization.
 Five patients were admitted acutely and eight patients were referred to our institution at least 3 days postinjury.
 All patients required operative intervention in order to obtain wound closure.
 Patients admitted acutely showed a decrease in length of hospital stay and patient morbidity when compared to referral patients.
 Our data suggest that class C firework injuries, although small in terms of TBSA burned, result in full-thickness wounds that warrant aggressive surgical management.
