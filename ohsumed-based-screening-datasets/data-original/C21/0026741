Serial casting as a technique to correct burn scar contractures. A case report.
 Serial casting is a fast, relatively simple, and inexpensive way to effectively correct burn scar contractures.
 Plaster casts provide circumferential pressure and a prolonged stretch to contracted tissue and cannot be removed by the patient.
 When casts are applied well and padded appropriately, there is little risk of pressure areas, since the casts are conforming and do not slip distally.
 Serial casting may be a successful alternative when low-force dynamic splinting cannot be sized small enough for a child, or when patient compliance is unreliable.
 A case study of a 2-year-old male patient with severe plantar-flexion contractures of the ankles is presented.
