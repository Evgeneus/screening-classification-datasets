The morbidity of long-term seizure monitoring using subdural strip electrodes.
 The authors report a prospective study of morbidity associated with long-term seizure monitoring using subdural strip electrodes.
 Three hundred fifty patients were divided into two groups: 175 patients received antibiotics intravenously during the entire period that the electrodes were implanted, and 175 patients received one dose of antibiotics on the morning of surgery.
 In the group given continuous antibiotic coverage there were two cases of meningitis, both treated without sequelae.
 In the group receiving one dose of antibiotics, one patient had a brain abscess and three had superficial wound infections.
 There were no other instances of major morbidity or mortality in either group of patients.
 The total morbidity rate for both serious and minor complications was 0.85%.
