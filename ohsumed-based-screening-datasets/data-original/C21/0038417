County data on alcohol-related mortality--United States.
 Although estimates of alcohol-related mortality (ARM) have been determined for the United States and selected states, the magnitude of ARM ahs not been well defined for smaller geographic areas.
 To provide additional geographically specific data, the Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism recently released a reference manual for ARM in U.S.
 counties (County Alcohol Problem Indicators).
 The manual provides information for 3107 counties for 1979-1985 using both underlying and multiple cause-of-death information.
 This report summarizes data sources, methods, and applications for the manual.
