Interleukin-6 and its relation to the humoral immune response and clinical parameters in burned patients.
 The cytokine interleukin-6, which has been shown to be increased in patients with burn injuries, is produced by activated monocytes and endothelial cells and has many in vitro activities, including stimulation of acute-phase protein synthesis in hepatocytes, immunoglobulin synthesis in B lymphocytes, and stimulation of growth of megakaryocytes.
 In 13 patients with a mean of 31% full-thickness burns, we studied the relation of serum interleukin-6 to clinical parameters and parameters of the acute-phase response and immunoglobulin production.
 Interleukin-6 was already elevated within hours after the injury was sustained, and it remained elevated for several weeks.
 All components of the acute-phase response were observed: fever, tachycardia, leukocytosis with an associated left shift, elevation of C-reactive protein and alpha 1-antitrypsin, and a decrease in albumin levels.
 In the second week after burn injury, immunoglobulin M levels peaked, followed by a prolonged elevation of immunoglobulin G levels.
 Thrombocyte counts initially decreased and rebounded to supranormal levels after 2 weeks.
 Interleukin-6 levels were positively correlated with acute-phase responses.
 We believe that the production of interleukin-6 induces the synthesis of acute-phase proteins.
 High interleukin-6 levels may also be an etiologic factor in the marked immunoglobulin response observed.
 Likewise, the relation between the megakaryocyte-promoting activity of interleukin-6 and the rebound thrombocytosis requires further investigation.
