The sexual relationship of male alcoholics and their female partners during periods of drinking and abstinence.
 The quality of the sexual relationship between alcoholic male veterans admitted to an alcohol treatment program and their stable nonalcoholic female partners was assessed in relation to time intervals of abstinence and drinking.
 Repeated measures analyses performed on the LoPiccolo Sexual History Form provided information on sexual problems associated with the desire, arousal and orgasm phases of the sexual response cycle and other kinds of information relevant to sexual functioning.
 Results indicate that the sexual relationship varies in relation to drinking or abstinence.
 Sexual intimacy appears quite normal and satisfactory during abstinent periods; however, female partners present an internally consistent picture of neither desiring nor enjoying sex during drinking periods, though accepting sex reluctantly.
 For male alcoholics, satisfaction with sex while drinking continues to be reported despite awareness of their partner's negative emotional reactions during sex.
 Clinicians and researchers are cautioned to differentiate drinking and abstinent periods when assessing the sexual relationship of alcoholic couples.
