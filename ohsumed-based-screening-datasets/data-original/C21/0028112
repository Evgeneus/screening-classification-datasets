The Syracuse I-plate.
 The Syracuse I-Plate is a versatile neutralization plate for anterior spinal fixation following decompression for burst fractures and pathologic vertebral body destruction by tumor.
 In this article, the history, current use, and indications are discussed.
 The anterior approach and application of the I-plate to the lower thoracic and lumbar spine is presented, as well as a brief summary of a current clinical series of 34 patients.
 Fusion rates were high and hardware failure most frequent in patients with associated osteoporosis or extensive posterior disruption, such that the device was contraindicated in cases of extensive three-column injuries or significantly osteoporotic bone.
