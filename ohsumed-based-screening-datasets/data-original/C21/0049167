Gastrostomy tube transmigration: a rare cause of small bowel obstruction.
 A 77-year-old woman with an indwelling gastrostomy tube presented with a clinical picture of pneumonia and small bowel obstruction.
 During gastrostomy closure and performance of a feeding jejunostomy, inadvertent transmigration of the gastrostomy tube was found to be the etiology of the small intestinal obstruction.
 This case illustrates a rare complication of enteric feeding tubes.
