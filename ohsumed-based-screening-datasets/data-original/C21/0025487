Abnormal low density lipoproteins composition in some chronic alcoholics: a possible mechanism.
 Decreased plasma low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apo B) levels are observed in heavy alcohol drinkers.
 LDL composition was determined in 16 alcohol addicts immediately after a period of alcohol abuse.
 Cholesterol to apo B ratio in the LDL fraction was significantly higher in the alcoholic group when compared with controls.
 In half of them the ratio exceeded 1.75.
 LDL subfractionation showed that in all subjects with atypically high LDL cholesterol to apolipoprotein B ratio, most of the LDL was in the form of a light subfraction.
 Acetylation in vitro showed that the heavy LDL subfraction was modified to a greater extent than the light subfraction.
 This suggests that the low apo B levels often observed after heavy drinking may arise from enhanced removal of the heavy LDL subfraction from the bloodstream.
