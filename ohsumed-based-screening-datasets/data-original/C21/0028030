Truncation artifact: a potential pitfall in MR imaging of the menisci of the knee.
 Because truncation artifacts on magnetic resonance (MR) images may be confused with meniscal tears, measures to suppress them were investigated in a human cadaver knee and prospective and retrospective studies of patients.
 The artifacts were most prominent when the acquisition matrix was 128 x 256 and the 128-pixel (phase-encoded) axis was in a superoinferior (SI) orientation.
 An anteroposterior (AP) orientation of the 128-pixel axis or use of a 256 x 256 acquisition matrix reduced the prominence of or nearly eliminated the artifacts.
 A review of reports of MR imaging and arthroscopic examinations of 83 knees yielded eight menisci that were falsely interpreted at MR imaging as having tears.
 Retrospective review of the images suggested that the errors were due to truncation artifacts in two cases.
 Truncation artifacts will cause relatively little difficulty if diagnostic observers are aware of their characteristics and simple steps are taken to minimize their prominence, including acquiring images in 192 x 256 or 256 x 256 matrices or AP rather than SI orientation of the phase-encoded (128-pixel) axis of 128 x 256 matrices.
