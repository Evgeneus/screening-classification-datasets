Fatty acids in human platelets and plasma. Fish oils decrease sensitivity toward N2 microbubbles.
 Platelet aggregation induced by N2 microbubbles (simulating microbubbles developed during deep diving) was measured in seven volunteers before and after intake of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (-EPA, 3.5 g/day) and ethyl-docosahexaenoate (-DHA, 2.5 g/day) for 2 wk.
 The relative content of arachidonic acid (AA) decreased in platelets from all individuals, whereas the content of EPA and DHA increased.
 The decrease of AA was almost identical with the increase of EPA plus DHA.
 In plasma the AA content was unchanged, while EPA and DHA increased.
 The N2 microbubble-induced aggregation showed a significant negative correlation with the DHA content both in platelets and in plasma.
 Less aggregation was also observed with high EPA content in platelets or plasma.
 A significant correlation between AA content in platelets and aggregation was seen.
 Intake of marine oils may be beneficial to divers under deep diving and to patients during extracorporeal circulation, because this may reduce the microbubble-induced aggregation.
