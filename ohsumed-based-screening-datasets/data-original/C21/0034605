Preventing death after traumatic rupture of the aorta. A chest film may help save a life.
 Traumatic rupture of the aorta is a life-threatening injury that necessitates immediate diagnosis and surgical repair.
 Diagnosis depends on recognition of findings on a plain chest film, specifically, mediastinal widening, left hemothorax, and an apical cap sign.
 Aortography should be done immediately to establish the diagnosis when clinical and/or radiographic findings suggest a rupture.
