Prevention of sports-related eye injury.
 Sports-related eye injury is an important cause of vision loss.
 Many eye injuries can be prevented through the supervision of play, the enforcement of game rules and the use of eye protective devices.
 State-of-the-art eye protective devices incorporate highly impact-resistant optical material, usually polycarbonate lenses, in a sturdy frame.
 Protective devices are available for use in racquet sports, baseball, basketball, football, ice hockey and other sports.
