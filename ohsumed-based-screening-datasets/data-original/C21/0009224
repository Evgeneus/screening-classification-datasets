Arterial abnormalities of the hand in athletes.
 Vascular lesions of the hand may be seen in athletes exposed to repetitive blunt trauma.
 Thirteen athletes seen from 1983 to 1988 experienced symptoms related to hand ischemia.
 Nine were professional baseball catchers.
 The majority of patients complained of chronic symptoms, including cold hypersensitivity (four patients), finger numbness (one), finger coolness (three), and finger blanching (three).
 Two patients had acute symptoms with sudden posttraumatic hand ischemia with finger and palmar pain.
 Diagnosis was established by history and physical examination and confirmed by noninvasive testing.
 Testing included use of Doppler examination and cold tolerance examination with thermistors.
 Two athletes required angiographic evaluation because of severe ischemia and continuous pain.
 All patients in this group were managed nonoperatively.
 Those with chronic complaints were counseled regarding cold avoidance and instructed to increase their glove padding.
 The two patients with acute symptoms required vasodilator (papaverine chloride) infusion, followed by intravenous heparin and dextran.
 All baseball catchers returned to their sport with dissipation of symptoms.
