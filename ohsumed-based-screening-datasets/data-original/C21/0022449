Alcoholism. Are you missing the diagnosis?
 Early diagnosis of alcoholism requires exploration of the impact of alcohol on the patient's life.
 The disease cannot be readily detected simply by asking questions about the quantity of alcohol consumed.
 Few physical findings are present until late in the disease, and laboratory tests for alcoholism are neither sensitive nor specific when used alone.
 Use of screening questionnaires should be part of routine office practice.
 Elderly alcoholics are difficult to identify and need special consideration.
 Effective therapy is available if alcoholism is detected early.
