Ureteroscopic retrieval of proximally located ureteral stents.
 Indwelling self-retaining ureteral stents are important for the maintenance of urinary drainage in the ureter threatened by obstruction by neoplasm, edema, or calculus.
 Proximal migration of the stent into the ureter prevents simple cystoscopic retrieval and necessitates removal by other techniques.
 In this series both rigid and flexible ureteroscopes were used to remove stents from locations ranging from the renal pelvis to the distal ureter in 16 patients.
 Three-pronged wire graspers was the retrieval instrument most frequently used.
 Stents were removed in all patients without complication.
 Ureteroscopy provides the most convenient and least invasive technique for removing stents proximally located in the upper urinary system.
