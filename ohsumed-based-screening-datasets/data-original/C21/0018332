Poisoning with equine phenylbutazone in a racetrack worker.
 Phenylbutazone is a potent nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory drug often used by veterinarians to treat racetrack animals.
 Its use in human beings is limited because of significant adverse effects and the availability of newer, safer drugs.
 We report the case of a 24-year-old man who ingested 17 g of equine phenylbutazone over a 24-hour period to treat the pain of a toothache.
 He developed grand mal seizures, coma, hypotension, respiratory and renal failure, and hepatic injury.
 Serum phenylbutazone concentration obtained approximately eight hours after presentation was 900 micrograms/mL.
 The patient recovered during six weeks of intensive supportive care and repeated hemodialysis.
