Value of magnetic resonance imaging in spontaneous extradural spinal hematoma due to vascular malformation: case report.
 A case of spinal cord compression due to spontaneous extradural spinal hematoma is reported.
 A spinal arteriovenous malformation was suspected on the basis of magnetic resonance imaging.
 Early surgical exploration allowed a complete neurological recovery.
 The vascular malformation was histopathologically confirmed.
 The role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of acute spinal cord compression syndromes is stressed.
