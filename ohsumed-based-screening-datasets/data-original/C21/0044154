Evaluation of the traveler. An introduction to emporiatrics for the emergency physician.
 Travel medicine, or emporiatrics, presents an additional challenge to the practicing emergency physician.
 In this time of increased travel for business and pleasure, travel history should become a routine part of patient evaluation.
 While the emergency physician may not need to become facile with specific details concerning immunizations and prophylaxis, he or she should have a good working knowledge of these in order to provide the potential traveler with some basic information and to be able to adequately evaluate the returned traveler who becomes ill and seeks care.
 Air travel allows many travelers to arrive back in the United States before manifesting symptoms and signs of illness acquired abroad.
 Many of these illnesses are not usually found in the United States.
 Late diagnosis of certain illnesses, such as falciparum malaria, may increase the morbidity and mortality.
 As such, travel history should become a routine part of patient evaluation, and the physician should have a good working knowledge of illnesses that may be acquired abroad.
