Histomorphometric study of trabecular bone remodeling during condylar process fracture healing in the growing period: experimental study.
 Trabecular bone remodeling during condylar fracture healing in the growing period was analyzed by histomorphometry with a synchronous system.
 Data from the study showed displacement of the fractured condyle was compensated by the changes in remodeling ascribed to the pubertal spurt of growth, and that such remodeling still continued even after clinical healing.
 The regional acceleratory phenomenon, evolved to potentiate tissue healing, was observed 1 week after induction of the fracture.
 Mesenchymal cells were presumably modulated into chondroblasts that promoted endochondral ossification.
 It was concluded that trabecular bone remodeling plays an important role in healing of condylar fractures during the growth period.
