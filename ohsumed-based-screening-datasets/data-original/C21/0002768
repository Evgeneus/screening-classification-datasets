Treatment of moderate-to-severe hypothermia in an urban setting.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: To study the treatment of moderate-to-severe hypothermia using a combination of core rewarming techniques.
 DESIGN: A prospective study.
 SETTING: The emergency department of an urban, community hospital.
 TYPE OF PATIENTS: Sixteen patients who presented with accidental hypothermia with a core temperature of less than 32 C.
 INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated with warmed IV fluids either through central or peripheral IV lines and heated aerosol masks.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients had a mean rewarming rate of 1.16 C/hr; all survived.
 The majority were chronic alcoholic patients who presented with multiple medical conditions that required hospitalization.
 CONCLUSION: All patients recovered with this method of core rewarming.
