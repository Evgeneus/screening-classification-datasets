Impedance measurement in divers during a scuba-diving training programme.
 An assessment of the strain on the tympanic membrane caused by diving was performed using impedance measurement of the middle ear in 21 untrained young men going through a scuba-diving training programme (scuba, self-contained under-water breathing apparatus).
 Tympanometry was carried out just before and after diving.
 The divers made 104 dives between them (median 5 each, range 2-7) at depths from 2 to 12 m (median 6 m).
 The results showed a significant increase in middle ear compliance on diving.
 The increase in compliance was significant at different depths, was transient, and fell to the initial level between the dives.
 We conclude that the strain exerted on the tympanic membrane and middle ear from barotrauma due to diving results in a reversible impairment of the recoiling capacity of the elastic fibrils of the tympanic membrane.
 This transient increase in compliance, we think, is the first measurable change in elasticity of the tympanic membrane.
 If barotrauma continue the changes could be irreversible.
