Diagnosis and treatment of shoulder injuries in the athlete.
 The goal of the treatment team dealing with patients who have sports-related shoulder injuries is to return them to their previous activity.
 There is no substitute for knowledge of anatomy, diagnosis modalities, or current treatments.
 Realistically, some of the athletes are not able to return to the level of competition they performed originally.
 For those patients, recommendations and suggestions for alternatives based on a sound knowledge of arthroscopic principles need to be considered.
 One of the greatest roles for the nurse treating these patients may be the temporary loan of her shoulder for them to lean on.
