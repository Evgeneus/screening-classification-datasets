Axial movement and tibial fractures. A controlled randomised trial of treatment.
 Diaphyseal fractures of the tibia in 80 patients were treated by external skeletal fixation using a unilateral frame, either in a fixed mode or in a mode which allowed the application of a small amount of predominantly axial micromovement.
 Patients were allocated to each regime by random selection.
 Fracture healing was assessed clinically, radiologically and by measurement of the mechanical stiffness of the fracture.
 Both clinical and mechanical healing were enhanced in the group subjected to micromovement, compared to those treated with frames in a fixed mode possessing an overall stiffness similar to that of others in common clinical use.
 The differences in healing time were statistically significant and independently related to the treatment method.
 There was no difference in complication rates between treatment groups.
