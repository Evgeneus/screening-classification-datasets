AIDS-related knowledge and behaviors among teenagers--Italy, 1990.
 As of December 31, 1990, the number of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases in Italy exceeded 8000.
 Although 67% of AIDS cases in Italy occurred among intravenous (IV)-drug users, the role of transmission through heterosexual contact with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons has increased, accounting for 7% of cases in 1990, compared with 2% in 1985.
 As part of an AIDS epidemiology course in Frascati for regional AIDS epidemiologists (approximately 20 km [13 miles] south of Rome) in November 1990, course participants surveyed AIDS-related knowledge and behaviors among students attending the five high schools in the local school district.
 This report summarizes findings of the survey, which aimed to characterize AIDS-related knowledge and behaviors of this population.
