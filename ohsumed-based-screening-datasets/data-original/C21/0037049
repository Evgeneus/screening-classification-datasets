Pituitary gonadal functioning in male alcoholics in an Indian psychiatric hospital.
 Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone and hepatic functions were measured in 38 male alcoholics and in 24 male control subjects.
 Significant elevation of serum LH and a trend of low serum testosterone were noted with scant evidence of advanced liver disease.
 None of the alcoholics had clinical stigmata of hypogonadism and feminization.
