Rational use of antibiotics in the critically ill patient.
 Despite the advent of newer broad-spectrum antibiotics, infection in critically ill patients still is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
 For these patients, who frequently receive inappropriate and excessive empiric antibiotic therapy, it is important to develop rational drug usage criteria.
 Current economic forces, including personnel shortages and the effects of diagnosis-related groups, are also a critical factor in this patient population.
 Criteria for rational antibiotic selection are based on patterns of infection and knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of individual antibiotics.
 The development and use of treatment protocols, or algorithms, will provide quality patient care for the lowest overall cost.
