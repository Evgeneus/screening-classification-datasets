A study of function and residual joint stiffness after functional bracing of tibial shaft fractures.
 Ninety-eight diaphyseal tibial fractures were treated with custom made functional braces in 97 patients older than 14 years of age.
 The average follow-up period was 1.86 years, and 53 patients had more than two years' evaluation (average, 2.83 years).
 The majority of the patients did not have full range of movement in the ankle and subtalar joints when the brace was removed after fracture healing.
 Although the stiffness decreased with time, a significant number of patients were left with residual joint stiffness.
 At an average follow-up period of 1.86 years, 68.4% of the patients had normal ankle motion and 60% had normal inversion and eversion of the hindfoot.
 In patients with more than two years' evaluation, 75.5% had normal ankle movement and 71.1% had normal inversion and eversion of the foot.
 In the knee joint, the incidence of residual joint stiffness was small and the amount of stiffness was clinically insignificant.
 Patients with an abnormal walking pattern after fracture healing had a high incidence of ankle and subtalar joint stiffness.
