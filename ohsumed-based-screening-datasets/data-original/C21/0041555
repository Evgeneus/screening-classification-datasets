Individual mood profiles in alcohol withdrawal.
 Daily self-reports of moods, using a Swedish Mood Adjective Check List with six bipolar dimensions, were performed in patients with alcohol dependence.
 One group (n = 13), consisting of inpatients in late withdrawal at a home for addicts, was studied for 6 weeks; another group (n = 12), consisting of outpatients in full remission, was studied for 1 week.
 The results of the ratings on the check-list were used to test a statistical model for its capacity to describe the individual courses of mood states during the recovery process.
 Time Series Analysis revealed that the individual courses of moods fitted an autoregressive statistical model and could thereby be summarized in numerical measures for individual baselines, amplitudes, and lengths of recovery.
 Such individual profiles of the alcohol recovery process, may be useful for both clinical and research purposes, making it possible, for instance, to predict points in time for an individual's recovery with respect to his total well-being, as well as the various dimensions of his mood states.
