Full-thickness rotator-cuff tear. An analysis of results.
 A retrospective review is reported on 68 patients with 72 full-thickness rotator-cuff tears treated surgically.
 Duration of symptoms before surgery averaged 18 months (range, one month to ten years).
 Tears of the rotator cuff were divided into small (12 shoulders), medium (26 shoulders), large (17 shoulders), and massive (17 shoulders).
 Rotator-cuff tears were repaired by use of a bony trough in 88% of patients.
 All patients were treated with decompression acromioplasty.
 In addition, an acromioclavicular arthroplasty was performed in 29 patients.
 Forty-seven men and 21 women with an average age of 58 years (range, 31-76 years) were followed for an average of 24 months (range, nine to 57 months).
 Excellent results are reported in 46 shoulders, good in 20, fair in four, and poor in two.
 The size of tear and duration of symptoms did not significantly affect results.
