Bone disorder in men with chronic alcoholism: a reversible disease?
 Disturbances in bone metabolism and histology have been recognized in chronic alcoholism.
 It has not been established whether they are reversible and the cause remains unclear.
 We studied various serum and urine variables (including serum PTH, calcium, D-vitamins, and osteocalcin concentrations), bone mineral content, and bone histomorphometrics in men who at present abused alcohol and compared the results to those from men who previously had abused alcohol but who had abstained from alcohol for at least 2 yr and from normal men.
 No significant differences were found in bone mineral content at the two measuring sites (distal forearm, lumbar spine) between drinkers, abstainers, and controls though a considerable proportion of both current drinkers and abstainers had subnormal values.
 Bone formation rate and turnover (expressed by the activation frequency) was significantly reduced in the current drinkers who also had lower serum PTH, 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, and osteocalcin concentrations.
 Men who had abstained from alcohol consumption for at least 2 yr had results similar to those from normal men, suggesting that the disturbances in bone metabolism in men abusing alcohol are reversible.
 The decrease in bone turnover in the drinkers may be explained by the observed reduction in plasma PTH concentration or a direct toxic effect of ethanol on bone tissue leading to a deficient recruitment of osteogenic cells.
