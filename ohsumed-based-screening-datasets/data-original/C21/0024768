Major trauma: a district general hospital experience.
 A retrospective review of all patients with major trauma admitted to a busy suburban district hospital was conducted over a 1-year period.
 Outcome for each patient was assessed using the TRISS system which calculates the probability of survival based on anatomical extent of injury and degree of physiological disturbance at the time of admission.
 Thirty-nine patients were admitted following major trauma, of whom nine died.
 Seven of the deaths were in patients with a greater than 50 per cent chance of survival according to the TRISS system.
 In contrast, four patients survived who had a greater than 50 per cent chance of death.
 Details of these 11 cases are given.
 The numbers of patients who were referred to neurosurgeons and cardiothoracic surgeons in regional specialist centres were recorded, as was the relative contribution of general and orthopaedic surgeons in our own hospital.
 We conclude that, in the absence of specialized trauma centres, a reasonable standard of care for patients who have sustained major trauma can be delivered in a district general hospital.
