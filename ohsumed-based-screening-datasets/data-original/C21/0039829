Posterior cruciate ligament injuries.
 PCL reconstruction is not often necessary.
 Arthroscopic techniques using autograft or allograft substitution for the PCL probably bear more physiologic and anatomic likeness to the normal ligament than to tissue transfers posteriorly.
 The arthroscopic procedure is exacting and technically demanding.
 It is advisable to supplement the PCL reconstruction with an appropriate capsulorrhaphy when the posterior capsule, arcuate complex, or oblique popliteal ligament are also injured.
 In combined cruciate injuries, PCL reconstruction is notably easier when staged before reconstruction of the ACL.
