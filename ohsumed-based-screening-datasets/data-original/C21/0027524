Penetrating cardiac injuries.
 One hundred nine penetrating cardiac injuries were reviewed: 49 gunshot wounds and 60 stab wounds.
 They were classified into four groups: group 1 (lifeless), 38; group 2 (agonal), 16; group 3 (shock), 33; and group 4 (stable), 22.
 Thirty-six patients in group 1 (94%) and 8 of 16 patients in group 2 (50%) underwent emergency room thoracotomy; 24 of 33 in group 3 (73%) and 20 of 22 (90%) underwent thoracotomy in the operating room.
 Twenty-one (38%) of 55 patients undergoing emergency room thoracotomy survived, whereas 47 (87%) of 54 patients undergoing operating room thoracotomy survived.
 Survival was 12 of 38 (31%) in group 1, 11 of 16 (69%) in group 2, 26 of 33 (79%) in group 3, and 18 of 22 (82%) in group 4 with an overall survival of 67 of 109 (61%).
 Gunshot wounds of the heart portend a worse prognosis than stab wounds.
 Survival of gunshot wounds was 20 of 49 (40%) compared with 47 survivors of 60 stab wounds (78%).
 Aggressive treatment, including emergency room thoracotomy, is justified for lifeless and deteriorating cardiac injury victims.
