Wound infection due to fresh water contamination by Aeromonas hydrophila.
 We report the case of a 24-year-old man who sustained a scalp laceration in a diving accident.
 His wound became infected, and he was treated with an oral cephalosporin, with subsequent progression of the infection.
 Cultures subsequently grew Aeromonas hydrophila.
 Many strains of Aeromonas are not sensitive to the antibiotics commonly used for wound infections.
 Aeromonas must be suspected as a pathogen in all wounds occurring in fresh water if proper treatment is to be initiated.
