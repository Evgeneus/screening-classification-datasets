Complications of lateral C1-2 puncture myelography.
 This study reviewed the technical complication of 112 cases of lateral C1-2 puncture myelography for cervical spinal cord disorders.
 Spinal cord puncture and contrast injection, puncture between the occiput and C1, and blood vessel puncture were the main complications.
 These principally depended on the positioning of the patient's neck (hyperextension) and misdirection of the x-ray beam.
 For preventing major arterial puncture, the authors also reviewed 164 vertebral angiograms and determined the pathway of the vertebral arteries and the incidence of anomaly.
