Isolated symptomatic cervical spinous process fracture requiring surgery. Case report.
 Isolated cervical spinous process fractures are common, but are usually considered to be inconsequential.
 Although such fractures may produce pain, complete recovery without residual symptoms is expected after conservative treatment, and neurological injury does not usually occur.
 The case of a patient with a persistently symptomatic C-2 spinous process fracture that required surgical treatment for pain relief is reported.
 A review of the pertinent literature illustrates with unusual clarity the interactions of social, political, and economic forces associated with this medical condition.
