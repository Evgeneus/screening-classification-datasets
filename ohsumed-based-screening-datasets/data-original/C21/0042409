Organ doses received by atomic bomb survivors during radiological examinations at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation.
 When evaluating the risks of oncogenesis and cancer mortality following exposure to the radiations of the atomic bombs (A-bombs), the medical X-ray doses received by the A-bomb survivors must also be estimated and considered.
 Using a human phantom, dosimetry was performed to estimate the X-ray doses received by A-bomb survivors during medical examinations at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF) as part of the long-term follow-up on the Adult Health Study (AHS).
 These examinations have been estimated to represent nearly 45% of the survivors' cumulative medical irradiation dose.
 Doses to the salivary glands, thyroid gland, lung, breast, stomach and colon were measured using thermoluminescent dosimeters.
 The results, which are reported here, will aid in estimating organ doses received by individual AHS participants.
