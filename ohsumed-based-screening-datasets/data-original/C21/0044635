Prevention of pedestrian injuries to children: effectiveness of a school training program.
 Pedestrian injuries are a complex problem for which no single intervention will be completely effective.
 One component of a community-wide program, training of schoolchildren in street-crossing skills, is evaluated.
 The program targeted public school students in grades K through 4 with an eight-session training program by a single teacher, cross-age teaching, videotape feedback, and in 1990 parent-child activity workbooks.
 Children's street crossing was observed pretraining and posttraining and graded on four behaviors: WALKING on sidewalk/shoulder vs in the street; STOPPING at the curb; LOOKING L-R-L before crossing; KEEP LOOKING while crossing.
 Analysis was conducted on matched pairs in which observations pretraining were compared with those posttraining on same child.
 Observations were completed on 137 children in 1989 and 92 in 1990.
 Nearly all children walked on the side of the road; however, fewer than 50% of children STOPPED, 25% LOOKED, and fewer than 20% KEPT LOOKING before training.
 Training did not improve the performance on the first two behaviors in either year, significantly increased LOOKING in 1990, and increased KEEP LOOKING by twofold in 1989 and threefold in 1990.
 It is concluded that pedestrian skills of children can be improved but that such a program must be part of a broader effort if pedestrian injuries are to decrease.
