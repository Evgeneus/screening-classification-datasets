Current treatment reduces calories required to maintain weight in pediatric patients with burns.
 A previous study indicated that formulas for determining caloric requirements of severely burned children overestimated their needs.
 This study was undertaken to determine the caloric intake required to maintain weight in patients under 12 years of age with burns over more than 30% total body surface area.
 The 102 patients studied were divided into two groups according to weight changes.
 A comparison of the actual caloric intakes of these groups was conducted.
 Multivariate regression analysis indicated that body surface area in square meters and burn surface were significant predictors of caloric requirements to maintain weight in these patients.
 It was determined that 1800 kcal was a plausible value for the calories per body surface area.
 Therefore the regression was formed with 1800 kcal as the multiplier of body surface area, and the multiplier of burn surface area was estimated.
 The resulting formula provides 1300 kcal/m2 burned, which is 900 kcal/m2 burned less than our previously suggested formula.
