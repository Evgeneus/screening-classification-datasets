Pancreatic pseudocyst in the left hepatic lobe: a report of two cases.
 The ultrasound and computed tomographic imaging features in a rare pancreatic pseudocyst of the liver are described in two patients.
 The pseudocysts occurred in the left lobe in both cases, one after a traumatic injury and the other after alcoholic pancreatitis.
 The possible topographical sequences with which pancreatic secretions entered the left hepatic lobe to form a cyst are discussed.
