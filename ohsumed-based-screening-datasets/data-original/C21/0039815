Cardiac tamponade following coronary arterial rupture during coronary angioplasty.
 We describe a patient in whom percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was complicated by rupture of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) with pericardial tamponade.
 The outcome was favorable with drastic intervention which included: occlusion of the bleeding vessel with the PTCA balloon, pericardiocentesis, and ligation of the vessel without the need of aortocoronary bypass graft.
