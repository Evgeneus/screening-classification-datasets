Admission alcohol level: a predictor of the course of alcohol withdrawal.
 BACKGROUND.
 Little is known about how to predict the course of alcohol withdrawal.
 This study explores relationships between alcohol levels at admission to a detoxification unit and the severity and outcome of alcohol withdrawal.
 METHODS.
 A retrospective cohort study was conducted in two institutions, the Mid-Missouri Mental Health Center (MMMHC) and the Harry S Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital (HSTMVH), of individuals admitted during 1 year.
 RESULTS.
 The alcohol levels at admission of the 86 clients at the Mental Health Center and the 99 patients at the HSTMVH, correlated with withdrawal severity over the first 48 hours after admission (R2 = .26 at MMMHC, .41 at HSTMVH, P less than .0001 for both), and remained significantly associated even after adjustment for other variables.
 Furthermore, individuals who had lower alcohol levels at the time of admission were more likely to stay for rehabilitation following detoxification (P less than .001 for both institutions).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 A patient's alcohol level at the time of admission to a detoxification unit may help predict the severity of withdrawal and the treatment outcome.
