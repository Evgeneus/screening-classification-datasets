Fractures of the carpal scaphoid. A critical study of the standard splint.
 The effect of the position of splintage on displacement of fractures of the waist of the scaphoid was studied during operations and in cadavers.
 We found that these fractures were best splinted in neutral or slight palmar flexion with no ulnar deviation.
 Providing the wrist was not ulnar deviated, the position of the thumb had no effect on displacement.
