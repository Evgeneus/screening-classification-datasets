Nutritional influence on the plasma and urine-free alkaline ribonuclease levels in severe trauma victims.
 The significance of free alkaline ribonuclease (RNase) activity as a criterion of protein metabolism and nutrition in traumatized man is evaluated in this report.
 Plasma and urinary levels of RNase were measured in severely injured, hypermetabolic patients and in normal controls.
 Significant increases in the plasma and urinary RNase levels were seen in these polytrauma victims and they were positively correlated.
 Plasma RNase levels were also significantly related to blood urea nitrogen and daily urinary nitrogen excretion.
 Urinary clearance of RNase was increased by 220% in trauma victims, although the creatinine clearance was not affected by trauma.
 In a subgroup of eight patients who were fed intravenously (1.4 times basal energy expenditure calories and 250-300 mg of N per kilogram per day) for 6 days, the daily excretions of urinary RNase, nitrogen, 3-methylhistidine, creatinine, and catecholamines were measured.
 There was a significant negative correlation between daily urine RNase and nitrogen balance.
 A general increase in all the metabolic parameters on the first day of feeding was seen, suggesting a nutritional stress superimposed on the trauma-induced metabolic stress.
 Excretion of RNase, 3-methylhistidine, and creatinine peaked on the first day of feeding and then decreased.
 The normal levels could not be reached even after 6 days of adequate nutrition.
 The results suggest that RNase levels could be used as a biomarker of protein metabolism.
