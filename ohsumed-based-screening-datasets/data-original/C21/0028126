Series of ninety-two traumatic cervical spine injuries stabilized with anterior ASIF plate fusion technique.
 This report details the results of 92 patients who underwent a single anterior procedure involving appropriate anterior decompression, tricortical inlay bone grafting, and application of anteriorly applied cervical vertebral plates and screws for the treatment of their acute lower cervical spine trauma.
 This allowed for needed anterior spinal decompression, correction of deformity, and excellent initial stability.
 A lightweight SOMI orthosis was used in the immediate postoperative period and continuing for 3 months on average.
 Follow-up detected a less than 2% incidence of significant complications related specifically to the use of anterior hardware and an excellent fusion rate (98.9%) occurring on average at 3.2 months postoperatively.
 Anterior decompression, bone grafting, and metallic osteosynthesis are thought to provide a valuable means of treating acute lower cervical spine trauma.
