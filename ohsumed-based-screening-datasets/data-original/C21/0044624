Pediatric prehospital care in urban and rural areas.
 There are limited data concerning pediatric prehospital care, although pediatric prehospital calls constitute 10% of emergency medical services activity.
 Data from 10,493 prehospital care reports in 11 counties of California (four emergency medical services systems in rural and urban areas) were collected and analyzed.
 Comparison of urban and rural data found few significant differences in parameters analyzed.
 Use of the emergency medical services system by pediatric patients increased with age, but 12.5% of all calls were for children younger than 2 years.
 Calls for medical problems were most common for patients younger than 5 years of age; trauma was a more common complaint in rural areas (64%, P = .0001).
 Frequency of vital sign assessment differed by region, as did hospital contact (P less than .0001).
 Complete assessment of young pediatric patients, with a full set of vital signs and neurologic assessment, was rarely performed.
 Advanced life support providers were often on the scene, but advanced life support treatments and procedures were infrequently used.
 This study suggests the need for additional data on which to base emergency medical services system design and some directions for education of prehospital care providers.
