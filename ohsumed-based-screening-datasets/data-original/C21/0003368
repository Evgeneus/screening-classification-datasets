Risk of occupational exposure to Herpesvirus simiae (B virus) in Quebec.
 Herpesvirus simiae (B virus) causes a mild infection in macaques.
 Transmission to humans may result in life-threatening encephalomyelitis.
 To evaluate the risk of occupational exposure to B virus we surveyed the directors of 11 biomedical laboratories in Quebec that use monkeys.
 Information was obtained on the monkey population and on the use of infection control measures recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), Atlanta.
 Of the 519 monkeys belonging to susceptible species the serologic status was positive in 264 (51%), all captured in the wilds, and it was unknown in 24 (5%).
 All of the monkeys were caged individually, and newly acquired ones were quarantined for 2 to 8 weeks.
 Of the 84 workers 52 (62%) handled monkeys whose serologic status was either positive or unknown.
 Only five laboratories (representing 61% of the workers) complied fully with the CDC guidelines.
 Nine of the laboratories had a wound management protocol, but only six had a designated specialist for consultation and prophylaxis.
 Although no cases of B virus infection have been reported from Quebec the severity of human illness necessitates strict adherence to infection control measures and expert management of occupational exposure to susceptible monkeys.
