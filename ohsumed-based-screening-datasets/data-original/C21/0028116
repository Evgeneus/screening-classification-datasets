Operative treatment of spinal fractures with the AO internal fixator.
 A multicentered prospective trial to investigate the usefulness of the AO spinal internal fixator for the treatment of thoracolumbar fractures and fracture-dislocations was undertaken.
 This pedicle screw-rod system was effective in stabilizing a variety of unstable fracture patterns.
 It was effective in decompressing the canal of retropulsed bony fragments associated with burst fractures.
 By the use of this implant, sagittal plane deformity was easily corrected.
