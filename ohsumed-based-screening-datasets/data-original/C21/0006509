Epidemiology of reported cases of AIDS in lesbians, United States 1980-89.
 National surveillance data for reported cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were used to assess demographic characteristics and behavioral risk factors in lesbians.
 From June 1, 1980 through September 30, 1989, 79 women with AIDS reported sex relations only with a female partner; most of these women (95 percent) were intravenous drug users.
 Prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the lesbian community will require efforts to prevent and reduce intravenous drug use.
