A novel approach to military combat trauma education.
 A heterogeneous group of 77 physicians on compulsory or reserve military service were exposed to a 5-day course in trauma management, specifically designed for military medical personnel.
 Cognitive knowledge of trauma care delivery of the medical officers was assessed by means of multiple-choice written tests, which were held before and upon completion of the course.
 The significantly improved (p less than 0.0001) scores of the post-course test demonstrate the value of a condensed trauma educational program.
 Analysis of the background variants (i.e., medical education, military, and residency training, and time since graduation) revealed that the relatively short but intensive course sufficed to surmount the difficulties inherent in instructing a student body composed of individuals with dissimilar professional experience.
 We advocate the institution of a compact course in trauma treatment, with the specific aim of enhancing the medical officer's knowledge in this critical field of medical care.
