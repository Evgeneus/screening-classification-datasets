Successful replantation of an amputated nasal tip by microvascular anastomosis.
 Successful microsurgical replantation of a completely avulsed nasal tip is presented.
 The result is excellent.
 The technical challenge involved no sizable veins for drainage.
 This problem was solved by an artery-to-vein shunting.
 For facial avulsions, there is nothing superior to the original tissue, and replantation should always be attempted first.
