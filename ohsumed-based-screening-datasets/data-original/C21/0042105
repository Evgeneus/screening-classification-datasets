Adult respiratory distress syndrome from sulfuric acid fume inhalation.
 A 23-year-old man had adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) caused by acute exposure to sulfuric acid fumes.
 The patient survived the initial hospitalization to be readmitted later with a lung abscess.
 After therapy, his chest roentgenogram and pulmonary function tests revealed no abnormalities except a marginally decreased DLCO, and he was without functional deficit.
 Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema probably resulted from direct alveolar injury caused by sulfuric acid.
