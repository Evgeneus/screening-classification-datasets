Suprascapular nerve lesions at the spinoglenoid notch: report of three cases and review of the literature.
 Lesions of the suprascapular nerve can occur at the supraspinatus notch (SSN) or at the spinoglenoid notch (SGN).
 Electromyographic (EMG), evaluation of the infraspinatus, and especially the supraspinatus muscles distinguishes SGN from SSN lesions.
 Three cases of SGN lesions, which are more common than SSN lesions, are presented.
