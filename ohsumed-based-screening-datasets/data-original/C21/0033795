Management of snakebite.
 Patients who have been or may have been bitten by a snake should receive prompt and careful clinical and laboratory evaluation.
 Fang marks, pain and swelling are characteristic of pit viper envenomation.
 Although no therapy is universally accepted, a number of treatment plans appear to be effective.
 If envenomation has occurred, intravenous administration of antivenin and/or surgical excision or incision should be carried out without delay.
 Prompt transferral to a medical facility is the most appropriate first-aid measure.
 If transportation is unduly delayed, immediate linear incision and suction may be of value.
