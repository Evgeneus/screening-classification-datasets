Uterine rupture at term pregnancy with the use of intracervical prostaglandin E2 gel for induction of labor.
 Prostaglandin E2 is a powerful oxytocic agent that reliably initiates labor, even in the presence of an unripe cervix.
 The low incidence of fetomaternal complication contributes to its universal use.
 We report a rare case of uterine rupture after intracervical application of prostaglandin E2 gel.
 Thus far no prostaglandin compound or method of administration seems to be exempt from such a complication.
