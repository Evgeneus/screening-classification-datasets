Increased airways reactivity after smoke inhalation.
 13 fire victims who required treatment after smoke inhalation underwent lung function assessment within 3 days of injury and 3 months later.
 Initial airways hyperreactivity improved over this period, but FEV1 and airways specific conductance did not change significantly.
 There was a strong correlation between exposure carboxyhaemoglobin concentration (an indicator of smoke exposure) and initial airways specific conductance (r + 0.79; p = 0.006).
 Airways obstruction after smoke inhalation in house fires may be more common and more persistent than is generally recognised.
 Early lung function tests would allow the incidence of pulmonary complications after smoke inhalation and the potential benefits of early use of inhaled antiinflammatory drugs to be assessed.
