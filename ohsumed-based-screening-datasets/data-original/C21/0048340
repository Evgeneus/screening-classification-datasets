Acute misoprostol toxicity.
 Misoprostol (Cytotec) is a recently released prostaglandin E1 analog approved for use in prevention of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gastropathy.
 We report one of the first known examples of toxicity in an acute ingestion since the drug was first released in international markets in 1984.
 After an accidental ingestion of 3 mg misoprostol (approximately 15 times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose), a 71-year-old woman exhibited fever, tremor, tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, and abdominal cramping.
 Recovery ensued with standard supportive care.
 The physiology of this unique drug and implications for management of acute toxicity are summarized.
