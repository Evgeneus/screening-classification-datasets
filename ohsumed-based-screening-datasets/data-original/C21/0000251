Left ventricular rupture complicating percutaneous mitral commissurotomy: salvage using percutaneous cardiopulmonary bypass support.
 Left ventricular rupture resulting in death has been reported to be a complication of percutaneous mitral commissurotomy.
 We report a 71-year-old man in whom a left ventricular rupture occurred during percutaneous mitral commissurotomy and resulted in hemodynamic collapse due to acute cardiac tamponade.
 The patient was stabilized using percutaneously instituted cardiopulmonary bypass support with subsequent repair of the left ventricle and successful mitral valve replacement.
 Three months later this patient remains in New York Heart Class I.
