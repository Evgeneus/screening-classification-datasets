Early excision and skin grafting of selected burns of the face and neck.
 Since 1979, 16 patients with facial and neck burns have been treated with excision and skin grafting within the first 4 days of injury.
 The injuries were tangentially excised and immediately covered with split-thickness skin grafts.
 Detailed consecutive results are presented.
 The patients can be divided into three groups.
 Group 1 consisted of small subdermal or circumscribed deep dermal burns of the face (n = 8).
 Healing was quick.
 Some patients developed signs of overgrafting.
 As a late result, unevenness and discoloration were seen.
 Group 2 consisted of mixed deep dermal and subdermal burns of the face and neck (n = 5).
 Usually, minor areas had to be regrafted.
 Some patients developed hypertrophic scars at border areas.
 In the completely excised and grafted area, the skin was smooth, pliable, and discolored.
 Group 3 consisted mostly of subdermal burns of the face and neck (n = 3).
 The surgical trauma was significant.
 Small areas had to be regrafted.
 Ectropion and microstomia developed.
 It is concluded that in selected cases of deep dermal and subdermal burns, early excision and skin grafting will result in faster healing and less scarring than expectant treatment.
