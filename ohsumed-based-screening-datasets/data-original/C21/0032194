MR examination of the knee: interpretation with multiscreen digital workstation vs hardcopy format.
 A multiscreen imaging workstation was compared with conventional hardcopy format for diagnostic interpretation of MR images of the knee.
 MR examinations from 30 patients were interpreted by two observers using film displayed both on a standard film panel alternator and an eight-screen digital workstation.
 Arthroscopic examination of these patients disclosed 30 meniscal tears and five anterior cruciate ligament tears in 28 patients.
 Two patients had normal arthroscopic examinations.
 The MR examinations were evaluated with a five-point confidence rating scale.
 Results were correlated with arthroscopic findings, and receiver-operating-characteristic curves were generated from these data.
 No significant difference was found between the areas under the receiver-operating-characteristic curves for film and digital display.
 The time required for image interpretation was greater when using the digital workstation than when using the film by a factor of approximately 2.7.
 Our data indicate that a multiscreen digital workstation can be used for interpreting MR examinations of the knee without impairment of diagnostic performance, but with increased time required for image interpretation when compared with radiographic film and a film panel alternator.
