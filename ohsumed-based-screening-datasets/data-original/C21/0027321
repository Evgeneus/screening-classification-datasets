Serum beta-hexosaminidase and alpha-mannosidase activities as markers of alcohol abuse.
 In 25-alcohol-dependent patients in whom detoxication treatment has been introduced serum total beta-hexosaminidase, thermostable beta-hexosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase and gamma glutamylotransferase (GGT) and serum high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were determined during alcohol withdrawal.
 The assays were also performed in a group of dependent individuals after a 1 month or longer period of abstinence.
 Marked increase in beta-hexosaminidase activity was observed in intoxicated patients.
 The activity decreased rapidly after the cessation of drinking, resembling the decrease in HDL cholesterol level in its dynamics.
 The alpha-mannosidase activity rise was less pronounced and its normalization was slow, similar to the GGT activity normalization rate.
 The rise of beta-hexosaminidase activity was mostly due to the thermostable component of the enzyme.
 Total beta-hexosaminidase or thermostable beta-hexosaminidase activity determinations appear to be simple and reliable markers of alcohol abuse.
