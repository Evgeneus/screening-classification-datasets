Finding of a bullet in the cervical column of a body hit by a train.
 This case is about the finding of a body of an unidentified male of approximately 70 years of age who was hit by a train.
 During the carrying out of the corresponding autopsy and after the radiological tests for posterior odontological identification, a foreign body of a cylindrical-cone shape, identical to that of a bullet, was found lodged between the first and second cervical vertebrae.
 During dissection of the neck, a bullet was found.
 When the ballistic test was carried out, it was ascertained that the bullet was from a cartridge of 7.92 by 57-mm Mauser caliber, manufactured in Spain in 1936.
 This ammunition corresponds to that used during the Civil War in Spain (1936-1939).
 After the identification of the body, it was proved that the bullet was the result of a war wound.
 However, the victim had been unaware of the existence of the bullet, which had remained in his body for 50 years.
