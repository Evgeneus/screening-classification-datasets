Intracapsular fractures of the neck of femur. Parallel or crossed garden screws?
 The results of treatment in 242 patients with intracapsular fractures of the neck of femur treated with Garden screws are presented with reference as to whether the screws were crossed or parallel.
 The incidence both of nonunion and of avascular necrosis was less in those fractures treated with parallel screws.
 The outcome was also superior if the reduction was good.
