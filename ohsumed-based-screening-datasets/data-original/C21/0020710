Vertical deceleration trauma. Principles of management.
 A highly complex interaction of several physical and biomechanical factors determines the patterns of injury and probability of survival in free falls.
 Falls from extreme heights result in massive visceral and vascular injuries, which are usually lethal.
 Urban falls tend to result in severe lower extremity, spinal, and pelvic fractures.
 Retroperitoneal hemorrhage is a significant cause of death and is best managed by emergency angiography and embolization.
 Early fixation of fractures reduces morbidity.
