Transient penetration of the hip joint during in situ cannulated-screw fixation of slipped capital femoral epiphysis.
 Before the routine intraoperative use of fluoroscopy at our institution during procedures to stabilize a slipped capital femoral epiphysis, twenty-five patients (thirty hips) had in situ cannulated-screw stabilization of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis with use of biplane radiography.
 Thus, a permanent record of the procedure was available for review.
 Fourteen hips in fourteen patients had an intraoperative episode during which the joint was penetrated by the guide-pin assembly or cannulated screw, or both.
 This penetration was corrected at the time of the operation.
 Eleven patients were followed for a minimum of two years (mean, thirty-nine months; range, twenty-four to sixty-three months).
 All physes went on to closure.
 None of the patients had clinical or radiographic evidence of chondrolysis.
 Transient penetration of the hip joint did not lead to chondrolysis in this series.
 This suggests that a single episode of penetration by a pin or screw, with immediate removal from the joint, is not associated with the development of chondrolysis.
