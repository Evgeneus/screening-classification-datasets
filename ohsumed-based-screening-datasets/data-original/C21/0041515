Safety of a preadolescent basketball program.
 A preadolescent youth basketball program was prospectively studied to determine injury rates and the kinds of injuries sustained.
 The overall injury rate was 7.6% (39 injuries among the 510 children aged 5 to 12 years).
 Girls had a higher injury rate than boys (P less than .02).
 Only 12 children (2.4%) suffered significant injuries as defined by the inability to play for at least one session.
 Most injuries were contusions (35.9%), followed by strains or sprains (28.2%), epistaxis (12.8%), lacerations (5.1%), and one finger fracture (2.6%), the most significant injury.
 Games were more likely to produce injuries than practice sessions; most injuries occurred in the second half of game play.
 This study documents a low injury rate in an organized preadolescent basketball program.
