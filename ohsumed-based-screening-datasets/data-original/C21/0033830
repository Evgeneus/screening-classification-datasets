Estimating energy requirements in burned children: a new approach derived from measurements of resting energy expenditure.
 We examined the determinants of resting energy expenditure (REE) in 127 observations in 56 burned children.
 Predicted basal energy expenditure (PBEE), body surface area (BSA), and body weight correlated significantly with REE (r2 = 0.76).
 Days postburn and burn size (% BSA burned) only accounted for 21%, and 24% of the variation in the elevation in REE above PBEE.
 The single most powerful predictor of REE was PBEE (REE = 1.29 x PBEE); addition of other variables did not improve the prediction.
 When our recently described activity factor of 1.2 for burn patients is used, the data predict that the average energy requirement to maintain energy balance is 1.55 x PBEE, which is significantly lower than commonly used recommendations, especially for larger burns.
 The energy required to ensure that 95% of patients achieve energy balance was (1.55 x PBEE) + (2.39 xoff+PBEE0.75), approximately equal to 2 x PBEE.
 Because the equations presented are derived from measurements of energy expenditure, they represent the most valid approach to estimating energy requirements.
