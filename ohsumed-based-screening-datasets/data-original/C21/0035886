Prevention of retrovirus infection after injury with contaminated instruments: an experimental study.
 Owing to similarities between human immunodeficiency virus and feline retroviruses, the feline model was chosen for the study to investigate the efficacy of timely topical treatment of accidental human immunodeficiency virus infection in the operating room.
 Cats were subcutaneously inoculated with either feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus.
 An effort was made to neutralize the virus in loco either by infiltration of the inoculation site with povidone-iodine or with monoclonal antibodies, or by cauterization and excision.
 The animals were periodically monitored for feline leukemia virus antigens or for feline immunodeficiency virus antibodies.
 The results indicated that in the feline model, the development of generalized virus infection may be prevented by local measures if applied immediately.
