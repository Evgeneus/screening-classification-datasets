Meniscal injuries.
 The knee is the largest and one of the strongest joints in the body.
 It is used in all forms of vigorous activity and is relatively unprotected.
 This lends it to being one of the most injured joints in the body.
 In addition to being traumatized, there are several other forms of pathology that can manifest symptoms of pain, swelling, and instability.
 Fortunately, most of the problems can be treated with conservative methods or by arthroscopy.
