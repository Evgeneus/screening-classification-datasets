"Ratchet-type" marginal fracture of the radial head with locked anterior dislocation. A case report.
 Locked anterior dislocation of the superior radioulnar joint occurred in a 26-year-old man.
 The configuration of the associated radial head fracture maintained the locked position and predisposed to recurrence after open reduction.
 Radial head excision was necessary to resolve the problem.
 Both medial ligament repair and a radial head prosthesis were necessary to stabilize the elbow.
