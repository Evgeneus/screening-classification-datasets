Neurapraxia of the femoral nerve in a modern dancer.
 We have presented a case of an acute onset femoral nerve neurapraxia in a pure modern dancer.
 Repeated mild stretching of the femoral nerve during an established dance routine over a period of several months is implicated as the etiology.
 The thigh muscles quickly weakened, but regained strength within 3 months.
 Electromyographic evidence of specific femoral nerve injury initially was negative, but was evident 6 weeks following injury.
 Overuse syndrome in dancers can cause rapid loss of strength.
 Other conditions such as herniated intervertebral disc, acute hemorrhage, trauma, iliopsoas rupture, and acute stretching must be ruled out.
 Complete recovery was the natural outcome.
