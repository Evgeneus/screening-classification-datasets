Tap-water scald burns. Awareness is not the problem.
 Review of admissions to a regional burn center showed that tap-water burns were an injury of pediatric, elderly, and neurologically impaired patients.
 A study was designed to measure general knowledge of tap-water injury and awareness of tap-water temperatures in homes.
 All those surveyed realized the potential for tap-water scald burns in their homes, and few believed that they could tolerate hot-only tap water at home for as long as 30 seconds.
 Respondents who had previous experience with tap-water burns had not lowered the settings of their water-heater thermostats.
 Economical but effective programs must be developed to encourage burn-reduction behaviors in high-risk groups.
