Unidirectional joint communications in wrist arthrography: an evaluation of 250 cases.
 Although arthrographically demonstrable communications between various compartments of the wrist occur in older persons without symptoms, similar communications in younger persons may indicate clinically significant posttraumatic ligament tears and other pathologic processes.
 However, detection of communications varies depending on the arthrographic technique used.
 It has been claimed that if triple-compartment arthrography is not used in all patients, clinically significant unidirectional ligament tears may be overlooked.
 We determined the frequency and distribution of unidirectional intercompartmental communications, using a modification of techniques described in the literature.
 Separate injections of contrast material were made in sequence into the midcarpal, distal radioulnar, and radiocarpal joints of 250 consecutive patients.
 We found 38 unidirectional communications (17 lunotriquetral, nine scapholunate, three radial capsular, one ulnar capsular, six combined sites, and two indeterminate sites) between the midcarpal and radiocarpal joints.
 Nine unidirectional communications between the radiocarpal and distal radioulnar joints were found.
 Comparison of these results with the frequency and direction of unidirectional communications reported by others suggests that demonstration of communications depends on specific technical factors, such as which joint is injected first, the amount of contrast material used, and the delay between injections.
 This dependence on technical factors raises questions about the value of routine three-compartment wrist arthrography.
