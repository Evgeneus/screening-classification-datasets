A one-year prospective ED cohort of pediatric burns: a proposal for standardizing scald burns.
 During a 12-month period ending on 11/30/88, data were collected on 143 pediatric patients visiting a pediatric emergency department with burns.
 Sixty-four percent were males.
 Common causes of the burns included hot water (17%), hot food (23%), hot appliances (18%), and charcoal and grills (9%).
 Sixty-six percent of the burns took place at home.
 The hospitalization rate was 8%.
 A suggestion for standardizing scalds based on fluidity and function is proposed, since there is ambiguity regarding definition of a scald.
