Vascularised fibular graft for congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia. Long-term results.
 Five children with congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia treated by free vascularised fibular grafts were followed up until skeletal maturity.
 The ipsilateral fibula was used in four cases, the contralateral fibula in one.
 All our cases achieved bone union, but leg length discrepancy, atrophy of the foot and ankle stiffness were frequent complications, due perhaps to the many previous operations.
 Vascularised fibular grafting might achieve better results if it were done as the primary procedure.
