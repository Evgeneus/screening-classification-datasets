Climbing and the older athlete.
 Climbing may be considered appropriate for the older athlete.
 The requisites, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal fitness, can be attained through training; the skills can be acquired through schools or guide services.
 Inherent risks can enhance the enjoyment.
 The motivational psychology for climbing usually reflects positive qualities and attitudes toward life and the environment.
 With good health, the recreation of climbing can be enjoyed well into the seventh decade of life.
 Climbing may not be for everyone, but the physical and physiologic benefits, as well as the challenges, are available to the older athlete.
