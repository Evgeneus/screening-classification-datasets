Tanning salons: an area survey of proprietors' knowledge of risks and precautions.
 An area survey of tanning salon proprietors was conducted in a medium-sized midwestern city.
 Proprietors reported they were in compliance with federal safety regulations, but not all had age, frequency, or duration restrictions.
 Similarly, proprietors were not uniformly informing patrons of potential tanning hazards, including the possibility of skin cancer, and were not knowledgeable about the risk and benefits of tanning.
 Some establishments reported selling psoralens to patrons to enhance tanning.
 More explicit guidelines regarding the use of tanning equipment and more accurate consumer information are needed.
