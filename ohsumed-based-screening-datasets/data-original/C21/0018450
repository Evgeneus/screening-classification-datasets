Magnetic resonance imaging for ineffectual tarsal tunnel surgical treatment.
 Tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) is an entrapment neuropathy caused by compression of the posterior tibial nerve beneath the ankle flexor retinaculum.
 Treatment of TTS consists of surgical release of the retinaculum.
 The failure rate is 10%-20%.
 Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was used to evaluate a patient with an unsatisfactory response.
 MR imaging demonstrated incompleteness of the surgical release of the flexor retinaculum.
