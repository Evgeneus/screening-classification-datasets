Intraoperative management of severe endobronchial hemorrhage 
 Endobronchial hemorrhage due to pulmonary artery perforation by a Swan-Ganz catheter developed during coronary artery bypass grafting while weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass.
 After reinstitution of cardio-pulmonary bypass with pulmonary artery venting, bleeding was localized to the right lower lobe bronchus using fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
 A Fogarty embolectomy catheter was inflated in the bronchus to tamponade successfully only the right lower lobe.
 This case illustrates a method of distal bronchial blockade for maximal retention of pulmonary function and avoidance of pulmonary resection.
