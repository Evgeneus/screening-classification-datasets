Street-recruited intravenous drug users and sexual risk reduction in New York City.
 Previous studies have reported that intravenous drug users (IVDUs) have made considerable drug-use risk reduction, but less sexual risk reduction.
 This paper presents findings about sexual risk reduction by street-recruited IVDUs in New York City, and examines the predictors of sexual risk reduction.
 Sixty-one per cent of these street-recruited IVDUs have initiated deliberate sexual risk reduction in order to avoid AIDS.
 For the total sample (n = 568), as well as for the male IVDUs, specific health belief and social influence factors were significant predictors of sexual risk reduction.
 For female IVDUs, drug-risk reduction, having a friend or acquaintance who practices sexual risk reduction, and wanting to have a(nother) child were significant predictors of sexual risk reduction.
 These findings suggest the importance of social support and community organization to promote risk reduction.
