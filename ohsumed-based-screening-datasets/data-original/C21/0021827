Wrist arthrography: value of the three-compartment injection method.
 Arthrography of the wrist was performed on 300 consecutive patients by injecting contrast material separately into the radiocarpal (RCJ), midcarpal (MCJ), and distal radioulnar (DRUJ) joints.
 The addition of MCJ and DRUJ injections to the standard RCJ injection significantly improved diagnostic yield.
 In 78 (26%) of the 300 cases, the abnormality was found after MCJ or DRUJ injections alone.
 Of the 103 triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) abnormalities identified, 27 (26%) could be demonstrated after DRUJ injection alone.
 Of the 145 abnormal RCJ and MCJ communications, 42 (29%) could be seen after MCJ injection alone.
 Similarly, 22 (15%) of the 145 abnormal RCJ and MCJ communications were seen after RCJ injection alone and would have been missed if only MCJ injection had been performed.
 Thus, three separate injections into the RCJ, MCJ, and DRUJ are necessary for complete arthrographic evaluation.
