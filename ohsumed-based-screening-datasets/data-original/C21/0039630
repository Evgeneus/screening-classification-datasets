Alcohol abuse: comparison of two methods for assessing its prevalence and associated morbidity in hospitalized patients 
 PURPOSE: To evaluate two methods for assessing the prevalence of alcohol abuse in hospitalized patients based upon scores on standardized alcoholism screening instruments compared with diagnostic discharge data, and to determine the risk for comorbid conditions in patients who abuse alcohol.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 2,534 consecutive patients admitted to five adult inpatient services of an academic center, 1,964 were screened for alcohol abuse using the CAGE and the SMAST.
 Their discharge diagnoses were obtained and analyzed for the presence of alcohol-related diagnoses and other comorbid conditions.
 RESULTS: A total of 1.4% of patients had a principal alcohol-related diagnosis (ARD), 6% had a secondary but no principal ARD, and 15% screened positive for alcohol abuse but had no ARD.
 The overall prevalence of alcohol abuse was 22.4%.
 Patients with a principal ARD had a higher risk for dementia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pancreatitis, sequelae of liver disease, and illegal drug abuse.
 Patients with a secondary ARD were at risk for 19 comorbid conditions, including pancreatitis, injury, pneumonia, COPD, and poly-drug abuse.
 Patients who screened positive for alcohol abuse but had no ARD were significantly more likely to have a diagnosis of hypertension, arrhythmia, breast cancer, or pelvic inflammatory disease.
 CONCLUSION: Discharge diagnoses alone markedly underestimate the prevalence of alcohol abuse in hospitalized patients.
 Patients from the three groups are at higher risk for comorbid conditions, and secondary prevention of alcohol abuse can be achieved by routinely screening every patient using recognized alcoholism screening instruments.
