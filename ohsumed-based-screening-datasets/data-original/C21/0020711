New horizons in management of hypothermia and frostbite injury.
 Diagnosing hypothermia requires a high index of suspicion.

 Frostbite is best treated by physicians who are cognizant of the pathophysiology of cold injury.
 Although alternative methods of intervention are being tested, rapid rewarming and anti-inflammatory agents are integral to treatment protocols.
