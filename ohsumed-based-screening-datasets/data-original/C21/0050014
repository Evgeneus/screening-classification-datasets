Hepatitis C virus antibodies in acute icteric and chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis.
 Hepatitis C virus antibodies were measured in 213 patients who had acute (n = 122) and chronic (n = 91) non-A, non-B hepatitis.
 In acute infection, anti-hepatitis C virus was detected in 61% of IV drug abusers, in 33% of patients with transfusion-associated hepatitis, and in 22% of patients with sporadic infections (P less than 0.0005, drug abusers vs.
 sporadic).
 Mean time to seroconversion was 11.6 weeks (range, 1-80 weeks).
 Anti-hepatitis C virus was more common in chronic infection (P less than 0.001) and was more often detected in IV drug users (89%; P less than 0.0001) and after transfusion (71%; P less than 0.005) compared with chronic sporadic infection (27%).
 Antibody persisted for up to 8 years.
 Six chronic case patients (8.3%) later lost antibody (mean, 24 months; range, 12-48 months).
