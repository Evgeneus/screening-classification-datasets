Reattachment of the detached ciliary body with suturing for treatment of contusional ocular hypotension.
 Ocular hypotension resulting from a detached ciliary body after ocular contusion usually is best treated surgically.
 We report a simple, safe, and relatively effective procedure used to suture the ciliary body onto the inner surface of the sclera in eight such cases.
 Intraocular pressure (IOP) rose from unmeasurable levels to 10 to 12 mm Hg in five of these cases.
 Although in the three other cases IOP did not increase immediately after the operation, in one case it rose to 10 to 12 mm Hg 1 month postoperatively, and in the other two cases it rose to a normal level after additional laser therapy.
