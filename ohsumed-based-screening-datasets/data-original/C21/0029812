Pitfalls of bone scintigraphy in suspected hip fractures.
 In a review of 2617 patients who were admitted with a suspected fractured neck of femur over a period of five years, 213 had normal or equivocal plain radiographs, and were subsequently investigated by bone scintigraphy.
 Normal scans were obtained in 127 (60%) cases.
 Of the remaining 86 cases, 82 (38%) were reported to show fractures of the proximal femur, three showed pubic ramus fractures, and one acetabular fracture was demonstrated.
 Review and follow-up has revealed eight false positive and two false negative scans.
 The various factors accounting for these errors are considered, and the clinical implications discussed.
 Careful analysis of accompanying plain radiographs is stressed when interpreting scintigrams.
