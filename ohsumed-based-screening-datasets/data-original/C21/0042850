Comparison of expandable endotracheal stents in the treatment of surgically induced piglet tracheomalacia.
 Present surgical alternatives for pediatric tracheobronchomalacia are limited and associated with many potentially undesirable complications.
 The feasibility of different intraluminal expandable endotracheal stents for the treatment of surgically induced tracheomalacia was analyzed in 27 piglets.
 A potentially fatal tracheomalacia was surgically created.
 Either a stainless steel "zig-zag" stent or a woven polymeric stent was then implanted.
 Tracheal patency, mucosal function, histopathologic respiratory tract changes, and effects of the stent on esophageal motility were evaluated over a 16-week period.
 Piglets with steel stents uniformly experienced intense inflammation leading to tracheal dysfunction and death.
 Piglets with polymeric stents experienced minimal respiratory symptoms.
 Expandable polymeric endotracheal stents alleviate surgically induced piglet tracheomalacia, were easy to insert, allowed for tracheal growth, and reduced the need for high-risk surgical procedures with prolonged ventilatory support.
