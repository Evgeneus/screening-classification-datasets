Transoral crossbow injury to the cervical spine: an unusual case of penetrating cervical spine injury.
 The complexity of missile injuries to the cervical spine has increased as the technology that causes these injuries has become more sophisticated.
 Management requires adaptation of conventional neurosurgical approaches to the cervical spine in an effort to limit neurological deficit and establish stability.
 We report an unusual case of a 19-year-old man who suffered transoral penetration of the cervical spine by an arrow released by a crossbow at close range.
