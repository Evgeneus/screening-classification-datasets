Attitudes toward alcoholism among psychologists and marriage, family and child counselors.
 This study examines the attitudes of 589 randomly chosen licensed California psychologists and marriage, family and child counselors toward alcoholism.
 Their anonymous replies revealed that the two professional groups were relatively homogeneous in nature.
 The majority of each subscribed to the disease concept of alcoholism, recognized the importance of abstinence in problem resolution and as a treatment goal, rejected insight as a prerequisite of sobriety, believed in a positive prognosis and were extremely willing to be involved in the treatment of alcoholics.
 Negative attitudes toward alcoholics were expressed with respect to attribution of responsibility and a persistence of stigmatization of the alcoholic.
