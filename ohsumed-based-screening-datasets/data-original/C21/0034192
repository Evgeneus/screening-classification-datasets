Tissue reaction to collagen-coated porous hydroxyapatite.
 To give tenacity to high porosity (80%-90%) hydroxyapatite (HA) and to make a stronger bone substitute, a collagen-coated porous HA (C-HA) was prepared, and its compressive strength was examined.
 By implanting C-HA into the femoral condyle of adult rabbits, the capacity for new bone formation and foreign-body reactivity were quantitatively compared with those of HA alone.
 The compressive strength of C-HA was 4.3 times greater than HA.
 At four weeks after implantation, the mean areal ratio of the newly formed bone in the C-HA block in each rabbit was 9.9%, which was somewhat less than the 13.7% in the HA block; the mean number of multinucleated giant cells (MGC) per visual field at x25 in the C-HA-implanted specimens in each rabbit was 14.4, significantly larger than the 6.1 in the HA specimens.
 However, 12 weeks after C-HA implantation, the areal ratio of new bone increased to 32.7%, the number of MGC decreased to 9.4, and the differences compared to the values in HA cases, 31.5% and 6.8, disappeared.
 These results showed that C-HA is mechanically stronger than HA and that there is no difference between HA and C-HA in capacity for new bone formation or foreign-body reaction.
