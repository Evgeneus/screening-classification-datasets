Detoxification from benzodiazepines: schedules and strategies.
 Management of benzodiazepine (BZD) tolerance is divided into low- and high-dose withdrawal.
 Low-dose withdrawal includes patients who have received manufacturer-recommended doses of BZD on a daily basis for longer than 1 month.
 Gradual tapering of the BZD over 4 weeks on an outpatient basis is suggested.
 High-dose withdrawal includes patients who have been ingesting doses of BZD greater than the equivalent of diazepam 40 mg/d for longer than 8 months.
 It is recommended that the patients be tolerance tested with diazepam and, if tolerant, tapered off medication as inpatients at a rate of 10% per day.
 Triazolobenzodiazepines may be exceptions to these recommendations.
 Alprazolam should be titrated at a rate of 0.5 mg three times a day regardless of whether the patient is being tapered for low- or high-dose withdrawal.
