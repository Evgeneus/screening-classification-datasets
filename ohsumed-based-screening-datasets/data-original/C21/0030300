Failure of electric shock treatment for rattlesnake envenomation.
 The use of high-voltage electric shock therapy for the treatment of snake venom poisoning has recently gained popularity in the United States.
 We present a case that documents the dangerous, ineffective application of electric shock to the face of a patient envenomated by a Great Basin rattlesnake (Crotalus viridis lutosus).
 The successful use of antivenin in this critically ill, antivenin-allergic patient is described.
