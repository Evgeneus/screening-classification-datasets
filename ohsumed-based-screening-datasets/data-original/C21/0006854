Giant chest wall tumor resulting from tissue reaction to foreign bodies.
 Three patients are reported in whom chest wall tumors developed 19 to 28 years after thoracoplasty and increased in size with time.
 The tumors could be removed operatively with good results.
 All tumors were composed of hematoma and necrotic material, and in all cases they revealed foreign bodies microscopically.
 Diagnosis and possible etiological factors are discussed.
