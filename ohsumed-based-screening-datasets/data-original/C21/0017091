The role of continued drinking in loss of portal perfusion after distal splenorenal shunt.
 Fifty percent of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who undergo distal splenorenal shunting for variceal bleeding lose portal perfusion within 1 year.
 Although it was previously considered that this loss of portal flow was irrevocable, the present study shows that with resolution of alcoholic hepatitis, portal perfusion can be restored.
 A 34-year-old patient with alcoholic liver disease and a distal splenorenal shunt lost portal perfusion 1 year after the operation.
 He had continued to drink alcohol and had high sinusoidal pressure.
 Following forced abstinence over the next 2 years, his sinusoidal pressure fell, liver volume decreased, results of liver biopsy improved, and portal perfusion was restored.
 Shunt patency was documented, and the same collaterals from the portal vein to the shunt could still be visualized as had been seen when portal flow was absent.
 Restoration of portal perfusion was attributed to decreased intrahepatic resistance secondary to abstinence from alcohol.
 A return to drinking in the next 9 months led to alcoholic hepatitis and once again loss of portal perfusion.
 This study places emphasis on increased intrahepatic resistance rather than the development of portal-to-shunt collaterals as important in the loss of portal flow in such patients.
