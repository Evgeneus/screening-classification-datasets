Angular remodeling of midshaft forearm fractures in children.
 Thirty-six children treated for angulated midshaft forearm fractures were roentgenographically reexamined after a median time of four years (range, two to 5.8 years).
 The angulation of the fractures and epiphyseal plates was measured at the time of healing and at the follow-up examination.
 In children younger than 11 years of age, there was a significant correlation between fracture correction and change in epiphyseal plate angulation, with the highest degree of correction being 13 degrees.
 In children older than 11 years, no correlation was found, and the degree of fracture correction was unpredictable.
 The study points to an important influence of the epiphyseal plate on fracture remodeling, which decreases in late childhood.
