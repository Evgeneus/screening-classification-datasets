The metabolism of ethyl esters of fatty acids in adipose tissue of rats chronically exposed to ethanol.
 The concentration of ethyl esters of fatty acids as well as the activity of the enzyme synthesizing these esters (fatty acid ethyl ester synthase) were determined in adipose tissue of rats ingesting ethanol (9-16 g/kg body weight/day) for different periods of time.
 After 10 and 17 weeks of ethanol exposure about 300 nmol of ethyl esters of oleic, palmitic, stearic, and linoleic acids were found per gram adipose tissue.
 The ethyl esters disappeared after 1 week of abstinence.
 Closer analyses, using radioactive ethanol, revealed a half-life of the esters of less than 24 hr.
 The bulk of the esters was found in a membrane preparation of isolated adipocytes.
 Hormone-sensitive lipase hydrolyzed emulsified ethyl oleate as efficiently as that of trioleoylglycerol, but in mixed ethyl oleate/trioleoyl glycerol particles the hydrolysis of ethyl oleate was slower, suggesting a decreased accessibility.
 Synthase activity was found in adipose tissue from rats not exposed to ethanol.
 It doubled after 10 and 17 weeks of ethanol and decreased with a half-life of at least a week after abstinence.
 It was concluded that ethyl esters of fatty acids are formed in rat adipose tissue as previously shown in other tissues.
 They seem to be stored mainly in membranous parts of the adipocytes.
 Synthase activity is induced by ethanol.
 The elevated activity has a longer half-life, and may be useful as an indicator of alcohol abuse.
