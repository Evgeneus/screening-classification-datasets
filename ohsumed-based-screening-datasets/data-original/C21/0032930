Reconstruction of internal orbital fractures with Vitallium mesh.
 Trauma to the face frequently results in internal orbital fractures that may produce large orbital defects involving multiple walls.
 Accurate anatomic reconstruction of the bony orbit is essential to maintain normal appearance and function of the eye following such injuries.
 Autogenous bone grafts do not always produce predictable long-term support of the globe.
 Displacement and varying amounts of bone-graft resorption can lead to enophthalmos.
 This study examines the use of Vitallium mesh in the acute reconstruction of internal orbital defects.
 Fifty-four patients with 66 orbits underwent reconstruction of internal orbital defects with Vitallium mesh.
 Associated fractures were anatomically reduced and rigidly fixed.
 Forty-six patients and 57 orbits had adequate follow-up for analysis of results.
 The average follow-up was 9 months, with 85 percent of the patients followed 6 months or longer.
 There were no postoperative orbital infections, and none of the Vitallium mesh required removal.
 Large internal orbital defects can be reconstructed using Vitallium mesh with good results and little risk of infection.
 Vitallium mesh appears to be well tolerated in spite of free communication with the sinuses.
 Stable reconstruction of the internal orbit can be achieved and predictable eye position maintained without donor-site morbidity.
