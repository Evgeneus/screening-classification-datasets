The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test: false positives in a college student sample.
 The Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (MAST), designed and validated by Selzer (1971), is widely used to screen for persons with alcohol problems.
 The most recent version of the MAST includes the question "Have you ever attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA)?" This question may contribute to false positive identifications, as it does not specify whether attendance is for the subject's own problem drinking.
 In the current research, 114 college students completed the MAST along with an additional question: "Have you ever attended a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous because of your own problem drinking?" The results indicated that seven of 114 subjects (6.1%) attained inflated MAST scores because they had attended an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, but not for their own problem drinking.
 It is suggested that the wording to the Alcoholics Anonymous question on the MAST be changed to reduce the number of false positive identifications produced by this instrument.
