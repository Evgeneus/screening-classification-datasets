Inadequate immune response among public safety workers receiving intradermal vaccination against hepatitis B--United States, 1990-1991.
 The Immunization Practices Advisory Committee (ACIP) recommends that hepatitis B vaccine be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route (1).
 However, since November 1990, public safety departments have reported to CDC at least four instances of poor immune response among public safety workers vaccinated against hepatitis B by the intradermal (ID) route of administration.
