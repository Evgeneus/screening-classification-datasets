The dorsal antiglide plate in the treatment of Danis-Weber type-B fractures of the distal fibula.
 The results of 93 of 107 consecutive antiglide plate internal fixations of Danis-Weber Type-B fractures of the distal fibula are reported with a follow-up period of just over one year.
 Using the ankle evaluation scale of Weber, 66.7% excellent, 27.9% good, and only 5.4% poor results were found.
 The method of dorsal antiglide plate fixation is possible in most of the frequent Type-B ankle fractures.
 Stabilization is better with the antiglide plate, especially in older patients with osteoporotic bone.
 Because of these advantages and the biomechanically sound technique, the antiglide plate is recommended for stabilization of the Danis-Weber Type-B fracture of the distal fibula.
