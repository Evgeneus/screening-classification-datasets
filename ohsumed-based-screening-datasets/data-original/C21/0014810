Tricuspid valve incompetence caused by nonpenetrating thoracic trauma.
 Tricuspid valve incompetence from ruptured papillary muscle or chordae as a result of nonpenetrating trauma is uncommon.
 Blunt trauma causing partial detachment of a leaflet from the annulus is very rare.
 We report the case of a young adult involved in a car accident who had these findings.
 Operative repair with resuture of the leaflet to the annulus and annuloplasty using a Carpentier ring resulted in complete recovery.
