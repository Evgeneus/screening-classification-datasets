Newly designed continuous corneal irrigation system for chemical burns.
 A newly designed continuous irrigation system has been applied in our clinic.
 Six cases of corneal chemical burns have been treated with this system from September 1988 to February 1989.
 The present system has been available in any clinics by materials such as a disposable intravenous tube and a scalp vein tube for infants.
 Compared with the methods previously reported, this system showed good results, simplicity for setting up, good patient tolerance and low cost of the equipment.
