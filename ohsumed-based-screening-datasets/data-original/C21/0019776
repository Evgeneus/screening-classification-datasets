Management of arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the forearm.
 We initially observed our patient, who had subcutaneous arginine monohydrochloride extravasation in the volar forearm, until his wound demarcation was complete.
 After wound demarcation, we proceeded with debridement and partial-thickness skin grafting.
 Upper extremity function was totally normal 3 months after this therapy.
 This is the first case report in the literature that describes a child with an arginine monohydrochloride-induced extravasation necrosis.
