Effects of TRH-analog treatment on tissue cations, phospholipids and energy metabolism after spinal cord injury.
 Effects of thyrotropin-releasing hormone analog CG3703 on biochemical changes following impact spinal cord trauma were investigated by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy, atomic absorption spectrophotometry, high-pressure liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay using parallel injury models in rabbits and rats.
 Treatment with CG3703 at 45 min after trauma in rabbits significantly attenuated decreases in intracellular pH and reversed increases in phosphodiester to phosphomonoester ratio, as shown by 31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
 The improved phosphodiester/phosphomonoester ratio was correlated with improved ATP status after treatment, although there was no improvement in aerobic bioenergetic capacity as reflected by phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphate ratios.
 In rats, treatment with CG3703 significantly reduced changes in tissue cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+) and water content following trauma, but did not significantly alter the accumulation of free fatty acids or thromboxane B2.
 Thus, the beneficial effects of treatment with thyrotropin-releasing hormone or thyrotropin-releasing hormone analogs on outcome following traumatic spinal cord injury may be due, in part, to actions relating to ion homeostasis.
