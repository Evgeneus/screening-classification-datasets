Use of orthopantomographs in forensic identification.
 Radiographs of the head region were used for identification of 17 victims during an 11-year period in the Department of Forensic Medicine, University of Turku, Finland.
 Examinations resulted in positive identification of 10 victims.
 Proof of identity of four people was based on exclusion identifications.
 In one case, comparable information supporting the identity was achieved.
 Due to insufficient ante- and postmortem material, two individuals remained unidentified by radiological methods.
 The use of orthopantomography in identification is recommended because it enables visualization of the structures of the jaws and related areas on a single radiograph.
