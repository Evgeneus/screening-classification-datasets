Mortality attributable to HIV infection/AIDS--United States, 1981-1990.
 From 1981 through 1990, 100,777 deaths among persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) were reported to CDC by local, state, and territorial health departments; almost one third (31,196) of these deaths were reported during 1990.
 During the 1980s, AIDS emerged as a leading cause of death among young adults in the United States.
 By 1988, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection/AIDS had become the third leading cause of death among men 25-44 years of age and, by 1989, was estimated to be second, surpassing heart disease, cancer, suicide, and homicide (Figure 1).
 In 1988, HIV infection/AIDS ranked eighth among causes of death among women 25-44 years of age (Figure 2); in 1991, based on current trends, HIV infection/AIDS is likely to rank among the five leading causes of death in this population (1).
