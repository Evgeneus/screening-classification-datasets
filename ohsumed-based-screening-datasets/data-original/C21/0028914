Potential for injury: trauma after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
 Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a technique that saves lives and is a measure that critical care practitioners use without hesitation.
 Potential complications from CPR, however, include injury.
 The reported incidence of such injuries ranges from 21% to more than 65%.
 Unfortunately, even properly executed CPR can lead to injury.
 The incidence of most common injuries, such as injury to the skin, bony thorax, and upper airway, may be limited by performance of proper basic and advanced life support.
 Limiting these injuries is important.
 Discovering them in successfully resuscitated victims, however, is critical to long-term recovery and rehabilitation.
 As future techniques for CPR evolve, further research needs to focus on those techniques that limit the potential for injury.
