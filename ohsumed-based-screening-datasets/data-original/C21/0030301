Acute traumatic cervical epidural hematoma from a stab wound.
 Cervical spinal epidural hematoma is an infrequent entity that usually requires emergency decompressive therapy because of rapid neurologic dysfunction.
 We present the case of a 34-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with minimal symptomatology after a stab wound to the neck.
 A computed tomography myelogram of the cervical spine revealed a cervical spinal epidural hematoma.
 This case illustrates an unusual presentation as well as etiology of cervical spinal epidural hematoma.
