Motor-evoked potentials in patients with cervical spine disorders.
 Measurements of motor-evoked potentials by means of fractionated magnetic stimulation of motor pathways to the upper limbs was performed as part of the clinical assessment in 268 patients with cervical spine disorders.
 Seventy-two percent of the 127 patients with degenerative changes of the cervical spine, 67% of the 55 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 57% of the 51 patients with trauma of the cervical spine showed a pathologic delay of central motor latency (CML).
 The data suggest that this method has a high sensitivity and therefore is recommended in the diagnosis of cervical spine disorders in patients with suspected compression of neural structures.
