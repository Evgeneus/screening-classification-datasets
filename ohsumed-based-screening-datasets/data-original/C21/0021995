Delayed pharyngoesophageal perforation: a complication of anterior spine surgery.
 Stabilization of the cervical spine is often accomplished via an anterior cervical approach.
 Bone grafts and/or plates and screws are used to achieve stabilization.
 Injuries to the pharynx and esophagus are known complications in anterior exposure of the cervical spine.
 These injuries are manifest in the early postoperative period.
 Reports of late perforations are very rare.
 We present four cases of delayed injury to the pharynx and esophagus that resulted in abscess or fistula.
 We postulate that graft displacement with resulting erosion was responsible for these serious complications.
 Postoperative odynophagia in patients who undergo anterior cervical fusion warrants evaluation of the bone graft location.
 Early surgical intervention and repair may decrease prolonged morbidity in these patients.
