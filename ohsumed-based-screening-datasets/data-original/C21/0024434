Arsenic exposures in Mississippi: a review of cases.
 Arsenic poisonings occur in Mississippi despite public education campaigns to prevent poisonings in the home.
 We reviewed 44 Mississippi cases of arsenic exposures occurring from January 1986 to May 1990.
 We compared the epidemiologic differences between unintentional and intentional poisonings.
 Cases were found and characterized through the two toxicology laboratories and hospital records.
 Arsenic-based rodenticides were the arsenic source in 23 of the 44 exposures.
 Other sources were monosodium methylarsenate (4 cases), dodecyl ammonium methane arsonate (5 cases), and other compounds (12 cases).
 Of the 44 exposures, 27 were unintentional, 7 were suicide attempts, 6 were homicide attempts, and 4 were of unknown intent.
 Of the 27 unintentionally exposed patients, 19 were black and 14 were male; their median age was 3 years.
 Of the 13 intentionally poisoned persons, 9 were male and 10 were black, with a median age of 28 years.
 Six of the seven patients who attempted suicide were white; four of the six victims of attempted homicide were black.
 We recommend removal of remaining bottles of arsenic-based rodenticides from store shelves, and we urge practicing physicians to warn patients of the dangers of using such rodenticides.
