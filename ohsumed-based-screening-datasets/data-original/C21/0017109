Chronic rupture of the Achilles tendon: a new technique of repair.
 A new operative technique is described for the treatment of patients who have a rupture of the Achilles tendon.
 The large gap between the proximal and distal stumps of the Achilles tendon in seven patients was bridged by use of the tendon of the flexor digitorum longus as the graft.
 At the most recent follow-up examination (average follow-up, thirty-nine months; range, two to six years), the result was excellent or good in six patients and fair in one.
 Postoperatively, two patients needed an adjuvant procedure: one, a local rotation flap and the other, a split-thickness skin graft.
 Both patients had excellent restoration of function.
 The patient who had a fair result had a persistent limp and residual discomfort.
 There were no re-ruptures.
