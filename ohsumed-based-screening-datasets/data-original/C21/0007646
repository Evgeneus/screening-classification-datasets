Endophthalmitis due to Sporothrix schenckii after penetrating ocular injury.
 A 13-year-old boy developed endophthalmitis from traumatic inoculation of vegetable material penetrating his right eye.
 Sporothrix schenckii was morphologically identified from the intraocular fluids.
 However, repeated attempts to culture the organism proved negative.
 Seventeen sporotrical endophthalmitis cases have so far been reported, and before this report, only one of them was secondary to trauma.
 This is the sole eye to our knowledge not only to have escaped enucleation after sporotrical endophthalmitis but to have achieved useful (20/50) vision.
