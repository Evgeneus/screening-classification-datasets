Massive bilateral diaphragmatic rupture after an apparently minor automobile accident.
 A case of massive bilateral diaphragmatic rupture following a low impact motor vehicle accident is described.
 The patient experienced herniation of intraabdominal contents into the thoracic cavity, but suffered no additional injuries.
 Few cases of bilateral diaphragmatic rupture have been reported and no cases of acute bilateral rupture have been described as an isolated injury.
 Diaphragmatic rupture in general may be a difficult injury to recognize.
 Based on our review of recent cases of diaphragmatic rupture (1979-1990), most patients presenting acutely have additional trauma (89.9%) but only vague symptoms related to their diaphragmatic insult.
 A chest roentgenogram may be a useful diagnostic tool, although many patients with diaphragmatic rupture have only nonspecific findings.
 A nasogastric tube placed prior to chest roentgenogram may enable the physician to recognize the injury more readily.
 A high index of suspicion is required to recognize diaphragmatic rupture and should be maintained for all victims of motor vehicle accidents with abnormal but nondiagnostic chest roentgenograms.
