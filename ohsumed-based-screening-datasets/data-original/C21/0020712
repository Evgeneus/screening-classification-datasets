Soft-tissue infections after trauma.
 Soft-tissue infections are best prevented by proper initial management of the wound.
 When they do occur, they produce certain characteristic physical signs, the appearance of which mandates prompt operative intervention.
 The extent of debridement is determined by the intraoperative findings.
 Diagnostic categorization of the infection is performed postoperatively on the basis of the level of soft-tissue involvement and the results of bacterial cultures.
