Revision osteoarticular allograft transplantation in weight-bearing joints. A clinical review.
 The early results of revision osteoarticular allografts in weight-bearing joints are reported.
 Sixteen consecutive patients underwent surgery over a six-year period between 1982 and 1988.
 At the time of review eight patients (50%) had surviving second allografts with an average follow-up time of 48 months (range 12 to 87).
 Five patients were graded excellent according to the Mankin scale, one good and two fair.
 Eight patients (50%) required further surgery, but only two patients came to amputation.
