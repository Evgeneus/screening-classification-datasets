Acute appendicitis following blunt abdominal trauma. Incidence or coincidence?
 Inflammation of the appendix is a common cause of acute abdominal pain.
 The etiology and pathophysiology of appendicitis have been well described.
 The initiating factor often is obstruction of the appendiceal lumen by inspissated stool, barium, food, parasites, or hyperplastic lymphoid tissue.
 Two patients have been identified who developed appendicitis temporally related to blunt abdominal trauma, without other clear etiology.
 Although absolute documentation of trauma as an etiologic factor in these cases is difficult, theoretical mechanisms for the occurrence are discussed.
 In the setting of right lower quadrant pain following mild to moderate blunt abdominal trauma, acute appendicitis should be considered as a possibility.
