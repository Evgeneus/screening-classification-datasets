Inhalation of foreign bodies in Chinese children: a review of 400 cases.
 A retrospective review of 400 Chinese children who had inhaled foreign bodies was undertaken.
 There has been a yearly increase in the total number of cases of airway foreign bodies removed in our hospital.
 Fifty-eight percent of the children presenting were from the countryside; 42% were townspeople.
 Approximately 90% of the patients were under 3 years of age, with the peak incidence of foreign body inhalation occurring between 1 and 2 years of age (57.8%).
 The male-female ratio was about 1.2:1.
 About 95% of the removed foreign bodies were organic in origin.
 The majority of the foreign bodies were found most often in the right bronchial tree (46%).
 A positive history of foreign body inhalation was obtained in 98% of the cases.
 Twenty-eight percent of the children presented at the hospital within 24 hours, 71% within 1 week, and 29% more than 1 week after inhaling the foreign body.
 The most common presenting symptoms of laryngotracheal foreign bodies were cough, wheezing, dyspnea, and hoarseness; those of bronchial foreign bodies were cough, wheezing, decreased air entry, and rhonchi.
 More than two-thirds of the children with larygotracheal foreign bodies had normal x-ray findings.
 The most common fluoroscopic findings in those children with bronchial foreign bodies were mediastinal shift (36.8%), obstructive emphysema (35.7%), and normal findings (35%).
 A total of 348 (87%) bronchial foreign bodies were removed by rigid bronchoscopy (81%), rod-lens bronchoscopy (5%), and spontaneous expulsion (1%); 52 (13%) laryngeal and tracheal foreign bodies were removed by direct laryngoscopy (12%) and tracheotomy (1%).
 A single endoscopic procedure successfully removed 92.5% of 400 foreign bodies detected in the airways.
 One child died during bronchoscopy, for a mortality rate of 0.25%.
