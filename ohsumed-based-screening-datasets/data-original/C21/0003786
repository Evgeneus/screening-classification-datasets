Retroperitoneal air after routine hemorrhoidectomy. Report of a case.
 Retroperitoneal air as a complication after routine hemorrhoidectomy has not been reported in the literature.
 This occurred recently after hemorrhoidectomy in a 34-year-old patient receiving glucocorticoid therapy for rheumatoid arthritis.
 Adverse steroidal effects of wound healing have been well documented.
 It is believed that steroid-induced tissue changes contributed to the development of this unique complication.
