The value of brainstem auditory evoked potentials in early diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy.
 Statistical analysis of the interpeak latencies of brainstem auditory evoked potentials (BAEP) shows that a delayed IPL I-V is a very sensitive indicator for an early diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy.
 In cases of uncomplicated delirium tremens no significant deviations of BAEP were found.
