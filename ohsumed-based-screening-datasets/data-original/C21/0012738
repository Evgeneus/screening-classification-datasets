Primary intramedullary nailing of open femoral shaft fractures.
 The cases of 60 patients with 63 open femoral fractures treated by primary reamed intramedullary nailing were retrospectively reviewed.
 Twenty-two were classified as Type I open fractures, 26 as Type II and 15 as Type III open fractures by Gustilo's classification.
 All fractures were treated by wound debridement followed by immediate reamed intramedullary nailing.
 There were five early soft-tissue infections and three late deep infections.
 Of the late infections, only one was osteomyelitis (1.6%).
 There were three nonunions and seven malunions.
 All of the complications were dealt with effectively by standard methods.
 We concluded that primary reamed intramedullary nailing is an effective alternative for the treatment of Type I and II open femur fractures and for Type III open femur fractures associated with multiple trauma.
