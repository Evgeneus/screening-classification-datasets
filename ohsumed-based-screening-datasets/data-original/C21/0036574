Is outcome worse in a small volume Canadian trauma centre?
 The minimum number of seriously injured patients required to maintain clinical competence and achieve acceptable clinical competence in a single trauma centre is unknown.
 It has been suggested that the probability of survival is improved in hospitals treating greater than 200 trauma patients annually.
 We sought to determine if probability of survival was lower in our small volume centre.
 Between 1986 and 1989, 752 (522 male, 230 female; average age, 36 years) trauma patients were admitted to our institution.
 The major mechanism of injury was blunt (89%).
 All patients underwent trauma severity scoring.
 Trauma Score, Injury Severity Score, and a Revised Trauma Score were used to derived the probability of survival by the TRISS method.
 The mean Injury Severity Score was 23.3 and the mean Trauma Score was 13.2.
 The overall mortality rate was 15.8%.
 The Z statistic demonstrated no significant difference between actual and predicted deaths for the 4-year period or for any individual year (range, -1.05 to 1.26, p greater than 0.05).
 The M statistic was 0.753.
 We conclude that, despite fewer trauma patient admissions (less than 200 per year), comparable clinical results can be achieved by surgeons dedicated to trauma management.
