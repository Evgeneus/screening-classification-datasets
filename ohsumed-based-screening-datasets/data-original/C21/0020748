Stroke after heavy marijuana smoking.
 I examined two young men who developed cerebral infarction associated with heavy marijuana smoking.
 Both were light tobacco smokers, but they did not drink alcohol or use other street drugs.
 Diagnostic work-up for nonatherosclerotic causes of stroke was unremarkable.
 I postulate that marijuana-associated alterations in systemic blood pressure resulted in vasospasm, leading to strokes in these patients.
