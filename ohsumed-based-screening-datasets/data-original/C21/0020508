Pediatric bicycle trauma.
 Bicycle-related trauma is a serious pediatric problem.
 Serious injuries and even fatalities can occur, and care must be taken to avoid undertreating these patients.
 In an effort to further define the problem, 201 consecutive patients admitted for bicycle trauma were reviewed.
 The patients ranged in age from 3 to 16 years and 76% (153/201) were male.
 Head trauma was the most common admission diagnosis (99/201; 49%).
 Fourteen per cent (28/201) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and 23% (47/201) required an operative procedure.
 The average hospital stay was 3 days; however, patients who were admitted at least 24 hours after injury had an average hospital stay of 7 days.
