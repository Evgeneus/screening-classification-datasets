Initial dosage regimens of gentamicin in patients with burns.
 For 95 patients with burns the gentamicin dosage regimen necessary to achieve optimal serum concentrations was determined.
 Individual elimination rates and distribution volumes for gentamicin were determined and correlated with renal function parameters and age.
 In patients with burns who had normal serum creatinine levels (less than 1.5 mg/dl), gentamicin clearance and thus dosage regimens can be stratified by age.
 Gentamicin's clearance decreased inversely with age.
 Initial dosage guidelines were calculated for different age groups of patients with normal levels of serum creatinine.
 The guidelines were developed to assist the clinician in attaining therapeutic concentrations with initial doses of gentamicin.
 Therapeutic serum concentrations were reached in most patients with burns dosed by these guidelines.
 Serum gentamicin concentrations should always be monitored during therapy, and dosages should be adjusted to ensure optimal concentrations during the course of therapy.
