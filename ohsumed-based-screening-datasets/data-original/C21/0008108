Why use drains?
 There is no firm published evidence to support the use of closed suction drains.
 Over 20 years ago, large studies by the Public Health Laboratory Service and the National Research Council found that drains were risk factors for wound infection.
 A prospective randomised study of the use of closed suction drains after surgery for fractured neck of femur in 70 patients failed to show that drains improved wound healing.
 Drained cases had more complications.
