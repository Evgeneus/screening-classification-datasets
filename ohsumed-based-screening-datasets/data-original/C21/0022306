Age-related effects of chronic ethanol intake on vitamin A status in Fisher 344 rats.
 The present study was designed to investigate the interaction of age and ethanol on vitamin A status in rats.
 Rats aged 2 and 19 mo were fed a liquid diet containing 36% of total energy as ethanol or pair-fed a diet containing isoenergetic carbohydrate in place of ethanol.
 After 3 wk older rats had lower serum retinol (P = 0.04) and higher vitamin A concentrations in liver (P = 0.0001), esophagus (P = 0.0001) and the proximal (P = 0.03) and distal (P = 0.0001) colon than younger animals.
 Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450, retinyl ester hydrolase (REH) and cellular retinol-binding protein (cRBP) were significantly reduced; acyl coenzyme A: retinol acyltransferase (ARAT) was increased; and alcohol (retinol) dehydrogenase (ADH) activity was unchanged with age.
 Ethanol ingestion increased serum retinol as well as esophageal and colonic vitamin A levels in both age groups.
 Hepatic cRBP decreased further in the older rats with ethanol feeding, but no change was noted in the percentage of hepatic vitamin A as retinol or retinyl esters.
 Ethanol ingestion decreased REH (P = 0.0001) and ARAT activities (P = 0.02) and increased cytochrome P-450 (P = 0.04) but had no effect on the activity of ADH in either age group.
 These data indicate that, regardless of age, chronic ethanol ingestion significantly alters the tissue distribution of vitamin A; however, ethanol reduced cRBP levels only in older rats.
