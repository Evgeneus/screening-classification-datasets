Special considerations in the management of a patient with multiple sclerosis and a burn injury.
 The purposes of this report were to describe a successful treatment of a burn injury in a patient with multiple sclerosis as well as to outline specific aspects of therapy that contributed to minimizing the risk of complications in this challenging patient.
 Multiple sclerosis is the leading cause of neurologic morbidity and death among young adults.
 It is an inflammatory disease of the central nervous system that involves the autonomic and somatic components and is characterized by a primary destruction of myelin.
 The demyelinated nerves exhibit an increased temperature sensitivity that accounts for the adverse effects of elevated core temperature on the neurologic signs and symptoms of this disease.
 Because burn injury, infection, and vigorous exercise elicit an elevation of core temperature with an accompanying deterioration in neurologic function, lowering the elevated core body temperature is mandatory.
 The dysautonomias of multiple sclerosis may be as devastating as their somatic counterparts and may have life-threatening implications.
 In recent years, advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of central nervous system dysfunction have enabled physicians to improve dramatically the management of symptoms in multiple sclerosis without significantly altering the progressive long-term course of the disease.
