Acute poisoning with bromofosmethyl (bromophos).
 One hour after suicidal ingestion of about 20 mL of a 38% solution of bromofosmethyl, CAS: 2104-96-3 (bromophos), a 52 year-old female was admitted to the hospital with extreme miosis, hypersalivation, hyperperistalsis and muscular fibrillation.
 Gastric lavage was performed and activated charcoal administered.
 Cholinergic symptoms were antagonized by repeated doses of 0.5 mg atropine.
 Because of the high dose of bromophos, hemoperfusion was performed with amberlite XAD4.
 The bromophos clearance during hemoperfusion was 95 mL/min (flow 200 mL/min).
 The patient received two doses of 500 mg obidoxime for recurrent muscular fibrillation.
 The further clinical course was uneventful.
 On day 4, the patient was transferred to a psychiatric ward because of persistent suicidality.
 In contrast to poisoning by most organophosphates, red blood cell acetyl cholinesterase was only minimally depressed but the plasma butyryl cholinesterase was initially decreased and normalized within a few days.
 The records of 25 patients reported to our Poison Control Center with ingestion of more than 1 g bromophos were also evaluated.
 The most frequent symptoms were miosis, hyperperistalsis, hypersalivation, agitation, nausea/vomiting and convulsions.
 Nine of the patients had no symptoms.
 Bromophos is relatively less toxic than its phosphate derivative, parathion.
