Effect of succinylcholine on the intraocular contents of open globes.
 The use of succinylcholine in patients with suspected or proven open globes is considered dangerous by some for fear of extruding the intra-ocular contents as a consequence of the co-contraction of the extraocular muscles it produces.
 To test this hypothesis, the authors devised an anterior and a posterior trauma model in the cat eye.
 Thirty events were studied using the anterior trauma model and eight with the posterior model.
 The only observable effect of succinylcholine administration was forward displacement of the lens and iris.
 No intraocular content was lost in any event.
 The authors believe this study supports the argument that, when indicated, succinylcholine may be considered in open globes.
