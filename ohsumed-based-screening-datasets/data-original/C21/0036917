Fluoxetine in the treatment of borderline and schizotypal personality disorders.
 Twenty-two patients meeting the criteria for borderline or schizotypal personality disorder or both participated in a prospective, nonblind 12-week trial of fluoxetine.
 There were significant reductions in self-injury and in scores on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist regardless of diagnosis.
 The results suggest that controlled trials of fluoxetine and investigations of the serotonergic system in these disorders would be useful.
