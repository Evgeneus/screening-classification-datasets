Successful management of an adult lightning victim using intracranial pressure monitoring.
 Serious central nervous system injuries after lightning strikes are fortunately rare.

 We describe the successful neurological resuscitation and critical care management using intracranial pressure monitoring of an adult who sustained a lightning strike.
 The role of intracranial pressure monitoring in this setting is discussed.
