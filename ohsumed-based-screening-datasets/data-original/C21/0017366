Antisocial alcoholics: are there clinically significant diagnostic subtypes?
 Of 360 alcoholic male inpatients assessed with a diagnostic interview, 106 (29%) were found to have a co-occurring diagnosis of antisocial personality.
 Of these ASP alcoholics, 86 were further subdivided into those with only ASP and alcoholism (n = 38), those with ASP, alcoholism and drug dependence (n = 30) and those with ASP, alcoholism and depression (n = 18; 9 of whom also had drug abuse).
 Comparisons among the three antisocial groups indicated that they differed in measures of psychopathology and course and severity of alcoholism.
 When the ASP groups were compared to an alcoholism only group, an earlier onset, more rapid course and increased percentage of many alcoholism symptoms were found in the ASP groups, confirming the findings of other studies.
