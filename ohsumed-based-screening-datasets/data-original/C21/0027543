Blast injury to the thoracic esophagus.
 Blast injury causing pneumatic disruption of the esophagus is a rare and potentially lethal injury.
 The mortality and morbidity rate are high unless the injury is promptly recognized and treated.
 Our experience with a midesophageal perforation resulting from a blast injury emphasizes the importance of awareness of this condition and of the chest radiograph in making an early diagnosis.
