Long-term nervous system damage from radiation of the spinal cord: an electrophysiological study.
 A group of 13 patients suffering from Hodgkin's disease who had undergone chemotherapy and radiotherapy (above and below the diaphragm) approximately 10 years earlier was studied.
 The total chemotherapeutic dose was similar for all patients; the radiotherapy dose, however, was standard for 7 patients, while the other 6 received much higher dosages over limited regions of the spinal cord.
 Although most of these patients appeared normal both clinically and on magnetic resonance imaging, a neurophysiological study was performed to determine whether there was any involvement of the central or peripheral nervous system.
 Motor conduction velocity and sensory conduction velocity were measured in the lower limbs as well as spinal- and scalp-recorded somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) in response to stimulation of the posterior tibial and sural nerves at the ankle.
 In addition, motor evoked potentials were recorded from the upper and lower limbs during cortical stimulation.
 All neurophysiological data were normal in patients who had received a standard radiation dose, while most of those who had been exposed to higher doses showed altered cortical SEPs and a slowing of central conduction time (D10-P1).
 Thus even though they were asymptomatic, these patients appeared to have sustained CNS damage, mainly at the level of the spinal cord.
