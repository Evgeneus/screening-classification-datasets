Acute in vivo effects of low ethanol concentration on the capacity of urea synthesis in rats.
 We studied the effect of acute exposure, by constant intravenous infusion, to a low blood ethanol concentration (range 8-14 mmol/l) on the in vivo capacity of urea-N synthesis (CUNS), alanine elimination, and the nitrogen retention in fed and fasted rats.
 Alanine was infused to obtain a constant blood concentration of alpha-amino nitrogen between 7.3 and 11.7 mmol/l, at which concentrations urea synthesis is at maximum.
 CUNS was calculated after nephrectomy as accumulation of urea in body water, elimination of alanine as alanine infusion rate corrected for accumulation, and nitrogen retention as the difference.
 In the fed state ethanol decreased CUNS from 7.84 +/- 0.32 mumol N/(min 100 g body weight (BW] (mean +/- SEM) (n = 7) to 6.30 +/- 0.58 (n = 6) (p less than 0.001) and in the fasted state from 8.25 +/- 0.27 mumol N/(min 100 g BW) (n = 10) to 6.90 +/- 0.25 (n = 10) (p less than 0.001).
 In the fed state ethanol increased the elimination of alanine from 6.49 +/- 0.28 mumol/(min 100 g BW) (n = 7) to 6.95 +/- 0.25 (n = 6) (p less than 0.01), and in the fasted state decreased it from 6.25 +/- 0.12 mumol/(min 100 g BW) (n = 10) to 5.67 +/- 0.20 (n = 10) (p less than .001).
