Delayed presentation of unstable cervical spine injury with minimal symptoms.
 Emergency physicians are less likely to suspect the presence of a severe or unstable cervical spine injury in patients who have been ambulatory since the traumatic episode.
 We present the case of a man with multiple cervical fractures and a 75% anterior subluxation of C6 and C7 who did not seek medical care for six weeks after falling from a height.
 Previous reports of delayed or occult cervical spine injuries are reviewed.
 Physicians must aggressively search for injuries whenever a history of neck pain is present or a strong mechanism of injury exists, even if the patient has been ambulatory for days or weeks following the injury.
