Results of knee manipulations after anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions.
 We analyzed the results of knee manipulations in 42 knees that had persistent flexion or extension deficits after intraarticular ACL reconstructions.
 All manipulations were done under a spinal or general anesthetic and, in 10 cases, arthroscopic debridement of adhesions also was performed.
 The average time from reconstruction to manipulation was 7 months (range, 3 to 14 months) and the average followup was 26 months (range, 6 to 56 months).
 At manipulation, average flexion was increased from 95 degrees to 136 degrees and average extension from 11 degrees to 3 degrees.
 In no case was motion gained at the expense of joint stability and, at final followup, average flexion and extension were 127 degrees and 4 degrees, respectively.
 The final range of motion achieved was not affected by the time to manipulation, severity of premanipulation flexion deficit, or concomitant arthroscopic debridement of adhesions.
 However, knees with premanipulation extension deficits of greater than or equal to 15 degrees achieved significantly less final extension than knees with lesser premanipulation deficits.
 Overall, manipulations were a safe and effective method for improving both flexion and extension in 86% of the knees that had restricted motion after ACL reconstructions.
