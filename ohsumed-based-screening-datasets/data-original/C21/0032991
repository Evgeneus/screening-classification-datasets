Nonthermal surgical complications in burn patients.
 Patients with severe burn injuries are generally admitted to specialized units and managed by physicians who specialize in burn care.
 Complications requiring operative intervention and not directly related to the burn wound occur frequently but are easily overlooked.
 To determine the nature and frequency of these complications, we conducted a retrospective study of all burn cases in our burn unit over a 5-year period.
 Twenty-three of the 309 patients (7%) had 45 complications not related directly to the burn wound and required surgical intervention or consultation.
 The population with surgical complications was generally older (52 vs 42 years), more severely burned (36% vs 25% total body surface area), and had a higher mortality (44% vs 13%).
 Sixteen of the 23 patients with complications had a single surgical problem, while seven patients sustained multiple complications.
 In six of the 10 deaths, the surgical complication was believed to be either directly related or significantly contributory to the cause of death.
 Because the number of burn patients requiring surgical intervention is high, burn patients must be thoroughly examined for possible complications.
