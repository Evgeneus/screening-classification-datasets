Prevalence, onset, and risk of psychiatric disorders in men with chronic low back pain: a controlled study.
 This study used structured diagnostic interviews and DSM-III criteria to assess lifetime prevalence and pre-morbid risk of psychiatric disorder in a sample of men with long-standing chronic back pain (CLPB) attending a primary care clinic.
 A control group of age and demographically matched men without history of back pain was also studied.
 Compared to controls, men with CLBP had significantly higher lifetime rates of major depression (32% vs.
 16%), alcohol use disorder (64.9% vs.
 38.8%), and a major anxiety disorder (30.9% vs.
 14.3%).
 Almost all CLBP men ever experiencing a mood disorder reported recurrent, not single, episodes.
 The 6 month point prevalence of major depression, but not other disorders, was also significantly elevated for men with CLBP.
 In CLBP, the first episode of major depression generally (58.1%) followed pain onset.
 While the initial major depressive episode usually commenced within the first 2 years of established pain, late onset mood disorder was also common.
 By comparison in most cases (81%) onset of alcohol use disorders considerably preceded pain.
 When an age-matching procedure was used to gauge relative vulnerability to psychiatric illness in patients and controls, CLBP patients had significantly higher pre-pain rates of alcohol use disorder but not depression.
 After age of pain onset, CLBP subjects had over 9 times the risk of developing major depression, but had similar rates of developing alcoholism.
 We conclude that (1) alcohol use disorders rather than depression may increase risk of developing CLBP, and (2) risk of new onset and recurrent major depression remains high for men throughout their pain career.
 This suggests that psychological adaptation to long-standing pain may be less successful than previously thought, especially with regard to recurrent mood disorder.
