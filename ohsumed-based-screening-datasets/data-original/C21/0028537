Whipple procedure for trauma: is duct ligation a safe alternative to pancreaticojejunostomy?
 The use of pancreatic duct ligation (DL) during a Whipple procedure for trauma has been reported but not analyzed.
 We reviewed 13 cases of DL and compared the results with that reported for the Whipple procedure for trauma with pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ).
 The mortality rate of DL was 53.8%.
 Pancreatitis occurred in three cases (23.1%) and caused one death.
 Pancreatic fistulae occurred in 50% of patients surviving two or more days after DL.
 No long-term survivor developed overt diabetes mellitus.
 Malabsorption occurred in 50% of the long-term survivors of DL.
 When the DL and PJ groups were compared no statistically significant difference could be found in either mortality or pancreatic morbidity.
 The 46.2% survival rate for DL warrants its consideration as a technique available to trauma surgeons when faced with an unstable patient unable to tolerate further operative therapy.
