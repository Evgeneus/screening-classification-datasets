A radiographic approach to diffuse lung disease.
 The chest radiograph remains the first and foremost imaging modality used in the assessment of patients who have diffuse lung disease.
 An optimal approach to the radiograph requires an understanding of pulmonary anatomy and pathophysiology of disease.
 The assessment of the radiograph can be based on an anatomic or a descriptive approach.
 Associated abnormalities, including pleural effusion, pneumothorax, lymphadenopathy, and so forth, also influence the differential diagnosis.
 This article presents a basic radiologic approach to diffuse lung diseases.
