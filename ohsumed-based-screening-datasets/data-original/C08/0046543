Impact of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 on tuberculosis in rural Haiti.
 We conducted a case-control study to determine the relative and attributable risk of HIV seropositivity for bacillary-positive (smear and/or culture) pulmonary tuberculosis in Haiti.
 There were 274 patients with tuberculosis and an equal number of control subjects.
 Antibodies to HIV were present in 67 (24%) patients and eight (3%) control subjects.
 Odds ratios suggested that the risk of pulmonary tuberculosis was 15.7 times as great (95% confidence interval, 4.8 to 5.0; p less than 0.05) in patients 20 to 39 yr of age who were HIV-seropositive than in HIV-seronegative patients.
 In contrast, the relative risk in those 40 to 59 yr of age was elevated (3.0 times), though not significantly (lower 95% confidence interval, 0.8).
 In the 20- to 39-yr age group, 31% of tuberculosis was attributable to HIV infection (95% confidence interval between 23 and 39%).
 HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients did not differ with respect to sputum smear positivity.
 HIV-seronegative patients were twice as likely to be infected with resistant organisms, though this was not significant.
 We conclude that HIV infection is a major risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis in young adult residents of Haiti.
 This, together with the fact that similar proportions of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative patients were potentially infectious, suggests that without vigorous counteraction tuberculosis will become a greater problem for Haiti.
