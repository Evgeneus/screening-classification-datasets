Pulmonary edema presenting as positive vitreous pressure.
 The ocular causes of increased vitreous pressure during intraocular surgery are well known.
 It can also be precipitated by systemic causes.
 We describe a patient whose first manifestation of pulmonary edema was forward bowing of the iris and posterior capsule and to increased vitreous pressure.
 The possible perioperative causes that may contribute to the production of pulmonary edema are examined.
 Recommendations for dealing with these are presented.
