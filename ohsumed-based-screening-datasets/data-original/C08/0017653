Deferoxamine and eflornithine (DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine) in a rat model of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 The iron chelator deferoxamine and the polyamine biosynthesis inhibitor eflornithine (DL-alpha-difluoromethylornithine) were examined for anti-Pneumocystis carinii activity in the rat model of P.
 carinii pneumonia.
 The activity of deferoxamine at 250, 500, and 1,000 mg/kg given intraperitoneally provides evidence that iron chelation is a promising novel approach to P.
 carinii chemotherapy.
 Results with eflornithine at 2, 3, and 4% in drinking water confirm and extend previously reported activity in the rat model.
