Plastic bronchitis: an old disease revisited.
 Expectoration of bronchial casts (plastic bronchitis) is an uncommon but ancient problem.
 Herein we describe a 40-year-old man, with no prior lung disease, who had dyspnea, cough, and expectoration of long branching bronchial casts.
 No specific cause was delineated, although special stains for eosinophilic granule major basic protein demonstrated occasional foci of eosinophils and small amounts of extracellular major basic protein in the bronchial casts.
 Various diseases, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis, have been associated with the formation of bronchial casts and should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
 Although most previously reported cases have been associated with some type of pulmonary disease, our patient had no evidence of an underlying pulmonary disorder.
