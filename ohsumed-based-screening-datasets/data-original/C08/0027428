Endoscopic laser therapy for obstructing tracheobronchial lesions.
 The Lahey Clinic experience using laser bronchoscopy for relief of obstructive tracheobronchial lesions during a 7-year period from 1982 to 1989 involves 269 patients treated with 400 procedures.
 The carbon dioxide (CO2) laser was used for tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue.
 The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for all obstructing endobronchial neoplasms.
 Indications for therapy included severe dyspnea, hemoptysis, and postobstructive pneumonitis.
 All patients had relatively central lesions.
 A rigid bronchoscope was used to treat 88% of patients, and 12% of patients were treated with a flexible bronchoscope.
 One death occurred during the intraoperative period.
 Eleven deaths occurred within 1 week of therapy and were related to the presence of extensive malignant lesions or to coronary artery disease.
 Our experience indicates that bronchoscopic application of the CO2 or Nd:YAG laser affords effective palliation for patients with obstructive tracheobronchial lesions.
 The Nd:YAG laser is recommended for patients with bulky vascular endobronchial neoplasms, and the CO2 laser is best reserved for patients with benign tracheal stenosis and granulation tissue.
