High-dose carmustine and autologous bone marrow reinfusion in the treatment of refractory or relapsed small cell lung carcinoma.
 Fourteen patients with small cell carcinoma of the lung in relapse or with disease refractory to chemotherapy were treated with carmustine (BCNU) at doses of 600 to 1000 mg/m2 intravenously followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation.
 All patients previously were treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and etoposide.
 Seven of the 14 patients responded to the high-dose BCNU (50% response with 95% confidence limits ranging from 23% to 77%).
 Three patients had a complete response, and four had a partial response.
 Regrowth of tumor occurred within 60 days of treatment in the responding patients.
 Death occurred in six patients before the recovery of the platelet count to 50,000 cells/microliters.
 Although the response rate was high, the toxicity was excessive.
 In the dosage range of 600 to 1000 mg/m2 in heavily pretreated patients, BCNU is not recommended, but additional investigation may be warranted in patients with central nervous system metastases who previously were treated with radiation therapy.
