Upper airway obstruction from AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.
 Kaposi's sarcoma occurs in the head and neck region, commonly in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 This tumor may also involve oromucosal surfaces, but only rarely leads to upper airway obstruction.
 When such obstruction develops, the emergency physician must be aware of the attendant problems of surgical manipulation and radiotherapy.
