Predictors of neurodevelopmental outcome following bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 In infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, the influence of the severity of their pulmonary disease on neurodevelopmental outcome is unknown.
 Neurodevelopmental outcomes at a mean age of 36 months were assessed in 27 premature subjects who had bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 Subjects had a mean birth weight of 940 g (range, 540 to 1690 g) and a mean gestational age of 27 weeks (range, 25 to 31 weeks).
 The duration of mechanical ventilation ranged from 22 to 128 days, and the duration of requirement of supplemental oxygen ranged from 34 to 1033 days.
 No significant correlations were found between duration of mechanical ventilation or oxygen therapy and overall neurodevelopmental outcome.
 In contrast, cranial ultrasound findings of intracranial hemorrhage and/or periventricular echodensity related specifically to poorer cognitive outcome.
 By age 3 years, severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia is not a sufficient predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome.
 Intracranial hemorrhage and periventricular echodensity continue to be important predictors.
