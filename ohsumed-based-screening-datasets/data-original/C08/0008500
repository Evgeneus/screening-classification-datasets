Role of small calibre chest tube drainage for iatrogenic pneumothorax.
 A 2 mm Teflon catheter was used as a chest tube in 28 patients with iatrogenic pneumothorax.
 Frequent aspirations through the catheter were performed in 16 of the patients.
 In the remaining 12 patients the catheter was connected to a one way flutter valve.
 The treatment was successful in 27 of the 28 patients--one patient required a large calibre chest tube.
 The mean drainage time was 48 hours.
 The small catheter technique is superior to the use of a large intercostal drain as it is much less traumatic and troublesome.
 The small calibre chest tube with a one way valve is recommended as a safe and easy technique.
