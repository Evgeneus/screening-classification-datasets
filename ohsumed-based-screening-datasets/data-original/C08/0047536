Effects of PEEP on pulmonary hemodynamics in intact dogs with oleic acid pulmonary edema.
 The effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on the pulmonary circulation were studied in 14 intact anesthetized dogs with oleic acid (OA) lung injury.
 Transmural (tm) mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)/cardiac index (Q) plots with transmural left atrial pressure (Pla) kept constant were constructed in seven dogs, and Ppa(tm)/PEEP plots with Q and Pla(tm) kept constant were constructed in seven other dogs.
 Q was manipulated by using a femoral arteriovenous bypass and a balloon catheter inserted in the inferior vena cava.
 Pla was manipulated using a balloon catheter placed by thoracotomy in the left atrium.
 Ppa(tm)/Q plots were essentially linear.
 Before OA, the linearly extrapolated pressure intercept of the Ppa(tm)/Q relationship approximated Pla(tm).
 OA (0.09 ml/kg into the right atrium) produced a parallel shift of the Ppa(tm)/Q relationship to higher pressures; i.e., the extrapolated pressure intercept increased while the slope was not modified.
 After OA, 4 Torr PEEP (5.4 cmH2O) had no effect on the Ppa(tm)/Q relationship and 10 Torr PEEP (13.6 cmH2O) produced a slight, not significant, upward shift of this relationship.
 Changing PEEP from 0 to 12 Torr (16.3 cmH2O) at constant Q before OA led to an almost linear increase of Ppa(tm) from 14 +/- 1 to 19 +/- 1 mmHg.
 After OA, Ppa(tm) increased at 0 Torr PEEP but changing PEEP from 0 to 12 Torr did not significantly affect Ppa(tm), which increased from 19 +/- 1 to 20 +/- 1 mmHg.
 These data suggest that moderate levels of PEEP minimally aggravate the pulmonary hypertension secondary to OA lung injury.
