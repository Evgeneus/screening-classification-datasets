Plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations in acute respiratory failure associated with sepsis: preliminary study.
 Plasma alpha-atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-ANP) concentrations were measured during mechanical ventilation in nine patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) associated with sepsis.
 The relationships between alpha-ANP and pulmonary hemodynamic variables were examined.
 A total of 22 measurements of alpha-ANP and other variables were obtained.
 The mean plasma alpha-ANP concentration of 22 measurements was 120.1 +/- 79.8 pg/ml (normal 31.7 +/- 12.0, mean +/- SD).
 Plasma alpha-ANP concentrations correlated with mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) (r = .703, p less than .01) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) (r = .606, p less than .01), but not with other variables.
 These findings suggest that alpha-ANP elevation may be related to the increases in MPAP and PVR in ARF associated with sepsis.
