Nasal schwannoma.
 A 36-year-old man with a nasal septal mass is presented.
 The diagnosis of a benign neoplasm arising from peripheral nerve Schwann cells was made by excisional biopsy.
 A benign nerve sheath tumor may be either a schwannoma or neurofibroma.
 Schwannomas may be distinguished from neurofibroma by clinical and histologic criteria.
 Malignant degeneration and intracranial extension may complicate the course of a nasal schwannoma.
 Complete excision is the preferred therapy.
