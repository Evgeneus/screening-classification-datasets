Pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis.
 The presentation of a patient with multiple pulmonary nodules with or without cavitation and often with signs of a multisystemic vasculitis should suggest one of the pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis syndromes.
 The five conditions traditionally considered together in the category of pulmonary angiitis and granulomatosis differ widely in their cause and pathogenesis and are more appropriately considered as variants or relatives of other processes.
 The radiologic features of this group of diseases, however, are similar, and it is useful to still consider them together.
 Table 1 summarizes the radiologic features of these conditions.
