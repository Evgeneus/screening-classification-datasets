New device for percutaneous fragmentation of pulmonary emboli.
 A new catheter system was designed for percutaneous fragmentation of large pulmonary emboli.
 The device consists of an impeller rotating at high speed at the center of a self-expandable basket at the tip of a 7-F catheter.
 The highly flexible catheter was able to reach all tested embolus sites in a glass model of the pulmonary arterial tree.
 Embolus fragmentation was quick and thorough.
 Particles in the effluent larger than 10 microns accounted for only about 9% of the treated embolus weight.
 Wall contact with the rotating impeller was not observed.
 The impeller-basket catheter promises to be a useful tool for percutaneous treatment of acute pulmonary embolism.
