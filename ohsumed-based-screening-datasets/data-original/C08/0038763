Improved survival after resection of pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma 
 The value of resecting pulmonary metastases from malignant melanoma was retrospectively examined.
 Between 1981 and 1989, 56 patients (35 men and 21 women with a mean age of 49 years) had 65 pulmonary resections for histologically proven metastatic melanoma after treatment of the primary tumor.
 In patients undergoing thoracotomy, 50% (28/56) had pulmonary metastases as the initial site of recurrence.
 Twenty-eight patients (50%) had local-regional recurrence before the development of lung metastases.
 Eight lobectomies, two segmentectomies, and 55 wedge excisions were done.
 Fifty-four patients (54/56, 96%) underwent complete resection, and there were no operative deaths.
 The postthoracotomy actuarial survival was 25% at 5 years (median interval, 18 months).
 Location of the primary tumor, histology, thickness, Clark level, local-regional lymph node metastases, or type of resection was not associated with improved survival.
 Patients without regional nodal metastases before thoracotomy had a median survival of 30 months compared with 16 months for all others (p = 0.04).
 Patients with lung as the site of first recurrence had a median survival of 30 months compared with 17 months for patients with initial local-regional recurrence (p = 0.038, log-rank test).
 Despite systemic spread, patients with isolated pulmonary metastases from melanoma may benefit from metastasectomy.
