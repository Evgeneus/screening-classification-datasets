Persistent generation of peptido leukotrienes in patients with the adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 The time course of leukotriene generation in the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was investigated by measurement of urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4) excretion, the major urinary LT metabolite in humans.
 Sequential measurements were made in nine subjects entered into the study within 48 h of the onset of ARDS, defined by an arterial/alveolar PO2 ratio of less than 0.3 and radiographic evidence of diffuse bilateral pulmonary edema.
 Initial urinary LTE4 excretion was significantly elevated (1.250 +/- 0.050 ng/mg creatinine sulphate; n = 7) compared with a non-ARDS postoperative group (0.254 +/- 0.114 ng/mg; n = 5) and normal control subjects (0.035 +/- 0.010 ng/mg; n = 12).
 LTE4 excretion in the first 24 h was estimated to be 6.9 micrograms, representing a release of 0.1 micrograms/kg/h of peptido leukotrienes into the bloodstream.
 These values were physiologically important based on a comparison with the increased urinary LTE4 excretion observed after antigen-induced bronchoconstriction in allergic asthmatics (baseline LTE4, 0.06 +/- 0.04 ng/mg; postantigen, 0.56 +/- 0.14 ng/mg; 0.17 micrograms LTE4/24 h; n = 8).
 In subjects with ARDS, this pathologic LTE4 excretion persisted during a subsequent 5-day study period.
 Leukotriene E4 excretion was associated with persistent abnormalities in gas exchange, pulmonary edema, and lung compliance, suggesting an important role for peptido leukotrienes in the pathophysiology of ARDS.
