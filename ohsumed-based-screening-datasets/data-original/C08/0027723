Extent of pulmonary emphysema in man and its relation to the loss of elastic recoil.
 1.
 We assessed lung density, determined by computerized tomography, as a measure of emphysema and related this to lung function and measurement of the elastic recoil of the lung in normal subjects and patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.
 2.
 We found a significant correlation between measurements of elastic recoil pressure at 90% of total lung capacity and both the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (r = 0.80, P less than 0.001) and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (r = 0.70, P less than 0.001).
 Measurements of elastic recoil of the lung also correlated with lung density as measured by computerized tomography scanning (P less than 0.001).
 3.
 Multiple regression analysis demonstrated a correlation between the density of the lowest fifth percentile of the computerized tomography lung-density histogram, and both the natural logarithm of the shape parameter of the pressure-volume curve (P less than 0.01), and the transfer factor for carbon monoxide (P less than 0.01).
 However, the mean computerized tomography lung density correlated, in addition, with the elastic recoil pressure of the lungs at 90% of total lung capacity (P less than 0.001).
 4.
 Since the elastic recoil pressure correlates with computerized tomography lung density, and hence with emphysema, and since elastic recoil pressure also correlates with the forced expiratory volume in 1 s, these results suggest that loss of elastic recoil is one determinant of airflow limitation in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease.
