Activity of temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens.
 The activity of the quinolone temafloxacin against respiratory pathogens was compared with those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin.
 MICs for 90% of strains tested indicated that temafloxacin was at least two- to fourfold more potent than the other two quinolones against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila.
 Temafloxacin had potency equal to that of ciprofloxacin and was twofold more active than ofloxacin against Streptococcus pyogenes.
 Moraxella catarrhalis, and Bordetella pertussis.
 Against Haemophilus influenzae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, temafloxacin was four- and twofold less potent than ciprofloxacin, respectively.
 When administered orally in mouse protection tests against S.
 aureus, S.
 pneumoniae, and S.
 pyogenes, temafloxacin was at least eight times more potent than ciprofloxacin and was two to four times more active than ofloxacin.
 Against H.
 influenzae, temafloxacin was as active as ofloxacin and was two times less active than ciprofloxacin following oral administration in mice.
 In treating L.
 pneumophila in guinea pigs and H.
 influenzae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ofloxacin were more effective than ciprofloxacin.
 Against S.
 pneumoniae otitis media in gerbils, temafloxacin and ciprofloxacin were more active than ofloxacin.
 Following subcutaneous administration in mice, temafloxacin achieved higher lung levels than ciprofloxacin or ofloxacin did.
