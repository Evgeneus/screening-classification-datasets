Schwannomas of the paranasal sinuses. Case report and clinicopathologic analysis.
 Schwann's cell tumors are common neoplasms arising from the neural sheath of autonomic, cranial, or peripheral nerves.
 We describe a case of destructive malignant schwannoma of the right ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
 The tumor was successfully treated by surgical excision, external radiotherapy, and radon seed implants.
 The patient remains symptom free 3 years after therapy ended, emphasizing the previously unrecognized benefits of radiotherapy for these types of tumors.
 The value of endoscopy in diagnosing and following schwannomas of the nasal and paranasal sinuses is highlighted in our review of the clinicopathologic features and radiologic findings of this tumor.
