Evaluation of 99Tcm Technegas ventilation scintigraphy in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.
 In the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, perfusion lung scintigraphy offers high sensitivity but low specificity.
 The specificity can be significantly increased by the use of combined ventilation and perfusion studies.
 Most aspects of perfusion lung scintigraphy are uniformly accepted but the technique of ventilation imaging varies from centre to centre.
 This study describes a new technique for the performance of ventilation scintigraphy using a suspension of ultrafine carbon particles labelled with 99Tcm ("Technegas").
 The technique combines the ready availability of 99Tcm and its optimal imaging properties with an easily administered radiopharmaceutical of particle size sufficiently small to deposit in the alveoli.
 Of 63 patients studied by conventional perfusion scintigraphy plus Technegas ventilation scintigraphy, images of diagnostic quality were obtained in all.
 31 of these patients also had a ventilation study using 81Krm gas and in only one instance did the two methods of ventilation imaging lead to differing interpretations.
 We conclude that high quality diagnostic images may be obtained using this new technique, which can be made available on both a routine and an emergency basis, thus improving the service provided for patients suspected of having pulmonary embolism.
