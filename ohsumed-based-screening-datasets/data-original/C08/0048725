The effect of the calcium antagonist, isradipine, on working capacity, pulmonary function, morbidity and survival rate in patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
 Beneficial effects of calcium antagonists on the pulmonary haemodynamics of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been observed in several studies.
 Such effects include a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, an increase in cardiac output, and an increase in oxygen delivery.
 The clinical implications of these effects are uncertain.
 The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, long-term study described here is the first to investigate the clinical effects of a calcium antagonist on patients with COPD.
 The aim was to test the hypothesis that the calcium antagonist, isradipine, could increase working capacity and lung function, and decrease morbidity and mortality.
 Fifty-two patients with COPD were investigated.
 During a 22-month observation period no statistically significant differences between the isradipine group and the placebo group were found with regard to these parameters.
 It is concluded that the existing evidence does not justify the introduction of calcium antagonists as part of the routine treatment of COPD.
