The prognostic significance of pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase in patients with small-cell lung cancer.
 Pretreatment serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were assayed in 288 patients presenting with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) between 1976 and 1985.
 Patients were routinely staged by physical examination, chest x-ray, bone, brain, and liver scans, and bone marrow evaluation.
 Clinical response and survival were assessed following treatment with combination chemotherapy as part of four clinical trials.
 Patients with extensive disease (ED) presented with a higher incidence (108 of 147, 73%) of abnormally elevated LDH (greater than 193 IU/L) than those (65 of 141, 46%) with limited disease (LD) (P = 2 x 10(-6)).
 Forty percent of patients had an initial normal LDH level and a higher response rate (89 of 108, 82%; complete response [CR], 47%) than those with elevated values of LDH (119 of 156, 76%; CR, 29%).
 The CR rate varied inversely with the level of LDH in patients with LD (P = .026) but not in those with ED (P = .300).
 The median survival time and 1-year and 2-year survival rates for patients with elevated LDH were 39 weeks and 33% and 6%, respectively, whereas for those with a normal LDH level these were 53 weeks and 54% and 16%, respectively.
 Patients with LD and elevated levels of LDH manifested a higher relative death rate (1.63:1) when compared with patients with LD and LDH in the normal range (P = .0083).
 The survival of patients with ED did not differ between those with normal and elevated levels of LDH (P = .273).
 A significant survival advantage persisted for patients with LDH in the normal range following adjustments for extent of disease, performance status (PS), and treatment protocol (P = .044, log-rank analysis).
 In conclusion, serum LDH appears to be a significant independent pretreatment prognostic factor in patients with SCLC that correlates with stage of disease, response to treatment, and survival.
