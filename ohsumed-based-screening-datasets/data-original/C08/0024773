Symptomatic treatment versus combination chemotherapy for patients with extensive non-small cell lung cancer.
 In a randomized clinical trial, 87 patients with inoperable, extensive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were randomized to receive either combination chemotherapy (cisplatin at 70 mg/m2 intravenously [i.v.] on day 1 and etoposide at 100 mg/m2 i.v.
 on day 1 and 200 mg/m2 orally on days 2 and 3) or symptomatic treatment.
 No statistically significant differences in survival time were found between the two treatment techniques.
 A major problem in the interpretation of the results was the use of semicurative radiation therapy (3000 to 4200 cGy) to the primary tumor and mediastinum, which was given with symptomatic intent.
 Three long-term survivors were seen in the latter group.
