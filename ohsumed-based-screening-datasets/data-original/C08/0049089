Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 suppresses endogenous fibrinolysis in a canine model of pulmonary embolism.
 BACKGROUND.
 Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the specific, fast-acting inhibitor of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA), binds to fibrin and has been found in high concentrations within arterial thrombi.
 These findings suggest that the localization of PAI-1 to a thrombus protects that same thrombus from fibrinolysis.
 In this study, clot-bound PAI-1 was assessed for its ability to suppress clot lysis in vivo.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Autologous, canine whole blood clots were formed in the presence of increasing amounts of activated PAI-1 (0-30 micrograms/ml).
 Approximately 6-8% of the PAI-1 bound to the clots under the experimental conditions.
 Control and PAI-1-enriched clots containing iodine-125-labeled fibrin (ogen) were homogenized, washed to remove nonbound elements, and delivered to the lungs of anesthetized dogs where the homogenates subsequently underwent lysis by the endogeneous fibrinolytic system.
 125I-labeled fibrin degradation products appeared in the blood of control animals within 10 minutes and were maximal by 90 minutes.
 PAI-1 reduced fibrin degradation product release in a dose-responsive manner at all times between 30 minutes and 5 hours (greater than or equal to 76% inhibition at 30 minutes, PAI-1 greater than or equal to 6 micrograms/ml).
 PAI-1 also suppressed D-dimer release from clots containing small amounts of human fibrin (ogen).
 t-PA administration attenuated the effects of PAI-1, whereas latent PAI-1 (20 micrograms/ml) had no effect on clot lysis.
 Blood levels of PA and PAI activity remained unaltered during these experiments.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The results indicate that PAI-1 markedly inhibits endogenous fibrinolysis in vivo and, moreover, suggest that the localization of PAI-1 to a forming thrombus is an important physiological mechanism for subsequent thrombus stabilization.
