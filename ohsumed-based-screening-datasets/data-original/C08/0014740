Hypertension with concomitant conditions: the changing role of beta-adrenoceptor blockade.
 Hypertension often is associated with concomitant conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, and peripheral vascular disease.
 Moreover, other cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemias and abnormalities of glucose and insulin metabolism, are common in patients with hypertension.
 Conventional beta-blockers used for antihypertensive therapy can have adverse effects in patients with airway disease, diabetes, and peripheral vascular disease, and can exaggerate the other risk factors.
 Newer beta-blockers such as celiprolol, which have selective partial agonist activity expressed at beta 2-receptors, appear to avoid these problems.
 Celiprolol exhibits antianginal and antihypertensive efficacy without adversely effecting left ventricular systolic function or exercise performance.
 It also may cause regression of left ventricular hypertrophy.
 The stimulatory action of celiprolol on vascular beta 2-receptors enhances regional flow and may increase walking distance in patients with claudication.
 The reduction in renal vascular resistance demonstrated by this drug is associated with preservation of renal blood flow and function.
 Spirometric measurements of airway function are unchanged during celiprolol treatment.
 Similarly, there are no adverse effects on lipid or glucose concentrations.
 These new developments in beta-blocker pharmacology indicate that this class of agents could be used in patients with hypertension with concomitant diseases or risk factors other than high blood pressure.
