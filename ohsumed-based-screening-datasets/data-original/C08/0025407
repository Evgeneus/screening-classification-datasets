Droperidol prevents serotonin-induced bronchospasm in the guinea pig.
 The effects of droperidol on bronchoconstriction induced by serotonin (5-HT) were studied in mechanically ventilated, paralyzed guinea pigs that had been anesthetized with pentobarbital.
 Droperidol did not modify the resting bronchial tone but prevented the bronchoconstrictor effects of 5-HT in a dose-related manner.
 Pretreatment with propranolol, hexamethonium, or prazosin did not alter the protective effects of droperidol on 5-HT-induced bronchoconstriction.
 The bronchoconstrictor responses to histamine or acetylcholine were not affected by droperidol.
 These results suggest that the protective effects of droperidol on 5-HT-induced bronchoconstriction are mediated through 5-HT receptor blockade on bronchial smooth muscle.
