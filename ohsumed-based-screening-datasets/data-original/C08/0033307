Intravenous bolus of prednisolone decreases 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid formation in the rat model of acid aspiration.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: To test the hypothesis that the effect of steroids on hydrochloric acid aspiration may be involved in the metabolism of eicosanoids, we investigated the effects of an iv bolus of prednisolone on the metabolism of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 (11-dehydro-TxB2) in the rat model of acid aspiration.
 Wistar rats were randomly selected for three groups and treated with either a) an iv bolus of saline after intratracheal injection of saline (control group), b) an iv bolus of saline after intratracheal injection of acid (acid-saline group), or c) an iv bolus of prednisolone after intratracheal injection of acid (acid-prednisolone group).
 The concentrations of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and 11-dehydro-TxB2 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were measured by radioimmunoassay.
 RESULTS: The concentration of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of either acid-saline group (804 +/- 129 pg/mL) or acid-prednisolone group (748 +/- 112 pg/mL) was significantly greater than that of the control group (143 +/- 27 pg/mL, p less than .01) 1 hr after the administration.
 The iv bolus of prednisolone caused a significant decrease in 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (acid-saline group 1027 +/- 43 pg/mL; acid-prednisolone group 514 +/- 62 pg/mL; p less than .01) and cell counts of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 48 hrs after intratracheal injection of acid, while there was no significant change in 11-dehydro-TxB2.
 CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that corticosteroid administration may contribute to the inhibition of the inflammatory process of lungs after acid aspiration by decreasing the release of 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in the distal lung unit.
