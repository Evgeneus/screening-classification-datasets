The laryngeal mask airway in children. A fibreoptic assessment of positioning.
 Clinical and fibreoptic assessment of the positioning of the laryngeal mask airway was performed in 100 children.
 Clinical observation indicated a patent airway in 98% and severe airway obstruction in 2% of cases.
 Perfect positioning, as judged by fibreoptic laryngoscopy, was found in 49% and the epiglottis was within the mask in 49%.
 Fibreoptic evidence of partial airway obstruction in 17% was not detected clinically.
