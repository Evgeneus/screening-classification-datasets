Synchronous primary mucosal melanoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum.
 We present a case of contiguous primary malignant melanoma of the nose and maxillary antrum and mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the maxillary antrum.
 We believe that this association has not been previously recorded; whether this represents divergent differentiation in a single tumour or 'collision' of two separate tumours is uncertain.
