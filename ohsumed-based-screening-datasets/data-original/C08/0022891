Effects of indomethacin on hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia.
 A patient had liver cirrhosis associated with marked hypoxemia.
 With administration of indomethacin (75 mg/day for six days), PaO2 was elevated up to 50 mm Hg from 44 mm Hg.
 At that time, dynamic pulmonary perfusion imaging revealed a plateau time course curve of MAA uptake in the lungs, as compared with findings obtained during the state of severe hypoxemia without indomethacin.
 These observations suggest that part of hepatogenic pulmonary angiodysplasia is a functional vasodilatation that is presumably modulated by vasoactive substances, such as prostaglandins and/or other eicosanoids.
