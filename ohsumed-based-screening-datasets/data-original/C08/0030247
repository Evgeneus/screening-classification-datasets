Prediction of neurodevelopmental outcome in infants with and without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 In a group of 236 very low birth weight (VLBW) surviving infants, 60 had developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in the nursery.
 When compared with the 176 infants without BPD, infants with BPD were smaller, more immature, with lower one- and five-minute Apgar scores.
 Infants with BPD had a greater incidence of cardio-pulmonary and central nervous system (CNS) complications in the nursery.
 On follow-up, 25 (42%) of these infants were abnormal developmentally compared to 7% of infants without BPD (p less than .001).
 When comparisons were made within the group of infants with BPD, very few differences were found in maternal or infant risk factors between the normal and abnormal infants.
 The infants with BPD who had poor outcome more often had seizures and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).
 The infants with BPD who had good outcome were more often small for gestational age (SGA) and resuscitated with intubation at birth.
 They had apnea in the nursery more frequently than did abnormal infants with BPD.
 We conclude that VLBW infants with BPD are at greater risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcome than those without BPD.
 The risk for the infant with BPD relates to CNS complications rather than to chronic lung disease.
