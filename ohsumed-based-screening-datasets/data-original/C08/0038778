Role of echocardiography/Doppler in cardiogenic shock: silent mitral regurgitation.
 Two cases of cardiogenic shock and pulmonary edema due to acute, severe, silent mitral regurgitation are discussed.
 The mechanism for the mitral regurgitation was papillary muscle rupture in the setting of acute myocardial infarction.
 Echocardiography established the presence, severity, and cause of the mitral regurgitation and the associated hyperdynamic left ventricular function in the setting of cardiogenic shock.
 Transesophageal echocardiography is excellent for assessing the mitral valve in critically ill patients in whom transthoracic echocardiography may be inadequate or misleading.
 This allowed for emergency mitral valve replacement without prolonged attempts at medical stabilization.
