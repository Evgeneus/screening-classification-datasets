Association of supraglottic and gingival idiopathic plasmacytosis.
 Three cases of gingival plasmacytosis in which laryngeal symptoms eventually developed are reported.
 Two of the three patients underwent endoscopic biopsy of supraglottic lesions, which proved to be similar to those in the oral cavity.
 The third patient had supraglottic erythema only and was not subjected to biopsy.
 Known etiologic factors associated with plasma cell gingivitis were excluded.
 Treatment with oral and topical steroids resulted in good control of the lesions.
