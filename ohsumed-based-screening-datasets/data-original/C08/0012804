Adjuvant, specific, active immunotherapy for resectable squamous cell lung carcinoma: a 5-year survival analysis.
 In 1976 Stewart et al.
 (Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 277:436-466) reported the effectiveness of adjuvant specific active immunotherapy of lung carcinoma in improving the postoperative survival of stage I lung carcinoma patients in a phase II study using lung carcinoma-associated antigen (TAA) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA).
 A phase III study was then designed by the authors to see the effects of specific active immunotherapy compared to the conventional management (no treatment) and to nonspecific immunotherapy.
 From 1976 to 1981, 85 patients with resectable (stages I and II) squamous cell lung carcinoma were entered into a randomized study: 1) control group; 2) specific immunotherapy group--three monthly doses of 500 micrograms of TAA emulsified with CFA; 3) nonspecific immunotherapy group--three monthly doses of CFA emulsified in saline.
 All the patients in the study received skin tests with 100 micrograms of the same TAA used for the immunotherapy.
 Recently, a 5-year follow-up of all the patients became available: The life table 5-year survival of group 1 was 34%, of group 2 was 75%, and of group 3 was 53%.
 The median survivals for the three groups were group 1, 38 months; group 2, 106 months; and group 3, 71 months.
 The difference was significant at P = .007 (Cox-Mantel test).
