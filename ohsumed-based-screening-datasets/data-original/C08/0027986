The cervical spine in maxillofacial trauma. Assessment and airway management.
 Although the presence of a real or potential cervical spine injury limits the options for emergency airway management, many choices still remain.
 The otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon frequently is called on to treat patients with airway emergencies; therefore, familiarity with the risk of spinal cord damage and methods to avoid it when establishing a safe airway constitute important knowledge.
 Experience with the variety of airway techniques available increases the number of options and decreases the risks of morbidity and mortality for the patient with cervical spine injury.
