Pulmonary reactions caused by welding-induced decomposed trichloroethylene 
 This is the report of a welder who performed argon-shielded electric arc welding in an atmosphere containing trichloroethylene.
 He developed immediate respiratory symptoms, pulmonary edema 12 hours after exposure, and recurring dyspnea ten days after exposure.
 These pulmonary reactions might be explained by inhalation of decomposition products of trichloroethylene such as dichloroacetyl chloride and phosgene.
