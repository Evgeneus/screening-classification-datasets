Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia treated with eflornithine in AIDS patients resistant to conventional therapy.
 Eflornithine (DFMO) was used to treat 31 AIDS patients with confirmed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who had clinically failed treatment with pentamidine, sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim or both agents as their first-line therapy.
 Twenty-one of 31 (68%) responded to second-line treatment with 400mg/kg per day of eflornithine.
 Five patients discontinued treatment because of bone marrow toxicity.
 Eflornithine appears to be a useful salvage therapy in patients failing first-line treatments.
