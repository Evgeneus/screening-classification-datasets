Treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim.
 Sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim may be an alternative or adjunctive treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis, as suggested by our experience with six patients.
 Two had limited Wegener's granulomatosis; one of these achieved remission with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim alone, and the second achieved remission with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and prednisone.
 Four patients presented with sinus, pulmonary, and renal involvement.
 One patient initially treated with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim developed worsening renal function requiring cytotoxic therapy.
 Two patients initially treated with cytotoxic agents achieved remission coincident with the addition of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim for persistent sinus symptoms.
 One patient had relapse of pulmonary symptoms after achieving and maintaining a remission during treatment with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim alone.
 This experience suggests that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim may be an effective treatment for some patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and may be the only agent required.
 Patients require careful follow-up and still may need cytotoxic therapy.
