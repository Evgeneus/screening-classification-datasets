Pulmonary vein thrombosis following bilobectomy.
 Acute thrombosis of the pulmonary vein following lobectomy or bilobectomy is a rare complication with no standard guideline for diagnosis or management.
 In this report, we present a case of right upper lobe vein thrombosis following a middle and lower lobectomy.
 Diagnosis was confirmed by ventilation-perfusion lung scan, pulmonary angiogram, and bronchoscopy.
 The patient was treated conservatively with no further complications and had a partial recovery of the circulation to the right upper lobe.
 A review of the literature is also presented along with the experimental data demonstrating the mechanisms of recovery.
