Description of a closed window technique for in vivo study of the feline basilar artery.
 Recent interest in the regulatory functions of large cerebral arteries has led to many studies addressing the specific reactivity of these vessels.
 Current data originate mainly from in vitro experiments, as in vivo studies of larger intracranial cerebral arteries have been cumbersome so far due to the lack of a suitable animal model.
 We provide a detailed technical description of a closed transclival window method for in vivo study of the basilar artery in cats.
 We present our experience with this preparation in 29 animals, which shows that the technique is feasible and allows repeated, accurate, and reproducible measurements of the basilar artery, although possible depressive effects of the anesthesia on vascular reactivity have to be taken into account.
 With hyperventilation, the basilar artery constricted by 12.2 +/- 7.6% of the baseline diameter.
 The cerebral blood flow response to hypocapnia with this preparation was 2.0 +/- 0.4%/torr PaCO2.
 An exudative clouding of the window occurred in some cats but had no apparent effect on vascular reactivity.
 We also discuss possible pitfalls in the surgical preparation.
