Benign lesions of the vocal folds: uniformity in assessment of clinical diagnosis.
 The names given to a number of benign lesions of the vocal folds are not well standardized and lead to difficulties in comparing treatment.
 In the present study photographs of benign lesions of the larynx were presented to groups of clinicians together with a questionnaire, and the answers analysed.
 The results show great variation between clinicians in interpretation and naming of these lesions.
 Definitions are suggested for different benign conditions in order to standardize the nomenclature.
