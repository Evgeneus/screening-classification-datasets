The laryngeal mask airway in children 
 The laryngeal mask airway was used in 200 children during a variety of surgical procedures.
 Some problem with the use of the device was encountered in 47 cases (23%), but in only five cases (2.5%) were the problems serious enough to warrant abandonment of its use.
 A clear airway was ultimately achieved in 191 children.
 Downfolding of the epiglottis over the laryngeal inlet was identified in eight out of 24 patients where flexible laryngoscopy was performed, clinically all these had unobstructed airways.
 The mask was used in 16 children with known airway problems.
 It is concluded that the size 2 laryngeal mask airway can be successfully used within the weight range 6-30 kg.
