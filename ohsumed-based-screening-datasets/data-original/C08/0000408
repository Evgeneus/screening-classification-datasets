Quality of life in elderly patients with chronic nonspecific lung disease seen in family practice.
 We studied the quality of life of elderly patients with chronic nonspecific lung disease (CNSLD) in family practice.
 We also investigated the relationship between patients' somatic condition and their quality of life.
 Seventy patients, aged 40 years or older, with a diagnosis or symptoms of CNSLD completed the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the list of daily activities (DAL).
 Pulmonary function (FEV1, IVC) and respiratory symptoms were assessed.
 The results indicated that patients were more impaired in their physical and psychosocial functioning than healthy control subjects.
 Most lung function parameters showed no correlation with the SIP scores.
 The respiratory symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea were related to patients' quality of life.
 Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were more restricted in their daily functioning than patients with asthma.
 Since the relationship between patients' somatic condition and their quality of life is weak, we recommend comprehensive care that encompasses psychosocial as well as somatic interventions.
