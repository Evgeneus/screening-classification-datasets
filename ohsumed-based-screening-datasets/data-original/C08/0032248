Cardiac anaesthesia in a patient with myotonic dystrophy.
 We describe a patient with myotonic dystrophy who required open-heart surgery for an atrial septal defect.
 He also had a sick sinus syndrome and an abnormal myocardium on histological examination.
 Anaesthesia using fentanyl, droperidol, nitrous oxide and a low concentration of enflurane was uneventful.
 Atelectasis of the left lung developed on the first postoperative day after removal of the tracheal tube.
 This was successfully treated by fibreoptic bronchoscopy.
