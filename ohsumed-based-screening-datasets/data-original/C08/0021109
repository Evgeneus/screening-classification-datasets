Immunochemical and immunohistochemical studies on three aldolase isozymes in human lung cancer.
 The aldolase isozymes A, B, and C in tumor tissues (63) and sera (104) of patients with lung cancer were determined with an enzyme immunoassay system, compared with normal lung tissues (13), and the sera of normal healthy subjects (100).
 Tissue aldolase A and C concentrations were enhanced in 83% (52/63) and 51% (32/63) of patients with lung cancer, respectively, regardless of histologic type or stage (P less than 0.01).
 But aldolase B was not elevated in tissue levels.
 In the sera of patients with lung cancer, there were no significant elevations of the isozymes.
 Immunohistochemically aldolase A and C stained more intensely in the cytoplasm of lung cancer cells than those in normal tissues.
 These results indicate lung cancer cells contain enhanced tissue levels of aldolase A and C.
