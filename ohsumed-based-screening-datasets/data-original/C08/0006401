Use of intrapleural streptokinase in the treatment of thoracic empyema.
 The incidence of pleural effusions in bacterial pneumonia may exceed 40%, a factor that may be related to increased morbidity and mortality.
 Options in the treatment of complicated pleural effusions or empyema, when unresponsive to closed tube drainage, include repositioning of the indwelling tube thoracostomy or insertion of additional chest tubes, instillation of intrapleural streptokinase, and surgical intervention.
 The authors describe the course of three patients wherein the use of intrapleural streptokinase was efficacious in effecting prompt drainage of previously inadequately evacuated empyema, thus eliminating the necessity for further invasive intervention.
