Effect of LY171883 on endotoxin-induced lung injury in pigs.
 We evaluated the role of sulfidopeptide leukotrienes as mediators of endotoxin-induced respiratory failure in pigs.
 Escherichia coli endotoxin (055-B5) was infused intravenously into anesthetized 10- to 14-wk-old pigs at 5 micrograms/kg the 1st h followed by 2 micrograms.kg-1.h-1 for 3 h in the presence and absence of LY171883, a specific leukotriene D4 (LTD4)/LTE4 receptor antagonist.
 Endotoxin caused hemoconcentration, granulocytopenia, decreased cardiac index, systemic hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, increased pulmonary vascular resistance, bronchoconstriction, hypoxemia, increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane, pulmonary edema, and increased plasma concentrations of thromboxane B2 (TxB2), prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha), and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha.
 LY171883 did not modify endotoxin-induced cardiopulmonary and hematologic abnormalities, except for a modest attenuation of pulmonary hypertension (at 1 h) and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (at 1-2 h).
 Ex vivo stimulation of whole blood with calcium ionophore caused large increases in plasma concentrations of TxB2, PGF2 alpha, and LTB4.
 These increases were not significantly modified in blood derived from pigs treated with LY171883, indicating no inhibition of cyclooxygenase or 5-lipoxygenase.
 We conclude that LTD4 and LTE4 are not important mediators of endotoxin-induced lung injury in anesthetized pigs, although they may contribute modestly to pulmonary vasoconstriction.
