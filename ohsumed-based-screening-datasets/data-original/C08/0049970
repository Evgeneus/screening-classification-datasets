Ventilatory compensation for lactacidosis in ponies: role of carotid chemoreceptors and lung afferents.
 We investigated changes in arterial PCO2 (PaCO2) and pulmonary ventilation (VE) in normal, carotid chemoreceptor-denervated, and hilar nerve-denervated ponies during intravenous lactic acid infusion at rest and treadmill exercise at 1.8 mph-5% grade (mild) and 1.8 mph-15% grade (moderate).
 Lactic acid, (0.5 M) infusion of 0.10, 0.13, and 0.20 ml.min-1.kg-1 at rest and mild and moderate exercise increased arterial [H+] linearly throughout the 10 min of acid infusion.
 At 10 min of infusion, arterial [H+] had increased approximately 20 nmol/l (0.2 pH units) for each condition and group.
 Under most conditions, the temporal pattern of PaCO2 during acid infusion was biphasic.
 At rest and during mild exercise in all groups, and in carotid chemoreceptor-denervated ponies during moderate exercise, PaCO2 increased approximately 2 Torr (P less than 0.05) during the first 2 min of acid infusion.
 However, in normal ponies during moderate exercise, PaCO2 was not changed from control in the first 2 min of infusion.
 Between 2 and 10 min of infusion at rest and mild and moderate exercise in all groups, there was a 5-Torr significant decrease in PaCO2, which did not differ (P greater than 0.10) between groups.
 VE increased between 15-30 s and 2 min of infusion, but VE changed minimally between 2 and 10 min of infusion at rest and exercise in all groups of ponies.
 We conclude that lactacidosis does increase VE at rest and submaximal exercise in the pony.
