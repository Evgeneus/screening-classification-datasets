Acute upper airway obstruction following Teflon injection of a vocal cord; the value of nebulized adrenaline and a helium/oxygen mixture in its management 
 A 67-year-old man presented with a 45-year history of a week voice.
 This was result of polio which had left him with a right vocal cord palsy.
 The patient underwent a Teflon injection of the right vocal cord under general anaesthesia to improve the quality of his voice.
 In the immediate post-operative period, he suffered acute upper airway obstruction.
 The problem of acute upper airway obstruction following Teflon injection is considered and its management with nebulized adrenaline and a helium/oxygen mixture is discussed.
