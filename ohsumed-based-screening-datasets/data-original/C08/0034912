The effect of obliterative bronchiolitis on breathing pattern during exercise in recipients of heart-lung transplants.
 The more rapid and shallow ventilation pattern seen during exercise in patients with obstructive and/or restrictive lung disease has been attributed by some investigators to the effects of vagal afferents from intrapulmonary receptors.
 Recipients of heart-lung transplants (HLTR) offer a unique opportunity to test this hypothesis since they have denervated lungs and may develop obliterative bronchiolitis after organ rejection.
 We thus compared the ventilation responses to incremental bicycle ergometry of five HLTR with relatively normal pulmonary function (HLTR-N) and four with bronchiolitis obliterans (HLTR-O).
 We compared the slopes of the linear portion of the tidal volume versus inspired minute ventilation relationship of both groups.
 The rate of rise of tidal volume (VT) (slope of VT versus VI) was greater in HLTR-N (0.31 +/- 0.004) than in HLTR-O (0.023 +/- 0.007) (p less than 0.05).
 This corresponded to a slower increase in respiratory rate (RR) (slope of RR versus Vl/cm) in HLTR-N (0.055 +/- 0.005) than in HLTR-O (0.083 +/- 0.019) (p less than 0.01).
 Furthermore, values for VT, inspiratory time (TI), and duty cycle (TI/Ttot) measured during exercise at the VT break point were all significantly lower in the HLTR-O than in HLTR-N.
 We also evaluated the ability of HLTR with lung disease to regulate their ultimate level of ventilation during maximal exercise.
