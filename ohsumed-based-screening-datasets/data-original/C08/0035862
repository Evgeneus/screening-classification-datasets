Multiple pulmonary microemboli complicating pneumonectomy.
 Pulmonary embolism is widely recognized to complicate abdominal and lower limb orthopedic surgical procedures, but in comparison, it is seldom recognized to hamper the postoperative progress of patients after thoracic operations.
 We present 4 patients in whom multiple pulmonary emboli developed after pneumonectomy, 2 of whom were treated successfully.
 We discuss the mostly atypical presentation and the physiological and clinical consequences, and also suggest a mode of management.
