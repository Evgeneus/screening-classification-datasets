Effusion cytology.
 Cytologic evaluation is the best way to detect the presence of malignancy in body cavity fluids.
 Although a positive diagnosis is highly reliable, a negative result does not rule out a malignant cause.
 Adenocarcinomas, well-differentiated squamous carcinomas, small-cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, large-cell lymphomas, and acute leukemias are accurately classified when present in effusions.
 The definitive diagnosis of malignant mesothelioma, small-cell lymphomas, and chronic leukemias, and subclassification of sarcomas and poorly differentiated neoplasms are difficult and may require additional diagnostic techniques.
 With a few exceptions, the exact causes of benign effusions cannot be determined by cytologic methods.
