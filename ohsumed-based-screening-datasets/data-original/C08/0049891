Microsubglottoscopy: an expansion of operative microlaryngoscopy.
 The development of the adult subglottiscope has facilitated expansion of the indications for operative microlaryngoscopy to include surgery in the subglottic region of the larynx, as well as in the upper cervical trachea.
 A set of microlaryngeal instruments with an elongated shaft has been developed to support the use of the subglottiscope in the adult patient population.
 During the 18-month period from January 1, 1988, through June 30, 1989, sixteen adult patients with subglottic or upper cervical tracheal pathology were operated on a total of twenty-three times, using the adult subglottiscope to facilitate exposure and treatment.
 The patients' pathologic conditions included subglottic stenosis, subglottic granuloma, subglottic extension of laryngeal hemangioma and papilloma, and suprastomal granuloma.
 Two selected cases are presented to highlight indications for the use of this instrument.
 We have found the exposure of these subglottic and upper cervical tracheal lesions, using the binocular, microlaryngeal approach facilitated by the adult subglottiscope, to be improved over that obtained with existing microlaryngoscopes or conventional tracheoscopes.
