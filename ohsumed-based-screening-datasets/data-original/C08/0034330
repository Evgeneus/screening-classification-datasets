Unique aspects of respiratory disease in the aged.
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common problem in the elderly, often resulting in reduced pulmonary capacity and serious functional disability.
 Contrary to commonly-held medical opinion, COPD often has a significant reversible component in the older patient and thus offers an excellent opportunity for successful treatment.
 Smoking cessation is the single most important measure to manage COPD.
 In addition, treatment with inhaled bronchodilators and corticosteroids, pulmonary rehabilitation programs, home oxygen therapy, and various preventive strategies are practical components for reversing COPD-induced dysfunction.
