Endolaryngeal jet ventilation: a 10-year review.
 Jet ventilation for microsurgery of the larynx has been in common use at our institution since 1978.
 There were 942 cases performed, with ages ranging from 7 days to 90 years.
 A specially modified laryngoscope with multiple ports into which a 14- or 16-gauge ventilation needle can be advanced just distal to the vocal cords simplifies this form of anesthesia and ventilation.
 Jet ventilation has been advocated in place of conventional ventilation methods during carbon dioxide laser surgery because it eliminates the potential fire hazard of the endotracheal tube and allows superior visibility of the vocal cords.
 Despite these advantages, it is still not in common use.
 We will review the airway mechanics and special anesthesia considerations that make jet ventilation a safe and time-proven technique.
