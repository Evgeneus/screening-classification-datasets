Itraconazole in the treatment of coccidioidomycosis.
 Sixteen patients with coccidioidomycosis were treated with itraconazole for one year.
 Sixteen suffered from pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, two of them had associated mediastinal lesions, and one suffered from skin coccidioidomycosis.
 The daily dose used was 400 mg during the one-year period.
 Patients were clinically evaluated every month and tested for mycosis every three months.
 All patients except for one showed negative cultures on the third month after treatment began.
 Effectiveness achieved was excellent in eight patients (50 percent); a very good response was found in seven patients (44 percent); no response was seen in one patient (6 percent).
 There were four (25 percent) relapses and one dropout.
 Side effects seen were high blood pressure (19 percent) and lower limb edema (6 percent), which was temporary and at no time required discontinuing the drug therapy.
 We believe that itraconazole is an effective drug to treat coccidioidomycosis with a wide safety margin.
 It is well tolerated, and the incidence of relapses was low.
