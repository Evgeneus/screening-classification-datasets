Eosinophil cationic protein stimulates and major basic protein inhibits airway mucus secretion.
 Possible roles of eosinophil (EO) products in modulating the release of mucus from airway explants were investigated.
 Cell- and membrane-free lysates from purified human EOs (1 to 20 x 10(5)) caused a dose-dependent release of respiratory glycoconjugates (RGC) from cultured feline tracheal explants.
 Crude extracts from isolated EO granules also stimulated RGC release, suggesting that a granular protein might be responsible.
 Three proteins derived from EO granules, EO-derived neurotoxin, EO cationic protein (ECP), and major basic protein (MBP) were separated by sequential sizing and affinity chromatography.
 ECP (0.025 to 25 micrograms/ml) caused a dose-dependent increase in RGC release from both feline and human airway explants and also stimulated the release of the serous cell-marker, lactoferrin, from human bronchial explants.
 EO-derived neurotoxin (0.025 to 50 micrograms/ml) failed to affect RGC release, whereas MBP (50 micrograms/ml) significantly inhibited RGC release from feline explants.
 Thus, ECP stimulates RGC and lactoferrin release from airway explants, whereas MBP inhibits RGC release.
