Detection of bullous lung disease: conventional radiography vs digital storage phosphor radiography.
 The detection of fine linear contours and altered aeration are requirements for the radiologic diagnosis of bullous lung disease and are severe measures of the spatial and contrast resolution of chest imaging systems.
 We compared plain film radiography with five postprocessing algorithms of storage phosphor digital radiography (2144 x 1744 x 10 bit matrix with 0.2-mm pixel size) in the detection of CT-proved bullous lung disease (35 patients and 25 normal control subjects).
 Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis of 2160 observations by six interpreters was done to evaluate the observers' performance.
 By analysis of variance (p less than .05), we found that the default digital algorithm and the three edge-enhancing algorithms of high and medium frequencies performed less well than plain films did, but the differences fell short of statistical significance.
 Gray-scale reversal was the only digital algorithm that performed significantly less well than plain films did.
 We conclude that any differences between digital algorithms and plain films in the detection of bullous lung disease were too small to be detected in this study.
 Any difference between the two methods in providing clinically important, diagnostic information is likely to be insignificant.
