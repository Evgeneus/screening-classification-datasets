Hemoptysis complicating AICD patch placement controlled by temporary selective bronchial balloon occlusion.
 This is the first reported case of an automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patch placement complicated by hemoptysis.
 It is also notable because the patient's massive hemoptysis was managed by a balloon occlusion catheter inserted into the segmental bronchus through the endotracheal tube with fluoroscopic guidance.
