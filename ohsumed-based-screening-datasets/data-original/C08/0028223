Imaging the pleura: sonography, CT, and MR imaging.
 A variety of imaging techniques can be used to evaluate the pleura and the pleural space.
 Standard radiographs are the most common.
 In this article, however, we review the use of three other imaging techniques: sonography, CT, and MR imaging.
 Sonography allows easy identification of pleural fluid and loculation and differentiation from pleural masses; CT is best for characterizing location and composition of pleural masses; MR is somewhat limited, but is best for imaging superior sulcus carcinoma.
