Right-sided aortic arch presenting as refractory intraoperative and postoperative wheezing.
 A 29-year-old woman presented with severe refractory intraoperative wheezing and airflow limitation that resolved spontaneously.
 Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax confirmed a right-sided aortic arch.
 Variable intrathoracic large airway obstruction that worsened markedly when the patient was in a supine position and slightly more following intravascular volume expansion was shown on flow-volume studies.
 We postulate the right-sided aortic arch caused airflow obstruction that worsened intraoperatively because of position and intravenous fluids.
