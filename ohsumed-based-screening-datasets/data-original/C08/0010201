Eosinophilic granuloma of the lung presenting as a solitary pulmonary nodule.
 A symptomless 58 year old man had an eosinophilic granuloma of the lung that presented as a solitary pulmonary nodule rather than the usual diffuse reticulonodular shadow on the chest radiograph.
 Only one previous case presenting in this way has been described.
