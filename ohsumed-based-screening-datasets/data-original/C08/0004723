Inter-arytenoid glottic bar following intubation.
 Inter-arytenoid glottic bar is a rare complication of prolonged endotracheal intubation.
 We present two such cases and their treatment.
 The aetiology of this complication is multifactorial and involves local factors--local trauma, movement of the endotracheal tube within the larynx, infection, and anatomical influences--together with systemic factors such as in our two cases.
 The relative importance of these factors is discussed.
 A comment is also made on the use of a pre-operative topogram and the importance of an ENT assessment in patients with airway problems following prolonged intubation.
