Long-term clinical follow-up of adult idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis and celiac disease.
 A 22-year-old man with a history of repeated whole blood transfusions since the age of 7, was admitted to the hospital for dyspnea and blood-stained sputum.
 A complete blood cell count, a test for reticulin antibodies, an x-ray film of the chest, a transbronchial biopsy and a biopsy of the small bowel were performed and the results confirmed the diagnosis of IPH, associated with CD.
 The patient has been asymptomatic for four years on a gluten-free diet.
 In cases of IPH, it may be important to investigate the coexistence of CD because treatment of the latter could lead to a better prognosis.
