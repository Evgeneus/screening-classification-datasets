N-ras 61 oncogene mutations in Hurthle cell tumors.
 Mutations of ras oncogenes are believed to play an important role in the initiation or progression of human tumors.
 In thyroid tumors the incidence of ras activation by specific point mutations has been reported to range from 33% in follicular adenomas up to 60% in anaplastic carcinomas.
 Because of our long-standing interest in Hurthle cell tumors, we began a study of 70 such cases to determine the incidence of ras mutations and their clinical correlates.
 Analysis of N-ras sequences at condon position 61, with the polymerase chain reaction method and oligonucleotide probe hybridization, showed point mutations of the normal codon CAA* in eight tumor samples.
 One was a mutation from CAA to AAA, one from CAA to CTA,* and six from CAA to CGA.
 These mutations would result in amino acid substitutions of lysine, leucine, or arginine for the normal glutamine at position 61 in the N-ras protein.
 Identical ras mutations in two tumors and some of their surrounding thyroid tissue may indicate that activating ras point mutations are an early event in carcinogenesis.
 The incidence of mutations was 1 of 24 (4%) of the histologically benign tumors, 5 of 34 (15%) of the intermediate tumors (with vascular or capsular permeation), and 2 of 12 (17%) in the malignant group.
 Four of these eight patients died of metastatic thyroid disease and four are alive without evidence of recurrence.
