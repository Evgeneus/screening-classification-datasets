Prolactin-producing pituitary carcinoma with pulmonary metastases.
 Pituitary adenomas rarely are metastatic.
 Extracranial visceral metastases of prolactinomas were not previously reported.
 The authors report a case of a 34-year-old man with a prolactin-producing pituitary carcinoma and histologically proven lung metastases.
 Pathologic examination of the pulmonary spread included electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry; these confirmed prolactin production by the tumor.
 The patient's presentation at initial diagnosis, disease recurrence, clinical course, management, and response to therapy (with its theoretic basis) are detailed.
 Despite the use of dopamine analogues (to tolerance and in combination), there was documented intracranial and extracranial disease progression.
 Possible future therapeutic maneuvers are discussed.
