Acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema treated with mechanical ventilation. Factors determining in-hospital mortality.
 We reviewed 88 episodes of cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE) treated with mechanical ventilation to define the clinical features that predict in-hospital mortality.
 Fifty-six patients survived to hospital discharge.
 APACHE II scores were not helpful in prediction.
 Multiple logistic regression models to predict outcome were developed using variables present at the time of intubation and 24 hours later.
 The model at the time of intubation indicated mortality was related to systolic blood pressure less than 130 mm Hg, the presence of anterior myocardial infarction, use of calcium channel blockers, age, and absence of prior hospitalization for CPE.
 A model using additional variables available 24 hours later showed that mortality was related only to the need for vasopressor medication at 24 hours, and systolic blood pressure at intubation less than 130 mm Hg.
 The predictive power of these models was confirmed by applying them to 46 additional patients.
 The variables contained in these models suggest that the prognosis of patients with CPE treated with mechanical ventilation depends primarily on the severity of acute left ventricular injury.
 Variables relating the degree of respiratory failure, however, were not predictive of mortality.
 These multiple logistic regression models provide a means to compare patients with CPE for quality assessment purposes and for studies of treatment regimens, and may also provide information useful to patient and family counseling regarding the value of continued aggressive intensive care.
