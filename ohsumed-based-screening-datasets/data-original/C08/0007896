Pathologic dependence of oxygen consumption on oxygen delivery in acute respiratory failure secondary to AIDS-related Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 Oxygen consumption is pathologically dependent on oxygen delivery in ARDS and sepsis.
 We asked whether oxygen consumption is dependent on oxygen delivery in severe acute respiratory failure secondary to AIDS-related PCP.
 In five patients who had AIDS-related PCP, diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, no evidence of bacterial infection, and acute respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation with arterial oxygen tensions less than 75 mm Hg while breathing at least 50 percent oxygen, and PEEP greater than 10 cm H2O, we determined oxygen delivery and consumption by calculation from thermodilution cardiac output and arterial and mixed venous oxygen contents.
 Oxygen delivery was increased using transfusion of two units of packed red blood cells over one hour.
 Oxygen delivery increased 22 percent (638 +/- 204 to 778 +/- 201 ml/min.m2, p less than or equal to 0.006).
 Oxygen consumption increased 11 percent (134 +/- 34 to 149 +/- 29 ml/min.m2, p less than or equal to 0.02).
 The oxygen extraction ratio did not change.
 We conclude that similar to ARDS and sepsis, oxygen consumption may be pathologically dependent on oxygen delivery in patients who have severe acute respiratory failure secondary to AIDS-related PCP.
