Intranasal fluocortin butyl in patients with perennial rhinitis: a 12-month efficacy and safety study including nasal biopsy.
 Fluocortin butyl (FCB) is a recently developed topical intranasal corticosteroid that is inhaled as a powder and has been demonstrated to be well tolerated and to improve symptoms and signs of perennial rhinitis in previous short-term studies.
 This multicenter, open-label study evaluated the efficacy and safety of FCB during a 12-month treatment period in patients with perennial rhinitis.
 Treatment was initiated with one inhalation of FCB in each nostril three times a day (total dosage, 3 mg/day).
 In subsequent months, one third of the patients was maintained at the dosage of 3 mg/day, one third at a lower dosage of 2 mg/day, and the remaining one third of the patients at a larger dosage of 4 to 8 mg/day.
 Of 109 patients enrolled in the study, 90 patients (82.6%) completed all 12 months of treatment.
 Symptom and sign scores decreased significantly (p less than 0.001) at the 2-month evaluation compared to scores at baseline, and the improvement was maintained throughout the 12-month study period.
 After 12 months, greater than 80% of the patients had substantial control of symptoms.
 Specimens of nasal biopsies, performed at the beginning and end of treatment, revealed a decrease in eosinophils and other cellular infiltrates, a slight tendency of an increase in mast cell counts, and a trend toward normalization of the nasal mucosa.
 There were few adverse effects.
 Mean plasma cortisol levels were normal before and after corticotropin stimulation at baseline and after 12 months of FCB therapy.
