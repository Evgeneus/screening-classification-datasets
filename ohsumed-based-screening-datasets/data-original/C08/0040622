Lung abscess with group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus. Case report and review.
 Invasive infections with group A beta-hemolytic streptococci became less common in the early 20th century prior to the widespread use of antibiotics.
 From the early 1960s until the mid-1980s, reports of invasive infections continued to decline.
 In the past 5 years, there has been a resurgence of invasive infections and, possibly, also of postinfectious sequelae from this organism.
 We describe a patient with lung abscess from group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus.
 Lung abscess from hemolytic streptococci was not uncommon in Osler's day, but it was not reported in the English-language literature for 20 years until recently.
 Clinicians should be aware of the broad and growing spectrum of infections with this pathogen.
