Cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with acute severe asthma ("status asthmaticus") spontaneously elaborate a neutrophil chemotactic activity distinct from interleukin-8.
 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from patients with acute severe asthma on the day of admission to hospital were cultured in vitro in serum-free medium in the absence of mitogenic stimulants for as long as 72 h.
 PBMC isolated from control groups (mild asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, normal subjects) were cultured in a similar fashion.
 After incubation, the culture supernatants were tested for neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) using a modified Boyden chamber technique.
 PBMC from patients with acute severe asthma elaborated significantly greater amounts of NCA into the culture supernatants as compared with all three control groups (p less than 0.01).
 The amounts of PBMC-derived NCA from the same patients after 7 days of hospital therapy and clinical improvement were reduced (p less than 0.01).
 A correlation was observed between the extent of reduction in spontaneous release of NCA by PBMC derived from patients with acute severe asthma and the degree of clinical improvement of their asthma (p less than 0.02).
 Both monocytes and lymphocytes, when cultured separately, released NCA in amounts sufficient to account for the total activity released by unfractionated PBMC.
 NCA in PBMC culture supernatants accumulated progressively with time, a process inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by cycloheximide.
 The amounts of NCA in culture supernatants did not correlate with the concentrations of histamine in lysates of the PBMC prepared just prior to culture.
