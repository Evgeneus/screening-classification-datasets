Acoustic rhinometry used as a method to monitor the effect of intramuscular injection of steroid in the treatment of nasal polyps.
 Acoustic rhinometry is a new method which describes the geometry of the nasal cavity and the epipharynx.
 The method, based on the reflection of an acoustic signal entered into the nasal cavity, can be used to evaluate the cross-sectional area of the nasal cavity as a function of distance from the nostril.
 The method has, together with nasal expiratory peak flow (NPF) and nasal index based upon a self assessment score, been used to evaluate, in an objective and dynamic way, the effect of systemic treatment of nasal polyps with steroids in a series of eight patients with recurrent nasal polyposis.
 The study shows a significant relationship between these three parameters before and after systemic treatment of nasal polyps with steroids.
 It is concluded that in this study acoustic rhinometry had an accurate and objective method for measuring the geometry of the nasal cavity before and after treatment for processes which block the nasal cavity.
