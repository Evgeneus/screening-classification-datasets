Imaging of diffuse lung diseases. Past, present, and future.
 For many years the plain chest radiograph was the only imaging modality used in the assessment of patients who had diffuse lung disease.
 Presently, high resolution computed tomography (CT) and lung scintigraphy play a major role in the assessment of these patients.
 Use of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the assessment of the lung parenchyma has been limited by poor signal-to-noise ratio and physiologic motion.
 Recent improvements in technique, however, have allowed assessment of patients with diffuse lung disease.
 It is likely that MR imaging will play an increasing role in the assessment of these patients in the near future.
