Mediastinal abnormalities: detection with storage phosphor digital radiography.
 Conventional film radiography (FR) and six postprocessing algorithms of isodose storage phosphor digital radiography (SR) (0.2-mm X 10-bit pixel matrix) were compared in the evaluation of 40 mediastinal and 30 pulmonary lesions in 60 patients who underwent computed tomography of the chest.
 The six SR algorithms varied among each other in only one image parameter.
 One algorithm approximated conventional image characteristics.
 The other five algorithms were designed to optimize imaging of the mediastinum and tested the effects of gray-scale reversal, adjustment of optical density, a linear instead of a sigmoid gradation curve, and moderate edge enhancement of high and medium spatial frequencies.
 Performance was evaluated by calculating the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (Az) of 5,040 observations by six readers.
 Post-processing with high-frequency edge enhancement and density optimization for the mediastinum significantly improved performance of SR over FR in the detection of mediastinal lesions (Az = .80 +/- .02 vs .73 +/- .01, respectively).
 Gray-scale reversal significantly decreased performance (Az = .64 +/- .03).
 All SR algorithms that were postprocessed to optimize imaging of the mediastinum were significantly inferior to FR in the detection of pulmonary lesions.
