PEEP and "reverse mismatch". A case where less PEEP is best.
 A V/Q lung scan was obtained in a patient with LLL collapse who was receiving IPPV and PEEP.
 This revealed absent ventilation and hyperperfusion to the collapsed lobe.
 After a reduction in PEEP from 12 to 5 cm H2O, a repeat V/Q scan showed a more even distribution of pulmonary perfusion.
 Arterial hypoxemia improved.
