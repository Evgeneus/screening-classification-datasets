Respiratory deficiency in experimental idiopathic scoliosis.
 Clinically significant respiratory failure in a group of animals with an experimentally produced structural thoracic scoliosis was identified.
 A detailed physiologic investigation of their respiratory function showed that their respiratory compromise was associated with the development of a smaller and stiffer chest.
 Frank respiratory failure, however, was rare and seen only in animals with the most severe spinal deformities when it was also associated with a general failure to thrive.
 Animals with less severe deformities had little measurable restriction of pulmonary function, did not develop respiratory failure, and grew normally.
