Bilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema following unilateral pleurocentesis.
 Acute ipsilateral pulmonary edema following reexpansion of the lung after pleurocentesis or pneumothorax is a well described entity.
 We report the unusual occurrence of bilateral pulmonary edema following unilateral pleurocentesis in a young male without heart disease.
 Various hypotheses regarding the mechanism of reexpansion pulmonary edema include increased capillary permeability due to hypoxic injury, decreased surfactant production, altered pulmonary perfusion and mechanical stretching of membranes.
 This case suggests that forces leading to ipsilateral reexpansion pulmonary edema also affect the contralateral lung.
