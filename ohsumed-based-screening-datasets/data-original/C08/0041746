Inhibition of different dosages of oxatomide or placebo on skin prick test and nasal allergen provocation.
 In this two-stage, double-blind study, we evaluated the effects of different dosages of oxatomide (1 and 2 mg/kg/day) on nasal provocation and skin reaction wheal induced by grass-pollen challenge.
 Children with a positive history of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and positive responses to skin prick test and nasal provocation test to grass pollen were studied out of season.
 The results obtained with 1 mg/kg/day of oxatomide demonstrated no significant difference in wheal areas and nasal secretion induced by allergen challenge between treated and untreated patients.
 The administration of 2 mg/kg/day demonstrated a significant suppression in wheal reaction and nasal secretion induced by specific challenge.
