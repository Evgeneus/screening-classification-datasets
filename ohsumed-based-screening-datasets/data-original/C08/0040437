Corticosteroid treatment as a risk factor for invasive aspergillosis in patients with lung disease.
 Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis usually occurs in severely immunocompromised or neutropenic patients.
 Six patients with invasive aspergillosis are described whose only defence impairment was underlying lung disease and corticosteroid treatment.
 Cough, fever, and sputum production were the usual reasons for presentation and four patients developed the sepsis syndrome.
 Radiographic findings included de novo cavitation in three patients and rapid radiographic progression in four.
 Aspergillus species were isolated from respiratory secretions of all patients early in the course of the disease.
 Treatment was effective in only two patients and the subsequent progress of the others was consistent with a chronic necrotising process.
 Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is uncommon in patients with respiratory diseases receiving corticosteroids, but should be considered when pneumonia and cavitary infiltrates occur.
