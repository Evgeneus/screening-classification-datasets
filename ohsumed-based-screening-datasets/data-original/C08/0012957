Eosinophilic pneumonia associated with reaction to radiographic contrast medium.
 We have described what we believe to be the first published case of a reaction to radiographic contrast medium followed by a diffuse eosinophilic pneumonia.
 This association seems to confirm what is know about the immunologic mechanisms of such reactions, and though further verification of causation is needed, we found it to be the most plausible explanation.
