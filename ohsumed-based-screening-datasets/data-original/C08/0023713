Pleuroperitoneal shunting for intractable pleural effusions.
 Pleuroperitoneal shunts were implanted in 17 patients with intractable pleural effusions, 15 of which were malignant and 2 benign.
 Complicating factors included 13 instances of severe trapped lung and 3 cases of synchronous ascites.
 There was one hospital death.
 Palliation of dyspnea at rest was achieved in all patients, although 3 required oxygen with exertion.
 Four shunts became occluded between 1 and 10 months after placement.
 Two of these were replaced.
 The remaining conduits continued to function to the present or until the patients' deaths between 1 and 28 months.
 Shunting allowed hospital discharge and provided symptomatic relief in a group of patients in whom other approaches had failed or were not applicable.
