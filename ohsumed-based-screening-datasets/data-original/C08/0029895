Fatal airway obstruction caused by a mucous ball from a transtracheal oxygen catheter.
 A 50-year-old man with pulmonary fibrosis and COPD presented with worsening cough, dyspnea, chest pain, and hypoxemia of no readily apparent etiology, approximately four weeks after insertion of a transtracheal oxygen therapy catheter.
 Despite vigorous bronchial hygiene therapy, the patient died.
 Autopsy revealed obstruction of the trachea by a large mucous ball.
 We point out the nonspecificity of physical and radiologic findings associated with this condition and suggest that serial flow-volume loop analysis or earlier use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy might have been of assistance in premortem diagnosis of the mucous plug.
