Pathogenesis and prevention of childhood pneumonia in developing countries: recommendations.
 Recommendations are presented that emerged from the Conference on the Pathogenesis and Prevention of Pneumonia in Children in Developing Regions held 21-23 August 1989 in Bellagio, Italy.
 The conference recommendations embrace three major areas: first, the biology, epidemiology, and clinical manifestation of important etiologic agents causing acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI); second, the evaluation of risk factors affecting ALRI in the developing world necessary for planning intervention strategies in diverse ecologic settings; and third, the generation of targeted research questions that will translate into available safe and effective vaccines capable of controlling ALRI-related morbidity and mortality.
