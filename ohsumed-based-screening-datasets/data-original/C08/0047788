Recombinant human interferon-gamma as adjunct therapy for Aspergillus infection in a patient with chronic granulomatous disease.
 The hallmark of chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is defective killing of ingested microorganisms by phagocytic cells.
 Invasive aspergillosis in CGD patients is particularly virulent and has a mortality rate of approximately 50%.
 A patient with autosomal recessive CGD was identified who had progressive pulmonary aspergillosis that was unresponsive to conventional antifungal therapy.
 She was treated with recombinant human interferon-gamma (rHuIFN-gamma) and had a dramatic improvement in clinical symptoms, sedimentation rate, and radiographic scans.
 No consistent improvement in bactericidal function or neutrophil oxidative capacity could be demonstrated.
 However, serum neopterin levels, a measure of macrophage activation, increased in a dose-dependent manner with rHuIFN-gamma therapy; increased levels mirrored the improved clinical parameters.
 This patient's treatment illustrates the usefulness of the single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) gallium scan for following pulmonary inflammatory lesions in the presence of fibrosis and indicates that rHuIFN-gamma may be of benefit to CGD patients with serious infections unresponsive to conventional therapy.
