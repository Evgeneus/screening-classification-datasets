Direct injury to the bronchial vasculature in anesthetized sheep.
 Injury to the bronchial vasculature may contribute to liquid and solute leakage into the lung during noncardiac pulmonary edema.
 The purpose of this study was to measure changes in hemodynamics, pulmonary mechanics, extravascular lung water, and lung morphometry after selectively injuring the bronchial vasculature in anesthetized sheep.
 In two groups of seven sheep, we injected oleic acid (0.1 ml/kg) or normal saline directly into the bronchoesophageal artery.
 We measured systemic and pulmonary arterial pressures, cardiac output, oxygen saturation, pulmonary resistance and compliance, and lung volumes before and 1 and 4 h after injection.
 The lungs were removed for measurement of extravascular water, histology, and morphometry.
 Four hours after injection of oleic acid, cardiac output decreased but pulmonary arterial pressure did not change.
 In addition, pulmonary resistance increased and dynamic compliance and vital capacity decreased.
 Extravascular lung water was slightly but significantly greater in the oleic acid group.
 Histological examination showed interstitial edema and leukocytes in airway walls and sloughing of bronchial epithelium but little or no alveolar edema.
 Morphometric analysis showed significant thickening of airway walls.
 We conclude that direct injury to the bronchial vasculature increases lung resistance, decreases dynamic compliance, and increases extravascular lung water by the accumulation of an inflammatory infiltrate in airway walls.
