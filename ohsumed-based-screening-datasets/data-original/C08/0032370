A protocol for the safe administration of debrisoquine in biochemical epidemiologic research protocols for hospitalized patients.
 The genetically determined ability to metabolize the antihypertensive drug debrisoquine has been proposed as a genetic risk factor for primary carcinomas of the lung.
 To test this hypothesis, the metabolism of the drug was evaluated in a case control study.
 The subjects were characterized by their ability to metabolize debrisoquine after receiving a test dose of the drug followed by the collection of an 8-hour urine sample.
 They were classified by laboratory analysis into one of the following three groups: extensive, intermediate, and poor metabolizers.
 Poor metabolizers comprise 10% of the population and are unable to hydroxylate the drug.
 This group was expected to be at highest risk for deleterious effects from this medication.
 A protocol was created that included patient education and blood pressure monitoring to administer this medication safely to a group of patients with cancer who were already compromised.
 Although poor metabolizers showed a small decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, no significant hypotensive episodes or clinical sequelae were observed in any of the groups.
 These data suggest that debrisoquine can be administered safely in a controlled clinical setting and will be useful for the characterization of lung cancer patients in biochemical epidemiology studies.
