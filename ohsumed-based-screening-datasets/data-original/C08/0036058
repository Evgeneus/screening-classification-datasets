Results and prognostic factors of surgery in the management of non-small cell lung cancer with solitary brain metastasis.
 Between 1975 and 1988, 37 patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and synchronous (within 1 month, n = 10) or metachronous (n = 27) solitary brain metastasis (SBM) underwent combined excision of their lesions.
 Overall 5-year and median survival were 30% and 27 months (range, 3 to 125+ months), respectively.
 Twenty-seven patients had a relapse, and their median disease-free interval (DFI) was 17.5 months (range, 1 to 108 months).
 The most frequent (78%, n = 20) site of first recurrence locally was either the ipsilateral thorax (n = 14) or brain (n = 6).
 In univariate analysis, age, primary tumor and lymph node status; tumor histology, size, and side; type of pulmonary resection; side and location of SBM; and onset of presentation did not affect survival and DFI.
 By contrast, the interval (less than or equal to versus greater than 12 months) between the two operations significantly affected survival (P = 0.0096) and DFI (P = 0.046).
 The DFI was also affected by the administration of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) for the primary tumor (P = 0.02).
 Using the Cox model, AC was the most independent predictor of DFI.
 These data support the inclusion of surgery in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with NSCLC and SBM.
