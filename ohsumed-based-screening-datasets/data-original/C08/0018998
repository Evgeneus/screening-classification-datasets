Endoscopic repair of supraglottic laryngeal clefts.
 We describe the technique of endoscopic diagnosis and endoscopic surgical repair used in the management of supraglottic interarytenoid laryngeal clefts in 11 children seen between 1981 and 1988 at the Hospital for Sick Children, London, England.
 Six of the children had primary type I clefts that required endoscopic repair.
 The symptoms included inspiratory stridor, choking during eating, and aspiration.
 Five of the children had previous transcervical repair of type II clefts that had partial breakdown in the interarytenoid area causing symptoms of aspiration, which required secondary repair endoscopically.
 All the patients had successful microlaryngoscopic closure; in two children, however, the breakdown of the repair necessitated repeated endoscopic correction.
 The only complication occurred in a case of postoperative supraglottitis, which was successfully managed with intubation and antibiotics.
 We conclude that endoscopic repair is a useful and reliable technique and an elegant alternative to the open transcervical approach for the closure of supraglottic laryngeal clefts.
