Videothoracoscopic ligation of bulla and pleurectomy for spontaneous pneumothorax.
 A thoracoscopic technique to ligate pleural bullae and perform parietal pleurectomy is described.
 The procedure has been performed on 2 patients, allowing definitive treatment of recurrent spontaneous pneumothoraces.
 Both patients have been cured of their problem and benefited from the decreased trauma of access by reduced postoperative pain, rapid recovery, and decreased scarring of the skin.
