Effects of embolus size on hemodynamics and gas exchange in canine embolic pulmonary hypertension.
 We examined the effects of different-sized glass-bead embolization on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange in 12 intact anesthetized dogs.
 Pulmonary hemodynamics were evaluated by multipoint pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa)/cardiac output (Q) plots before and 60 min after sufficient amounts of 100-microns (n = 6 dogs) or 1,000-microns (n = 6 dogs) glass beads to triple baseline Ppa were given and again 20 min after 5 mg/kg hydralazine in all the animals.
 Gas exchange was assessed using the multiple inert gas elimination technique in each of these experimental conditions.
 Embolization increased both the extrapolated pressure intercepts (by 6 mmHg) and the slopes (by 5 mmHg.l-1.min.m2) of the linear Ppa/Q plots, together with an 80% angiographic pulmonary vascular obstruction.
 These changes were not significantly different in the two subgroups of dogs.
 However, arterial PO2 was most decreased after the 100-microns beads, and arterial PCO2 was most increased after the 1,000-microns beads.
 Both bead sizes deteriorated the distribution of ventilation (VA)/perfusion (Q) ratios, with development of lung units with higher as well as with lower than normal VA/Q.
 Only 100-microns beads generated a shunt.
 Only 1,000-microns beads generated a high VA/Q mode and increased inert gas dead space.
 Hydralazine increased the shunt and decreased the slope of the Ppa/Q plots after 100-microns beads and had no effect after 1,000-microns beads.
 We conclude that in embolic pulmonary hypertension, Ppa/Q characteristics are unaffected by embolus size up to 1,000 microns.
