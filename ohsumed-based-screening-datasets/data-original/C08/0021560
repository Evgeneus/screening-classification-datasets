Full recovery after a chloroquine suicide attempt.
 The nonfatal case of a 20 year-old woman who ingested 6 grams of chloroquine in a suicide attempt is reported.
 After initial ventricular fibrillation, she rapidly developed a pulmonary edema with cardiogenic shock.
 She was successfully treated with diazepam, epinephrine, dobutamine and mechanical ventilation.
 Plasma chloroquine levels showed an initial peak of 36 micrograms/mL.
 The patient was discharged fully recovered after 19 days.
 The interaction between chloroquine and diazepam is discussed, as is the need for careful management of epinephrine therapy.
