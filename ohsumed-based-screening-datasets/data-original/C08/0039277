Wegener's granulomatosis complicated by pregnancy. A case report.
 A 23-year-old woman who presented in the 17th week of her third intrauterine pregnancy was diagnosed as having active Wegener's granulomatosis.
 Therapy, consisting of corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and hemodialysis, was instituted and maintained until delivery.
 Although Wegener's granulomatosis complicated by pregnancy has been reported previously, this is the first reported patient to be treated successfully with the above agents during the second and third trimesters without apparent harm to her or her infant.
