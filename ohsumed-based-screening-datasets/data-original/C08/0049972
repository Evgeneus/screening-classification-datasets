Effect of hyperventilation on oxygenation of the brain cortex of newborn piglets.
 A new phosphorescence imaging method (Rumsey et al.
 Science Wash.
 DC 241: 1649-1651, 1988) has been used to continuously monitor the PO2 in the blood of the cerebral cortex of newborn pigs.
 A window was prepared in the skull and the brain superfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid.
 The phosphorescent probe for PO2, Pd-meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphine, was injected directly into the systemic blood.
 The phosphorescence of the probe was imaged, and the lifetimes were measured using flash illumination and a gated video camera.
 The PO2 in the blood of the veins and capillary beds of the cortex was calculated from the lifetimes.
 Systemic blood pressure was continuously monitored while the systemic arterial PCO2, PO2, and blood pH were measured periodically.
 The PO2 in the blood was quantitated for 60- to 200 microns2 regions within the image (from a total field of approximately 3 mm diam).
 The PO2 in the microvasculature was not uniform across the viewing field but increased or decreased in each region independently of the other regions.
 Thus at any point in time the PO2 in a region could be substantially above or below the average value.
 During hyperventilation, which lowered arterial PCO2 and increased pH of the blood, the average PO2 decreased in proportion to the decrease in arterial PCO2.
 For example, hyperventilation, which decreased arterial PCO2 from its normal value of 40 Torr to 10 Torr, caused a rapid (within 5 min) decrease in PO2 in the blood of capillaries and veins to approximately one-third of normal.
