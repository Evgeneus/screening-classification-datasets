Recent advances in etoposide therapy for non-small cell lung cancer.
 Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) continues to be a major health problem in the US.
 In 1990, approximately 120,000 new cases will be diagnosed, and the majority of these patients will have either unresectable disease or resected disease that has a relatively low chance of being cured.

 The objective of this review is to summarize the results of the chemotherapy trials in Stage III and IV NSCLC patients.
