Clinical evaluation of a new chest tube used in neonates.
 We report preliminary experience with a newly designed chest tube (JCT), for evacuation of neonatal pneumothorax.
 The catheter has a unique pigtail confirguration at the distal end, intended to simplify placement and minimize chest wall and lung trauma by reduced tube size and depth and insertion.
 Thirty-eight JCTs were placed in neonates with pneumothoraces.
 Neonates' birth weights ranged from 400 to 3,595 grams.
 All 38 tubes immediately relieved clinical signs of pneumothoraces.
 Thirty-five (92%) tubes immediately fully evacuated the pneumothoraces as evidences on chest radiograph.
 Twelve pneumothoraces partially reoccurred at a mean of 24 hours following JCT placement.
 These tubes were either irrigated or replaced.
 This newly configured chest tube functions effectively in the treatment of neonatal pneumothorax.
