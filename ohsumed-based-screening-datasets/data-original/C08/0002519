Cardiorespiratory effects of endoscopic esophageal variceal sclerotherapy.
 Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS) is an effective means of controlling variceal hemorrhage, which develops as a consequence of portal hypertension.
 While esophageal perforation, ulceration, strictures, and mediastinitis are potential complications associated with this procedure, it is not clear whether isolated pleuropulmonary events such as pleuritis, pneumonitis, and adult respiratory distress syndrome are causally related to the EVS.
 Endoscopy and sedation with the attendant risk of aspiration, particularly in the background of hepatic encephalopathy, may account for some of these events.
 Recent controlled studies of respiratory function demonstrate that EVS as such results in minor changes in gas exchange, lung volumes, and pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics.
 Most pulmonary complications have been reported with the use of sodium morrhuate sclerosant.
 Comparative studies among different sclerosants are necessary to evaluate relative safety.
 Finally, there have been rare reports of myocardial ischemia and pericarditis reported in association with EVS, but these are of a transient nature.
 Chest symptoms, roentgenographic pleuropulmonary changes, pulmonary hemodynamics, and cardiac perturbations are transient and should not preclude offering EVS to patients with variceal hemorrhage.
