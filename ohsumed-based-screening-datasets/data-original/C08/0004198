An unusual late complication following surgical repair of tetralogy of Fallot.
 A case is presented of extrusion of right ventricular outflow tract patch material through a mediastino-cutaneous fistula occurring five years after repair of tetralogy of Fallot.
 The focus of the mediastinal infection was an infected epicardial pacemaker electrode placed at the time of initial surgery.
 Subsequent echocardiographic studies showed minimal right ventricular outflow tract or pulmonary arterial dilatation, and, with no further surgery, the child is well after two and a half years follow-up.
