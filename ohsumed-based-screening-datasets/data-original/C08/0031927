Imaging of metastatic colorectal cancer with tumour-activated killer lymphocytes.
 Adoptive immunotherapy may be useful for treating or visualising metastatic cancer.
 Lymphocytes were taken from 6 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and cultured with cells from the patients primary tumour to produce tumour-activated killer (TAK) lymphocytes.
 We re-injected each patient with IIIIn-labelled TAK cells in order to visualise metastases.
 Images were taken with a gamma-camera for up to 48 h after injection.
 Metastases were revealed as early as 4 h in the lung and as late as 48 h in the abdomen.
 Liver images produced "cold" spots corresponding to metastatic lesions.
 Lymph nodes were not visualised.
 Re-injection of TAK cells raised against autologous colorectal tumours reveals the sites of metastases.
