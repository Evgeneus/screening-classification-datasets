Neurogenic pulmonary edema: treatment with dobutamine.
 In the case of a patient with complicating subarachnoid hemorrhage, an infusion of dobutamine was followed by a massive diuresis and regression of severe neurogenic pulmonary edema.
 It is suggested that the reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance and the increase in cardiac contractility accounts for the observed beneficial effect and indicate that dobutamine is a suitable drug for the treatment of neurogenic pulmonary edema.
