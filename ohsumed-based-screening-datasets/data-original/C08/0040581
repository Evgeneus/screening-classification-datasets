Predicting death in patients hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia.
 OBJECTIVE: To validate a previously reported discriminant rule for predicting mortality in adult patients with primary community-acquired pneumonia and to determine which factors available at hospital admission predict a fatal outcome among such patients.
 DESIGN: Historical cohort study.
 SETTING: University hospital.
 PATIENTS: Adults admitted to the hospital for community-acquired pneumonia.
 MEASUREMENTS: Using stepwise logistic regression, we analyzed prognostic factors (data available at admission and recorded in the medical record) that showed a univariate association with mortality.
 The predictive values of three discriminant rules were measured to validate the results of a previous study.
 MAIN RESULTS: Of 245 patients, 20 (8.2%) died.
 Of 42 prognostic factors identified in previous studies, 8 were associated with mortality, but only a respiratory rate of 30/min or more, a diastolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg or less, and a blood urea nitrogen of more than 7 mmol/L remained predictive in the multivariate analysis.
 A discriminant rule composed of these three variables was 70% sensitive and 84% specific in predicting mortality, yielding an overall accuracy of 82%.
 CONCLUSION: Tachypnea, diastolic hypotension, and an elevated blood urea nitrogen were independently associated with death from pneumonia in our study, confirming the value of a previously reported discriminant rule from the British Thoracic Society.
 This rule may be useful in triage decisions because it identifies high-risk patients who may benefit from special medical attention.
