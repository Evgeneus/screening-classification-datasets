The value of flexible bronchoscopy in childhood pulmonary tuberculosis.
 The value of 121 flexible bronchoscopy (FB) procedures was evaluated in 54 children, aged three months to 14 years, suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis.
 Specimens from FB were culture-positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven of the 13 bacteriologically confirmed cases.
 Bronchial abnormalities consistent with the diagnosis were found in 31 of 54 cases.
 Separate or coexistent findings at initial FB included airway compression (20 cases), granulation tissue (ten cases), and obstructive caseum (four cases).
 Chest roentgenograms underestimated bronchial involvement in 14 children.
 Further FB monitoring documented disease evolution.
 The FB was important in the management of patients, as it (1) guided the use of prednisone therapy, especially in the children with a chest roentgenogram not suggestive of bronchial involvement; (2) indicated a need for resection of granulation tissue by rigid bronchoscopy (three cases); and (3) guided the surgical decision (two children with persistent bronchial obstruction).
 Thus, FB is a safe and valuable procedure in the management of childhood pulmonary tuberculosis.
