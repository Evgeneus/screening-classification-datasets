Small cell lung carcinoma: clinicopathological, immunohistochemical, and ultrastructural study.
 Sixty-seven cases of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLA) in Tri-Service General Hospital (TSGH) during the past 16 years were studied.
 For patients with extensive stage of disease, the mean survival time and 2-year survival rate were 7.2 months and 3.1% versus 13.4 months and 16.7% for patients with limited stage.
 A better prognosis was obtained by treatment with a combination of intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
 Immunohistochemical studies were performed by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase method.
 The positive rates in descending order were bombesin (80%), synaptophysin (74.3%), neurofilament (68.6%), neuron-specific enolase (60%), low molecular weight cytokeratin (54.3%), high molecular weight cytokeratin (25.7%), chromogranin-A (22.9%), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (0).
 Seven cases were examined and found to be ultrastructure; only 3 cases were found to contain neurosecretory granules.
 We emphasize that electron microscopy is not necessary as a routine diagnostic procedure, while light microscopy should be employed whenever possible; the immunohistochemical study should be considered within this context.
