Psychological outcomes of a pulmonary rehabilitation program.
 This study assessed physiologic, psychological, and cognitive functioning in outpatients with COPD.
 Sixty-four subjects, 53 to 82 years of age, participated in the 30-day exercise rehabilitation program.
 The program consisted of exercise, education and psychosocial counselling.
 Participants were assessed prior to beginning the program and at the end of 30 days.
 Assessments at both times included physiologic functioning (bicycle ergometry testing, pulmonary function tests, 12-min walk), psychological well-being (anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, perceived well-being) and an abbreviated neuropsychological test battery.
 Results indicate significant improvement in physical endurance and pulmonary function, significant reductions in symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improvement in measures of general well-being and neuropsychological functioning.
 The study suggests that exercise rehabilitation of older adults with COPD contributes not only to improvements in physical functioning and endurance, but also to enhanced cognitive functioning and psychological well-being.
