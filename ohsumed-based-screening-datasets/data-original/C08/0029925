The basis and basics of mechanical ventilation.
 The development of mechanical ventilators and the procedures for their application began with the simple foot pump developed by Fell O'Dwyer in 1888.
 Ventilators have progressed through three generations, beginning with intermittent positive pressure breathing units such as the Bird and Bennett device in the 1960s.
 These were followed by second-generation units--represented by the Bennett MA-2 ventilator--in the 1970s, and the third-generation microprocessor-controlled units of today.
 During this evolutionary process clinicians recognized Types I and II respiratory failure as being indicators for mechanical ventilatory support.
 More recently investigators have expanded, clarified, and clinically applied the physiology of the work of breathing (described by Julius Comroe and other pioneers) to muscle fatigue, requiring ventilatory support.
 A ventilator classification system can help the clinician understand how ventilators function and under what conditions they may fail to operate as desired.
 Pressure-support ventilation is an example of how industry has responded to a clinical need--that is, to unload the work of breathing.
 All positive pressure ventilators generate tidal volumes by using power sources such as medical gas cylinders, air compressors, electrically driven turbines, or piston driven motors.
 Positive end-expiratory pressures, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, pressure support ventilation, pressure release ventilation, and mandatory minute ventilation, are examples of the special functions available on modern ventilators.
 Modern third-generation ventilators use microprocessors to control operational functions and monitors.
 Because these units have incorporated the experience learned from earlier ventilators, it is imperative that clinicians understand basic ventilator operation and application in order to most effectively prescribe and assess their use.
