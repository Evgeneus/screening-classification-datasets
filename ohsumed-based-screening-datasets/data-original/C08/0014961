Pathologic bronchial vasculature in a case of massive hemoptysis due to chronic bronchitis.
 The cause of bleeding in a patient with recurrent massive hemoptysis was not apparent after bronchoscopy and gross examination of the lobectomy specimen.
 Histologic submission of all major bronchi uncovered dilated, tortuous bronchial arteries just below the bronchial mucosa with sites of both current and healing arterial rupture.
 This bronchial arterial abnormality is common to several chronic pulmonary diseases, but is rarely diagnosed as a cause of massive hemoptysis.
 Careful pathologic examination of major bronchi in the setting of hemoptysis of unknown causation is recommended.
