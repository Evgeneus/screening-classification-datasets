Application of smooth Teflon clip to inferior vena cava during radical cystectomy to prevent postoperative pulmonary embolism.
 Between 1976-1986, a smooth Teflon clip was applied to the inferior vena cava of 56 patients who underwent radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.
 The purpose of the clip is to narrow the lumen of the inferior vena cava so that large emboli will be trapped and thus prevented from reaching the lungs.
 These 56 patients were compared with a group of 26 historical controls who underwent radical cystectomy without application of such a clip between 1967-1976.
 One patient (1.8%) whose vena cava was clipped had a pulmonary embolus which was fatal.
 Four (15.4%) of the 26 control patients had postoperative pulmonary emboli, the embolic event being fatal in 3 (11.5%).
 Application of the smooth Teflon clip to the inferior vena cava significantly lessens the incidence of pulmonary embolism following radical cystectomy.
