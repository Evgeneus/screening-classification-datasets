Initial management of trauma. The first 5 minutes.
 Trauma is the leading cause of death in young Americans and is responsible for the loss of more productive years of life than heart disease and cancer combined.
 Initial management of trauma consists of the establishment or maintenance of a patent airway, ensurance of adequate breathing, and resuscitation of the circulation.
 All of these are accomplished simultaneously with a cursory survey to identify immediately life-threatening injuries and to prevent permanent disability.
