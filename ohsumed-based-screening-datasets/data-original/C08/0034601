Vasculitis. A practical approach to management.
 Vasculitis encompasses a wide variety of diseases.
 Because diagnosis may be difficult, a careful evaluation is essential, including a detailed patient history, thorough physical examination, and appropriate laboratory studies.
 Diagnosis is based on clinicopathologic features that permit identification of the condition.
 Biopsies are often necessary to confirm a diagnosis.
 It is important to accurately categorize the vasculitic disorders, since prompt, aggressive therapy with potentially toxic drugs is necessary to avoid irreversible organ system dysfunction.
