Effect of positive airway pressure on capillary transit time in rabbit lung.
 We used fluorescence videomicroscopy to measure the passage of fluorescent dye through the subpleural microcirculation of the lung.
 With the rabbit in the left lateral decubitus position, the subpleural microcirculation was viewed either through a transparent parietal pleural window located in the superior part of the chest or directly with the chest open.
 There was no physical contact with the chest or lung.
 The rabbit was anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated with 100% O2.
 The dye was injected into the right ventricle during a 2-min apneic period to eliminate lung movement due to ventilation.
 The video signal of the passage of the dye was analyzed frame by frame by use of digital image processing to compensate for cardiogenic oscillations of the lung surface.
 Gray scale levels of an arteriole and adjacent venule were measured every 1/30 s.
 Capillary transit time was determined from the difference between the concentration-weighted mean time values of the arteriolar and venular dye dilution curves.
 We studied the effect of airway pressure (0-20 cmH2O) on transit time.
 Cardiac output was measured at different airway pressures by the thermal dilution technique.
 Capillary transit time averaged 0.60 s at functional residual capacity.
 Right ventricular-to-arteriolar transit time was four times as large as the capillary transit time.
 An increase in airway pressure from 0-5 to 20 cmH2O resulted in a fourfold increase in both capillary and arterial transit times and a threefold decrease in cardiac output.
