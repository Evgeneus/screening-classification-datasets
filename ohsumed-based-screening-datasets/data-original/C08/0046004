Microphonic versus end-tidal carbon dioxide nasal airflow detection in neonates with apnea.
 Impedance pneumography in combination with expired CO2 monitoring are commonly used techniques for detecting central and obstructive apnea in infants.
 In this investigation an American Telephone and Telegraph StarSet-1 3000-ohm self-actuating microphone connected to the end of an infant cannula was used to monitor neonatal nasal airflow to detect breaths and apnea.
 The microphone was placed in a soundproof container to eliminate environmental sound artifacts.
 Analyses of 100 breaths from five patient samples during active and quiet sleep showed that there was no significant difference between microphone and expired CO2 recording of respiration.
 The techniques were 98% and 96% sensitive, respectively.
 Microphonic detection of nasal airflow identified 27 of the 32 episodes of upper airway obstruction (84.2%) registered by end-tidal CO2 recording.
 Inspiratory and expiratory events could also be well documented.
 Microphonic recording of nasal airflow is a reliable and inexpensive technique to detect apnea.
