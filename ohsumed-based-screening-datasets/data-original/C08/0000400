Differential therapy with calcium antagonists in pulmonary hypertension secondary to COPD. Hemodynamic effects of nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil.
 In 53 patients with COPD and precapillary pulmonary hypertension, we investigated the effect of three typical calcium antagonists on hemodynamics at rest and during bicycle ergometer exercise.
 In the responders, the decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance following nifedipine was 23 percent at rest (p less than 0.0005) and 35 percent during exercise (p less than 0.0005); following diltiazem, it was 10 percent at rest (p less than 0.05) and 23 percent during exercise (p less than 0.025); following verapamil, it was 22 percent at rest (p less than 0.005) and 11 percent during exercise (p less than 0.025).
 The cardiac index rose significantly at rest and under exercise only after the administration of nifedipine (+16 percent and +8 percent, resp).
 Nifedipine caused the most distinctive peripheral vasodilation.
 The heart rate increased slightly following nifedipine and decreased slightly following diltiazem and verapamil.
 After long-term therapy with nifedipine (13 +/- 5 months), the decrease in pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance was no longer significant.
 In our opinion, the different hemodynamic action profiles will have consequences for the differential therapy in patients with COPD and pulmonary hypertension.
