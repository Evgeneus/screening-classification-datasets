Assessing the feasibility of bronchoplastic surgery with magnetic resonance imaging.
 Bronchoplastic surgical techniques may allow resectional therapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma in select patients in whom preoperative pulmonary function demonstrates prohibitive risk for pneumonectomy.
 We report an otherwise poor candidate for pneumonectomy in whom coronal magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated the potential for distal bronchial salvage.
