Antibody levels to whole culture filtrate antigens and to purified P32 during treatment of smear-positive tuberculosis.
 Antimycobacterial IgG levels were measured repeatedly during treatment in 12 patients with moderate or severe pulmonary tuberculous disease using a dot immunobinding assay.
 We used reflectance densitometry equipment to quantify the immunoperoxidase staining and a Mycobacterium bovis BCG culture filtrate and the purified P32 protein as antigens.
 Antibody response against whole culture filtrate and P32 antigen increased after a three-month period of treatment.
 After this antibiotherapy was completed, the estimated amount of antibodies directed against the P32 decreased while those against the whole culture filtrate remained at the same level.
 A serologic test using P32 as the antigen seems to allow a better discrimination between active and healed tuberculosis.
