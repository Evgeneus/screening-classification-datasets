Pachymeningitis associated with a pulmonary nodule.
 The authors report a case of hypertrophic pachymeningitis, a rare cause of spinal cord compression.
 In this patient, dural inflammation was associated with a histologically identical pulmonary lesion.
 Such an association has not been described previously and supports the hypothesis that this disease is related to other connective tissue disorders.
