Case report: cisplatin-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome.
 Two patients developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE), following red blood cell transfusion in a setting of acute cisplatin nephropathy.
 One manifested the full picture of hemolytic uremic syndrome, the other had transient features following blood transfusion.
 We further reviewed the clinical records on blood transfusion for all patients with cisplatin nephropathy.
 A third case of (NCPE) was identified in a patient with acute renal dysfunction.
 However, none of the 16 patients with cisplatin-induced, mild stable chronic renal impairment had pulmonary dysfunction or other laboratory evidence for microangiopathy following transfusion.
 Hemolytic uremic syndrome may be a rare manifestation of cisplatin toxicity.
 Caution is indicated in transfusing patients with acute platinum nephropathy even in the absence of overt microangiopathy.
 The pathogenesis of this syndrome and the cause for NCPE is unclear.
 The literature is reviewed and discussed.
