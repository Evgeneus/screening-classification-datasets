Isolated hyoid bone fracture: a case report and review of the literature.
 Isolated hyoid bone fractures secondary to trauma other than strangulation are rare and have few, if any, complications.
 We report a case of an isolated hyoid bone fracture that resulted in sudden and severe upper airway compromise.
 Diagnosis of these fractures is difficult and usually can be made only with a strong degree of suspicion.
 Patients who suffer neck injuries in whom a hyoid fracture is diagnosed or strongly suspected should be observed for 48 to 72 hours, considered for endoscopy, and treated as warranted.
