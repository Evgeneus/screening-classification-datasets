Chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin or 5-FU, cisplatin, and vinblastine for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. A randomized phase II study of the cancer and leukemia group B.
 Two hundred forty-seven patients with previously untreated nonresectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were entered in a prospective, randomized Phase II trial.
 Response assessment was possible in 232 patients, and 237 patients were evaluable for survival.
 Thirteen partial responses (11%) and 5 regressions (4%) of evaluable disease were obtained for the 116 patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (C) (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.5% to 21.5%).
 The median time to progression was 2.2 months and the median survival time was 4.6 months for 5-FU plus C.
 Twenty-three partial responses (20%) and 4 regressions (3%) of evaluable disease were obtained for the 116 patients treated with 5-FU, C, and vinblastine (V) (95% CI, 15.3% to 30.7%).
 The median time to progression was 2.8 months and the median survival time was 5.6 months for 5-FU, C, and V.
 The 5-FU and C doses were equivalent in the two treatment regimens.
 Sixteen of 85 patients (19%) with a performance status of 0 and 18 of 103 patients (17%) with a performance status of 1 responded, whereas only 2 of 44 patients (5%) with a performance status of 2 or greater responded (P = 0.009).
 Patients who had received locoregional radiation therapy had a lower overall response rate then those in the no prior radiation therapy group (P = 0.028).
 The median survival time for patients with a performance status of 0 or 1 was 6.3 months compared with 1.9 months for patients with a performance status of 2 or greater (P less than 0.001).
 Performance status also appeared to be a significant factor for time to progression.
 More frequent and severe leukopenia, fever, genitourinary (GU) toxicity, and pulmonary toxicity was reported with 5-FU, C, and V.
 There were three treatment-related deaths with 5-FU, C, and V and one treatment-related death with 5-FU plus C.
 Grade III/VI myelotoxicity was not influenced by prior radiation therapy or performance status.
 Neither regimen is active enough to be considered as standard therapy for advanced NSCLC.
