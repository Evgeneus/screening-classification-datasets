Delayed sternal closure for life-threatening complications in cardiac operations: an update.
 Over a 7-year-period, 25 patients had delayed sternal closure after open heart operations out of 34 patients whose sternum was not closed.
 The indications were extreme cardiac dilatation and uncontrollable mediastinal hemorrhage.
 This represented a 1.79% incidence in the overall open heart surgical experience at our unit.
 Sternal closure was performed at a mean of 2.64 days after the initial operation.
 Eighteen patients (52.9%) left the hospital alive and well, representing a 72% survival rate among patients undergoing delayed sternal closure.
 No mediastinal or fatal infection developed and only 1 patient had late superficial wound infection after delayed sternal closure.
 We conclude that delayed sternal closure is an effective method to treat severe complications after cardiac operations.
