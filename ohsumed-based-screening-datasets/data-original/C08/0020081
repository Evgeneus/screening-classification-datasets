In vitro susceptibilities of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis to seven fluoroquinolones.
 The in vitro susceptibilities of Bordetella pertussis and Bordetella parapertussis to seven fluoroquinolones were assessed by the agar dilution method.
 Ciprofloxacin and temafloxacin were the most active compounds (MIC for 90% of isolates tested [MIC90], 0.06 microgram/ml), while enoxacin and pefloxacin were the least active (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml).
 Fleroxacin, lomefloxacin, and ofloxacin showed intermediate activities (MIC90s, 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml).
 These results suggest a possible role for the fluoroquinolones in the treatment of pertussis, at least in adult patients.
