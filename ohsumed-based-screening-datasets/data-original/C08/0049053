Altretamine.
 Altretamine is a National Cancer Institute-designated group C antineoplastic agent used in the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer.
 Altretamine is a highly lipid-soluble drug available only for oral administration as a capsule.
 The drug is activated through metabolic oxidation to intermediate methylol derivatives and formaldehyde.
 It is unclear which metabolite is the major species responsible for cytotoxicity or the primary mechanism of cytotoxicity.
 As a single agent in the treatment of ovarian cancer, altretamine demonstrates a response rate similar to other active agents in this disease (21-39 percent).
 The major utility of altretamine is in combination with other agents such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, fluorouracil, melphalan, and cisplatin.
 However, few randomized trials have evaluated the contribution of altretamine in these multiagent combinations.
 Dose-limiting toxicities include gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting, anorexia), hematologic, and neurotoxic (peripheral neurotoxicity).
 The therapeutic role of altretamine is limited because of a toxicity profile similar to that of cisplatin, one of the more active agents in ovarian cancer.
 Its use should be reserved for patients who are not candidates for more standard platinum-based regimens.
