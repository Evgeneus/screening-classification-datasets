Air interface and elastic recoil affect vascular resistance in three zones of rabbit lungs.
 We examined the effect of the air interface on pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) in zones 1, 2, and 3 by comparing pressure-flow data of air- and liquid-filled isolated rabbit lungs.
 Lungs were perfused with Tyrode's solution osmotically balanced with 1% albumin and 4% dextran and containing the vasodilator papaverine (0.05 mg/ml).
 Lung volume was varied by negative pleural pressure form 0 to -25 cmH2O.
 Pulmonary artery (Ppa) and venous (Ppv) pressures were fixed at various levels relative to the lung base.
 Alveolar pressure (PA) was always zero, and perfusate flow was measured continuously.
 In zone 1 Ppa was -2.5 cmH2O and Ppv was -15 cmH2O.
 In zone 2 Ppa was 10 cmH2O and Ppv was -5 cmH2O.
 In zone 3 Ppa was 15 cmH2O and Ppv was 8 cmH2O.
 We found that in zone 1 the interface was essential for perfusion, but in zones 2 and 3 it had much lesser effects.
 In general, PVR depended almost uniquely (i.e., with small hysteresis) on transpulmonary pressure, whereas a large hysteresis existed between PVR and lung volume.
 PVR was high in collapsed and especially in atelectatic lungs, fell sharply with moderate inflation, and within the ranges of vascular pressure studied did not rise again toward total lung capacity.
 These results suggest that in zone 1 the interface maintains the patency of some alveolar vessels, probably in corners.
 The majority of alveolar septal vessels appears to be exposed directly to PA in zones 2 and 3, because at equal transpulmonary pressure the PVR is similar in the presence or absence of an interface.
