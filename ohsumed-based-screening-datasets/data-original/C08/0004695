Role of endoscopy in diagnosing scleroma in its uncommon sites.
 Eighty cases suffering from rhinoscleroma were studied.
 Suspected cases were examined by sinoscopy, nasopharyngoscopy and bronchoscopy for detection of secondary involvement in these sites.
 Antroscleroma, salpingoscleroma and tracheo-bronchoscleroma have been found in a relatively high percentage of cases.
 The role of endoscopy in early diagnosis, initial symptomatic treatment and follow-up cases is discussed.
