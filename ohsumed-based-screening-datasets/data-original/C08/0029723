Feasibility of epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia in a small community hospital.
 The first 6-mo experience of a two-physician APS using primarily epidural morphine in a community hospital is presented.
 After-hours anesthesia coverage was from home.
 The only monitoring was by nursing service observation.
 Complications occurred at incidences comparable to larger studies.
 Using the precautions outlined in the text, complications were appropriately diagnosed and treated despite the lack of 24-h in-house anesthesia coverage.
