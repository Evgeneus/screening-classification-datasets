Exposure to asbestiform minerals and radiographic chest abnormalities in a talc mining region of upstate New York.
 A radiologist in New York reported a high prevalence of pulmonary fibrosis in St.
 Lawrence and Jefferson counties.
 The New York State Department of Health responded by conducting a case history study of radiographic abnormalities found in the lung parenchyma and pleura of residents in Lawrence and Jefferson counties, where tremolitic talc has been mined for many years.
 During a 1-y period, all radiographs from 6 hospitals in the region were reviewed.
 A B-reader confirmed that 355 of 9,442 patients who were at least 40 y of age (3.8%) had a relevant abnormality; 60% of them reported occupational exposure to asbestiform minerals, and another 15% had a chest condition or injury that could have accounted for the abnormal radiograph.
 The results should be interpreted cautiously, but there was no evidence of widespread radiographic abnormalities resulting from ambient dust exposure.
 The data, however, support earlier studies that indicate that talc miners and millers experience excess parenchymal fibrosis and pleural changes.
 The data also suggest that individuals in the paper industry and construction trades may be at risk.
