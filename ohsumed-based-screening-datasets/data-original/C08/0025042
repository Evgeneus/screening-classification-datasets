Synergistic anti-Pneumocystis carinii effects of erythromycin and sulfisoxazole.
 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonitis was effectively prevented in 90% of immunosuppressed rats by the administration of 100 mg of erythromycin and 300 mg/kg/day of sulfisoxazole.
 All of the untreated control and erythromycin-treated animals developed the infection and 80% of rats given sulfisoxazole alone had the pneumonitis.
 A similar pattern of response occurred when the drugs were used therapeutically for rats with established P.
 carinii pneumonitis.
 The erythromycin and sulfisoxazole ratio of 1:3 was the most effective of several dose combinations tested.
 The established safety record from three decades of clinical use of this drug combination plus the broad spectrum of coverage for other causes of diffuse pneumonitis such as Chlamydia, Mycoplasma, and Legionella warrant further study of erythromycin-sulfisoxazole in AIDS patients.
