The laryngeal mask airway. An unusual complication.
 The laryngeal mask airway is an important addition to the anaesthetist's armamentarium, but its use is not without the possibility for misfortune.
 We encountered an unusual and potentially serious complication.
 A patient's epiglottis became trapped between the pliable grates in the mask portion of the laryngeal mask and partially obstructed his airway.
 Should this problem occur and remain unnoticed, in addition to the problem of airway obstruction during the anaesthetic, the oedematous epiglottis could be severely injured upon removal of the laryngeal mask.
 This, in turn, could result in airway obstruction requiring emergency treatment.
