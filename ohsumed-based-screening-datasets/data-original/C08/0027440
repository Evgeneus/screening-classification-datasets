8-Aminoquinolines from Walter Reed Army Institute for Research for treatment and prophylaxis of Pneumocystis pneumonia in rat models.
 Three 8-aminoquinolines from the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research (WRAIR), WR6026, WR238605, and WR242511, strongly inhibited Pneumocystis carinii growth in vitro at 1 microgram/ml.
 This activity was similar to that of primaquine.
 In rat therapy models, the WRAIR compounds affected Pneumocystis pneumonia at doses as low as 0.25 mg/kg (WR242511) or 0.5 mg/kg (WR6026 and WR238605).
 At these doses, primaquine alone was ineffective as therapy.
 In a rat prophylaxis model, all three WRAIR 8-aminoquinolines were extremely effective at daily doses of 0.57 mg/kg, showing activity greater than that of primaquine at this dosage and comparable to that of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole at 50/250 mg/kg.
