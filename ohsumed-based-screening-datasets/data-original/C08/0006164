Nasolaryngoscopy for family physicians.
 Nasolaryngoscopy is easy to learn and safe and convenient to perform.
 It is readily accepted by patients and is a rich source of clinical information.
 The flexible nasolaryngoscope allows the physician to directly observe the anatomy of the nasal passages, pharynx and larynx.
 The procedure is helpful for identifying the etiology of chronic nasal complaints and hoarseness.
 Other possible indications for nasolaryngoscopy include suspected nasal foreign body, recurrent nasal or pharyngeal bleeding, and epiglottitis.
 With the use of this instrument, treatment of otolaryngologic conditions may be more specific, thereby reducing unnecessary referral or delay in treatment.
