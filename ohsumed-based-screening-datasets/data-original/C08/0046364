A practical guide to nitrate use.
 Nitrate preparations are useful in the treatment of acute and chronic angina, acute and chronic congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction.
 Development of tolerance is best managed by providing a nitrate-free interval, thus avoiding continuous drug levels.
 This interval probably should be 10 to 12 hours with use of a transdermal patch.
 Nitrate treatment of the elderly may require lower doses to avoid hypotension.
