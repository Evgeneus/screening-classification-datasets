Phase II trial of whole-cell pertussis vaccine vs an acellular vaccine containing agglutinogens.
 An acellular pertussis vaccine containing agglutinogens 2 and 3, pertussis toxin, and filamentous haemagglutinin was developed by the Centre for Applied Microbiology and Research in the UK.
 188 infants were entered into a randomised blind trial and received either the acellular or a whole-cell vaccine, combined with diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, in a 3, 5, and 8-10 month schedule.
 Local reactions were similar in the two groups but significantly fewer infants had systemic symptoms after the acellular vaccine.
 Mean log-antibody titres to the agglutinogen and toxin components were higher with the acellular than with the whole-cell vaccine.
 Persistence of antibodies one year after the third dose was also better in the acellular group.
