Scleroma of the upper respiratory passages: a CT study.
 Scleroma is a chronic specific granulomatous disease endemic in Egypt.
 The nasal cavities were all affected in the 37 patients examined.
 The paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx were involved in 17 patients, while the larynx and upper trachea were affected in five patients, four of whom were females.
 Twenty-three patients were in the granulomatous stage; the rest of the patients were in the atrophic and fibrotic stages.
 The main nasal and nasopharyngeal CT findings were soft tissue masses of variable sizes.
 The lesions were characteristically homogenous, non-enhancing and had distinct edge definition; adjacent fascial planes were not invaded.
 The subglottic area was involved in laryngeal and tracheal scleroma.
 The lesions were mainly in the form of concentric irregular narrowing of the airway.
 In the trachea, crypt-like irregularities were diagnostic of scleroma.
 Intra-orbital, intra-cranial and infratemporal parapharyngeal scleromatous masses were detected in one patient.
