Reduction of neonatal mortality after multiple doses of bovine surfactant in low birth weight neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.
 To determine if outcomes of low birth weight neonates with respiratory distress syndrome can be improved by the administration of multiple doses of bovine surfactant, we conducted two identical multicenter, controlled trials, and the results were combined for analysis.
 Seven hundred and ninety-eight neonates weighing 600 to 1750 g at birth who had developed respiratory distress syndrome within 6 hours of birth were assigned randomly to receive either 100 mg of phospholipid/kg of Survanta, a modified bovine surfactant (n = 402), or a sham dosing procedure (n = 396).
 Neonates whose respiratory distress persisted could be given up to three more doses, with all doses to be given in the first 48 hours after birth.
 Dosing was performed by investigators not involved in the clinical care of the neonates; nursery staff were kept blinded as to the treatment assignment.
 Fewer Survanta-treated neonates died of any cause (18.4% vs 27.3%, P = .002), died of respiratory distress syndrome (9.0% vs 20.3%, P less than .001), and either died or developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia due to respiratory distress syndrome (51.2% vs 64.6%, P less than .001).
 Neonates who received Survanta also had greater improvement in their oxygenation and ventilatory status from baseline to 72 hours than did control neonates.
 Survanta-treated neonates were at lowered risk for developing pulmonary interstitial emphysema (18.6% vs 39.3%, P less than .001) and other pulmonary air leaks (11.5% vs 25.9%, P less than .001).
 We conclude that multiple doses of Survanta given after diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome reduce mortality and morbidity.
