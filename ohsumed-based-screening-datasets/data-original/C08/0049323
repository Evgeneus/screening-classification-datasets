Effect of enlarged adenoids on arterial blood gases in children.
 The enlarged adenoid is a common disorder in children resulting in nasopharyngeal obstruction.
 Many authors suggest that increased nasal resistance to respiration may cause disturbances in the pulmonary ventilation and carry the risk of obstructive sleep apnoea and/or cardiopulmonary syndrome.
 This study comprised 30 children complaining of long-standing nasal obstruction due to enlarged adenoids.
 Adenoidectomy was performed and the arterial blood gases were measured before and one month after surgery.
 Twelve normal children were also included as controls.
 Statistical evaluation of the results showed that O2 saturation and arterial O2 tension (PaO2) were significantly low before the operation, and increased significantly after surgery.
 Arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) was insignificantly low before operation, but decreased significantly after adenoidectomy.
 It was concluded that enlarged adenoid may be associated with ventilatory impairment which is reversible after adenoidectomy.
