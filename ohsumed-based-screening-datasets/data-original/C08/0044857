Comparison between Bricanyl Turbuhaler and Ventolin metered dose inhaler in the treatment of exercise-induced asthma in adults.
 The aim of the present study was to compare the effect of Bricanyl Turbuhaler (0.5 mg x 1 terbutaline) with the effect of albuterol metered dose inhaler (0.1 mg x 2 albuterol) in patients with reproducible bronchoconstriction.
 The study was performed as a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in sixteen asthmatic adults.
 Bronchoconstriction was induced by steady state running on a treadmill.
 Both 0.5 mg terbutaline and 0.2 mg albuterol have good bronchodilating effects in patients with exercise-induced asthma.
 There was, however, a faster onset of action after albuterol.
 The clinical value of this observed difference is uncertain.
