Effect of glutathione aerosol on oxidant-antioxidant imbalance in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
 Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by alveolar inflammation, exaggerated release of oxidants, and subnormal concentrations of the antioxidant glutathione in respiratory epithelial lining fluid (ELF).
 Glutathione (600 mg twice daily for 3 days) was given by aerosol to 10 patients with IPF.
 Total ELF glutathione rose transiently, ELF oxidised glutathione concentrations increased, and there was a decrease in spontaneous superoxide anion release by alveolar macrophages.
 Thus, glutathione by aerosol could be a means of reversing the oxidant-antioxidant imbalance in IPF.
