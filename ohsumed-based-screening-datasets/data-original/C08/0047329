Guidelines for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia for children infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
 Although guidelines have been established for prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) for adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, they have not been available for children (1).
 Experts in pediatric HIV infection (convened by the Pediatric HIV Resource Center) independently reviewed recent data and provided recommendations to the U.S.
 Public Health Service for PCP prophylaxis for HIV-infected or -exposed children.
 This report summarizes these deliberations and details the consensus guidelines.
