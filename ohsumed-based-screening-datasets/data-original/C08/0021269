Altered surfactant function and metabolism in rabbits with acute lung injury.
 Lung injury was induced in rabbits with N-nitroso-N-methylurethane (NNNMU), and saturated phosphatidylcholine (Sat PC) pool sizes and phospholipid compositions were measured in alveolar wash subfractions isolated by differential centrifugation (large and small surfactant aggregates).
 Surfactant metabolism also was studied using intravascular and intratracheal radiolabels.
 Protein permeability, gas exchange, and compliance were significantly abnormal as lung injury progressed.
 At peak injury, there was a decrease in the large aggregate Sat PC pool size in alveolar wash accompanied by increased uptake of Sat PC from the air space and increased specific activity of both intravascular and intratracheal radiolabels in lamellar bodies.
 This was followed by a marked rise in the small aggregate pool size in the alveolar wash and increased secretion of Sat PC into the air spaces.
 Phospholipid compositions, total phospholipid-to-protein ratios, and in vivo functional studies using a preterm ventilated rabbit model were abnormal for both large and small aggregate surfactant fractions from the lung-injured rabbits.
 These studies characterize quantitative, qualitative, and functional changes of alveolar wash surfactant subfractions in NNNMU-injured lungs.
