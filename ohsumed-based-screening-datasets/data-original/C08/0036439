Comparison of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine with an alternating regimen of methotrexate, etoposide, and cisplatin/cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine in the treatment of extensive-disease small-cell lung carcinoma: a Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program study.
 An alternating regimen for the treatment of extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) was compared with standard treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and vincristine (CAV) in 170 patients.
 Overall severity of toxicity was similar in both arms, with four toxic deaths in each arm (4.7%).
 Response results were also similar, with 54% complete and partial responses with the standard regimen and 53% complete and partial responses with the alternating regimen.
 Median survival time was 6.9 months with the standard regimen and 9.2 months with the alternating regimen (P = .078).
 The 2-year survival rate was 1.2% for the standard regimen and 4.7% for the alternating regimen.
 Survival benefit for treatment with the alternating regimen reached statistical significance only in those subsets of patients with poorer prognosis (male sex, performance status 3, liver metastases, bone marrow metastases, and oat cell histologic subtype).
