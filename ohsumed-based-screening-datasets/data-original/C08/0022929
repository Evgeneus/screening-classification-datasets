Effects of prostaglandin E1 in postoperative surgical patients with circulatory deficiency.
 Hemodynamic and oxygen transport effects of PGE1 were observed in the early postoperative period before development of ARDS in two series of general surgical patients with circulatory deficiencies.
 The first was a series of 19 studies in 18 patients, the second was a placebo-controlled series of 20 patients (ten received PGE1 and ten received a placebo).
 In the first series, PGE1 was given as a trial of therapy after fluid therapy to pulmonary wedge pressures greater than 15 mm Hg failed to correct satisfactorily circulatory and metabolic functions.
 There were two deaths in the placebo group and none in the PGE1 group.
 Previous studies indicated that PGE1 disaggregates platelets and reduces local vasoconstriction in pulmonary circulation; this study suggests that PGE1 improves tissue perfusion of systemic circulation.
 After fluid therapy to PAOP greater than 15 mm Hg fails to restore circulatory function to optimal values.
 PGE1 should be considered as ancillary therapy in critically ill postoperative patients.
