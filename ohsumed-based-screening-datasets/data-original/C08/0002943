Tracheal and main bronchial disruptions after blunt chest trauma: presentation and management 
 Tracheobronchial disruption is one of the less common injuries associated with blunt thoracic trauma.
 This injury can be life threatening, however, and failure to diagnose it early can lead to disastrous acute or delayed complications.
 Nine cases of tracheobronchial disruption in the setting of nonpenetrating thoracic trauma were seen at four Los Angeles trauma centers between 1980 and 1987.
 Mechanism of injury, presentation, diagnosis, and management of these patients were reviewed.
 Disruptions involved the trachea in 3 patients, the right bronchus in 5 patients, and the left bronchus in 2 patients.
 Tracheobronchial disruptions occurred in settings of high-energy impact-type injuries and were more likely to have associated injuries than they were to occur alone.
 Common presenting signs included subcutaneous emphysema, dyspnea, sternal tenderness, and hemoptysis.
 Radiographic findings were most commonly pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and clavicle or rib fractures.
 Rigid bronchoscopy and fiberoptic bronchoscopy were both highly accurate methods for diagnosis but only in the hands of trained cardiothoracic surgeons.
 Delay in diagnosis increased the likelihood of postoperative complications.
