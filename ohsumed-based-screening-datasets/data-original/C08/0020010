Cellular immunity in current active pulmonary tuberculosis.
 A group of 10 patients with recently diagnosed pulmonary TB were studied and compared to 10 bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immunized healthy individuals.
 Cellular immune mechanisms were explored in vitro utilizing fresh and precultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to PHA, PPD, and recall antigens (SK/SD and CA).
 Proliferative assays were also carried out in the presence of either each patient's serum (autologous serum) or cocultured with CD3(+)-depleted adherent cells.
 Serum measurements of soluble interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor and synthesis of IL-2 generated by mononuclear cells stimulated with PPD and SK/SD were also performed.
 Patient sera were able to inhibit autologous as well as allogeneic cell responses, and a significant adherent cell suppressive effect was observed.
 As a whole the group of patients showed decreased blast transformation to PPD, preserved proliferative responses to other recall antigens, and a low PPD-induced generation of IL-2.
 Furthermore, as possible evidence of preactivated T cells, these patients demonstrated high soluble IL-2 receptor serum levels.
 Early compromise of specific cell-mediated immunity, including IL-2 abnormalities, may be of significance in newly diagnosed pulmonary TB.
