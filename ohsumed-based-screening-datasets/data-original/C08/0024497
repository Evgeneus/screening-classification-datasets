Lymphocytic hypophysitis and pulmonary sarcoidosis. Report of a case.
 Lymphocytic hypophysitis is one of the causes of hypopituitarism in the postpartum period.
 Some of these patients have been reported to have other organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and the disease is considered to be autoimmune in nature.
 The authors describe a unique case of lymphocytic hypophysitis in a young woman.
 She had hemianopia that developed three days after delivery.
 Computed tomography scans revealed an intrasellar mass lesion.
 Secretions of adrenocorticotropic hormone and growth hormone were decreased.
 Although no organ-specific autoantibodies were detected in her serum, OKT4-positive helper T lymphocytes were increased in peripheral blood.
 Pituitary biopsy at craniotomy showed typical features of lymphocytic hypophysitis.
 Pulmonary and eye sarcoidosis developed 11 months after the delivery.
 This is, to the authors' knowledge, the first case of lymphocytic hypophysitis associated with sarcoidosis in other organs.
