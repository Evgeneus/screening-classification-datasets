Plasma prostanoids in neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Influence of meconium aspiration.
 Thromboxane B2 may be a mediator of neonatal persistent pulmonary hypertension.
 Elevated levels of plasma thromboxane and prostacyclin have been described previously in hypoxic newborn infants with neonatal pulmonary hypertension.
 We measured serial plasma levels of thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (stable metabolite of prostacyclin) in 21 newborn infants with severe respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension who required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support.
 We sought to study (1) the evolution of plasma prostanoids in pulmonary hypertensive infants treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and (2) whether different pulmonary hypertensive diagnostic subgroups have distinctive prostanoid profiles.
 Our data indicated that infants with meconium aspiration had significantly lower levels of plasma thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha while receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation than did infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension but no meconium aspiration.
 Levels of all infants decreased progressively as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support continued.
