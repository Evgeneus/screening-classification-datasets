Facilitation of mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus with continuous intravenous thiopental.
 Mechanical ventilation in status asthmaticus is associated with a significant mortality and morbidity.
 To facilitate intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV), we have used continuous IV thiopental (thiopentone) together with traditional ventilatory techniques.
 With this policy, we were able to achieve rapid correction of arterial blood gas tensions in a group of 20 severe asthmatics requiring IPPV.
 By 1 hour, peak airway pressure (PAP) had fallen from 58.6 +/- 15.7 to 30.2 +/- 10.9 cm H2O (p less than 0.001).
 During the same period, PaCO2 fell from 51.3 +/- 15.3 to 40.17 +/- 8.2 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) and pH rose from 7.25 +/- 0.1 to 7.33 +/- 0.1 (p less than 0.001).
 Morbidity was low and in particular, no episode of barotrauma was noted.
 All patients survived the acute attack and were successfully liberated from the ventilator.
 We conclude that these results are largely attributable to our use of early and continuous IV anesthesia induced by thiopental.
