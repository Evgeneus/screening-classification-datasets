Surgical management of lung metastases. Usefulness of resection with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser with median sternotomy.
 Between May 1969 and September 1989, 677 metastatic lesions were resected during 107 operations in 100 patients with pulmonary metastases from various primary sites at the Center for Adult Diseases, Osaka, Japan.
 Of those patients, 65 underwent conventional lateral thoracotomy, and 35 patients had median sternotomy.
 No significant difference existed in actuarial survival after the first operation to remove the metastases between the two patients groups.
 Furthermore, local excision of 418 lesions was performed in 25 patients with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser.
 Of those, 18 patients had undergone a one-stage operation for bilateral lesions through a median sternotomy approach.
 Although our study was not randomized, survival of the 25 patients treated with the Nd:YAG laser tends to be longer than survival of the 75 patients for whom the Nd:YAG laser was not used.
 We concluded that aggressive excision and evaporation of multiple lung metastases with the Nd:YAG laser under median sternotomy is a safe and promising variation in technique and that this approach will expand the scope of surgical indications for metastatic lung tumors.
 For a clearer demonstration of the influence of differences in surgical techniques on long-term survival it is necessary to conduct randomized prospective studies of the surgical techniques.
