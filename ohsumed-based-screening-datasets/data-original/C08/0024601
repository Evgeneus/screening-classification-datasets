General anaesthesia and undrained pneumothorax. The use of a computer-controlled propofol infusion.
 A patient who required pleurectomy had a 30% pneumothorax when she was presented for anaesthesia.
 She had refused to have this drained, and it had not responded to conservative management.
 She was anaesthetised using a computer-controlled propofol infusion system, without the use of nitrous oxide, and a chest drain was inserted before the institution of positive pressure ventilation.
 This technique reduces the hazards associated with general anaesthesia in the presence of an undrained pneumothorax.
 It may be a safe alternative method of induction of anaesthesia in other conditions in which positive pressure ventilation must be avoided, such as bronchopleural fistula.
