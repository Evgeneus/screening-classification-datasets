Sequential appearance of IL-1 and IL-6 activities in rat carrageenin-induced pleurisy.
 IL-1 and IL-6 activities were measured in the pleural exudate of rats during carrageenin-induced pleurisy to examine the relationship of the local production of cytokines to the inflammatory reaction.
 Time courses of appearance of the cytokines and inflammatory parameters in the exudate were compared.
 IL-1 activity and exudate volume started to increase at 1 h after the carrageenin injection, and then slightly later IL-6 activity and leukocyte number began to increase.
 IL-1 showed peak activity of approximately 700 U at 3 h and IL-6, of 6000 U at 5 h in the exudate, whereas exudate volume and number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes continued to increase thereafter.
 Furthermore, IL-6 level in the plasma of the carrageenin-injected rats showed a peak at 4 h (30 U/ml), and when rhIL-1 alpha (100,000 U) was intrapleurally injected, the more rapid increase in plasma IL-6 level was demonstrated at 1 h (30 U/ml).
 This latter rise was neutralized with simultaneous injection of anti-rhIL-1 alpha antibody.
 These facts indicate the possibility that IL-1 produced in the exudate or injected could rapidly propagate a signal to induce IL-6 production in the circulation.
 It took several hours to transmit an inflammatory signal that stimulated the liver to synthesize the acute-phase protein, T-kininogen.
 The time lag from the peak induction of IL-1 to the T-kininogen-increase in the pleurisy corresponded well to the interval for T-kininogen-increase by exogenous rhIL-1 alpha injection.
 These results strongly suggest that the initial inflammatory stimulus induces sequentially IL-1, IL-6, and T-kininogen production in this carrageenin inflammation.
