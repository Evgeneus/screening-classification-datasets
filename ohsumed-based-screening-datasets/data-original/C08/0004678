Lipid peroxidation and expression of copper-zinc and manganese superoxide dismutase in lungs of premature infants with hyaline membrane disease and bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 The putative involvement of reactive oxygen species in the etiology of lung damage in infants receiving mechanical ventilation has been examined by comparing the levels of peroxidation and expression of the antioxidant enzymes, CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase, in lungs from control and affected infants as well as from fetuses and infants who died postnatally after term delivery.
 Mean levels (+/- SD) of lung peroxidation, determined with a thiobarbituric acid method, were similar in affected and control premature neonates and in fetal subjects (1.87 +/- 1.26, 1.92 +/- 2.07, and 1.19 +/- 1.36 nmol/mg protein, respectively).
 Expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases was also similar in these subjects and in the patients who died postnatally.
 Thus activity measurements and immunoblotting studies showed continuous expression of these enzymes throughout development with no apparent change in protein levels or size.
 Immunohistochemical examination of lung tissue showed expression of CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutases in epithelial, smooth muscle, endothelial, and some mesenchyme components.
 In patients with bronchopulmonary dysplasia, alveolar walls were thickened by an excess of fibrous tissue and terminal air spaces were lined mainly by type II pneumatocytes.
 All structures, including abnormal fibrous components, were positive for both CuZn and Mn superoxide dismutase.
 Our data show that, unlike some experimental animals, expression of at least these antioxidant enzymes in human infants born prematurely is similar to that in adults, and indicate that such infants are better adapted for life in an oxygen-containing environment than previously suspected.
