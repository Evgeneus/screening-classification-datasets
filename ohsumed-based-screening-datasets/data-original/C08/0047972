A phase II study of days 1 and 8 cisplatin and recombinant alpha-2B interferon in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
 Preclinical data from studies of human lung cancer xenografts suggest that the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin are enhanced by alpha-interferon.
 To verify the above observations, the authors initiated a Phase II trial in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
 Cisplatin was given at 100 mg/m2 during a 28-day cycle in a divided day 1 and day 8 schedule.
 Starting on day 1, alpha-2B interferon was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 5 million units three times a week continuously for a minimum of 2 months.
 Between January 1989 and September 1989, 30 patients were evaluated for response and toxicity.
 According to the staging system proposed by Mountain, 20 patients had Stage IV disease, 7 had Stage IIIB disease, and 3 had Stage IIIA disease.
 Expression of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and Leu-7 was immunohistochemically investigated to evaluate possible relationship to treatment response.
 The response rate was 13.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.2% to 25%).
 The four responders showed positivity for NSE, and two of them were positive for Leu-7.
 An average of three cycles was given.
 The mean dose intensity administered was 83% of the projected dose for cisplatin and 92% of the projected dose for alpha-2B interferon.
 A standard scale was used to assess interferon toxicity.
 Hematologic, renal, and systemic side effects were not significant.
 In advanced NSCLC the addition of alpha-2B interferon did not increase the cisplatin-induced response rate.
 Further studies should be performed to determine the real value of chemotherapy response in tumors showing positive immunoreactivity for neural markers such as NSE and Leu-7.
