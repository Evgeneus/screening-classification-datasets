Round atelectasis in a 20-year-old woman.
 Round atelectasis is an unusual pulmonary pseudotumor often associated with primary pleural pathologic conditions or pleural effusion.
 We report the case of a 20-year-old woman who was found to have a large, circular pulmonary lesion demonstrated on both plain chest x-ray film and computed chest tomography.
 The patient underwent exploratory thoracotomy, at which time this uncommon entity was identified.
