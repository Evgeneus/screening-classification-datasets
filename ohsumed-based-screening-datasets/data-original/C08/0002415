Brake mechanics, asbestos, and disease risk.
 Health risks posed by inhalable asbestos fibers are known to exist in a variety of industrial and nonindustrial settings.
 Although early studies described an increased risk of asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma in asbestos-industry workers, subsequent research revealed the existence of a potential asbestos-related health hazard in nonasbestos industries such as the textile and railroad industries.
 Brake mechanics and garage workers constitute a large work force with potential exposures to levels of asbestos capable of producing disease.
 Unfortunately, the health risk faced by these workers has received little attention.
 This article briefly discusses currently available information on the asbestos health risks of workers in this setting, and highlights the need for further investigations of this occupational group.
