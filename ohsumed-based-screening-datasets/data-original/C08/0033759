Atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli in stroke patients.
 In 539 consecutive stroke patients admitted to a rehabilitation department, we studied the possible role of atrial fibrillation as a risk factor for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism by analyzing a series of relevant clinical data in patients with and without atrial fibrillation and in patients with and without venous thromboembolic complications.
 Deep venous thrombosis as well as advanced age and cardiac disease were significantly (p less than 0.001) more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation.
 However, in a model of simultaneous logistic regression carried out on the presence of absence of venous thromboembolic complications, atrial fibrillation was the only significant risk factor.
 In view of the morbidity and mortality linked to deep venous thrombosis, our findings argue for preventive anticoagulation therapy in stroke patients suffering from atrial fibrillation and merit further study.
