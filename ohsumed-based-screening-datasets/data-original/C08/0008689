Complications of nasotracheal intubation in neonates, infants and children: a review of 4 years' experience in a children's hospital.
 A computerized database was set up to study the incidence and outcome of complications of nasotracheal intubation in a paediatric hospital.
 We studied 2953 intensive care admissions over a 4-yr period.
 The overall complication rate was 8%.
 Accidental extubation and tube blockage were the most frequent events, accounting for a mean of 3.5% and 2.6% of the complications per year, respectively.
 Complications were more common in smaller children and there were differences between fields of intensive care.
 None of the complications was fatal or resulted in serious sequelae.
 None of the children in the study showed clinical symptoms of acquired subglottic stenosis before discharge from hospital, and none has been readmitted for this condition subsequently.
