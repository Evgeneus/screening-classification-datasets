Self-administered hyperventilation cardiopulmonary resuscitation for 100 s of cardiac arrest during Holter monitoring.
 An 80-year-old man remained conscious due to vigorous deep breathing during 100 s of ventricular arrest which was recorded on a Holter ECG.
 Arterial blood flow is considered to have been maintained by changes in intrathoracic pressure produced by deep respiratory movements.
 This case may represent a pure model of the "thoracic pump" mechanism.
