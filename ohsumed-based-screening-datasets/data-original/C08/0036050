Photodynamic therapy for multiple primary bronchogenic carcinoma.
 In recent years, multiple primary lung cancers have been reported with greater frequency, partly as a result of technologic advances in the detection of lung cancer and therapeutic achievements in its management.
 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively new therapy used with increasing frequency in the treatment of a wide variety of malignancies, including central lung cancers.
 In PDT, the differential retention of an injected photosensitizer by malignant tissue is exploited by treatment with a low-power laser beam delivered endoscopically.
 Since 1980, 145 patients with central lung cancers, including 35 cases of endoscopically evaluated early-stage lesions were treated with PDT at Tokyo Medical College.
 Thirteen of these 145 patients had multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas, five cases of which were synchronous with the rest, metachronous.
 Three of 13 patients with multiple tumors had early-stage lesions and were treated with endoscopic PDT alone.
 In the other ten cases, PDT was used to treat accessible early-stage foci although operative excision was required for advanced lesions.
 Mean survival after PDT, alone or in combination with surgery, was 38 months (range, 14 to 87 months), and seven patients remain alive to date.
 It was concluded that PDT is useful in extending the therapeutic options for, and improving the prognosis of patients with, multiple primary bronchogenic carcinomas.
