Cardiorespiratory effects of pressure controlled ventilation in severe respiratory failure.
 Cardiorespiratory values were measured in ten patients with severe respiratory failure on volume controlled and pressure controlled ventilation.
 Tidal volume, respirator rate, PEEP, auto-PEEP, inspiratory:expiratory ratio (1:2) and FIo2 were maintained at the same value for both ventilatory modalities.
 Changing from VCV to PCV was associated with significant improvements in PaO2, oxygen delivery, and tissue oxygen consumption.
 Peak inspiratory pressure fell.
 There were no significant changes in other cardiorespiratory values, such as arterial blood pressure, nor in ventilatory measurements, such as mean airway pressure, associated with the use of PCV.
 These results suggest that PCV may be a beneficial ventilatory modality in the treatment of severe respiratory failure since it results in improvement in arterial oxygenation, tissue oxygen delivery and utilization without any concomitant adverse effects on other hemodynamic or ventilatory factors.
