Swan-Ganz catheter-induced massive hemoptysis and pulmonary artery false aneurysm.
 Swan-Ganz catheter-induced massive hemoptysis and later pulmonary artery false aneurysm occurred in a patient with prosthetic mitral regurgitation.
 This patient was successfully managed by double-lumen endotracheal intubation, control of pulmonary hypertension, reversal of anticoagulation, mitral valve re-replacement, and transcatheter embolization.
 The pertinent literature is reviewed.
