Compensatory growth in fibrotic lung injury.
 We induced severe left-sided lung fibrosis by the unilateral endobronchial instillation of paraquat (1.0 mg/kg) into the left lungs of adult Fischer 344 male rats.
 Growth of the contralateral lung as well as its proliferative activity were measured 6 or 14 days later.
 Whereas the left lung underwent severe fibrosis and shrinkage with more than 85% reduction in lung volume, the right lung more than doubled in size.
 In addition, there was a significant increase in total protein content, DNA content, and DNA synthesis.
 We conclude that unilateral lung injury resulting in ipsilateral fibrosis and loss of parenchyma is associated with compensatory growth of the contralateral lung.
