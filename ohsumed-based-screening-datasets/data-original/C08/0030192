Effect of positive expiratory pressure breathing in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 The effect of positive expiratory pressure breathing, alone and in combination with coughing, was investigated in eight patients with cystic fibrosis.
 Functional residual capacity and total lung capacity was measured with a body plethysmograph before, during, and immediately after breathing with expiratory pressure of 5 and 15 cm H2O, and after a coughing period.
 The positive expiratory pressure breathing was carried out five times for two minutes with a two minute interval between each period.
 Mucus transport was measured in a peripheral lung region and over the whole lung by a radioactive aerosol tracer technique.
 Clearance measurements were carried out continuously during positive expiratory pressure breathing and during a control period.
 Two minutes' breathing with an expiratory pressure of 5 and 15 cm H2O caused an increase in mean (SEM) functional residual capacity from 2.6 (0.1) to 3.6 (0.3) and 4.4 (0.5) 1 and an increase in total lung capacity from 5.1 (0.2) to 5.9 (0.3) and 6.9 (0.4) 1.
 Lung volumes were higher during breathing with an expiratory pressure of 15 cm H2O than with 5 cm H2O; both returned to baseline values immediately after positive expiratory pressure breathing.
 Spontaneous mucus clearance and mucus clearance by coughing were not influenced by positive expiratory pressure breathing at either expiratory pressure.
 Thus in patients with cystic fibrosis positive expiratory pressure breathing increases lung volumes in relation to the expiratory pressure imposed; these changes in lung volume did not, however, lead to an improvement of mucus transport.
