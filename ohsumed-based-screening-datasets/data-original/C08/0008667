Crohn's disease of the lung 
 Two years after developing colonic Crohn's disease, a 17 year old boy presented with focal pulmonary consolidation.
 A lung biopsy specimen showed areas of non-caseating epithelioid granuloma.
 Although some respiratory abnormalities appear to be associated with inflammatory bowel disease, granulomatous disease affecting the lung has not previously been reported in a child.
