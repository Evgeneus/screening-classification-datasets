Pulmonary embolism associated with the act of defecation.
 Pulmonary embolism associated with the act of defecation has not been well described in the medical literature.
 We report our experience with deep vein thrombosis in patients who had a pulmonary embolism triggered by the act of defecation.
 In these individuals the embolization of peripheral thrombus appeared to have resulted from the performance of the Valsalva maneuver and its effects on peripheral blood flow and intrathoracic pressures.
 In addition, the important role of nursing personnel in recognizing and diagnosing this disorder as well as in initiating prophylactic measures directed against the development of thromboembolic disease is discussed.
