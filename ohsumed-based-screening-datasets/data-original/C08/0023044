Role of tachykinins in hyperpnea-induced bronchovascular hyperpermeability in guinea pigs.
 Isocapnic dry gas hyperpnea causes bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs that is mediated by release of tachykinins from airway sensory nerves.
 Exogenous neuropeptides can induce microvascular leak.
 Therefore we tested whether dry gas hyperpnea also elicits bronchovascular hyperpermeability by measuring Evans blue-labeled albumin extravasation along the airways of mechanically ventilated guinea pigs.
 We found that 1) room temperature dry gas hyperpnea increased Evans blue extravasation in extrapulmonary and intrapulmonary airways as a specific consequence of local airway heat/water losses, 2) capsaicin pretreatment ablated the bronchoconstrictor response to dry gas hyperpnea and reduced bronchovascular leak only in intrapulmonary airways, 3) phosphoramidon given to capsaicin-pretreated animals partially restored dry gas hyperpnea-induced bronchoconstriction and increased the vascular hyperpermeability response to hyperpnea in intrapulmonary airways, and 4) propranolol administration had no important effects on any of these airway responses.
 We conclude that dry gas hyperpnea causes bronchovascular hyperpermeability in guinea pigs.
 Tachykinins have a dominant role in this response in the intrapulmonary airways, although another mechanism may also contribute to the microvascular leak in the extrapulmonary airways.
