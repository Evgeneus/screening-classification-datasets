Pulmonary compliance: early assessment of evolving lung injury after onset of sepsis.
 We compared the sensitivity of dynamic (Cdyn) and static lung compliance (CL) with indicators of permeability injury in a model of septic porcine adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 Two groups of anesthetized ventilated swine (15-25 kg) were studied.
 Septic animals (Ps, n = 13) received Pseudomonas aeruginosa intravenously for 1 h, which resulted in severe adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 Controls (C, n = 13) received 0.9% NaCl.
 Cdyn, CL, bronchoalveolar lavage for protein estimation, and thermal cardiogreen extravascular lung water (EVLW) measurements were performed in seven C and eight Ps animals.
 Six C and five Ps animals underwent gamma camera measurement of lung-to-heart ratio (slope index) of 99Tc-labeled human serum albumin.
 Both Cdyn and CL decreased significantly (P less than 0.01) at 30 min and thereafter in Ps vs.
 C.
 EVLW, slope index, and bronchoalveolar protein content increased significantly (P less than 0.05) in Ps vs.
 C at 120, 150, and 300 min, respectively.
 Cdyn and CL decreased well before onset of permeability injury.
 These early changes may be due to release of vasoactive mediators and sequestration of neutrophils in the pulmonary capillaries and later to increases in EVLW.
 Measurement of Cdyn and CL represents an early means of assessing evolving lung injury in this acute septic porcine model.
