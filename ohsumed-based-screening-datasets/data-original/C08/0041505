Immunohistochemical expression of galactomannan in the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells during invasive aspergillosis.
 The monoclonal antibody EB-A1 to galactomannan is apparently specific for detecting Aspergillus species and Penicillium marneffei in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues.
 It reveals hyphae, remnants of filaments, and organisms in the cytoplasm of some phagocytic cells.
