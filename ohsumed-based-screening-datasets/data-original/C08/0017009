Physical and psychosocial consequences of total laryngectomy.
 The incidence and severity of respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy and their influence on daily living were studied in 59 laryngectomized patients.
 Daily sputum production was the principal complaint of these patients (98%), followed by coughing (64%) and the need for frequent forced expectoration (more than 5 times a day) in order to clear the airway (57%).
 Frequent stoma cleaning (more than 5 times a day) was required by 37% of the patients.
 Significant correlation was found between respiratory symptoms, voice rehabilitation and several aspects of daily living, including fatigue, sleep problems, social contacts and psychological distress.
 These findings indicate that respiratory symptoms after total laryngectomy are both frequent and troublesome.
 The development of effective methods for minimizing and/or preventing such respiratory problems would contribute significantly to improving the quality of life of laryngectomized patients.
