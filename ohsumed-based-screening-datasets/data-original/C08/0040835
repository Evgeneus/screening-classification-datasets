Crescentic glomerulonephritis in Wegener's granulomatosis: morphology, therapy, outcome.
 Fourteen patients with Wegener's granulomatosis (WG) and severe renal and extrarenal involvement were studied (serum creatinine on admission 5.8 +/- 3.4 mg/dl).
 Renal histology showed a necrotizing, crescentic glomerulonephritis in all patients.
 Despite advanced renal disease on admission cyclophosphamide, steroids (in 13 patients) and plasma exchange (in 9 patients) caused a rapid and sustained improvement of renal function.
 Four patients required intermittent hemodialysis over a period of one week.
 After 2 weeks of treatment serum creatinine values below 2 mg/dl (n = 4) indicated a nearly complete recovery of renal function in the long-term follow up (mean serum creatinine achieved after 12 months therapy: 1.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dl (n = 4).
 Therefore serum creatinine values observed after 2 weeks of therapy, appear to be of prognostic value with regard to renal outcome.
 No relapse of active WG or progressive renal deterioration was observed during follow-up (22 +/- 13 months) except in one patient with persisting renal impairment.
 Three patients died (staphylococcus sepsis, intracerebral hemorrhage during hypertensive crisis, pulmonary embolism) during the first two months of therapy.
 The decline of serum creatinine seemed to be a better indicator of successful therapy than the decrease of anticytoplasmatic antibody (ANCA), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hematuria.
 On admission ANCA titer neither correlated with serum creatinine, the degree of renal involvement, nor was it of prognostic value.
 ANCA, serum creatinine and hematuria normalized within 2 to 8 months, whereas ESR and proteinuria remained elevated.
 Our data indicate a good prognosis of WG even with advanced renal involvement and generalized vasculitis provided aggressive treatment is performed early.
