Occurrence, clinical manifestations, and prognosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
 In order to obtain more information on the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome and recent developments in its prognosis, we analysed the severity and prognosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome in children diagnosed and treated during the years 1980-6 throughout Finland.
 The criteria for Guillain-Barre syndrome were fulfilled in 14 boys and 13 girls.
 The mean annual number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome was thus 3.9, giving a mean annual incidence of 0.38/100,000 of population under 15 years of age (95% confidence intervals 0.25 to 0.56/100,000).
 The incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome causing permanent neurological defects in children under 15 years of age was 1.4/10 million annually (95% confidence intervals 0.035 to 7.8/10 million).
 Our figures appeared to be one fourth to a half of that reported earlier in children and even lower than those in adults.
 Although there were no deaths among our patients, mortality from Guillain-Barre syndrome seems to have remained similar for the last 20 years despite current awareness of the possibility of cardiac arrest and respiratory failure.
