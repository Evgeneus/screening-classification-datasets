Comparative in vitro activities of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) and other antimicrobial agents against staphylococci, enterococci, and respiratory tract pathogens [published erratum appears in Antimicrob Agents Chemother 1991 Mar;35(3):603]
 The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (CI-978; AT-4140) was compared with those of other antimicrobial agents against isolates of staphylococci, enterococci, and various respiratory tract pathogens.
 Sparfloxacin was the most active drug tested against staphylococci (MIC for 90% of the strains tested [MIC90], 0.125 micrograms/ml) and enterococci (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml).
 It was also active against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml), Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis (MIC90, 0.125 microgram/ml), Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 0.5 microgram/ml), and Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC90, 1.0 microgram/ml).
