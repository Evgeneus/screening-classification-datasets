Self-care actions taken by older adults for influenza and colds.
 The purpose of this study was to examine self-care behaviors that older adults use to manage cold and influenza episodes.
 Interviews were conducted with 160 adults aged 65 to 94.
 A large number and a variety of cold- and influenza-related self-care actions were reported.
 Medication administration was found to be common for colds (79% of subjects) and influenza (95%).
 Subjects reported more illness-specific preventive behaviors for influenza than for colds.
 Influenza vaccination behavior was related to experiences with vaccination-associated illness, health state, and talking with physicians about vaccination.
 Few subjects identified potential hazards associated with influenza or colds.
