Venous thromboembolism after brain tumor surgery: a retrospective review.
 We retrospectively reviewed the incidence rate of clinical postoperative deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism in 1703 patients undergoing initial craniotomy for meningioma, glioma, or cerebral metastasis.
 The incidence rate of clinical thromboembolic complications was 1.59% for all tumor groups within the first 4 weeks of surgery.
 Patients undergoing surgery for meningiomas had a statistically significant increased risk of thromboembolism despite fewer overall perioperative risk factors, when compared with the other tumor groups.
 The tumor-specific incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism for meningioma, glioma, and metastasis were 3.09%, 0.97%, and 1.03%, respectively.
 Whether this difference was a result of increased surgical time or an inherent property of meningiomas could not be ascertained.
