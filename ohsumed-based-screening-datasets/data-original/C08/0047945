Cough-type asthma: a review.
 Cough-type asthma is a well-defined entity.
 The patients typically have a chronic, nonproductive cough that is exacerbated by exercise and upper respiratory tract infections.
 Bronchial provocation maneuvers are helpful in diagnosing cough-type asthma in older children and adults.
 Bronchodilators are the mainstay of therapy, although some patients may require cromolyn sodium or inhaled corticosteroids.
 The natural history of this process suggests that approximately a third to a half of these patients may progress to "classical" asthma with wheezing.
