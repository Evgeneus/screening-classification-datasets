The growing teratoma syndrome.
 A 26-year-old man presented with multiple pulmonary nodules and a left testicular mass.
 Combination chemotherapy for a malignant, mixed germ cell testicular tumor resulted in shrinkage of the pulmonary nodules and normalization of the tumor markers (beta-HCG, LDH and AFP).
 Subsequent surgical excision performed for enlargement of the pulmonary nodules revealed mature teratomas, diagnostic of the GTS.
