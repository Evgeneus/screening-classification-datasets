The role of indium-labelled leukocyte imaging in pyrexia of unknown origin.
 Indium-111-labeled white blood cell scanning is often used in the investigation of pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) to locate an otherwise occult source of sepsis.
 From a series of 166 white blood cell studies performed for sepsis, 28 cases of true PUO were identified and reviewed.
 The sensitivity was 60% and specificity 70%, with a positive predictive value of 38% and negative predictive value of 90%.
 Only 11% of studies revealed a pyogenic cause for PUO.
 These results are discussed and the potential role of gallium scanning in PUO is raised.
