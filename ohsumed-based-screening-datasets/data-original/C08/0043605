Neutrophil apoptosis and clearance from neonatal lungs.
 8 newborn babies with airways inflammation, who were mechanically ventilated, underwent bronchoalveolar lavage to examine the fate of neutrophils in the inflamed airways.
 Light microscopy and electronmicroscopy showed evidence of neutrophil apoptosis and ingestion of intact neutrophils by macrophages in specimens from all 8 infants.
 Neutrophil apoptosis, without the local release of intracellular contents that promote inflammation, might represent a mechanism by which tissue injury is reduced during the resolution of neonatal pulmonary inflammation.
