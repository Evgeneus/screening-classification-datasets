High definition computed tomography in rheumatoid arthritis associated pulmonary disease.
 Eighteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (American Rheumatism Association definition) were selected consecutively from a rheumatology clinic.
 All patients were examined with plain chest radiographs, thin slice computed tomography, and pulmonary function tests.
 Four patients with normal chest radiographs, and normal pulmonary function tests were found to have normal CT scans.
 In ten patients, abnormalities consistent with rheumatoid associated lung disease were demonstrated, including changes of interstitial fibrosis in seven cases.
 This fibrosis had a predominantly peripheral pattern on CT scan.
 Computed tomography was found to be more sensitive than plain radiographs in detecting abnormalities; however, all the patients in this series with CT lung changes had abnormalities on pulmonary function testing.
