What to do when an x-ray film suggests lung cancer.
 The chest film is one of the most common methods of detecting lung cancer, which often appears as solitary nodules or hilar masses.
 Once the diagnosis is established, the most effective treatment can be determined and staging of the tumor can be done.
 Surgical resection is the only cure for non-small-cell carcinoma, although radiotherapy and chemotherapy may shrink some tumors.
 Because 90% of all cases are caused by smoking, a preventive approach to the disease is crucial.
 Screening of high-risk patients (ie, smokers with airflow obstruction) using chest films and sputum cytology may aid this approach.
