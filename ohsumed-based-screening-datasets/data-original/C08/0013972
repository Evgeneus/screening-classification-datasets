Fatal embolization of intestinal contents through a duodenocaval fistula.
 Embolization of intestinal contents to the lung is an exceedingly rare event, which to our knowledge, has never been reported as a cause of death.
 Equally rare is duodenocaval fistula resulting from a penetrating duodenal peptic ulcer.
 We present the case of a 51-year-old man whose duodenal ulcer led to a fistulous tract with the inferior vena cava and subsequently to progressive pulmonary embolization of intestinal contents, ultimately resulting in death from respiratory failure.
