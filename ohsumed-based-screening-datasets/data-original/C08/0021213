Differential effects of continuous versus intermittent suction on tracheal tissue.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the differential effect of continuous versus intermittent application of negative pressure on tracheal tissue during endotracheal suctioning.
 The sample consisted of 12 mongrel dogs, randomly assigned to group 1 (N = 5), continuous suction, or group 2 (N = 5), intermittent suction.
 All animals were orally intubated (40F endotracheal tube).
 Two control animals were intubated and not suctioned.
 Animals in group 1 and 2 were suctioned every 15 minutes for 4 hours for a total of 16 suction passes.
 Endotracheal suctioning was performed by using a 14F suction catheter either continuously (10 seconds) or intermittently (2 seconds with, 1 second without for a total of 10 seconds) at a suction pressure of 200 mm Hg and a suction flow rate of 16 L/min.
 Tracheal tissue samples were examined for simplified and major simplified damage, ulceration, and ulceration with necrosis.
 Results indicated that all forms of damage were present with both suctioning techniques.
 No significant differences were found between group 1 and group 2 (Wilcoxon rank sum) for any of the alterations.
 Results indicate that both continuous and intermittent application of negative pressure with endotracheal suction produces significant damage to tracheal tissue.
