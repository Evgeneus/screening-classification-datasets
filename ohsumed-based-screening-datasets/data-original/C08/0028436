Nasalis myocutaneous sliding flap: repair of nasal supratip defects.
 The nasalis myocutaneous sliding flap ("nasalis flap") is an axial island flap based on the branch of the angular artery that supplies the nasalis muscle.
 The technique for performing this flap for the repair of defects up to 1.5 cm in diameter on the supratip area of the nose is described in detail.
 Twenty-four cases with supratip defects following Mohs surgery repaired with the nasalis flap are reported.
 Flap survival was 100% and final cosmetic results were excellent.
 It is concluded that the nasalis flap should always be considered for the repair of defects of the supratip area of the nose.
