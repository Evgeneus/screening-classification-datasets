Regional blood flow to canine parietal pleura and internal intercostal muscle.
 Transcapillary Starling forces in the parietal pleura and the underlying interstitium may potentially contribute to the exchange of fluid across this barrier.
 However, the extent of blood flow to the parietal pleura has not been measured.
 Thus, using standard microsphere techniques, we compared blood flow to the parietal pleura, including the subpleural interstitium, with blood flow to the adjacent internal intercostal muscle, as well as with flows to other serous tissues, including mediastinal pleura, pericardium, and parietal peritoneum, in anesthetized dogs that were either breathing spontaneously (n = 9) or ventilated to control arterial PCO2 (n = 5).
 Blood flow (ml.min-1.g-1) was measured after 20 min of equilibration in four successive body positions: right lateral decubitus, supine, left lateral decubitus, and prone.
 Overall, flow to parietal pleura was not different in spontaneous [1.07 +/- 0.14 (SE)] and mechanically ventilated animals (0.74 +/- 0.11).
 Flow to the internal intercostal muscle was significantly less than pleural blood flow, averaging 0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.16 +/- 0.03 in the same groups, although again there was no effect of ventilation mode.
 Blood flow to other serous tissues in the thoracic cavity, specifically the mediastinal pleura (0.67 +/- 0.14) and pericardium (0.88 +/- 0.22), was similar to parietal pleural flow, whereas that to the parietal peritoneum was an order of magnitude lower (0.09 +/- 0.02, P less than 0.05).
 Changing body position had no effect on blood flow to any of the sampled tissues.
 Blood flow to the dorsal aspect of the chest wall muscle in spontaneously breathing animals tended to be greater than that to lateral or ventral portions of the chest wall.
