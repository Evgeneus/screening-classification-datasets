Cough intensity in patients with a vocal cord palsy.
 This study assesses the effect a paralysed cord has on the intensity of coughing.
 The air flow pattern during coughing of 10 patients with a vocal cord palsy was compared with a control group, using a computerized pneumotachograph system.
 There was no significant difference in the value of the peak air flow but the time taken to reach the maximum value was prolonged in the vocal cord palsy group.
 This non-invasive test may aid diagnosis of vocal cord palsies but the laterality of the lesion cannot be predicted from the airflow pattern alone.
