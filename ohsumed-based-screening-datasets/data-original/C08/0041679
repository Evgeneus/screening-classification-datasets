Ultrasonography as a method of examination of the frontal sinus.
 This prospective study was performed to evaluate the reliability of ultrasonography for the detection of fluid and mucosal swelling in the frontal sinus.
 The evaluation was based on a comparison of the preoperative ultrasonographic results with the surgical findings in 27 frontal sinuses.
 Ultrasonography was found to be a reliable method for the demonstration or exclusion of mucosal swelling and accumulated fluid (sensitivity 92%; specificity 93%).
