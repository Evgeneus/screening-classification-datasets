Radionuclide evaluation of cardiac function during sleep in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 The influence of sleep on cardiac function in severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia was assessed in five children 1.5 to 5 years of age.
 Left and right ventricular ejection fractions (LVEF and RVEF) were investigated by equilibrium radionuclide ventriculography in five children undergoing polygraphic monitoring during the different states of alertness: wakefulness, nonrapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement sleep.
 Intraobserver and interobserver LVEF and RVEF measurement reproducibility was high.
 During quiet, supine wakefulness, LVEF was normal, but RVEF was low.
 During sleep, a decrease in both LVEF and RVEF, expressed as a percentage of the awake value, was marked in the two children with the most nocturnal desaturation and longest duration of paradoxic rib cage motion during inspiration.
 It is concluded that radionuclide ventriculography can be easily performed during sleep in children and can provide useful information regarding right ventricular function during sleep in children with severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
