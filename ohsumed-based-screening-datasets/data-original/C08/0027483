Peak expiratory flow rate and the acute chest syndrome in homozygous sickle cell disease.
 The peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was studied in 20 matched pairs of children with homozygous sickle cell disease with either no episodes or six or more episodes of acute chest syndrome.
 The pairs were carefully matched for height and a highly significant reduction in PEFR was observed in children with multiple episodes of acute chest syndrome.
 Lateral and anteroposterior chest diameters and chest circumference correlated with PEFR but did not differ between index and control cases.
 The most likely cause of the reduced PEFR in children with multiple episodes of acute chest syndrome is an accumulating pulmonary fibrosis that decreases lung compliance.
