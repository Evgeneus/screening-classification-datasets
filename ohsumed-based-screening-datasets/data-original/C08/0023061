Neonatal calves develop airflow limitation due to chronic hypobaric hypoxia.
 Neonates and infants presenting with pulmonary hypertension and chronic hypoxia often exhibit airway obstruction.
 To investigate this association, we utilized a system in which neonatal calves are exposed to chronic hypobaric hypoxia and develop severe pulmonary hypertension.
 For the present study, one of each pair of six age-matched pairs of neonatal calves was continuously exposed to hypobaric hypoxia at 4,500 m (CH); the other remained at 1,500 m.
 At 2 wk of age, mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP), dynamic lung compliance (Cdyn), resistance (RL), and static respiratory system compliance (Crs) were measured at 4,500 m in both CH and control calves exposed acutely to hypoxia (C).
 These measurements were repeated after cumulative administrations of nebulized methacholine (MCh).
 Tissues were removed for histological examination and assessment of bronchial ring contractility to MCh and KCl.
 After 2 wk of hypobaric hypoxia, MPAP (C 35 +/- 1.7 vs.
 CH 120 +/- 7 mmHg, P less than 0.001) and RL (C 2.64 +/- 0.16 vs CH 4.99 +/- 0.47 cmH2O.l-1s, P less than 0.001) increased.
 Cdyn (C 0.100 +/- 0.01 vs.
 CH 0.082 +/- 0.007 l/cmH2O) and Crs (CH 0.46 +/- 0.003 vs.
 C 0.59 +/- 0.009 l/cmH2O) were not significantly different.
 Compared with airways of C calves, airways of CH animals did not exhibit in vivo or in vitro MCh hyperresponsiveness; however, in vitro contractility to KCl of airways from CH animals was significantly increased.
 Histologically, airways from the CH calves showed increases in airway fibrous tissue and smooth muscle.
