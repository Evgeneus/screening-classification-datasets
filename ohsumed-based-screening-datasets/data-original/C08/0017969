Nosocomial Legionnaires' disease and use of medication nebulizers.
 Guidelines for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia specify that only sterile fluids should be used for aerosol therapy; however, this recommendation may not be uniformly followed.
 Thirteen patients with nosocomial pneumonia due to Legionella pneumophila serogroup 3 (Lp3) were identified at a community hospital in the period from 1984 through 1988; 12 patients (92%) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; and 9 patients (69%) died.
 An epidemiologic investigation suggested that the use of nebulizers to deliver medication was associated with acquiring legionnaires' disease.
 The hospital potable water system was contaminated with Lp3, and a survey indicated that tap water was commonly used to wash medication nebulizers.
 Lp3 in respirable-size droplets was isolated from aerosols generated by a nebulizer containing Lp3 at one-tenth the concentration found in the hospital potable water.
 These findings support the recommendation that only sterile fluids be used for filling or cleaning respiratory care equipment and suggest that this guideline is not universally followed.
