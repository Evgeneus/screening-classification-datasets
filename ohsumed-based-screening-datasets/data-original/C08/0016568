Pulmonary embolization of iodine-125 seeds following prostate implantation.
 The optimal treatment of prostatic carcinoma limited to the gland remains controversial.
 Treatment has included implantation of Iodine-125 seeds via both a suprapubic approach and, more recently, a transperineal technique utilizing ultrasound guidance.
 We recently have noted a heretofore unreported complication with this latter technique, namely, embolization of seeds to the lungs.
 Review of the chest x-ray films of 31 patients who underwent suprapubic implants showed no evidence of this phenomenon.
 One of 5 patients undergoing transperineal implant was found to have seeds lodged in the lung.
 Complications surrounding the various treatments of localized prostate carcinoma are reviewed.
