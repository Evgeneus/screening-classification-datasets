Salivary-type neoplasms of the sinonasal tract.
 Salivary-type neoplasms of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses are numerically dominated by adenoid cystic carcinomas and pleomorphic adenomas.
 All others, benign or malignant, are rarely encountered and are usually biologically and histologically low-grade.
 Sites of origin in the sinonasal tract conform to the density and distribution of the seromucous glands and hence are most often nasal (septum and turbinates) or ostial.
