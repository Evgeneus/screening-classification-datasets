Management of panfacial fractures.
 Panfacial injuries are those that involve trauma to the lower, middle, and upper facial bones.
 They often are accompanied by multisystem- or polytrauma and require a team approach for management.
 Although stabilization of the overall status of the patient takes precedence, early and total restoration of facial form and function should be the goal of the maxillofacial surgeon.
