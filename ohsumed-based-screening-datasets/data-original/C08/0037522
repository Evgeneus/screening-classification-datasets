Nocardia asteroides infection complicating rheumatoid arthritis.
 We describe a case of pulmonary nocardiosis in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) receiving treatment with combined immunosuppressive agents and prednisone.
 This infection is still considered rare, hard to diagnose, and difficult to treat.
 To the best of our knowledge, such a case has not been described in a patient with RA.
