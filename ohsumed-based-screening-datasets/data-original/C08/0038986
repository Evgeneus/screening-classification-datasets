Pulmonary function tests in bronchopleural fistula.
 A 53-year-old white man underwent a left pneumonectomy for alveolar cell carcinoma.
 His postoperative course was complicated by pneumonia.
 At a follow-up clinic visit, the patient complained of a "roaring sound" during respiration.
 A follow-up PFT did not show the expected loss of volume (nitrogen washout) from a preoperative PFT, suggesting a bronchopleural fistula.
 A chest x-ray film and xenon lung scan confirmed the diagnosis.
 The fistula was surgically repaired.
