Respiratory problems in emergence from anesthesia.
 In conclusion, anesthesia and mechanical ventilation have major effects on respiratory function, both intraoperatively and postoperatively.
 Recognition that mechanical ventilation represents a major departure from spontaneous ventilation should enable anesthesiologists to compensate for the increases in dead space ventilation and the propensity for alveolar collapse that accompany low volume mechanical ventilation.
 The use of postoperative regional analgesic techniques to alleviate respiratory compromise constitutes both current clinical practice and an area of active, ongoing investigation.
 Gone are the days when the anesthesiologist's responsibility stopped at the recovery room door.
 Today, anesthesiologists with expertise in postoperative pain management, cardiovascular physiology, and intensive ventilatory care are able to provide patients an improved likelihood of avoiding postoperative respiratory complications.
