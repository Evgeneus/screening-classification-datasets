A case of acquired factor X deficiency with in vivo and in vitro evidence of inhibitor activity directed against factor X.
 A 67-year-old woman had symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection for which she received a five-day course of erythromycin.
 Epistaxis and gross hematuria subsequently developed, and the patient was found to have a selective Factor X deficiency.
 She received supportive therapy and prothrombin complex concentrates (Factors II, VII, IX, and X), with subsequent resolution of her transient Factor X deficiency.
 Her hospital course, however, was complicated by the development of multiple cerebral infarctions.
 This is the tenth reported case of transient Factor X deficiency not associated with amyloidosis.
 In seven of the previous cases, as in this patient, the deficiency was associated with a preceding upper respiratory infection.
 This is the only case, however, with evidence of inhibitory activity in the plasma that was directed toward Factor X.
