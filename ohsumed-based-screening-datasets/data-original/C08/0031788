Electrothrombosis of saccular aneurysms via endovascular approach. Part 2: Preliminary clinical experience.
 Fifteen patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms were treated using electrolytically detachable coils introduced via an endovascular approach.
 The patients ranged in age from 21 to 69 years.
 The most frequent clinical presentation was subarachnoid hemorrhage (eight cases).
 Considerable thrombosis of the aneurysm (70% to 100%) was achieved in all 15 patients, and preservation of the parent artery was obtained in 14.
 Although temporary neurological deterioration due to the technique was recorded in one patient, no permanent neurological deficit was observed in this series and there were no deaths.
 It is believed that this new technology is a viable alternative in the management of patients with high-risk intracranial saccular aneurysms.
 It may also play an important role in the occlusion of aneurysms in the acute phase of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
