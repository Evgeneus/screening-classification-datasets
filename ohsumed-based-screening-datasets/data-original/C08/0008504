Bronchoalveolar lavage via a modified stomach tube in intubated patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and diffuse pneumonia.
 A simple non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage method was used in 30 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome undergoing assisted ventilation for respiratory failure.
 A modified Argyle Levin stomach tube was passed via the endotracheal tube and lavage performed.
 The lavage was well tolerated and performed quickly and easily, required little training, and had a high degree of sensitivity (73%--a diagnosis in 22 of the 30 cases).
