Ascites and pleural effusions associated with endometriosis.
 We report a case of ascites and bilateral pleural effusions associated with an endometrioma in a 26-year-old woman of Chinese descent.
 She had a right salpingo-oophorectomy and partial omentectomy performed, and she received leuprolide acetate depot injections after the operation.
 We believe this is the first description of use of a GnRH agonist to treat this rare condition.
