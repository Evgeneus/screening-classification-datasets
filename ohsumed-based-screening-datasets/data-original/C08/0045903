High antigen reactivity in mononuclear cells from sites of chronic inflammation.
 Antigen-specific in-vitro responses of mononuclear cells from synovial fluid and peripheral blood of patients with rheumatoid arthritis were compared with those of mononuclear cells from pleural exudate and peripheral blood of non-rheumatoid-arthritis patients with chronic pleuritis not caused by tuberculosis.
 The antigens tested were an acetone-precipitable fraction of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (AP-Mt), an Escherichia coli lysate containing the 65 kD heat-shock protein of M bovis BCG (65 kD/E coli), the M bovis heat-shock protein alone (65 kD), and E coli alone.
 The mean proliferative responses to AP-Mt were higher in synovial-fluid than in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in rheumatoid arthritis patients (mean [SEM] stimulation index 10.5 [3.1] vs 2.6 [0.9]) and in pleural-exudate than in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells in the pleuritic patients (7.5 [1.7] vs 3.5 [2.0]).
 The same pattern was seen for the other three antigens.
 Only 1 of 26 synovial-fluid mononuclear cell samples from rheumatoid arthritis patients showed a positive response (stimulation index 3 or more) to 65 kD compared with 5 of 22 pleural-exudate mononuclear cell samples, so 65 kD seems not to be the major antigen recognised by synovial-fluid T cells in rheumatoid arthritis.
 Enhanced reactivity against mycobacterial and other bacterial antigens is not restricted to mononuclear cells from chronically inflamed joints but seems to be a common feature of chronic inflammation.
