Protein concentrations have little effect on reabsorption of fluid from isolated rat lungs.
 A study was conducted to determine whether differences in the concentrations of large molecules between the air space and perfusate solutions altered the rates at which fluid was reabsorbed from isolated fluid-filled perfused rat lungs.
 Four groups of experiments were conducted: 1) 5 g/dl albumin in the air spaces and perfusate, 2) 15 g/dl albumin in the air space and 5 g/dl albumin in the perfusate, 3) 5 g/dl albumin in the air space and 15 g/dl albumin in the perfusate, and 4) a mixture of 5 g/dl albumin and 7 g/dl Dextran 70 in the air spaces and 5 g/dl albumin in the perfusate.
 Fluid reabsorption was determined by following the concentration of albumin labeled with Evans blue (T-1824) in the air space and perfusate compartments.
 Because leakage of protein between the air space and perfusate compartments is very slow, increases in T-1824 concentrations in the air spaces indicated loss of fluid from this compartment, whereas decreases in these concentrations in the perfusate compartment provided evidence of fluid transport into the vasculature.
 Approximately 30% of the air space fluid was reabsorbed in a 2-h period, and virtually all of this fluid reached the perfusate compartment.
 Despite oncotic differences that ranged from -65 to 65 Torr, variations in air space or perfusate albumin concentrations did not have a significant effect on this process.
 A 30% decrease in fluid reabsorption was observed when dextran was in the air space solution, but this decrease did not appear to be due to the oncotic properties of this solution because albumin did not have a measurable effect on reabsorption.
