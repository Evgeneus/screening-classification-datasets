Bronchopulmonary involvement in ulcerative colitis.
 We report two cases of pulmonary involvement in ulcerative colitis.
 The first patient, a 37-year-old woman, had bilateral basal bronchiectasis full of mucopurulent secretion, with a marked improvement of pulmonary function and roentgenographic appearance after a conservative approach.
 The second patient had severe pulmonary fibrosis of autoimmune nature and died owing to a pulmonary infection.
 In the second patient, a sulfasalazine reaction as an etiologic factor was excluded, while in the first this possibility seemed unlikely.
 Therefore, we take these two cases as examples of the extraintestinal manifestations of ulcerative colitis.
