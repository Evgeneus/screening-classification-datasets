Cause of death in unsuccessful prehospital resuscitation.
 During 1987-1988, prehospital resuscitation was unsuccessful in 204 of 381 patients who suffered a witnessed cardiac arrest due to presumed coronary heart disease in Helsinki.
 The cause of death was verified by autopsy in 80 (39%) of the 204 patients.
 Their cause of death could not be estimated on the basis of previous patient history, and their autopsy diagnoses were then related to the initial cardiac rhythm recorded at the scene.
 At autopsy, coronary heart disease was considered to have been the cause of death in 78% of the patients with ventricular fibrillation, in 43% of the patients with electromechanical dissociation (EMD), and in 60% of the patients in asystole.
 Cardiac tamponade or massive pulmonary embolism was the cause of death in 15 of the 28 patients with EMD who underwent autopsy.
 These findings support previously noted relationships between some causes of cardiac arrest and the initial cardiac rhythm, and also in prehospital cardiac arrest patients with unsuccessful resuscitation.
