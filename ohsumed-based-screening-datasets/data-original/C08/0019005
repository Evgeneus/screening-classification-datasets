Reconstruction of pediatric larynx and upper trachea with the sternohyoid rotary door flap.
 The sternohyoid myocutaneous flap, the rotary door flap, is optimally oriented to serve in laryngotracheal reconstruction.
 It provides immediate, highly vascularized lining and structural support to the augmented airway.
 Therefore, it is one of the most versatile alternative methods available for surgical reconstruction of the stenosed larynx and trachea.
 Thirteen of 14 patients who were managed by the rotary door flap technique have been successfully decannulated.
 The features of the flap and the surgical technique are described with reference to modifications in the pediatric age group.
