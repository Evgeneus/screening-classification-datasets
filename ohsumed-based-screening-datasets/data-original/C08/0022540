COPD: management and rehabilitation.
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases include emphysema, chronic bronchitis and asthma.
 Patients with mild disease may remain asymptomatic for many years.
 In patients with a sedentary lifestyle, 60 percent of lung function may be lost before shortness of breath occurs during daily activity.
 Spirometry may detect mild to moderate airflow obstruction in asymptomatic patients.
 Goals of therapy include reduction of airflow obstruction, prevention or treatment of complications, and improvement in quality of life.
