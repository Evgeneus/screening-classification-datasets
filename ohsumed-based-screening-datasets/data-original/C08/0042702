Perialveolar interstitial resistance and compliance in isolated rat lung.
 We have developed a method to characterize fluid transport through the perialveolar interstitium using micropuncture techniques.
 In 10 experiments we established isolated perfused rat lung preparations.
 The lungs were initially isogravimetric at 10 cmH2O arterial pressure, 2 cmH2O venous pressure, and 5 cmH2O alveolar pressure.
 Perialveolar interstitial pressure was determined by micropuncture at alveolar junctions by use of the servo-null technique.
 Simultaneously a second micropipette was placed in an alveolar junction 20-40 microns away, and a bolus of albumin solution (3.5 g/100 ml) was injected.
 The resulting pressure transient was recorded for injection durations of 1 and 4 s in nonedematous lungs.
 The measurements were repeated after gross edema formation induced by elevated perfusion pressure.
 We model the interstitium as a homogeneous linearly poroelastic material and assume the initial pressure distribution due to the injection to be Gaussian.
 The pressure decay is inversely proportional to time, with time constant T, where T is a measure of the ratio of interstitial tissue stiffness to interstitial resistance to fluid flow.
 A linear regression was performed on the reciprocal of the pressure for the decaying portion of the transients to determine T.
 Comparing pressure transients in nonedematous and edematous lungs, we found that T was 4.0 +/- 1.4 and 1.4 +/- 0.6 s, respectively.
 We have shown that fluid transport through the pulmonary interstitium on a local level is sensitive to changes in interstitial stiffness and resistance.
 These results are consistent with the decreased stiffness and resistance in the perialveolar interstitium that accompany increased hydration.
