The potassium--titanyl phosphate laser for treatment of turbinate dysfunction.
 Patients with nasal turbinate dysfunction most often are seen by the physician with such symptoms as watery nasal secretions, nasal obstruction, congestion, facial pressure, or pain.
 There will often have been multiple attempts to manage the problem medically and symptomatically with antihistamines, decongestants, antibiotics, nasal cromolyn, and topical or systemic steroid therapy.
 Some patients will have undergone numerous attempts at surgical therapy, most often with cryosurgery or cauterization.
 The cause of the symptoms of turbinate dysfunction for most of these patients is either vasomotor rhinitis, allergic rhinitis, or polypoid hypertrophic turbinates.
 A visible-wavelength laser with a wavelength of 532 nm, the potassium-titanyl phosphate laser has been used with nasal endoscopes to perform laser photocoagulation of the nasal turbinates.
 A description of the technique and early results have been previously reported.
 This article reports good long-term results with the technique.
