Adrenal atrophy at autopsy in two asthmatic children.
 In two children dying in status asthmaticus, adrenocortical atrophy was demonstrable at autopsy.
 Both children had been treated since infancy with pulsed steroidal inhalers, short courses of oral or parenteral steroids, and steroidal skin preparations (for associated eczema).
 Adrenocortical atrophy has not been described previously in this clinical context.
 The increasing administration of steroids to asthmatic children may lead to the production of overt--or more frequently, subclinical--atrophy of the adrenal cortices with important consequences to mortality and morbidity.
