Pneumothorax complicating small-bore feeding tube placement.
 Small-bore Silastic feeding tubes are being used with increasing frequency for short- and long-term enteral hyperalimentation.
 We present three cases where these flexible tubes were passed into the tracheobronchial tree and then out into the pleural space.
 The result in each case was a pneumothorax or hydropneumothorax.
 These cases were collected at one community hospital over a 6-month period.
 A review of the current literature reveals reports of 10 similar cases.
 We conclude that, although the exact incidence of pleural complications of small-bore feeding tubes is unknown, it is not insignificant.
 The traditional methods of assessing proper nasogastric tube placement are inadequate when applied to these small tubes.
 Only a chest roentgenogram can assure placement in the stomach.
 Education of hospital staff on methods to avoid malposition of feeding tubes has resulted in an absence of pulmonary complications over a subsequent 1-year period.
