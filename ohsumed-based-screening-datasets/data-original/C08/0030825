Rare presentation of a parapharyngeal schwannoma.
 Schwannoma, or neurilemmoma, is included in the differential diagnosis of masses in the parapharyngeal space.
 Schwannomata do not usually cause acute inflammation, and therefore do not tend to present as emergencies as in this case, in which there was acute respiratory embarrassment.
