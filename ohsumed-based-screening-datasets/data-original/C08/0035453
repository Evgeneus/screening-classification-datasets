Establishment of cell-to-cell contact by adoptively transferred adherent lymphokine-activated killer cells with metastatic murine melanoma cells.
 A murine model of pulmonary B16 melanoma was used to study the infiltration into metastases of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells and adherent lymphokine-activated killer (A-LAK) cells and, specifically, to study whether A-LAK cells are able to leave the tumor microcirculation and establish cell-to-cell contact with malignant cells.
 Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that A-LAK cells accumulated in metastases twice as efficiently as LAK cells during interleukin-2 stimulation.
 Electron microscopy of pulmonary metastases 16 hours after administration of 2.5 x 10(7) A-LAK cells revealed A-LAK cells, identified by the presence of typical two-compartment granules, in direct contact with melanoma cells.
 This finding was confirmed by using A-LAK cells prelabeled with polycationized ferritin.
 In conclusion, our observations demonstrate unambiguously the ability of adoptively transferred A-LAK cells to establish contact with extravascular metastatic melanoma cells.
