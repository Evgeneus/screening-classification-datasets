Intratracheal surfactant administration restores gas exchange in experimental adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with viral pneumonia.
 The effect of intratracheal surfactant administration was studied in rats with adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with infection with nebulized Sendai virus.
 Thirty-six hours after infection, animals (n = 7) showed severely impaired gas exchange and acidosis during artificial ventilation (PaO2 = 152.2 +/- 18.7, PaCO2 = 65.3 +/- 19.2, pH = 7.26 +/- 0.11) with a pressure-controlled mode, standard frequency of 35/min, peak airway pressure of 15 cm H2O (15/0), inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:2, and F1O2 = 1.
 Gas exchange improved (P = 0.02) with increased ventilator pressures with PEEP (25/4).
 Forty-eight hours after infection, blood gas tensions could no longer be significantly improved by these same ventilator settings (PaO2 = 123.8 +/- 31.0, PaCO2 = 95.1 +/- 43.6, pH = 7.12 +/- 0.16, n = 9).
 At this time, surfactant replacement dramatically increased arterial oxygenation within 5 min (PaO2 = 389.4 +/- 79.9) and resulted in a fourfold increase in PaO2 within 2 h.
 It is concluded that intratracheal surfactant administration is a promising approach in the treatment of respiratory failure during adult respiratory distress syndrome associated with viral pneumonia.
