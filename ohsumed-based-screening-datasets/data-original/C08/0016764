Thromboxane synthetase inhibition decreases polymorphonuclear leukocyte activation following hindlimb ischemia.
 Ischemia of the lower extremity has been shown to cause pulmonary leukostasis and increased pulmonary artery pressure.
 Thromboxane (TX) has been implicated as a mediator in this process.
 The effect of OKY-046, a TX synthetase inhibitor, on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) production of superoxide anion (O2-) as determined by ferricytochrome reduction was examined.
 Fourteen dogs were subjected to 6 hours of bilateral gracilis muscle ischemia followed by 1 hour of reperfusion.
 O2- production from resting PMNs and PMNs stimulated with opsonized zymosan (OZ, 0.1 mg/ml) was measured prior to ischemia or drug treatment (baseline), and following reperfusion in both treated (n = 7) and control groups (n = 7).
 Serum TX levels were measured using a radioimmunoassay.
 Following reperfusion, TX levels in the treated group were decreased as compared with the control group (18 +/- 2 pg/ml vs.
 72 +/- 26 pg/ml, P less than 0.05).
 Superoxide production by both resting and stimulated PMNs was also decreased in the treated group; from 0.98 +/- 0.16 nmol to 0.43 +/- 0.12 nmol O2- in the resting state (P less than 0.05) and from 13.3 +/- 1.5 nmol to 9.0 +/- 1.1 nmol O2- after stimulation (P less than 0.005).
 O2- production was increased in the control group following reperfusion as compared with baseline samples, and this increase was attenuated by treatment with OKY-046.
