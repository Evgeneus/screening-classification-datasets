Nasal reconstruction with articulated irradiated rib cartilage.
 Nasal structural reconstruction is a formidable task in cases where there is loss of support to both the nasal dorsum and tip.
 A multitude of surgical approaches and materials have been used for the correction of the saddle-nose deformity with varying degrees of success.
 Articulated irradiated rib cartilage inserted through an external rhinoplasty approach was used to reconstruct nasal deformities in 18 patients over a 6-year period.
 Simultaneous use of a midline forehead flap to reconstruct the overlying soft tissue was required in four cases.
 Follow-up ranged from 1 to 6 years (mean, 2.8 years).
 Results were rewarding in most cases with marked improvement in nasal support and airway.
 Revision and/or replacement secondary to trauma or warping of the graft was required in four cases.
 None of the patients exhibited infection, extrusion, or noticeable resorption.
 A description of the surgical technique, review of all the cases, and recommendation for continued use of this graft material are discussed.
