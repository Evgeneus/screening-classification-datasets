Effect of low-molecular-weight heparin on recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-induced thrombolysis in canine pulmonary embolism.
 We employed a canine model of pulmonary embolism induced by radioactive blood clots to determine if low-molecular-weight heparin augments recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA)-induced thrombolysis.
 Following embolization, dogs were randomized: group 1 dogs received heparin; group 2 dogs received low-molecular-weight heparin; group 3 dogs received 1.5 mg/kg of rtPA over 45 minutes; group 4 dogs received rtPA 3 mg/kg over 45 minutes; and group 5 dogs received 1.5 mg/kg of rtPA plus low-molecular-weight heparin.
 Over three hours, little thrombolysis occurred in groups 1 and 2.
 In contrast, significant thrombolysis occurred in groups 3 to 5, 46 percent, 49 percent, and 46 percent, respectively (all p less than 0.01 compared with groups 1 and 2).
 We conclude that there is an upper limit to the dose-thrombolytic rate relationship with rtPA, and that low-molecular-weight heparin does not augment rtPA-induced thrombolysis.
