Soft tissue sarcoma of the pleural cavity.
 Seventeen cases of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) developing in the pleural cavity were collected from Japanese hospitals, and their clinical and pathologic findings summarized.
 Eight of the 17 patients had a 15-year to 50-year (mean, 28.8) history of chronic pleural inflammatory disease (pleuritis, pyothorax, and pulmonary tuberculosis) before the onset of the pleural sarcoma.
 Histologically, malignant fibrous histiocytoma was the most common tumor type (11 cases), followed by angiosarcoma (four).
 The age at diagnosis of the sarcoma ranged from 15 to 74 years (mean, 58); the male-to-female ratio was 3.3:1.
 In the eight cases of sarcoma associated with chronic pleural inflammatory disease, male preponderance was more marked (7:1).
 The commonest presenting symptom was chest pain.
 A mass could be detected by chest roentgenograms in 13 patients and computed tomographic scans in 15 patients.
 No patient had distant metastases at first admission.
 Thirteen patients were treated by surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy.
 Thirteen of the 17 patients died 1 to 87 months (mean, 14.2) after therapy for STS.
 The actuarial 1-year survival rate was 38.5%.
 These findings suggest that long-standing pleural inflammation might be an etiologic factor for development of pleural STS.
