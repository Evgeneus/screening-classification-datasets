Colic medication and apparent life-threatening events.
 Eight infants with histories of apnea and cyanosis were referred to the Southwest SIDS Research Institute for evaluation of apparent life threatening events (ALTE).
 All of the infants had been treated for colic with a 1:1 concentration of dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) and phenobarbital, hyoscyamine sulfate, atropine sulfate and scopolamine hydrobromide (Donnatal).
 The medication was pre-mixed by local pharmacists.
 A comprehensive work-up failed to reveal a cause for the ALTE in any infant.
 The Dramamine/Donnatal mixture was withdrawn and polygraphic evaluation was conducted.
 Cardiorespiratory abnormalities were identified in all eight infants and significant gastroesophageal reflux (GER) was documented in four.
 The possibility that colic medication contributes to cardiorespiratory instability and GER in vulnerable infants requires serious consideration and further evaluation.
