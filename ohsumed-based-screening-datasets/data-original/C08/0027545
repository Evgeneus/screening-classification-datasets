Dissectors for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.
 Even with circulatory arrest during pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, continued back-bleeding obscures the operative field.
 This necessitates frequent interruptions of dissection to allow aspiration with a second instrument.
 Therefore, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy dissectors are described that allow simultaneous suction of blood from the operative field.
 Before the use of these dissectors, circulatory arrest time was 59 +/- 23 minutes in 124 consecutive patients.
 In the last 10 consecutive patients using these dissectors, the mean circulatory arrest time has been 52 +/- 22 minutes (p = not significant).
 It is anticipated that with a larger database, the ability to aspirate blood simultaneously during the dissecting process will result in a significant shortening of circulatory arrest time.
