Cystic fibrosis: scoring system with thin-section CT.
 The progression of lung disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) was evaluated with chest radiography.
 The severity and extent of the various radiographic changes were scored with the Chrispin or the Birmingham method, which involves the use of imprecise and subjective terms, such as line shadows, large pulmonary shadows, and nodular cystic lesions.
 Although computed tomography (CT) has been shown to be helpful in the evaluation of lung disease in CF, no scoring system or other objective criteria have been developed for the evaluation of the wide range of pulmonary changes in these patients.
 A CT scoring system was devised that incorporates all of the changes seen in the lungs of patients with CF.
 Such a scoring system may facilitate objective evaluation of existing and newly developed therapeutic regimens and may be a valuable tool in the preoperative evaluation of patients being considered for lobectomy or bullectomy and in the selection of patients for lung transplantation.
