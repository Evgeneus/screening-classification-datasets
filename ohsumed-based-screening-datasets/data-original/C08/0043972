Simultaneous exposure of sheep to endotoxin and 100% oxygen.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of endotoxin on the development of vascular and airway dysfunction during O2 toxicity.
 Sheep were prepared for chronic measurement of vascular pressures, cardiac output, gas exchange, and collection of lung lymph.
 Tracheostomies were made for accurate delivery of gas mixtures.
 Sheep were placed in one of three experimental groups: those receiving endotoxin (n = 9), those breathing 100% O2 and receiving endotoxin (n = 7), and those exposed to 100% O2 alone (n = 6).
 Sheep had daily measurements of hypoxic vasoconstriction (FIO2 = 0.12), gas exchange, circulating white blood cell counts, lymph flow, and lymph and plasma protein concentrations.
 Lung neutrophils were counted, and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase and manganous superoxide dismutase were measured in lung samples from some sheep biopsies taken at baseline surgery and postmortem.
 Endotoxin markedly prolonged survival time and partially protected against the increased lung vascular permeability in sheep breathing 100% oxygen, but impairment of gas exchange, loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and ultimate progression of respiratory failure were not prevented.
 Induction of MnSOD occurred in sheep breathing 100% O2, in sheep receiving endotoxin alone, and in those exposed to 100% O2 plus endotoxin.
 We conclude that endotoxin markedly increases tolerance to O2 toxicity but that some of the pathophysiology of O2 toxicity is unaltered.
 The role of superoxide dismutase in the observed protection is unclear.
