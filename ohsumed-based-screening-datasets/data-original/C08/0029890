The effect of prostaglandin E1 on acute pulmonary artery hypertension during oleic acid-induced respiratory dysfunction.
 This study examined the general effect of intravenous PGE1 on RV Ees and effective PA elastance (EA) during acute pulmonary hypertension associated with oleic acid infusion.
 In eight pigs, RV end-systolic elastance was quantified with the Ees and Ea was defined with reference to the Windkessel model.
 Oleic acid infusion increased mean PAP and Ea.
 Prostaglandin E1 reduced PAP and decreased Ea.
 Ees did not change throughout the study.
 Mean arterial pressure was reduced and the pulmonary shunt was increased after PGE1 infusion.
 The PaO2 was reduced.
 Data from this study suggest that although PGE1 is effective in reducing PAP, it is not as effective in reducing RV afterload.
 Furthermore, PGE1 does have significant side effects such as reduction of systemic arterial pressure and an increase in pulmonary shunt.
