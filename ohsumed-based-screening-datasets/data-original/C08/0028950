Effect of slowly increasing elastic load on breathing in conscious humans.
 Because the detection of added loads is a function of the step change in load relative to background level of load (Weber's law), we reasoned that detection may be delayed if the load is increased in very small steps over a protracted period.
 This would permit the study of subliminal load responses over a greater range than would otherwise be possible.
 In 13 healthy males, an external elastic load (delta E) was added in very small steps (load increased every few seconds) such that delta E increased from zero to 6.0 cmH2O/l in 18 min.
 Each subject underwent a control study in which an identical protocol was followed but no load was added.
 Five subjects sensed the load after a variable period of load application.
 Their results were discarded.
 In the remaining eight subjects, there was no perception of increased load throughout the 18 min.
 By comparison with the control studies in the same subjects, there was a progressive reduction in tidal volume and breath duration with loading.
 To assess the response to an increase in load associated with perception, in five of the eight "nonsensers" the load was suddenly doubled (delta E = 6 cmH2O/l) at the end of the 18 min of progressive nonsensed loading.
 This evoked perception in all subjects and was associated with highly variable responses in tidal volume and breath duration.
 We conclude that tachypnea associated with elastic loading in conscious humans is a reflex response that is facilitated by consciousness but does not require perception.
