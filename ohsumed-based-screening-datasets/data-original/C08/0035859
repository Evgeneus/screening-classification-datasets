Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation.
 Five patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation are reported.
 Four had severe clinical symptoms, whereas 1 was asymptomatic.
 Mechanical ventilatory support was necessary in 1 because of respiratory distress.
 Pneumocystis carinii infection developed in 4 patients within the first 4 postoperative months, and 1 patient had clinical disease 1 year after transplantation with a recurrence 9 months later.
 All were treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole either orally or intravenously (10 to 20 mg.kg-1.day-1 of trimethoprim).
 All patients recovered from infection and received the same drug prophylactically for 2 to 20 months after the infection.
 All patients are doing well after Pneumocystis carinii infection except 1 who died after an acute myocardial infarction 4 years after infection.
 We conclude that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is an effective agent for the treatment of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia after heart transplantation.
