Paraquat induced pulmonary fibrosis in three survivors.
 Pulmonary lesions following paraquat poisoning are believed to be almost invariably fatal.
 The three patients reports here survived despite persistent radiological change.
 One of the patients died after taking a larger dose of paraquat one year later, and at necropsy histological changes attributable to the two episodes of paraquat poisoning were apparent.
