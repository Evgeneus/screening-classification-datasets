Pulmonary embolism presenting as exercise-induced hypotension.
 A 68-year-old man with remote history of previous myocardial infarction presented with a four-week history of intermittent dyspnea.
 After developing hypotension during an exercise tolerance test, he underwent cardiac catheterization, revealing significant pulmonary hypertension and two-vessel coronary artery disease.
 Pulmonary angiography confirmed the presence of pulmonary emboli which partially resolved after thrombolytic therapy.
 Subsequent treadmill testing confirmed the absence of exercise-induced hypotension two months following treatment.
 This case underscores the importance of considering pulmonary embolism as a potential cause of exercise-induced hypotension, since it can be successfully treated with thrombolytic agents weeks after the initial onset of symptoms.
