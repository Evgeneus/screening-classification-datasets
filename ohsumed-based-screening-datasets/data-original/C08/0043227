Check-valve mechanism as a cause of bilateral spontaneous pneumothorax complicating bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma.
 We present a rare case of simultaneous bilateral pneumothorax complicating bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma.
 Autopsy revealed that numerous subpleural alveolar spaces were distended and most of the small airways were narrowed by cancer cells.
 We conclude that a check-valve mechanism may be responsible for pneumothorax in patients with bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma.
