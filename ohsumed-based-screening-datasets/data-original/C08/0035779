Murine models of cytomegalovirus-associated pneumonitis.
 Data derived from the murine models described in this report now serve as the cornerstone for our understanding of at least some of the mechanisms by which MCMV in combination with other cofactors can trigger the series of events that result in the development of interstitial pneumonia in the MCMV-infected mouse.
 What is clear from the studies completed to date is that MCMV by itself is not particularly pathogenic when it replicates in the lung, but in the presence of a perturbation in the immune system of the host, can produce serious pulmonary disease.
 It is hoped that the knowledge gained from these studies in mice will someday be shown to be relevant to humans.
