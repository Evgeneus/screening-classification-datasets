Pectus excavatum: a 15-year perspective.
 Pectus excavatum is relatively uncommon.
 Our experience with 177 children during a 15-year period produced changes in our surgical technique, which now includes a small transverse incision, minimal subcutaneous flap elevation, a muscle-relaxing incision over the fifth costal cartilage, complete resection of involved cartilage, use of Adkins' strut, suspension of sternum to strut, taut reefing of intercostal muscle, no tubes or drains, epidural analgesia, a patient-controlled analgesia device postoperatively, and eventual strut removal.
 Use of the evolved technique gives excellent cosmetic results, good functional results with minimal discomfort, and a shorter convalescent period.
