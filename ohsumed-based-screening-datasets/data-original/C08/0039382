A method for the treatment of abductor spasmodic dysphonia with botulinum toxin injections: a preliminary report.
 A preliminary technical report of the effective treatment of abductor spasmodic dysphonia with botulinum toxin is presented.
 Our technique attempts to place the toxin close to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle to allow diffusion of the material to the PCA.
 Our pilot study demonstrates that botulinum toxin is an effective approach for reducing or eliminating the abductor glottal spasms during phonation and, thereby, providing functional speech communication.
