Diagnostic, morphologic, and histopathologic correlates in bronchogenic carcinoma. A review of 1,045 bronchoscopic examinations.
 Information on the correlation between bronchoscopically visible aspects, histopathologic classification, and diagnostic yield is very scarce.
 To contribute to the knowledge of the subject, we reviewed the bronchoscopic charts of 1,045 patients with lung cancer who were seen in the years from 1983 to 1989 at the Bronchology Service of the A.
 Carle Hospital.
 Tumors were more often located centrally and superiorly.
 No preference as to side was found.
 Squamous carcinomas were, by far, the most frequent cell type.
 Forceps biopsies, brushings, and washings were positive in 79 percent, 38 percent, and 32 percent of the obtained specimens, respectively.
 Bronchoscopically, squamous and small-cell carcinomas were more often visualized as central tumor-like lesions, which were better diagnosed by forceps biopsies.
 Adenocarcinomas, on the contrary, were more frequently peripheral and showed infiltrative, compressive, or aspecific findings.
 In these latter tumors, cytologic studies were more fruitful.
 Large-cell anaplastic carcinomas had an intermediate behavior.
 Cell type, endoscopic appearance, and diagnostic success are interrelated features.
 Visible characteristics at bronchoscopy can therefore anticipate the more likely histotype and guide the diagnostic approach.
