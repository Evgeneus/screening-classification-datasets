Mechanical obstruction to ventilation from an ovarian cyst during pregnancy.
 This report documents the danger of the gravid uterus fixing a large ovarian cyst in a position disadvantageous to diaphragmatic excursion and thereby obstructing ventilation.
 A 34-year-old pregnant patient presented at 18 weeks amenorrhoea with a large ovarian cyst.
 She gave a history of exertional dyspnoea and orthopnoea.
 Clinical examination revealed a grossly enlarged abdomen and a respiratory rate of 28 breaths.min-1.
 Intraoperatively, ventilation was markedly impaired resulting in cyanosis and bradycardia.
 This was relieved by drainage of the ovarian cyst.
 A left lateral tilt with manual traction on the tumour may have avoided this problem.
 Should the above measures be inadequate, immediate drainage of the cyst is essential.
 Severe respiratory distress may require ultrasound-guided, percutaneous, aspiration of the cyst preoperatively.
 However, as in this patient, the absence of gross signs of respiratory failure does not preclude acute ventilatory failure after induction of anaesthesia.
