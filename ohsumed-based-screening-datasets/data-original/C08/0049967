Cyclooxygenase pathway mediates lung injury induced by phorbol and platelets.
 The role of platelets in lung injury has not been well defined.
 In the present study of isolated perfused rat lungs, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 0.15 microgram/ml) or platelets (6.7 X 10(4)/ml) alone did not discernibly change the pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) or lung weight (LW).
 However, the combination of platelets and PMA drastically increased the PAP and LW (delta PAP 26.2 +/- 1.0 mmHg, delta LW 2.7 +/- 0.4 g).
 delta PAP was positively correlated with the increase in thromboxane B2 produced by infusion of platelets and PMA (thromboxane B2 = 35.6 + 0.97 delta PAP, r = 0.67, P less than 0.01).
 The hypertension and edema formation induced by PMA and platelets were strongly attenuated by indomethacin, an inhibitor of platelet cyclooxygenase (delta PAP 5.6 +/- 2.0 mmHg, P less than 0.001; delta LW 0.0 +/- 0.1 g, P less than 0.001), and by imidazole, an inhibitor of thromboxane A2 synthase (PAP 8.0 +/- 2.5 mmHg, P less than 0.001; LW 0.0 +/- 0.3 g, P less than 0.01).
 Inactivation of platelet lipoxygenase with nordihydroguaiaretic acid mildly depressed pulmonary pressure but did not affect delta LW (delta PAP 18.9 +/- 1.6 mmHg, P less than 0.05; delta LW 3.1 +/- 0.3 g, P greater than 0.05).
 In vitro experiments showed that the capacity of platelets to release oxygen radicals was only 2.6% of that found for granulocytes.
 These results suggest that platelets may be activated by PMA to increase PAP and vascular permeability.
