Pulmonary disease in AIDS patients.
 Pulmonary disease remains a major complication of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 Over the past decade several changes in the pattern of disease have occurred.
 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic pathogen in AIDS patients, though its incidence on bronchoscopy has declined and empiric therapy often occurs without a specific diagnosis.
 Changes in the management of patients with PCP have included different dosages and routes of administration for chemotherapy, improved overall survival, and a recent increase in the number of patients surviving episodes of respiratory failure.
 In addition, infection with mycobacteria tuberculosis (M.Tb.) has emerged as a major public health problem.
 The pattern of M.Tb.
 is distinct from non-immunocompromised patients though response to therapy usually occurs.
