Morphologic changes in lungs of anesthetized sheep following intravenous infusion of recombinant tumor necrosis factor alpha.
 Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is a monokine released in response to endotoxin and has been suggested as a primary mediator of endotoxic shock.
 We have recently demonstrated that infusion of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha (rTNF alpha) into sheep elicits a physiologic response in the lung that closely resembles endotoxemia.
 The present study examines the morphologic changes that accompany these alterations in pulmonary physiology.
 Five anesthetized, open-chest sheep received 0.01 mg/kg of protein (2.24 x 10(7) U rTNF alpha/mg) intravenously over 30 min.
 Lung biopsy tissue for light and electron microscopy was obtained from random lobes 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 min after beginning the infusion.
 Pulmonary (Ppa) and systemic arterial pressures, cardiac output, and peripheral blood leukocyte number and differential counts were monitored throughout the study.
 Three control animals were treated in a similar manner but received either saline (n = 1) or rTNF alpha denatured by boiling for 30 min (n = 2).
 rTNF alpha caused an early increase in Ppa and peripheral blood leukopenia.
 Light microscopy revealed a threefold increase in the number of granulocytes per 100 alveolar profiles by 30 min and a fivefold increase by 2 h.
 From 60 min, increased alveolar wall thickness, red cell congestion, and peribronchovascular edema were apparent; from 2 h, there was increased cellularity of the alveolar walls and mononuclear cell infiltration of perivascular connective tissue.
 Electron microscopy revealed damage to alveolar Type I and II pneumonocytes and progressive endothelial injury from 30 min.
