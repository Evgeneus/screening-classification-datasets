Pleuropulmonary complications of endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy.
 The most common pulmonary complication of EVS is pleural effusion.
 The most clinically significant pulmonary complication of EVS is delayed perforation with formation of esophagopleural or esophagobronchial fistula.
 Pneumonia, empyema, pulmonary infarction, and atelectasis can also occur.
 Endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy probably does not cause ARDS, but that issue remains unsettled.
 Transient relative pulmonary hypertension during EVS is probably of no clinical significance, but caution is urged when sclerosing varices in a patient with borderline right heart function.
