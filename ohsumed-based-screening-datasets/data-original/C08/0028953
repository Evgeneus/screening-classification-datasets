Changes of lung surfactant and pressure-volume curve in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis.
 We investigated whether alveolar surface force increased and participated in the lung pressure-volume relationship in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in hamsters and, if so, whether lung surfactant was hampered in the lungs.
 On the air-filled pressure-volume curve, decreases of lung volume from control level were significantly higher at 3-8 cmH2O pressure on day 10 than on day 30.
 Because the change of lung tissue elasticity evaluated from the saline-filled pressure-volume curve was equal for the 2 days, the higher decrease of air volume on day 10 was due primarily to contribution of alveolar surface force.
 Pressure differences between deflation limbs of air-filled and saline-filled pressure-volume curves, which represented net alveolar surface force, were significantly higher at any lung volume between 50 and 90% total lung capacity on day 10, but almost no significance was observed on day 30.
 Phospholipid concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid significantly decreased on day 10 but had improved by day 30.
 Analysis of phospholipid species in purified lung surfactant showed decreased fractions of disaturated phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol on day 10.
 Surface-active properties of the surfactant, measured by a modified Wilhelmy balance, were remarkably hampered on day 10, but most of them had improved by day 30.
 We consider that the quantitative and functional abnormalities of lung surfactant have a part in the aggravation of lung mechanics in the acute phase of pulmonary fibrosis.
