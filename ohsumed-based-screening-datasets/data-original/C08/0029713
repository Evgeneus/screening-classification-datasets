A coaxial technique for facilitating one-lung ventilation.
 A tube for bronchial intubation is described.
 A long (48 cm), small bore (5.0 mm internal diameter), cuffed, bronchial plastic tube is inserted coaxially within a large bore tracheal tube (10.0 mm) used for ventilation.
 The inner tube is designed primarily as a blocker to be inserted with a fibreoptic or optical bronchoscope, but can be effected blindly with a stylet.
 Several methods of inserting the inner tube and ensuring correct placement were used in 10 males undergoing thoracic surgery.
 If the bronchial cuff is inflated the tube can be used either as a blocker or as a conduit for suction and conventional and differential ventilatory techniques.
 Early clinical experience suggests that the technique is an alternative method of facilitating one-lung ventilation.
