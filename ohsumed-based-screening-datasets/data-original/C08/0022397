The importance of acquired diffuse bronchomalacia in heart-lung transplant recipients with obliterative bronchiolitis.
 The results of heart-lung transplantation are improving with increasing experience in postoperative management, but obliterative bronchiolitis may still develop late postoperatively.
 We have performed 19 heart-lung transplants, with 1-month, 1-year, and 2-year actuarial survival rates of 95% +/- 5%, 84% +/- 8%, and 69% +/- 16%, respectively.
 Three early recipients died of bronchiolitis, and four patients who were operated on more than 2 years ago are currently being followed up with bronchiolitis.
 Since August 1988, 13 surviving recipients have undergone serial postoperative bronchoscopies and transbronchial biopsies with topical analgesia.
 Diffuse bronchomalacia, involving the main bronchi down to the fifth-order bronchi bilaterally, has developed in four patients with bronchiolitis 9 +/- 2 months after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis was confirmed.
 Pulmonary function tests have revealed a lower ratio of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to forced vital capacity, lower specific airway conductance, and higher airway resistance in heart-lung recipients with bronchomalacia than in patients with bronchiolitis alone.
 We conclude that diffuse bronchomalacia occurs frequently in heart-lung transplant recipients who have obliterative bronchiolitis.
 Bronchomalacia worsens the functional airflow obstruction caused by bronchiolitis and may play an important role clinically in the declining respiratory status of heart-lung transplant recipients.
