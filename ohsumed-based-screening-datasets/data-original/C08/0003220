Critical volume for pulmonary acid aspiration: reappraisal in a primate model.
 We have studied, in the monkey, the critical volume for the production of severe pneumonitis following pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents.
 Aspiration of 0.4 ml kg-1 and 0.6 ml kg-1 at pH1 produced mild to moderate clinical and radiological changes, but no deaths.
 Aspiration of 0.8 ml kg-1 and 1.0 ml kg-1 at pH1 was associated with an increasingly severe pneumonitis.
 At 1.0 ml kg-1, 50% of the animals died--a mortality rate considerably less than that reported previously in animal studies.
 If these results were to be extrapolated to humans, the critical volume for severe aspiration could be increased from 25 ml to 50 ml (0.8 ml kg-1), considerably reducing the percentage of patients perceived to be "at risk".
