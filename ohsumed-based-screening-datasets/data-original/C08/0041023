Interpretation of maxillary sinus radiographs in children.
 Nasal symptoms are a frequent cause of referral to paediatric ENT clinics.
 It is the policy of our unit to view sinus radiographs without a report at the initial clinic attendance.
 This study demonstrates there is no statistically significant difference in the interpretation of the radiographs between two ENT surgeons and a radiologist although there was a tendency for the radiologist to have a greater specificity.
 This finding may have financial implications.
 In addition a clear sinus radiograph is shown to be a significant negative finding.
