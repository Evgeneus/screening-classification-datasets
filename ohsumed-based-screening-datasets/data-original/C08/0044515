Coughing and central venous catheter dislodgement.
 Silastic central venous catheters are subject to dislodgement from a variety of causes.
 Only one occurrence of catheter dislodgement has been previously reported in connection with coughing.
 We report four additional cases of silastic central venous catheter dislodgement associated with forceful coughing paroxysms, alone or in combination with emesis or rectal tenesmus.
 Three episodes of catheter dislodgement occurred in adolescents or young adults with cystic fibrosis, who may constitute a particularly high-risk group.
 Dislodgement in two patients was asymptomatic.
 These case suggest that patients with frequent or severe paroxysms of increased intrathoracic pressure may be at higher risk of catheter dislodgement.
 Since dislodgement may be initially asymptomatic and can cause serious complications, a high index of suspicion for dislodgement in patients with silastic central venous catheters and coughing paroxysms is advised.
