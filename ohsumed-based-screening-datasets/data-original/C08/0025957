Randomized trial of salbutamol in acute bronchiolitis.
 To test whether nebulized salbutamol (albuterol) is safe and efficacious for the treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis, we enrolled 83 children (median age 6 months, range 1 to 21 months) in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial.
 Participants received two treatments at 30-minute intervals of either nebulized salbutamol (0.10 mg/kg in 2 ml 0.9% saline solution) or a similar volume of 0.9% saline solution placebo.
 Outcome measures were the respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and a clinical score based on the degree of wheezing and retractions.
 Patients in the salbutamol arm had significantly greater improvement in clinical scores after the initial treatment (p = 0.04).
 There was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- 16 vs 151 +/- 16; p = 0.03).
 We conclude that salbutamol is safe and effective for the initial treatment of young children with acute bronchiolitis.
