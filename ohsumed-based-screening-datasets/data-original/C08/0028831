Subglottic laryngeal closure for aspiration.
 Aspiration may be life threatening, particularly in those patients with severe central neurological disease.
 From such a group of patients, several were identified who had severe laryngeal dysfunction and aspiration.
 The majority of patients in this subgroup existed in a neurologically vegetative state.
 In an attempt to reduce the degree of aspiration they experienced, the procedure of subglottic laryngeal closure was performed.
 Essentially, the operation is designed to isolate the tracheal airway from the incompetent larynx.
 The aim is to protect the lower airway from pharyngeal contamination.
 In all 5 patients there was a marked improvement in general and pulmonary health.
