Subglottic cyst in a newborn.
 Subglottic laryngeal cysts in the newborn are extremely rare.
 It is difficult to establish if the cyst is acquired or congenital because respiratory distress requires intubation in the I.C.U.
 generally without prior endoscopy.
 A case report is presented, followed by a discussion of possible aetiology and management protocol; the advantages of the CO2 laser make excision of the cystic sac possible without tracheotomy.
