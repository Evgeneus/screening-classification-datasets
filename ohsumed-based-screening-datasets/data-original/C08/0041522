Oral water intoxication in infants. An American epidemic 
 Between 1975 and 1990, a total of 34 patients with water intoxication were treated at St Louis (Mo) Children's Hospital, 24 of these in the last 3 years, indicating a marked increase in incidence of this previously rare condition.
 Thirty-one were infants living in poverty who ingested excessive amounts of water offered at home by their caretakers.
 Exhaustion of the supply of infant formula was the most common reason given for this substitution.
 Infants were treated by a single infusion of hypertonic saline or a slow infusion of isotonic saline.
 Central pontine myelinolysis was not observed as a complication of hypertonic saline therapy.
 Modification of the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children to provide sufficient formula for the growing infant and better education of mothers as to the hazards of excessive water ingestion might reduce the incidence of this preventable and life-threatening condition.
