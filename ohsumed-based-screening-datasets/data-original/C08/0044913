Cystic and bullous lung disease.
 One of the most difficult problems facing clinicians is the evaluation and management of patients with dyspnea whose chest roentgenogram shows single or multiple large cystic spaces.
 This is made more difficult when underlying lung disease is present.
 The dilemma focuses on whether the obliteration or removal of the cystic areas will benefit or cause further deterioration of the patient's condition.
 The pathophysiology of the problem is not completely understood, but accumulated clinical experience has shown that surgical therapy can be beneficial but requires proper patient selection.
