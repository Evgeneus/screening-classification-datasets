Bilateral intrapulmonary hematomas.
 A 67-yr-old man, known to have chronic obstructive lung disease, developed bilateral localized pulmonary densities on chest radiographs after cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
 An autopsy disclosed bilateral intrapulmonary hematomas without communication with bronchi, pulmonary arteries, or pleural cavities.
 We suggest blunt pulmonary injury is the most probable cause of the hematomas and discuss its pathogenic mechanism.
 Intrapulmonary hematomas should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary densities developing after a vigorous resuscitation.
