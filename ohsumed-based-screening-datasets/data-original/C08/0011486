Comparison of the effects of inhaled corticosteroids on the airway response to histamine, methacholine, hyperventilation, and sulfur dioxide in subjects with asthma.
 To investigate whether inhaled steroids modulate the airway response to different bronchoconstrictive stimuli, we studied 25 subjects with mild asthma with a double-blind, noncrossover design to compare the effect of a 3-week treatment with salbutamol (0.2 mg, four times a day [q.i.d.]) and placebo (N = 11) to the effect of salbutamol (0.2 mg q.i.d.) and inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP, 0.5 mg q.i.d.) (N = 14).
 Airway response to histamine and methacholine was assessed as the provocative concentration (in milligrams per milliliter) necessary to increase the specific airway resistance (SRaw) (in centimeters of H2O times second) by 100% (PC100 SRaw).
 Airway response to hyperventilation of air and to hyperventilation of 0.75 ppm of sulfur dioxide (SO2) was determined as the provocative ventilation (in liters per minute) necessary to increase SRaw by 75% (PV75 SRaw).
 Challenges were performed on separate days before and after treatment, and salbutamol inhalation was withheld at least 6 hours before each challenge.
 Salbutamol and placebo did not change perchallenge baseline SRaw nor did they have any significant effect on the airway response to the stimuli.
 Salbutamol and BDP decreased the mean prechallenge baseline SRaw (SEM) from 7.7 (0.37) to 5.9 (0.28) (p less than 0.01) and significantly (p less than 0.01) increased geometric mean (SEM) PC100 SRaw for histamine from 0.5 (1.42) to 0.9 (1.53) mg/ml; for methacholine, from 0.2 (1.47) to 0.5 (1.51) mg/ml; and mean (SEM) PV75 SRaw for hyperventilation of air from 51.8 (2.32) to 58.4 (1.86) L/min.
 In contrast, the change of PV75 SRaw during hyperventilation of SO2 from 26.2 (2.29) to 31.4 (3.30) L/min was not significant.
