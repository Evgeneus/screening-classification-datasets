Hyponatremia and hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism in a critically ill patient: combination of insensitivity to angiotensin II and tubular unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoid.
 A 62-year-old man with pneumonia and left flank pain had a clinical syndrome of hyponatremia, hypotension, dehydration, and high urinary sodium excretion in the presence of a normal glomerular filtration rate.
 The plasma level of antidiuretic hormone was relatively high despite decreased serum osmolality.
 Thyroid function and excretion of glucocorticoid and sex steroids were normal.
 The serum aldosterone level was very low despite elevated plasma renin activity.
 Angiotensin II failed to stimulate any secretion of aldosterone, despite the occurrence of a progressive rise in blood pressure.
 On the other hand, rapid ACTH administration increased both serum aldosterone and cortisol.
 The patient showed no effective response to increased salt intake, but large doses of mineralocorticoid resulted in a normal serum sodium level without dehydration.
 Subsequently, he suffered cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular tachycardia.
 Postmortem examination showed well differentiated adenocarcinoma in the left pleura and an intact, histologically normal adrenal zona glomerulosa and kidney.
 This is the first reported case of a critically ill patient with hyponatremia caused by hyperreninemic hypoaldosteronism possibly due to angiotensin II insensitivity and tubular unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoid.
