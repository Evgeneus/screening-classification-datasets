Computerised axial tomography of the trachea. A useful investigation when a retrosternal goitre causes symptomatic tracheal compression.
 Case histories are reported of three patients who had large retrosternal goitres which were responsible for significant abnormalities of the airway.
 Computerised axial tomography demonstrated the exact anatomy.
 The site of tracheal compression was shown and accurate measurements of the diameter of the trachea at its narrowest point were made.
 This information was useful when the management of the patient was planned.
