Effect of GR32191, a potent thromboxane receptor antagonist, on exercise induced bronchoconstriction in asthma.
 Previous work suggests a role for mast cell derived mediators in exercise induced asthma.
 The contribution of newly generated contractile prostaglandins to exercise induced asthma was assessed by using a potent and orally active thromboxane (TP1) receptor antagonist, GR32191.
 The effect of 120 mg GR32191 on exercise induced asthma was observed in 12 asthmatic subjects.
 For the exercise challenge the subjects performed six minutes of treadmill exercise, breathing dry air at a work load that had previously been shown to induce a fall in FEV1 of 25% or more from the pre-exercise baseline.
 No effect of GR32191 on pre-exercise baseline airway calibre was evident.
 There was no significant difference in the mean maximum percentage fall in FEV1 from baseline after exercise between drug and placebo (placebo 30.2%, GR32191 day 31.6%).
 It is concluded that the thromboxane antagonist GR32191 has no effect on exercise induced asthma.
 This suggests that prostaglandins, including PGD2, that act via the thromboxane receptor do not have an important role in exercise induced asthma.
