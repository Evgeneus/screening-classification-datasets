Quality of well-being before and after antibiotic treatment of pulmonary exacerbation in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 General quality of life has only recently been measured with an objective tool in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and there have been no reported attempts to document changes in patients' overall well-being over time, as patients deteriorate or respond to intervention.
 We applied the Quality of Well-Being scale (QWB) in 28 patients with CF before and after a two-week course of oral ciprofloxacin used to treat pulmonary exacerbations.
 There were significant correlations between changes in QWB and various pulmonary function test results; QWB vs FEV1: r = 0.4, p less than 0.03; QWB vs FVC: r = 0.5, p less than 0.01; and QWB vs SaO2: r = 0.4, p less than 0.05.
 Thus, the QWB can track changes in general well-being in CF patients over a brief time and detect changes associated with pulmonary exacerbation and its treatment.
