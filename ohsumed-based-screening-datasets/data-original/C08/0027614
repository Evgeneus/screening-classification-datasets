Effect of i.v. midazolam on the ventilatory response to sustained hypoxia in man.
 The ventilatory response to isocapnic, sustained hypoxia is characterized by initial hyperventilation followed by ventilatory decline.
 The ventilatory response to isocapnic sustained hypoxia during i.v.
 administration of midazolam was assessed in five healthy subjects.
 Compared with control experiments, the hyperventilatory effect of hypoxia was not decreased following administration of midazolam.
 The hypoxic ventilatory change was significantly greater with midazolam because of a decrease in tidal volume.
