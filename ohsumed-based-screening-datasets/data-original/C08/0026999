Influence of surgical resection before and after chemotherapy on survival in small cell lung cancer.
 We attempted to define the role of surgery in the treatment of small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
 Of 81 patients with clinically localized SCLC, 36 underwent surgical resection: 19 underwent initial resection with postoperative chemotherapy, while the remaining 17 were treated initially with chemotherapy, then resection.
 The remaining 45 patients were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
 The 5-year survival for the 36 surgical patients was 38%; median survival time (MST) was 33 months.
 Nineteen patients treated with postoperative chemotherapy showed a 42% 5-year survival, while 17 patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy showed a 33% 5-year survival.
 This difference was not significant.
 However, stage III survival tended to be better in patients with preoperative chemotherapy (MST, 29 months) than in those who had had postoperative chemotherapy only (MST, 17 months).
 Although survival of the 45 nonsurgical patients was poor, stage I and II patients, or those with complete remission showed a 25% 5-year survival with an MST of 33 months, and a 21% 5-year survival with an MST of 25 months, respectively.
 We thus concluded that initial resection combined with postoperative chemotherapy is beneficial for patients with stage I, and probably stage II disease.
 For resectable stage III, particularly in patients with N2 disease, adjuvant resection after chemotherapy may be a favorable choice in the management of SCLC.
 For advanced stage III, complete remission by chemotherapy should be attempted in combination with radiotherapy.
