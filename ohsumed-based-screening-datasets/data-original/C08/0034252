Intrathoracic osteosarcoma diagnosed by CT scan and pleural biopsy.
 Osteosarcoma rarely presents as a primary lesion in the chest, whereas pulmonary metastases are common.
 The diagnosis of primary intrathoracic osteosarcoma has invariably been by thoracotomy or autopsy.
 We present a case of a densely calcified, primary intrathoracic osteosarcoma where diagnosis was made antemortem by pleural biopsies and computed tomography scan.
