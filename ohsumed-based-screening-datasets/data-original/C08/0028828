Cough intensity in the laryngectomee.
 The exact role or even the necessity for a functioning larynx in the production of an efficient cough is unknown.
 This study compares the cough intensity of 10 laryngectomees with a control group of 10 individuals with a larynx.
 There is no significant difference in the peak flow but the time taken to reach the peak flow is prolonged in the laryngectomees.
 The supramaximal expiratory flow is thus absent.
 The larynx is not essential for coughing although the different pattern may be less efficient.
 This simple test may have diagnostic value in assessing the larynx.
