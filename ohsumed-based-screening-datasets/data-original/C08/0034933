Morbidity and mortality of patients with AIDS and first-episode Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia unaffected by concomitant pulmonary cytomegalovirus infection.
 To determine the significance of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pulmonary coinfection with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in AIDS, we examined the association of long- and short-term survival and morbidity (as defined by length of hospital stay) with recovery of CMV from bronchoscopy specimens and an indirect measure of virus titer in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (the time to develop CMV cytopathology in culture) in 111 patients diagnosed with a first episode of P.
 carinii pneumonia.
 Compared with 57 individuals from whom CMV was not isolated, the 54 individuals from whom CMV were isolated did not differ in baseline characteristics, long-term survival (213 versus 275 days, p = 0.97), acute death rate (19% in both, p = 1.0), or length of hospital stay (19.7 versus 21.1 days, p = 0.68).
 Also, the time to develop CMV cytopathology in culture did not correlate with acute or long-term survival.
 Our observations thus do not support the use of CMV-specific antiviral therapy in AIDS patients with P.
 carinii pneumonia who also have evidence of pulmonary CMV infection.
