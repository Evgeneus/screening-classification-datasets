AIDS-associated polyclonal lymphoma: identification of a new HIV-associated disease process.
 High-grade non-Hodgkins B-cell lymphoma is one of the principle malignancies that occurs in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1).
 Immunoblastic lymphomas that arise in immunosuppressed transplant patients have been described as both monoclonal and polyclonal, and occur in association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.
 To test whether polyclonal lymphoma occurred in patients with AIDS we studied tumors from multiple sites in three patients who died with widespread AIDS-associated large cell or large cell immunoblastic lymphoma.
 All biopsy specimens contained invasive lymphoma.
 Tumor cells were mature IgM-positive immunoblasts by immunohistochemical analysis, with the same B-cell phenotype observed in all tumor sites.
 Only a minority of sites from all patients analyzed were monoclonal as measured by immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, with one case having several foci of monoclonal disease with other histologically identical metastases showing no evidence of monoclonal proliferation.
 Similar to the transplant-associated polyclonal B-cell proliferations.
 EBV gene sequences were present in multiple sites from one autopsy.
 In the other two autopsies, polyclonal B-cell proliferations occurred in the absence of EBV involvement except at one site, where a minor clone of EBV-infected cells was found.
 In contrast to HIV-associated Burkitt's lymphoma, no c-myc rearrangements were found at any site.
 These studies describe the occurrence of polyclonal lymphoma in AIDS and suggest that EBV-negative polyclonal lymphoma may be a distinct disease entity unique to HIV-infected individuals.
