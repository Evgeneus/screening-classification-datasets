Comparison of outcomes of double and single lung transplantation for obstructive lung disease. The Toronto Lung Transplant Group.
 Single lung transplantation has recently been applied with success in patients with obstructive lung disease.
 Such patients were previously managed by bilateral pulmonary transplantation.
 Between November 1986 and January 1990, 18 patients underwent transplantation for obstructive lung disease in our center.
 Eleven double lung transplants and seven single lung transplants were performed in patients having a mean age of 43.4 and 44.1 years, respectively.
 Operative death occurred in two of 11 double lung transplantations and one of seven single lung transplantations.
 Each patient underwent preoperative and 3-month postoperative pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analyses, nuclear lung scans, and 6-minute walk tests.
 There was no difference in the preoperative values for any of these parameters.
 Double lung recipients had significantly higher forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity than single lung recipients.
 However, the ratios of forced expiratory volume in 1 second to vital capacity were not different.
 Arterial oxygen and carbon dioxide tension were not different between the two procedures.
 Whereas double lung transplantations caused a slight preponderance of perfusion to the right lung, the transplanted lung in single lung recipients received a mean of 79.5% +/- 12.3% of predicted flow and only 61.6% +/- 5.0% of predicted ventilation.
 Three-month 6-minute walk distances were markedly improved in both groups, with double lung recipients achieving 573.0 +/- 44.7 m in comparison with the 528.0 +/- 43.0 m achieved by the single lung recipients.
 Single lung transplantation is a satisfactory option in patients with obstructive lung disease and might offer significant advantages to the older patient population, in which risk of double lung transplantation is high.
