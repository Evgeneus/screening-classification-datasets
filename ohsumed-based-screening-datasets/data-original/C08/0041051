Teniposide and etoposide in previously untreated small-cell lung cancer: a randomized study.
 A randomized study comparing teniposide (VM-26) and etoposide (VP-16) was performed to investigate whether there are any differences in the activity and toxicity of these two analogs in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).
 Only previously untreated patients with SCLC were included; 46 and 48 patients receiving VP-16 and VM-26, respectively, are assessable for response.
 There were no differences between the two groups with respect to extent of disease, median age, and performance status (PS).
 The initial doses were for both compounds 70 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) daily for 5 days every 3 weeks.
 After inclusion of 25 patients in the study, the doses were increased to 80 mg/m2 for VM-26 and 90 mg/m2 for VP-16 because of differences in toxicity.
 VM-26 caused more hematologic toxicity than VP-16 throughout the study.
 The overall responses (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]) were 65% for VP-16 and 71% for VM-26, with CR occurring in 24% and 23%, respectively, for the two compounds.
 Median survival was 8.5 months for VP-16-treated patients versus 11.3 months for VM-26-treated patients (P = .58).
 It is concluded that both VP-16 and VM-26 are highly active single agents in SCLC.
