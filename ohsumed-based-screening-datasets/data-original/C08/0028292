A cross-sectional study of pulmonary function in autobody repair workers.
 This study evaluated pulmonary function in workers from 39 autobody repair shops.
 Based on 152 White male workers with known smoking status, the mean percent predicted FEV1, FVC, and FEV1/FVC were 93.6, 96.8, and 96.6, respectively.
 Twenty-three percent of workers had a FEV1/FVC ratio less than the fifth percentile.
 Isocyanate levels ranged from nondetectable to 0.06 parts per million (STEL = 0.02 ppm).
 No shop had an adequate respiratory protection program.
 We concluded that there was an increase in abnormal pulmonary function in autobody workers.
 Three recommendations were made to shop owners: functional paint booths should be maintained, respiratory protection programs should be developed, and isocyanate-free paints should be used.
