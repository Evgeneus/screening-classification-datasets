Steroid-induced reduction of histamine release does not alter the clinical nasal response to cold, dry air.
 In some persons, cold, dry air (CDA) provokes symptoms of rhinitis that are associated with increased levels of histamine and other inflammatory mediators in nasal lavages.
 Because the patterns of mediators released during the early reaction to antigen and CDA-induced rhinitis are similar, we believe that mast cell activation is part of the reaction to CDA.
 In view of our previous finding that 1-wk pretreatment with topical steroids reduced symptoms and mediator release in the early nasal response to antigen of allergic subjects, we examined the effect of beclomethasone dipropionate on the response to CDA.
 Using a double-blind, crossover design, 84 micrograms of beclomethasone or placebo were administered in each nostril twice a day to 13 volunteers for 7 days prior to CDA challenge.
 The reaction to CDA was monitored by measuring the levels of histamine, N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methyl ester (TAME)-esterase activity and albumin in nasal lavages before and after provocation.
 Overall symptom scores, as well as scores for rhinorrhea and congestion, were also obtained.
 Cold, dry air challenge resulted in elevation over baseline of all parameters after placebo pretreatment.
 After beclomethasone, a significant reduction in histamine levels, but not in TAME-esterase activity or albumin levels or in number of symptoms, was observed.
 These results indicate that 1-wk pretreatment with beclomethasone affects mast cells, reducing histamine release after CDA, as it did in antigen-induced rhinitis.
 They also indicate that histamine may not be essential for the development of the immediate nasal reaction to CDA.
