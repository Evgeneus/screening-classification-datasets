Tuberculosis outbreak on Standing Rock Sioux Reservation--North Dakota and South Dakota, 1987-1990.
 From 1987 through 1988, a cluster of cases of tuberculosis (TB) occurred among persons residing on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation; recognition of this cluster prompted an epidemiologic investigation by the Indian Health Service (IHS), Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Health and Community Health Programs, South Dakota State Department of Health, North Dakota State Department of Health, and CDC.
 This report summarizes the findings of that investigation and follow-up public health interventions.
