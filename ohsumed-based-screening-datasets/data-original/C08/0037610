Psychologic and physiologic aspects of acute dyspnea in asthmatics.
 The purpose of this study was to compare psychologic and physiologic variables during intense dyspnea to those at times of no or low dyspnea in people with asthma.
 Thirty-six adults ranging from 19 to 76 years old were tested when they first came to the emergency department in acute dyspnea and again when they had no or low dyspnea just prior to discharge.
 Clinical signs found to be higher during high dyspnea than low dyspnea were respiratory rate, pulse, wheezing, and accessory muscle use.
 Peak expiratory flow rates and oxygen saturation were significantly lower, while anxiety, depression, somatization, and hostility were higher during times of high dyspnea.
 The panic/fear, fatigue, dyspnea, hyperventilation/hypocapnia, congestion, and rapid breathing subscales of the Asthma Symptom Checklist were also higher during high dyspnea compared to low dyspnea.
