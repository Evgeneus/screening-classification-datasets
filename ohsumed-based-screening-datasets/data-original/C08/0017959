Hypogammaglobulinemia associated with cytomegalovirus pneumonia.
 Transient but profound hypogammaglobulinemia occurred during cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia in a patient who developed striking declines in number of T lymphocytes.
 A 66-year-old, female, human immunodeficiency virus-negative patient requiring long-term hemodialysis had normal serum immunoglobulin concentrations before the onset of CMV pneumonia (IgG, 1070-1470 mg/dl; IgA, 94-102 mg/dl; IgM, 30-48 mg/dl).
 During the pneumonia episode, serum immunoglobulin concentrations were profoundly reduced (IgG, 440 mg/dl; IgA, 40 mg/dl; IgM, 25 mg/dl).
 Total lymphocytes declined from 3048/mm3 to 212/mm3 with reductions in CD4+CD45- lymphocytes (inducers of B cells) to 9% (nl, 24%-32%) and CD4+CD45+ lymphocytes (inducers of suppressor T cells) to 4% (nl, 14%-22%).
 CD8 lymphocytes were reduced to 5% (nl, 19%-31%).
 As the pneumonia resolved, serum immunoglobulin concentrations returned to normal.
 This is one of the few reported instances of CMV infection apparently causing hypogammaglobulinemia.
