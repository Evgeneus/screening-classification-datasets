Primary angiosarcoma of the seminal vesicle.
 We report on an unusual case of primary angiosarcoma of the seminal vesicle.
 Diagnosis was confirmed by light and electron microscopy, as well as specific immunohistochemical staining.
 This rare tumor is highly aggressive, and refractory to traditional surgical and adjuvant therapeutic modalities.
 Sarcomatous lesions of the seminal vesicle are reviewed.
