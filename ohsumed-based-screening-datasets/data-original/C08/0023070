Influence of lung volume and left atrial pressure on reverse pulmonary venous blood flow.
 Infarction of the lung is uncommon even when both the pulmonary and the bronchial blood supplies are interrupted.
 We studied the possibility that a tidal reverse pulmonary venous flow is driven by the alternating distension and compression of alveolar and extra-alveolar vessels with the lung volume changes of breathing and also that a pulsatile reverse flow is caused by left atrial pressure transients.
 We infused SF6, a relatively insoluble inert gas, into the left atrium of anesthetized goats in which we had interrupted the left pulmonary artery and the bronchial circulation.
 SF6 was measured in the left lung exhalate as a reflection of the reverse pulmonary venous flow.
 No SF6 was exhaled when the pulmonary veins were occluded.
 SF6 was exhaled in increasing amounts as left atrial pressure, tidal volume, and ventilatory rates rose during mechanical ventilation.
 SF6 was not excreted when we increased left atrial pressure transients by causing mitral insufficiency in the absence of lung volume changes (continuous flow ventilation).
 Markers injected into the left atrial blood reached the alveolar capillaries.
 We conclude that reverse pulmonary venous flow is driven by tidal ventilation but not by left atrial pressure transients.
 It reaches the alveoli and could nourish the alveolar tissues when there is no inflow of arterial blood.
