A transformation-incompetent, nuclear antigen 2-deleted Epstein-Barr virus associated with replicative infection.
 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) obtained directly from the oropharynx was used to detect viral DNA deleted for the EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2)-encoding gene that is essential for lymphocyte transformation.
 By polymerase chain reaction analysis, the deletion was found in virus from 5 of 33 healthy adult donors and 11 of 12 patients with concurrent human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Lymphoblastoid cell lines that produce standard transforming EBV also harbored EBNA2-deleted virus in cells permissive of EBV replication.
 In vitro infectivity studies indicated that the DNA is packaged and transmissible, with biologic properties similar to those of a laboratory mutant, P3HR-1, which also lacks the EBNA2 gene.
 These findings, obtained from productively infected cell systems, provide evidence for the existence in nature of a transformation-incompetent EBV variant that may facilitate EBV persistence and the emergence of reactivation diseases.
