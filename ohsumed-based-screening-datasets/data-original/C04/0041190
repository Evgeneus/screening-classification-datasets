Telecanthal approach for meningiomas in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.
 In three cases involving meningiomas in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses, transbasal spreading of the interocular distance (telecanthal approach) was used for tumor removal and reconstruction of the skull base.
 This telecanthal approach involves 1) bilateral en bloc removal of the superior lateral rim of the orbit, the nasal bone, and the posterior lateral wall of the orbit; 2) detachment of the medial canthal ligaments; and 3) spreading of the interocular distance.
 This approach provides a wide working space beneath the anterior half of the midline skull base, and needs neither a facial incision nor significant retraction of the brain.
 The surgical technique and its modification are described.
 The discussion focuses not only on comparisons with other techniques, but on the indications for this approach.
 Meningiomas originating in the paranasal sinuses are rare; a brief review of the literature concerning the clinicopathological features and pathogenesis is also given.
