Genitourinary cancer in the elderly.
 The subject of genitourinary cancer in the elderly becomes increasingly more important as our population of patients older than 50 years expands.
 Carcinoma of the kidney, bladder, and prostate all have an increasing incidence over the age of 50 and have a predilection for afflicting men more commonly than women.
 Etiologic factors, especially with bladder and kidney carcinomas, are well documented and in some cases preventable.
 Screening the urine for hematuria and careful digital rectal examinations may uncover a higher percentage of these malignancies in earlier, more curable stages.
 Recent advances in the treatment of all of these malignancies have improved survival and quality of life for these patients.
