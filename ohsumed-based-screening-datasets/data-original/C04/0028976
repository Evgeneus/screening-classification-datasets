Multiple basal cell carcinomas and HLA frequencies in southern Australia.
 An association between HLA-DR1 and the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas was detected in southern Australia.
 A reduction in HLA-DR4 was found in patients with basal cell carcinoma compared with a local control group.
 The relative risk for HLA-DR1 was 2.1, which was lower than that for persons in farther countries from the equator.
