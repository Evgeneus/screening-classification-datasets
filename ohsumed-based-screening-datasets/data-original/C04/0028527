Human papillomavirus--associated vulvar verrucous carcinoma in a 20-year-old with an intact hymen. A case report.
 A 20-year-old woman with vulvar verrucous carcinoma, the youngest such patient reported to date, had human papillomavirus DNA 6/11 identified with an in situ hybridization technique.
 In addition to her youth, the patient was unusual in that she had an intact hymen.
 Although she denied having engaged in sexual activity, venereal transmission of the virus may have occurred without vaginal penetration.
