Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia: molecular analysis of ABL insertion into M-BCR on chromosome 22.
 Leukemic cells from a patient with Ph-negative chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) had a normal karyotype.
 M-BCR was rearranged and chromosome in situ hybridization showed an ABL insertion between 5' and 3' M-BCR on an apparently normal chromosome 22.
 The association of 5' BCR and 3' ABL at the 5' junction of the chromosome 9 insert was typical of that found for the BCR-ABL fusion gene in other patients with the standard t(9;22) and CML.
 With an M-bcr-3' probe, we cloned and characterized a 3' junction fragment.
 Field inversion gel electrophoresis and chromosome in situ hybridization studies using a probe isolated from genomic DNA 5' of the junction showed that 3' M-BCR was joined to a region of chromosome 9q34 rich in repetitive sequences and lying some distance 3' of ABL.
 The chromosome 9 insert was at least 329 kilobases long and included 3' ABL and a larger portion of chromosome 9q34.
 Our results allowed us to exclude transposon- or retroviral-mediated insertion of ABL into chromosome 22.
 Instead, we favored a two-translocation model in which a second translocation reconstituted a standard t(9;22)(q34;q11) but left the chromosome 9 insert, including 3' ABL, in chromosome 22.
