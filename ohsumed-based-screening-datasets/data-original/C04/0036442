Prospective evaluation of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with operable non-small-cell lung cancer.
 Although adrenal metastases are frequently noted with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at autopsy, their incidence in patients with operable NSCLC is unclear.
 We prospectively assessed consecutive patients with otherwise operable NSCLC for the incidence and histology of unilateral adrenal masses.
 Assessment included blood chemistries, lung function tests, bronchoscopy, chest x-ray, bone scan, and computed tomography (CT) of the head, chest, and upper abdomen.
 Of 246 patients with otherwise operable NSCLC, 10 (4.1%) had a unilateral adrenal mass.
 Unilateral adrenal masses were needle-aspirated under CT control.
 If cytology was nondiagnostic, adrenalectomy was performed.
 Four (40%) of 10 patients had adrenal metastases proven by needle aspiration.
 Of the six (60%) patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses, one was demonstrated by needle aspiration.
 In the other five patients, a nondiagnostic needle aspiration led to adrenalectomy, which yielded two adenomas, two hyperplastic nodules, and one hemorrhagic cyst.
 There was no significant difference between the patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses with respect to patient age or stage and size of adrenal mass.
 Patients with benign unilateral adrenal masses underwent curative resection of their NSCLC and had significantly prolonged survival compared with patients with metastatic unilateral adrenal masses treated with chemotherapy (P = .037).
 Median survival of patients with benign and metastatic unilateral adrenal masses was greater than 30 months and 9 months, respectively.
 In conclusion, the presence of unilateral adrenal masses in patients with otherwise operable NSCLC should not preclude thoracotomy without pathologic proof of metastatic disease.
