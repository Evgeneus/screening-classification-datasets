Immunolocalization of the Bcl-2 protein within hematopoietic neoplasms.
 The Bcl-2 proto-oncogene was discovered at the t(14;18) breakpoint found in most follicular B-cell lymphomas and some diffuse large-cell lymphomas.
 Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and extending cell survival by blocking programmed cell death.
 We examined Bcl-2 protein expression in 82 hematologic malignancies and reactive lymphoid processes.
 All lymphomas with Bcl-2 rearrangement demonstrated high levels of Bcl-2 protein.
 However, most follicular and diffuse lymphomas without Bcl-2 rearrangement also displayed intense Bcl-2 staining.
 In these cases, mechanisms other than classic translocation may be deregulation Bcl-2.
 The pattern of Bcl-2 staining in follicular lymphoma is the inverse of the pattern in reactive hyperplasia, confirming a role for Bcl-2 immunolocalization in routine diagnosis.
 Small lymphocytic malignancies, including small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, expressed intermediate levels of Bcl-2.
 Bcl-2 protein varied in plasma cell dyscrasias.
 Bcl-2 protein levels in T-cell lymphomas reflected their corresponding stage of development.
 No substantial Bcl-2 was present in the Reed-Sternberg cells of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease.
 Chronic myelogenous leukemia was strongly positive for Bcl-2, consistent with the presence of Bcl-2 in normal myeloid progenitors.
 Immunohistochemistry identified an expanded spectrum of hematopoietic neoplasms in which Bcl-2 may provide a cell survival advantage.
