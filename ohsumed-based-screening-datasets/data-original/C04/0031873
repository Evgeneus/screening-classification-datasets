Incidence of ovarian cyst formation in women taking ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms.
 A total of 7,759 women were treated with ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms (EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms) in a field study involving 983 obstetrician-gynecologists evaluating the incidence of ovarian cyst formation.
 Six thousand three hundred eighty-two patients were evaluable; 1,377 could not be evaluated because of failure to meet inclusion criteria or inconsistent or incomplete data collection.
 Cysts were detected in 80 patients at the time of the final visit.
 Follow-up questionnaires were received on 61% of patients and confirmed the presence of 12 newly formed ovarian cysts in patients taking EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms.
 Only three women required an operation for ovarian cysts; two women had functional ovarian cysts (one follicular and one luteal), and one had a neoplastic cyst (cystadenoma).
 Thus, the incidence of ovarian cyst formation requiring surgical intervention was 0.05% in women taking EDA 1 mg with EE 35 micrograms.
