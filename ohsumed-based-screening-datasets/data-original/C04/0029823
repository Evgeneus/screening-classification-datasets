Cancer risk among staff at two radiotherapy departments in Denmark.
 In comparison with the general Danish population, the relative risk (RR) for cancer among staff members employed in two radiotherapy departments in Denmark during 1954-1982 and alive on 1 April 1968 was assessed by linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry.
 All staff had been monitored with film dosimeters for exposure to radiation.
 The study cohort consisted of 4151 persons, accruing 49553 person-years at risk.
 The collective radiation dose was 76.54 manSv and the mean dose 18.4 mSv.
 A total of 163 cancer cases were observed with 152.3 expected.
 The risks for cancers usually considered to be radiogenic were not elevated.
 A significant excess of prostatic cancer was observed (five cases, relative risk, 6.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-14.06); this is likely to be a chance finding.
 No relation was observed between radiation dose or years of exposure and cancer risk, but a weak non-significant increase in risk with time since first exposure was seen.
