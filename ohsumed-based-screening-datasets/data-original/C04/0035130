The prognostic significance of glial fibrillary acidic protein staining in medulloblastoma.
 Histologic and immunohistochemical properties of 53 medulloblastomas were analyzed with regard to clinical features and survival rate.
 No correlation was found between survival rate and histologic features of the tumor, such as desmoplastic reaction, number of mitoses, hemorrhages, necrosis, endothelial proliferation, glomerular arrangement, calcifications, rosettes, or oligodendroglial cells.
 However 82% of the patients with positive glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining in numerous tumor cells survived more than 5 years; only 30% survived that long if their tumor cells were GFAP negative (P = 0.0093).
 This significant difference was not related to the mode of therapeutic protocol used.
 The authors suggest that GFAP staining may be a useful prognostic tool in medulloblastoma.
