A report of familial carotid body tumors and multiple extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas.
 A case of familial carotid body tumors and multiple extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas is reported.
 The carotid body tumors, resected previously, were bilateral and associated with 4 intra-abdominal extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was far superior to computerized tomography and 131iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine in visualizing the intra-abdominal lesions, and may soon become the imaging technique of choice in the evaluation of patients with suspected pheochromocytoma.
