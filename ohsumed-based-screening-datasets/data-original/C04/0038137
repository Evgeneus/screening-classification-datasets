Trans-hydroxyl group configuration on carbons 2 and 3 of glucose. Responsible for acute inhibition of myo-inositol transport?
 Cultured neuroblastoma, cerebral microvessel endothelial, and retinoblastoma cells were used to examine the mechanism of acute inhibition by D-glucose of myo-inositol uptake.
 Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM D-glucose caused a significant decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake in all three cell types.
 The effect of D-glucose to acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake was dependent on the extracellular glucose concentration and was not reversed by sorbinil.
 2-Deoxy-D-glucose (30 mM), 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (30 mM), and cytochalasin B (100 microM) did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake.
 These data suggest that the hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 of D-glucose, which in a Haworth projection appear trans to each other, are important for inhibitory activity.
 Other monosaccharides (30 mM) having a similar 2,3-trans-diol configuration, L-glucose, D- and L-fucose, D- and L-galactose, D- and L-xylose, and D-arabinose, all to varying degrees significantly inhibited myo-inositol uptake.
 In all cases, the L-isomers were more potent inhibitors of myo-inositol uptake than the corresponding D-isomers.
 Monosaccharides (30 mM) having hydroxyl groups on carbons 2 and 3 in a cis configuration, D-mannose, L-rhamnose, D-allose, and D-ribose, did not acutely inhibit myo-inositol uptake.
 Replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbons 2 or 3 of D-glucose negated its inhibitory activity of myo-inositol uptake.
 In contrast, replacing the hydroxyl group with a fluorine on carbon 6 of D-glucose did not block its inhibition of myo-inositol uptake.
