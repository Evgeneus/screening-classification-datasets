Regulation of phospholipase D and primary granule secretion by P2-purinergic- and chemotactic peptide-receptor agonists is induced during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.
 We have compared the abilities of extracellular ATP (acting via P2-purinergic receptors) and formylated peptides (FMLP) to stimulate both phospholipase D (PLD)-based signal transduction and primary granule (azurophilic) secretion in HL-60 cells induced to differentiate along the granulocytic pathway.
 In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, neither ATP nor FMLP elicited significant PLD activation or increased secretion despite the previously documented ability of ATP to stimulate large increases in polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization.
 Conversely, within 1 d after induction of granulocytic differentiation by dibutyryl cAMP, both ATP and FMLP induced large increases in azurophilic secretion and corresponding increases in PLD activity.
 ATP-activated PLD activity was near-maximal within 1 d after dibutyryl cAMP treatment, while the FMLP-induced activity increased continuously over 4 d, with a maximal level twice that stimulated by ATP.
 Additional experiments characterized the activation of PLD by receptor-independent pathways at different stages of differentiation; these included studies of phorbol ester action in intact cells and GTP gamma S action in electropermeabilized cells.
 An apparent role for guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins in PLD regulation was also indicated by the significant reduction in FMLP- and ATP-stimulated PLD activity observed in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin.
 At all stages of differentiation, there was good correlation between the relative efficacies of ATP versus FMLP in stimulating both secretion and PLD activity.
 These data indicate: (a) that the receptor-regulated phospholipase D signaling pathway is induced during differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells; and (b) that differential activation of this signaling system by various Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptor agonists may underlie the differential regulation of secretion and other phagocyte functions by such agents.
