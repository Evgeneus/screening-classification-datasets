Sequential connection of flaps: a logical approach to customized mandibular reconstruction.
 Microsurgery has improved the success rate for reconstruction of composite defects in the head and neck.
 Restoration of mandibular continuity alone is not adequate for reconstruction.
 Replacement of the oral lining with thin tissue is necessary to improve tongue mobility and to set the stage for later dental restoration.
 There is currently no ideal osteocutaneous free flap that provides unlimited length of bone, can undergo multiple osteotomies to produce the proper curve to the reconstructed mandible, and provides thin skin for oral lining.
 Combining free flaps can take advantage of the strengths of the individual donor sites and eliminate some of the problems with current osteocutaneous flaps.
 In six patients, a fibular osseous free flap was combined with either a radial forearm flap or a lateral arm flap to provide bone and oral lining in reconstruction of mandibular composite defects.
 In these selected patients, the fibula provided the blood supply for the second free flap, which was placed sequentially.
 The distal peroneal vessels were used to anastomose to the radial forearm vessels or the lateral arm pedicle.
 This approach allows the surgeon to customize the defect by improving both the functional and aesthetic aspects of reconstruction and is of use in cases where vascular access is limited, such as following head and neck surgery and radiation.
