Glandular odontogenic cyst: clinicopathologic analysis of three cases.
 The glandular odontogenic cyst is a rare cyst of odontogenic origin, first described in 1988 by Gardner et al.
 Three previously unreported glandular odontogenic cysts are presented; none recurred after the initial surgical treatment, and one example was associated with a squamous odontogenic tumor-like proliferation in the wall.
 Ten similar cases were found in the literature, and their clinical and roentgenographic features, and follow-up, have been compared with the present cases.
