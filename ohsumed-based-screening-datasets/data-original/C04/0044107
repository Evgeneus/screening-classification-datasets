The Istituto Rizzoli-Beretta experience with osteosarcoma of the jaw.
 Twenty-eight osteosarcomas (OS) of the jaw were reported.
 There were 15 male and 13 female patients (age range, 9 to 68 years; mean, 36.9 years); 57.1% of the patients were older than 30 years of age.
 Swelling was the most frequent symptom; it was reported on an average of 6 months before diagnosis.
 Most of the tumors of the maxilla (eight patients) occurred in the alveolar ridge (six of eight).
 In the mandible (20 patients), the body was the preferred site (11 of 20).
 Radiographically most of the lesions were either lytic and sclerotic or only lytic.
 Histologically, 12 cases (42.9%) were osteoblastic osteosarcoma, ten (35.8%) were chondroblastic, four (14.3%) were fibroblastic, and two (7%) were round cell OS.
 Of the 28 cases, three (10.7%) were low grade, and 25 (89.3%) were high grade.
 Thirteen patients had intralesional surgery, and 13 had marginal surgery as their initial treatment.
 Recurrence was the rule in the first group, and it was 69% in the second group.
 Twenty patients (71%) died, and eight are alive.
 Of these, two are alive with disease.
 In the six patients who are alive and disease-free, all but one had marginal to wide surgical margins at the time of the first procedure or wide margins at the time of the recurrences along with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
 In the patient in which the surgical margins were marginal, the lesion was small 2.5 X 2 cm.
 This patient was alive without evidence of disease after 9 years of follow-up.
