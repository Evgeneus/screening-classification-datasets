Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia associated with a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma.
 Blepharospasm-oromandibular dystonia is characterized by the presence of spasms of the orbicularis oculi (blepharospasm) and of the lower facial or oromandibular muscles.
 A patient with this syndrome is presented in which a left cerebellopontine angle meningioma appeared to act as a triggering mechanism for the development of this disorder.
 On the basis of this report, we recommend that physicians search for this tumor in patients with this disorder.
