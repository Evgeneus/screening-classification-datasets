Prospective, randomized trial of palliative treatment for unresectable cancer of the esophagus.
 To evaluate the best method of palliation for obstructing nonresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the mid or distal esophagus, 27 patients were prospectively randomized to one of three treatment arms: (1) esophageal intubation with an Atkinson tube (AT, 10 patients), (2) esophageal intubation followed by radiation therapy (AT/RT, 8 patients), and (3) endoscopic laser therapy followed by irradiation (L/RT, 9 patients).
 Pretreatment characteristics were similar in the three groups.
 There was no procedure-related mortality.
 There were eight total complications related to the tube and none related to laser treatment (p = 0.02).
 Mean survival was 119 days in the AT group, 72 days in the AT/RT group, and 169 days in the L/RT arm (p = not significant).
 Quality of survival was most dependent on swallowing ability, and the swallowing score increased by 2.3 units in the AT group, 1.8 units in the AT/RT group, and 1.4 units in the L/RT group (p = not significant).
 Adding RT to laser therapy significantly increased time in treatment (mean, 38.7 days) when compared with the AT group (mean, 12.5 days) (p less than 0.001).
 However, only 1 patient required repeat laser ablation.
 It is concluded that AT and L/RT result in good palliation as measured by relief of dysphagia and survival time.
 However, morbidity of AT is significantly greater than that of L/RT.
 Laser and radiation therapy with a reduced total dosage of RT or with a change in fractionation schedule to limit treatment time is the preferred method of palliation.
