Orbital exenteration with eyelid sparing: indications, technique, and results.
 Of 22 orbital exenterations performed from January 1980 to December 1989, 16 were performed by an eyelid-sparing technique, and six were allowed to heal by spontaneous granulation.
 Reviewing these procedures, we conclude that the eyelid-sparing method is indicated mainly for advanced primary orbital malignancies and for certain secondary orbital malignancies such as orbital extension of uveal melanoma, conjunctival melanoma, and conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma.
 It is not usually applicable to orbital invasion of malignant eyelid tumors such as basal cell carcinoma and sebaceous gland carcinoma.
 Advantages of the eyelid-sparing method are more rapid healing and earlier fitting of a prosthesis.
