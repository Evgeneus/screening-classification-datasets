Fibromatous epulis in dogs and peripheral odontogenic fibroma in human beings: two equivalent lesions.
 This article compares the clinical and histopathologic features of the peripheral odontogenic fibroma in human beings and the fibromatous epulis in dogs.
 They are apparently equivalent lesions.
 Both are odontogenic tumors of limited growth potential that do not recur if adequately excised; both occur in middle and late adulthood of the species concerned.
 The one difference is that the peripheral odontogenic fibroma is a rare condition, whereas the canine fibromatous epulis is common.
