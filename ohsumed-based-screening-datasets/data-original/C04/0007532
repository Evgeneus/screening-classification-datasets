Third ventricle cavernous angioma: report of two cases.
 Cavernous angioma arising in the third ventricle is an extremely rare disease.
 We have reviewed five cases previously reported, as well as our own two cases, and discuss the clinical characteristics of and surgical approach to cavernous angioma at this site.
 The bifrontal craniotomy and interhemispheric translamina terminalis approach minimize the damage to the brain and allow for an approach to the third ventricle in a wide operative field with minimal compression of the brain itself.
 We have found this approach to be suitable for surgery on angiomas of the anterior half of the third ventricle.
