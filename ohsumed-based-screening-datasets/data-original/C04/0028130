Anterior plate fixation in spine tumor surgery. Indications, technique, and results.
 Anterior decompression by vertebrectomy is now well established as the procedure of choice to optimize neurologic recovery in patients with a deficit due to tumor involvement of the vertebral body.
 Fifteen patients with tumor involvement of the cervical or thoracic spine and neurologic deficit were treated by single-stage anterior decompression and AO plate stabilization.
 No patient suffered neurologic deterioration after surgery.
 All patients with thoracic lesions who were unable to walk on presentation and who managed to survive their primary disease improved to a level that allowed independent ambulation with a frame.
 There were no problems, such as loss of fixation or deformity.
 It is concluded that standard AO plates provide adequate stabilization of the cervical and thoracic spine after vertebrectomy for tumor involvement.
