The p53 tumour suppressor gene.
 The cell cycle is composed of a series of steps which can be negatively or positively regulated by various factors.
 Chief among the negative regulators is the p53 protein.
 Alteration or inactivation of p53 by mutation, or by its interactions with oncogene products of DNA tumour viruses, can lead to cancer.
 These mutations seem to be the most common genetic change in human cancers.
