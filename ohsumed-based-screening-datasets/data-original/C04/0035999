Assessment of the psychological impact of a breast screening programme.
 In order to assess the psychological effect of mammographic screening, questionnaires (which included psychometric tests) were sent to 750 women at invitation and, 6 weeks after screening, to 420 women normal after the first mammograph, to 240 women normal after special assessment, and to 68 women normal after open biopsy.
 Increasing degree of the investigation was associated both with increasing frequency of breast self examination (10% were practising breast self-examination at least once a week before screening compared with 24% for women after special assessment and 35% of women who had had an open biopsy (p less than 0.001)), and with greater confidence that any malignancy in the breast would have been found.
 Psychometric scores showed no increase of general levels of anxiety or depression in the screened groups.
 For anxiety, percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 2 and 6 for the four groups, respectively, and for depression the percentages abnormal were 5, 4, 4 and 6, respectively; 10% of screened women were more anxious about having breast cancer as a result of the screening.
 At least 10% of women proceeding to open biopsy of benign lesions require professional counselling and support.
 Psychological ill effects were not detected by the psychometric test among women who did not proceed to this final investigation.
 Behavioural changes did suggest a raised awareness or fear of potential cancer among the screened population.
