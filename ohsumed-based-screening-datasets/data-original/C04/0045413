Histopathological changes in leiomyomata treated with leuprolide acetate.
 Several studies have shown a decrease in uterine and/or leiomyoma volume when treated with leuprolide acetate (LA), a widely used gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist.
 The mechanism by which these changes occur is unknown.
 In this study, the histopathological slides of 31 women of reproductive age who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy were blindly reviewed by a pathologist.
 Seventeen women underwent myomectomy.
 Among those, 10 were treated with LA.
 The tumors in all of these patients were reduced in size after therapy.
 Histopathologically, the LA treatment correlated with a significant reduction in cellularity.
 No significant change in fibrosis, edema, or mitotic activity was seen.
