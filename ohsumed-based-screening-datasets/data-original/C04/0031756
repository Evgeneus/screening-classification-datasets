A phase I trial of taxol given by a 6-hour intravenous infusion.
 Taxol is a unique mitotic inhibitor that has entered phase II investigation.
 Phase I studies demonstrated hypersensitivity reactions that were related to the cremophor vehicle and to the rate of drug infusion.
 As a result, the time span of intravenous (IV) infusion of taxol was routinely prolonged to 6 hours or beyond, and premedication with diphenhydramine, dexamethasone, and cimetidine was initiated.
 Early studies showed antitumor activity, especially against malignant melanoma and ovarian carcinoma.
 This phase I trial was performed giving taxol, as a 6-hour IV infusion every 21 days, without premedication.
 The purpose was to study the necessity of premedication and its impact on toxicity and pharmacokinetics.
 Thirty-one patients received 64 assessable courses of taxol.
 One patient had a hypersensitivity reaction, which was easily controlled using routine measures.
 Myelosuppression was dose-limiting, but sporadic, with two fatalities due to sepsis.
 Nonhematologic toxicity was of grade 1 and 2 except for one patient with grade 3 mucositis and two patients with grade 3 neuropathy.
 The neuropathy consisted of reversible painful paresthesias, requiring discontinuation of drug in two patients.
 Four partial responses were seen (three in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, one in a patient with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary).
 Pharmacokinetic values were consistent with those previously reported.
 The occurrence of myelosuppression or neurotoxicity appeared to be associated with the area under the concentration x time curve (AUC) of taxol.
 The recommended phase II starting dose on this schedule is 225 mg/m2.
 Taxol merits broad investigation at the phase II level.
