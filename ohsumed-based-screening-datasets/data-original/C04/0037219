Lectin staining of neoplastic and normal background colorectal mucosa in nonpolyposis and polyposis patients.
 A lectin histochemistry approach was adopted for comparative assessment of a colon cancer risk.
 Binding of Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I (UEA-I), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Griffonia simplicifolia agglutinin-II (GSA-II), and Dolichos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) was investigated in tumor and background tissue from a total of 34 adenoma and 44 cancer patients and compared with reaction patterns in control and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients.
 Adenoma patients with UEA-I positive rectal mucosa were found to have a 33.3 percent familial history of large bowel cancer, which was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) than the respective 4.0 percent figure for patients with negative rectal mucosa.
 In the cancer patients, an even stronger correlation was noted, with a 63.2 percent UEA-I positive family history association being recorded, as opposed to 4.0 percent in the negative rectal mucosa patients (P less than 0.01).
 Thus, the results suggest that, apparently, normal rectal background mucosa of individuals genetically at high risk for colon and rectal cancer demonstrates a specific lectin binding ability similar to that of FAP patients and that the simple method using UEA-I staining of rectal biopsy specimens can be of practical use in identification of high-risk colorectal cancer.
