Selection criteria for successful immediate breast reconstruction.
 To evaluate the factors leading to success in immediate breast reconstruction after mastectomy, 176 consecutive immediate reconstructions done with implants or expanders over a 5-year period were analyzed.
 None of these 176 had "complete muscle coverage." There were only five failures: four with implant loss (one involving radiation) and one removed electively.
 The failures were 1 in 40 regular implants, 4 in 77 temporary expanders, and 0 in 59 long-term expanders.
 There is no other report in the literature comparing these different types of implants.
 Various hypotheses for failure are reviewed.
 It is concluded that failure in immediate reconstruction is not related to use of drains, bilaterality, or lack of "complete muscle coverage." It is concluded that failure is related to implant type, prior radiation, and most of all to suboptimal patient selection.
 Specific selection criteria and operative techniques are discussed.
