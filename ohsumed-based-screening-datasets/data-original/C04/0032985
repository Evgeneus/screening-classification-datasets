Seminal vesicle cysts: association with adult polycystic kidney disease.
 Adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD) is associated with cyst formation in the kidney, liver, pancreas, esophagus, ovary, uterus, and brain.
 Four patients with APKD (aged 45-65 years) with computed tomographic evidence of seminal vesicle cysts are described.
 All seminal vesicles contained cystic masses with attenuation values of 0-30 HU.
 Seminal vesicle thickness was 3-4 cm (normal, 1.5 cm).
 High-attenuation walls separated the cysts, which were 3-35 mm in diameter.
 All patients had typical renal stigmata of APKD.
 None had cysts elsewhere, except one patient with hepatic cysts.
 Postmortem examination in one patient confirmed the seminal vesicle cysts as well as APKD.
 It is likely that a basement membrane defect allows cyst formation in multiple organs, presumably including the seminal vesicles.
 Because of the association of seminal vesicle cysts with ipsilateral urogenital anomalies, and because only 60% of patients with APKD have a relevant familial history, the kidneys of patients with cross-sectional imaging evidence of seminal vesicle cysts should also be studied.
