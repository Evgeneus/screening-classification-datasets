Prostate specific antigen values after radical retropubic prostatectomy for adenocarcinoma of the prostate: impact of adjuvant treatment (hormonal and radiation).
 Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were obtained before and after radical retropubic prostatectomy in 192 patients: 78 (41%) had pathological stage B2 cancer or less, 83 (43%) had stage C or C+ and 31 (16%) had stage D1 disease.
 Of those with stages B2 or less, C, C+ and D1 disease 82, 86, 65 and 90%, respectively, had postoperative PSA values of 0.2 ng./ml.
 or less (when first evaluated 30 or more days postoperatively).
 At 1 year postoperatively 94% of the stages C and C+ cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiation had PSA levels of 0.2 ng./ml.
 or less, which was significantly different from those not treated adjuvantly (p = 0.02).
 This effect of adjuvant radiation on PSA was temporary in the small number of patients with longer followup.
 Adjuvant orchiectomy for stage D1 lesions resulted in female PSA levels in virtually all cases.
 This decrease may be misleading and may reflect a direct hormonal effect rather than a decrease in tumor volume.
 Positive surgical margins did not significantly affect postoperative PSA levels, possibly because of the frequent use of adjuvant treatment.
