Familial multicentric paragangliomas in a child.
 A 12-year-old girl presented with bilateral carotid-body paragangliomas and a unilateral jugular paraganglioma.
 The tumours were surgically removed.
 This is a rare combination of tumours in any patient and previously unreported in a child of this age.
 Her father died of a cerebellar astrocytoma and her mother underwent surgical removal of a large mediastinal paraganglioma.
 The association of astrocytoma with familial paragangliomas has never been documented.
 The literature on the epidemiology and inheritance pattern of familial paragangliomas is reviewed.
 The need for thorough pre-operative evaluation of the patient and close follow-up of family members is stressed.
