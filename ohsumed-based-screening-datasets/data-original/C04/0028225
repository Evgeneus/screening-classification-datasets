Mammographic and CT findings after breast reconstruction with a rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap.
 This essay illustrates the radiologic appearance of the reconstructed breast and the abdominal wall after breast reconstruction with a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap.
 The findings are based on a retrospective study of 42 mammograms, 17 abdominal CT scans, and two CT scans each of the chest and pelvis of patients who underwent this procedure.
