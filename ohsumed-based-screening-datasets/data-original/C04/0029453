Colorectal cancer: current trends in initial clinical manifestations.
 Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a common cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the United States.
 There continues to be controversy regarding the effectiveness and feasibility of various screening programs for CRC.
 To determine how cases of CRC are currently detected, we reviewed a series of 246 consecutive patients with well-documented pathologic staging and clinical presentation.
 Patients with low stage CRC (0 or A) had smaller tumors, were less likely to be anemic at presentation, and were more likely to have tumors located in the left side of the colon than patients with tumors at stage B or higher.
 Thirty-two of the 246 tumors were detected in asymptomatic patients through screening.
 These tumors were more likely to be of a lower stage than those in patients with active gastrointestinal symptoms.
 In our experience active screening programs detect a relatively small number of CRCs.
 A majority (66%) of CRCs are still detected from symptoms referable to the gastrointestinal tract.
