Cisplatin and etoposide as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic breast carcinoma: a prospective randomized trial of the Italian Oncology Group for Clinical Research.
 In this prospective randomized study, first-line treatment with the combination of cisplatin (P) and etoposide (E) was compared with the standard cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil (CMF) combination in 140 patients.
 Complete remissions were obtained in 11% of 65 assessable patients on CMF and in 12% of 65 assessable patients on PE.
 Complete plus partial remission rates were 48% on CMF and 63% on PE (P = .08).
 Time to progression (median, 32 v 31 weeks), duration of response (48 v 39 weeks), and survival (75 v 76 weeks) were not different.
 Hematologic toxicity was significantly higher with PE, and gastrointestinal side effects were frequent with this treatment.
 This study demonstrated that the PE combination is effective as front-line chemotherapy.
 As far as response rate is concerned, a trend of superiority over CMF was observed, which was of borderline significance.
 Due to the lack of survival advantage and to toxicity, this combination is not recommended for routine clinical use.
 However, its high level of activity should be taken into account for further research.
