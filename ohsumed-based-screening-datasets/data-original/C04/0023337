Gonadotroph adenoma of the pituitary mimicking a prolactinoma.
 In a 41-year-old woman with mild hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea, preoperative hormonal and neuroradiological findings suggested the diagnosis of a macroprolactinoma.
 She underwent transsphenoidal surgery since the tumor size had not changed in spite of bromocriptine administration for 5 months.
 Consequently, this case was diagnosed as a female-type gonadotroph adenoma on the basis of its characteristic ultrastructural features including a honeycomb Golgi complex, even though endocrinological and immunohistochemical findings were not those of a typical gonadotroph adenoma.
