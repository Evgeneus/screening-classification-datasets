Preoperative radiation therapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy in patients with stage II endometrial carcinoma.
 Seventy-four patients with Stage II endometrial cancer were treated by a combination of preoperative radiation therapy followed by extrafascial hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and paraaortic lymph node sampling at the University of Kentucky Medical Center from 1967 to 1988.
 All patients had histologically confirmed endometrial cancer with involvement of the endocervix.
 The cell types and numbers of the tumors treated were as follows: adenocarcinoma, 58; adenoacanthoma, six; adenosquamous carcinoma, nine; and clear cell carcinoma, one.
 Preoperative radiation consisted of 4500 cGy external therapy followed by one intracavitary implant providing an additional 2000 cGy to point A.
 Surgery was done 4 to 6 weeks after completion of radiation therapy.
 Five patients (7.1%) had paraaortic lymph node metastases.
 Four were treated with extended-field radiation therapy and one with platinum-based combination chemotherapy.
 After treatment, the patients were followed at regular intervals from 2 to 22 years (mean, 5.4 years).
 Eleven patients (15%) had recurrent cancer, with the vagina and upper abdomen being the most common sites of spread.
 The estimated 5-year and 10-year disease-free survival rates of these patients are 88% and 76%, respectively.
 Cell type, depth of myometrial invasion, and lymph node status were the most important prognostic variables in the patients evaluated.
 These data confirm that the combination of preoperative radiation therapy and surgery produces excellent long-term survival in patients with Stage II endometrial cancer.
