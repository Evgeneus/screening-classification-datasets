Laser laparoscopic management of large endometriomas.
 Forty-seven patients underwent laser laparoscopic management of endometriomas from 3 to 12 cm in diameter.
 Eighteen patients had infertility, 15 had pelvic pain, and 14 had both.
 The types of laser used were the carbon dioxide, argon, and potassium-titanyl-phosphate.
 There were no surgical complications.
 Twelve of 32 patients with infertility achieved pregnancy after the initial procedure.
 Subsequently, 2 patients conceived after a second-look procedure.
 Twenty-three of 30 patients with pelvic pain reported improvement or resolution.
 We confirm the efficacy of operative laparoscopy using lasers in the management of large ovarian endometriomas.
