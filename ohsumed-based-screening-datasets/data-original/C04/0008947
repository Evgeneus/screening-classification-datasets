Recurrence of resected esophagogastric adenocarcinoma: results of re-resection.
 Isolated local recurrence following potentially curative resection for carcinoma of the esophagus or esophagogastric junction does not necessarily imply pending systemic disease and early demise.
 While radiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy is standard treatment for such patients, resection is another available option.
 Resection may also be a consideration should localized disease persist after non-operative therapy in the absence of metastases.
 A 5 year retrospective review was performed examining 204 resections performed prior to 1989.
 Only 5 patients underwent resection of locally recurrent esophagogastric (EG) adenocarcinoma during this period.
 No squamous carcinoma recurrences were resected.
 One patient is well 15 months later while another died at 18 months of other causes without recurrence.
 Recurrence after re-resection occurred at 8, 11, and 24 months in the 3 other patients.
 Although there were no postoperative deaths, major complications occurred in 4 patients.
 All 5 patients swallowed normally after operation.
