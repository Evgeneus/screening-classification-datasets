Surgical approach to the retrocrural lymph nodes.
 Removal of retrocrural lymph nodes requires an approach other than the infradiaphragmatic retroperitoneal access generally used in the surgical management of testicular tumours.
 The transperitoneal route given access, at best, to the origin of the superior mesenteric artery, but advanced testicular tumours occasionally require retrocrural node dissection.
 We describe a useful surgical approach to these nodes and the underlying anatomy.
