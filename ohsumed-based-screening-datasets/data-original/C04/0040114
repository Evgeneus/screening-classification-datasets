PET study of carbon-11-PK 11195 binding to peripheral type benzodiazepine sites in glioblastoma: a case report.
 The utility of the peripheral type benzodiazepine site ligand 11C-PK 11195, for imaging human glioma in conjunction with Positron Emission Tomography, relies on a high specific binding of the tracer to tumoral peripheral type benzodiazepines sites.
 In a patient with glioblastoma, we found that 11C-PK 11195 binding was two-fold higher in the tumor than in normal gray matter and that 30% of tumoral binding could be displaced by a large excess of unlabeled drug.
 These findings suggest that tumoral retention of the ligand is due, in part, to specific binding.
