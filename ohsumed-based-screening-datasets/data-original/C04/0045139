Enhancement of mammary carcinogenesis by high levels of dietary fat: a phenomenon dependent on ad libitum feeding 
 Female 55-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with a single intravenous dose of 7,12-dimethylbenzanthracene (DMBA), 2 mg/100 g of body weight each.
 At 60 days of age, the rats were divided into four dietary groups (41-42 rats/group):I, 5% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; II, 20% corn oil diet fed ad libitum; III, 5% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group I; and IV, 20% corn oil diet fed 12% less than group II.
 The 5% and 20% corn oil diets were purified semisynthetic diets that were isonutrient on a caloric basis.
 All animals were housed individually in single cages; food consumption of each animal was computed daily throughout the study.
 Sixteen weeks after carcinogen treatment, mean numbers of mammary carcinomas per rat (+/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 4.1 +/- 0.6, 6.8 +/- 0.7, 3.0 +/- 0.3, and 4.1 +/- 0.5, respectively.
 Mean weight of mammary carcinomas per rat (g +/- SE) in groups I, II, III, and IV were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 8.0 +/- 1.3, 3.0 +/- 1.1, and 4.6 +/- 1.3, respectively.
 Mammary carcinoma number and weight were significantly (P less than .01) increased in the animals fed the 20% corn oil diet ad libitum when compared with those fed the 5% corn oil diet ad libitum; however, no significant differences in mammary tumor number or weight were observed between the animals fed a restricted, 20% corn oil diet and those fed a restricted, 5% corn oil diet.
 The study involving the animals fed the 12%-restricted diets was repeated (38-42 rats/group), with virtually identical results, i.e., the mean number of mammary carcinomas per rat in the groups fed the restricted 5% fat and 20% fat diets at termination of the study was 3.1 +/- 0.4 and 3.7 +/- 0.3, respectively, and the mean weight (g) of mammary carcinomas per rat was 4.3 +/- 1.2 and 4.0 +/- 1.1, respectively (no significant differences).
 Thus, high levels of dietary fat can significantly enhance mammary carcinogenesis in female rats, but only in animals on an ad libitum feeding protocol.
 A slight restriction in amount consumed (12% less than ad libitum) abolished the mammary carcinogenic differential between a high-fat and a low-fat diet.
