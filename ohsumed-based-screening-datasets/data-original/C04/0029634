Cervical human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid and cytologic evaluations in gynecologic outpatients.
 We studied the prevalence and cytologic manifestations of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid among 2668 gynecologic outpatients.
 The study population consisted of 1573 women who came into the emergency room, 623 women from an abortion clinic who were seen because of induced first-trimester abortion, and 472 women who had been referred to a colposcopy clinic because of an abnormal Papanicolaou smear finding.
 A dot blot technique was used for the detection of human papillomavirus types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35.
 The prevalence of human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid was 4.4% in the emergency room population, 8.8% in the abortion clinic population, and 31.4% in the colposcopy clinic population.
 Human papillomavirus type 16/18 was most prevalent (3.5%), followed by human papillomavirus type 31/33/35 (3.1%), and human papillomavirus type 6/11 was least prevalent (2.1%).
 Of all unselected human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid-positive women who were enrolled from the emergency room or from the abortion clinic, 73% had normal cytologic evaluations.
 Twenty-five percent had benign atypia, and 2% had dyskaryotic changes.
 No human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid type-specific differences were detected in the distribution of cytologic atypias.
