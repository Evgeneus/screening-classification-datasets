Growth patterns and prognosis of submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus. A pathologic study.
 Sixteen cases of esophageal carcinoma invading the submucosa were analyzed in terms of growth patterns.
 Seven were classified into the massively penetrating (down growth) type, four into the superficially spreading (spreading growth) type, and five into the unclassified type.
 In the down growth type, the ratio of the submucosal area to the total (mucosa and submucosa) area was more than 0.2 (one fifth), and in the others that ratio was less than 0.2.
 The down growth type is characterized by a tendency toward elevated lesions, a high incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a poor prognosis after surgery.
 Lymphatic and/or vascular invasions were recognized in six of seven cases, and the 5-year survival rate was 0%.
 In contrast, the spreading growth and unclassified types was characterized by superficial lesions, a low incidence of vessel invasions and lymph node metastasis, and a favorable prognosis.
 In only one with the spreading growth type was there lymphatic invasion.
 Three of the four with the spreading growth type survived over 5 years, and the other one with the spreading growth type and all of five with the unclassified type are alive without recurrences 15 to 52 months after surgery.
 Thus, growth patterns reflect well the prognosis of the submucosal carcinoma of the esophagus.
