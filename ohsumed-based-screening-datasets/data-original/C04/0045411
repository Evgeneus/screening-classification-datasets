Epilepsy and brain tumors: implications for treatment.
 Primary intraparenchymal tumors of the brain are important etiologic factors in partial or focal epilepsy.
 Indolent low-grade gliomas may be associated with a long-standing seizure disorder refractory to medical treatment.
 Surgical resection of the neoplasm and the epileptogenic area may render patients seizure-free.
 Removal of the tumor alone may also be associated with an excellent survival rate and surgical outcome.
 Conventional neurosurgical procedures are restricted in patients with tumors that are deep-seated lesions or involve functional cerebral cortex.
 Computer-assisted stereotactic surgical procedures have been developed for biopsy and resection of intra-axial brain-mass lesions.
 Stereotactic tumor resection may allow pathological determination of intracranial lesions and produce a worthwhile reduction in seizure activity in some patients with intractable partial epilepsy.
