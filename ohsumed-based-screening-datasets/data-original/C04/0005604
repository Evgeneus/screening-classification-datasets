Primary malignant melanoma in the parotid gland.
 Reports of primary malignant melanoma arising from the parotid salivary gland are extremely rare and, to date, have been sporadic.
 We report a pertinent case, and tabulate and correlate the clinical findings of the 13 cases reported thus far in the literature.
 The most common symptom is a progressively enlarging, asymptomatic, firm, and fixed mass.
 Total excision has been the established treatment of choice.
 The contribution of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy remains unclear, and it is not possible at present to predict the outcome of treatment in individual patients.
 Although rare, primary malignant melanoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis of parotid tumors.
 The clinical significance of establishing the diagnosis of primary malignant melanoma of the parotid gland is emphasized.
