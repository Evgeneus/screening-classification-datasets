Risk of recurrence after myomectomy.
 The risk of recurrence of uterine myomas was analyzed in 622 patients who underwent myomectomy between 1970 and 1984 at the First Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the University of Milan.
 The cumulative 10-year recurrence rate was 27%, and this increased steadily up to the end of the observation period.
 Differences were not observed in frequency of recurrence by age at diagnoses or by the site of the myomas at surgery.
 Patients with a single myoma tended to experience a lower rate, but this finding was not statistically significant.
 Women who gave birth to a child after myomectomy had a 10-year recurrence rate of 15%, against 30% for those who did not; this difference was statistically significant.
