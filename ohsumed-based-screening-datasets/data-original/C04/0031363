Resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder. A preliminary report of reconstruction with a new modular spacer.
 Reconstruction after resection of malignant bone tumors about the shoulder is difficult.
 Twelve patients had reconstruction using a new titanium modular spacer.
 This modular system allows the surgeon to reconstruct variable lengths of the proximal humerus.
 Although the patient has no active shoulder motion, excellent hand and elbow function is preserved.
 The spacer serves as a temporary device in the young active patient.
 A more definitive reconstructive procedure can be performed after the completion of chemotherapy and a sufficient disease-free interval.
