Cutaneous multilobated T-cell lymphoma with aggressive course.
 Cutaneous multilobated T-cell lymphoma is an uncommon variant of skin-based peripheral T-cell lymphoma typically characterized by cutaneous nodules in elderly patients and a chronic clinical course.
 We report a case of the disease that led to the patient's death within 2 years after onset.
 This disease may be associated with a more aggressive clinical course than generally recognized.
