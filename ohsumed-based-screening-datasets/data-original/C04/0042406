A new coaxial needle for pre-operative localization of breast abnormalities.
 A new coaxial needle, containing a retractable anchoring wire with a helical tip, has been developed for purposes of mammographic and sonographic localization of non-palpable suspicious breast abnormalities before surgical excision.
 The helically shaped tip provides the needle with a number of potential advantages over other currently available localization needles.
 During in vitro comparisons with other needles quantitative and qualitative evidence was obtained to suggest that the new needle can be expected to have improved anchoring capability, be deflected less by tough fibrous tissue interfaces and be more visible sonographically.
 The anchoring wire can also be retracted and repositioned.
 Preliminary clinical experience with the needle was consistent with these expectations.
