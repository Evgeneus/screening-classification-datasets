Oral cancer screening in the elderly.
 Oral cancers represent approximately 3% of all cancers diagnosed in the United States.
 Oral cancer is one-fifth as common as cancer of the breast, colon, and lung but more than twice as common as cervical cancer.
 Incidence rates for oral cancer are highest among older men.
 Epidemiologic data identify alcohol and tobacco as major risk factors associated with the disease.
 Screening for oral cancer is a simple, non-invasive procedure which can be easily incorporated into the comprehensive assessment of older patients.
 Oral cancer screening can detect early, localized lesions which are associated with an improved prognosis.
 Five-year survival rates are more than four times greater in individuals with localized lesions than those with distant metastases.
 Since older Americans visit their physician more often than their dentist, the physician's medical examination provides an excellent opportunity to screen for oral cancers.
