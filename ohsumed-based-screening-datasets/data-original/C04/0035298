Depressed adenoma of the stomach. Conceptual review and study of five cases.
 Depressed gastric adenoma is a recently featured lesion, distinguished by a depression in the gastric mucosa, with histologic changes of conventional adenomatous polyp.
 We observed five cases of depressed gastric adenoma, one of them associated with a peptic ulcer, another with a gastric stump, and yet another with an early gastric carcinoma.
 None of the cases was detected clinically by radiology or endoscopic study.
 Endoscopically, this lesion stimulates a peptic ulcer at a re-epithelialization stage or an early carcinoma of the depressed type.
 Histologically, all the cases showed dysplastic changes of varying degrees, with a relevant risk of malignancy.
 A similarity is shown to other lesions described in the gastric mucosa.
