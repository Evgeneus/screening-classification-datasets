Pheochromocytoma with electrocardiographic change mimicking angina pectoris, and cyclic change in direct arterial pressure--a case report.
 A forty-two-year-old man was admitted because of chest pain.
 Electrocardiograms at admission showed horizontal ST depression in leads, II, III, aVF, V4, V5, and V6.
 Direct blood pressure monitoring revealed cyclic change between 160/100 mmHg and 70/50 mmHg and heart rate between 80/sec and 120/sec at fifteen minute intervals.
 The plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations were elevated during the episodes of hypertension.
 Pheochromocytoma was found in the right adrenal gland.
 These cyclic changes in blood pressure and heart rate are an aid for diagnosis.
