Capillary hemangioma of the maxilla. A report of two cases in which angiography and embolization were used.
 This article presents two clinical cases of capillary hemangiomas of the maxilla.
 Such lesions are rare, as demonstrated by the review of the literature included in this article.
 The presentation, differential diagnosis, histopathology, management, and follow-up for each case are discussed.
 Our rationale for approaching these types of lesions, as well as our opinion that microembolization should be considered as a first line approach to treatment, is presented.
