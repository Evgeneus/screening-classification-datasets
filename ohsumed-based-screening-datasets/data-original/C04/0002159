Long-term results of surgical resection of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma.
 This study was undertaken to review the long-term results of multivisceral resection of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma.
 Between 1964 and 1980, 1042 patients underwent exploratory surgery for colorectal cancer.
 Of these, 58 patients (5.5%) underwent curative multivisceral resection for suspected contiguous invasion by the primary tumor.
 Follow-up was complete for all patients.
 The primary tumors were located in the rectum (38 patients), sigmoid (9 patients), left colon (6 patients), and right colon (5 patients).
 En bloc resection of other viscera included uterus, adnexa, bladder, vagina, small intestine, abdominal wall, liver, stomach, kidney, and ureter.
 The operative morbidity and mortality rates were 31% and 1.7%, respectively.
 Resection margins were free of tumor in 54 patients.
 In the four patients with tumor-positive resection margins, recurrence of disease was evident between 8 and 22 weeks after surgery (mean survival time, 8.2 months).
 Carcinomatous invasion of the resected contiguous organ was confirmed in 49 patients (84%).
 The mean survival time for patients without lymph node metastases was 100.7 months, but it was only 16.2 months (p less than 0.01) for patients with lymph node metastases.
 Actuarial 5-year disease-free survival rate for patients without lymph node metastases was 76% (36 of 47 patients).
 None of the patients (0 of 11) with lymph node metastases survived for 5 years.
 Three of 36 of the 5-year survivors experienced recurrence of disease before the seventh postoperative year; no cancer-related deaths occurred between 7 and 25 years.
 These data suggest that survival in locally advanced colorectal carcinoma is more dependent on lymph node status than on the extent of local invasion.
 Effective disease control associated with survival in the long term can be achieved by multivisceral resection.
