Vaginal and vulvar adenosis. An unsuspected side effect of CO2 laser vaporization.
 During a 15-month period, September 1984 through January 1986, 10 women who were treated in the Section of Gynecologic Oncology, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pennsylvania Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, developed vaginal or vulvar adenosis after CO2 laser vaporization.
 The indications for therapy were condylomata of the cervix, vagina and vulva refractory to conservative management in 3 patients, vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia in 3, lichen sclerosus in 1 and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with condylomata on the cervix and vagina in 3.
 All the patients underwent treatment of the vagina.
 Most underwent treatment of the cervix, and some underwent treatment of the vulva at various degrees of intensity and depth.
 During the posttreatment colposcopic follow-up examination, all the patients demonstrated lesions colposcopically consistent with adenosis of the vagina or vulva within the area treated with the CO2 laser.
 Biopsies of the lesions were performed, adenosis was confirmed histologically, and endometriosis was ruled out histologically.
 This entity has not been previously associated with CO2 laser vaporization, and its clinical significance is undetermined.
 Further follow-up is indicated.
