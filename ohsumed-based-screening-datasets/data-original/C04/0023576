Hepatocellular carcinoma: comparison of clinical features among ethnic groups in an area of low prevalence.
 We retrospectively surveyed the clinical features of 73 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma at two hospitals over a 12-yr period.
 The population was heterogeneous, with 39% representing immigrants from regions of high hepatitis B and hepatocellular carcinoma prevalence.
 The yearly incidence of cases was constant over the 12 yr.
 Patient data were analyzed by grouping into three broad categories based on origin from known high, medium, or low prevalence hepatocellular carcinoma zones.
 In this fashion, differences in clinical presentation were observed.
 Asians (N = 12) were younger, invariably presented with pain; 82% had markers of hepatitis B and did not have features of chronic liver disease.
 In contrast, Westerners (N = 45) were older by more than a decade.
 One-quarter were HBV positive and almost two-thirds were alcoholic.
 The clinical presentation of this group was more varied, over one-third presenting with features of decompensated liver disease or variceal bleeds.
 Mediterranean patients (N = 16) had features intermediary between the two other groups.
 A logistic regression model clinically separated patients with hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma from those with alcohol-related hepatocellular carcinoma, suggesting different ongoing pathogenetic influences.
