Gonadotropin-secreting pineal teratoma causing precocious puberty.
 A case of precocious puberty in a 7-year-old boy with a tumor of the pineal region is reported.
 Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were elevated in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid.
 Endocrinological evaluation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis demonstrated a normal prepubertal response.
 The tumor was resected and proved to be an immature teratoma.
 Human chorionic gonadotropin levels were markedly elevated in the tumor cyst fluid.
 Sexual precocity regressed and human chorionic gonadotropin levels in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid fell to normal after surgery, suggesting that the precocious puberty was secondary to ectopic human chorionic gonadotropin production by the pineal teratoma.
