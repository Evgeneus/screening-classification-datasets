Enhanced antitumor reactivity of tumor-sensitized T cells by interferon alfa.
 Tumor-draining lymph node cells from mice bearing the methylcholanthrene-induced MCA 106 tumors can be sensitized in vitro to acquire antitumor reactivity.
 We examined the effect of interferon alfa on the function of cells that underwent in vitro sensitization in adoptive immunotherapy.
 Interferon alfa increased the antitumor reactivity of in vitro sensitized cells in the treatment of MCA 106 pulmonary metastases.
 This effect was evident in irradiated mice, indicating that a host response to the interferon alfa was not required.
 Interferon alfa treatment increased class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression on tumor cells and increased their susceptibility to lysis by in vitro sensitized cells.
 These results suggest that interferon alfa enhancement of adoptive immunotherapy was mediated by its effect on tumor cells.
 Interferon alfa may be a useful adjunct to the adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer.
