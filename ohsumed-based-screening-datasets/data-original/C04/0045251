Update on esophageal radiology.
 This article reviews the current status of double-contrast radiography in diagnosing pharyngeal tumors and opportunistic esophagitis and the radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility disorders in patients with chest pain.
 Double-contrast pharyngography is a valuable technique for detecting pharyngeal tumors.
 These lesions may be manifested by an intraluminal mass, mucosal irregularity, or asymmetric distensibility.
 Furthermore, barium studies may demonstrate lesions involving the valleculae, tongue base, lower hypopharynx, and pharyngoesophageal segment that are difficult to visualize at endoscopy.
 Double-contrast radiography is also a valuable technique for detecting opportunistic esophagitis and for differentiating the underlying causes.
 Mucosal plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas discrete ulcers should suggest herpes esophagitis, and one or more large, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis.
 Finally, in evaluating patients with chest pain, in only a small percentage are esophageal motility disorders found to be a possible cause of their pain.
 Instead, the majority are found to have cardiac disease, structural esophageal lesions, or gastroesophageal reflux, so that barium studies are more useful in documenting normal motility or structural abnormalities in these patients.
