Pancreatic carcinoma in an elderly woman with an organic affective disorder and AIDS delusion.
 An elderly woman with symptoms of depression and an AIDS delusion was found also to have pancreatic carcinoma.
 I have discussed her case in conjunction with organic affective disorder, the evaluation of depression in the elderly, and suicide in the elderly.
