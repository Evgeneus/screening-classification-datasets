Hepatocellular carcinoma: treatment with a combination therapy of transcatheter arterial embolization and percutaneous ethanol injection.
 In an attempt to obtain complete tumor necrosis in large hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions, the authors studied the clinical and histologic findings of a new combination therapy, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) with transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) (pretreatment with TAE and subsequent PEI) in 15 patients with a single, large (3.0-9.0 cm in diameter), encapsulated lesion of HCC.
 Two weeks after TAE, PEI was performed under ultrasound guidance.
 A total of four to 11 injections were administered at a rate of one injection twice a week.
 During the follow-up period (range, 7-23 months), all lesions were reduced in size and no evidence of HCC was present at contrast material-enhanced computed tomography or angiography in nine of 11 patients who did not subsequently undergo surgery.
 Six patients had a follow-up of 1 year or more, for a 1-year survival rate of 100%.
 Four patients subsequently underwent surgical resection; complete necrosis of the tumor was observed in all four.
 The authors conclude that a combination of PEI and TAE is an appropriate treatment for patients with large, encapsulated HCC lesions who are poor surgical risks.
