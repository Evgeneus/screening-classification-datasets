Microcystic adnexal carcinoma following radiotherapy in childhood.
 A 36-year-old man was treated by radiotherapy for tinea capitis many years before discovery of microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC).
 Because of patient's refusal of any surgical intervention, we were able to follow the natural course of this tumor for 13 years.
 This case emphasizes the typical slow development of (MAC).
 The implication of the association of MAC and radiotherapy are discussed.
