Post cricoid lymphangioma.
 A 69-year-old female patient presented with symptoms characteristic of globus pharyngeus and barium swallow examination was normal.
 Her symptoms persisted and pharyngoscopy was undertaken; a post-cricoid polyp was found and removed.
 Histological examination revealed this to be a lymphangioma.
 Histological appearances, pathogenesis and treatment are discussed.
 The case illustrates that persisting symptoms presenting as globus pharyngeus should be further investigated to exclude rare lesions.
