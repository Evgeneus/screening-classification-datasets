Metastatic carcinoma to the male breast.
 A case of metastasis to the male breast from prostate carcinoma is reported.
 For proper treatment, it is important to differentiate primary from metastatic tumours.
 Prostate-specific antigen screening should be strongly considered in all breast masses seen in patients with known prostatic carcinoma.
 One cannot assume that breast enlargement in these patients is solely due to oestrogen-induced gynecomastia.
