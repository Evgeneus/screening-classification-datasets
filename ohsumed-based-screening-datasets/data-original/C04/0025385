Alcohol induction of ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line (HEP G2).
 Hyperferritinemia, an unclear mechanism, is frequently observed in chronic alcoholics.
 The aim of this work was to study the effect of alcohol on ferritin expression in a human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2.
 This cell line proved to be sensitive to alcohol, since alcohol increased gamma-GT activity both in cells and media.
 The most striking result was the increase of ferritin in cells and media by alcohol.
 Moreover, this effect was specific, since it contrasted with a decrease in total protein synthesis and secretion, a decrease in transferrin excretion and a lack of effect on orosomucoid.
 In our model, alcohol was able to induce, in a specific manner, ferritin expression.
