cis-platinum ototoxicity in children.
 Cis-platinum is an ototoxic antineoplastic drug.
 Evaluation of auditory thresholds in 33 children receiving cis-platinum shows that a threshold shift at 6 and 8 kHz is first measurable after a cumulative dose of 201 to 300 mg/m2.
 A 35- to 40-dB high-frequency threshold shift is evident after a cumulative cis-platinum dose of 301 to 400 mg/m2.
 Increasing cumulative doses of cis-platinum are associated with a greater degree of hearing loss.
 Receiver-operator characteristic curves were used to find a criterion value that effectively identified threshold shifts that were due to cis-platinum ototoxicity.
 A 15-dB or greater shift in the 6- and 8-kHz threshold average identifies a high true-positive (50%) and low false-positive (0%) rate of cis-platinum-induced hearing loss.
 Using this criterion, cis-platinum ototoxicity affected 77% of children who received cis-platinum (median cumulative dose 360 mg/m2).
