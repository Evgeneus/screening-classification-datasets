Lung lobe torsion following lobectomy.
 Three cases of postoperative pulmonary lobe torsion were reported.
 Two of three showed hemorrhagic infarctions, and as a result underwent rethoracotomies and removal of the affected lobes.
 From these experiences, we consider that computed tomography (CT) and bronchofiberscopic examinations are useful for the diagnosis of advanced torsion.
