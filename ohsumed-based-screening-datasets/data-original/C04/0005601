Thermally induced 'nicotine' stomatitis. A case report.
 A palatal lesion resembling "nicotine" stomatitis was found in a woman who did not smoke.
 However, the patient frequently drank extremely hot beverages.
 After she was instructed to reduce the temperature of the beverages, the lesion almost completely resolved.
 This suggests that heat was the primary cause of this lesion and also implicates heat as the major cause of nicotine stomatitis.
