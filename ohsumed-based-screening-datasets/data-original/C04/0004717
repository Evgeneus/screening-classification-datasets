Benign parotid tumour enucleation--a reliable operation in selected cases.
 The method of surgical treatment for benign tumours of the parotid gland had not yet been rationalized, but many authors recommend parotidectomy as the most appropriate procedure.
 A series of 289 operations for parotid swelling is reported; the majority of mixed and Warthin's tumours underwent enucleation without either complications or recurrence.
 The rationale of parotidectomy versus enucleation is discussed but in fast growing, deeply infiltrating and recurrent tumours, parotidectomy appears to be the best choice.
 In the other group of more commonly occurring tumours, enucleation represents a reliable time saving option.
