Recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma after partial hepatectomy: value of treatment with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization.
 The usefulness of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) of the hepatic artery was retrospectively evaluated in 66 patients who underwent the procedure for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma that recurred after partial hepatectomy.
 The materials infused were Gelfoam sponge or Gelfoam sponge plus Lipiodol and an anticancer agent.
 A control group of 15 patients with recurrent tumor received oral anticancer agents alone.
 The cumulative survival rate for the TACE group was 88% for the first year, 57% for 2 years, 42% for 3 years, and 27% for 5 years, whereas that of the control group was 80% for the first year, 27% for 2 years, and 18% for 3 years.
 Thus, the prognosis of the TACE group was significantly better (p less than or equal to .01, log-rank test) than that of the control group.
 The survival rate was inversely correlated with the ratio of the volume of the recurrent tumor to the volume of the whole residual liver.
 These results suggest that TACE is more effective than oral chemotherapy for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma that recurs after partial hepatectomy.
