Adenocarcinoma of the pancreas: a multimodality approach--a single surgeon's experience (1979-1988).
 A retrospective review of a single surgeon's experience with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was performed.
 One hundred-one patients were treated over a 10-year period from 1979 to 1988.
 Seven patients underwent potentially curative resections and 28 patients presented with metastatic (stage IV) disease.
 Sixty-four patients had locally advanced and unresectable primary lesions.
 A total of 51 patients received I-125 seed implantation.
 There was no statistically significant difference in morbidity (33% vs.
 30%) or mortality (6% vs.
 8%) between patients receiving I-125 implantation and those undergoing palliative surgical procedures without implantation.
 Operative mortality was highest in patients presenting with stage IV lesions (11%).
 In those patients with locally advanced and unresectable carcinomas, there was a nonsignificant increase in survival (12.8 mo vs.
 10.7 mo) in those receiving intraoperative I-125 implants when compared to those who did not when both groups received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy.
 Based on these encouraging results, it is concluded that I-125 implantation can be performed safely and shows a trend toward improving long-term survivorship in patients with locally advanced pancreatic carcinoma when used in conjunction with chemotherapy and external beam radiation.
