Carcinosarcoma of bladder following long-term cyclophosphamide therapy.
 Since the advent of long-term cyclophosphamide therapy, an association between this agent and the subsequent development of bladder neoplasms has been documented.
 Only six sarcomas have been reported, to our knowledge.
 This report describes the first case in which a leiomyosarcoma and an invasive transitional cell carcinoma (ie, carcinosarcoma) developed in a patient with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with 240 g of cyclophosphamide over a 6.5-year period.
