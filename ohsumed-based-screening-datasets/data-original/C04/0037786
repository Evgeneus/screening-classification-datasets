Primary squamous cell carcinoma of a gastric remnant.
 A 77-yr-old male developed primary gastric squamous cell carcinoma 33 yr after gastric resection for peptic ulcer disease.
 At the time of diagnosis, he was being endoscopically followed for large irregular stomal polyps.
 Infiltrating squamous cell carcinoma with focal keratinization and stomal polypoid hypertrophic gastritis was found.
 Previous reports describe adenocarcinoma and adenosquamous carcinoma in gastric remnants.
 There are various theories as to how such a tumor may arise in this setting.
