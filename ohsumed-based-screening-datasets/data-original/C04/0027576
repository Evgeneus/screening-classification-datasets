Mycosis fungoides metastatic to the orbit.
 We report a case of mycosis fungoides metastatic to the anterior orbit in an 83-year-old woman.
 The patient had a history of several years' duration of well-controlled primary mycosis fungoides with localized dermatologic T-cell lymphomas, mainly on the lower extremities.
 She developed gradual proptosis, hyperophthalmos, and vertical diplopia.
 Computed tomography demonstrated a solid, extraconal mass in the right lower anterior orbit.
 Biopsy revealed a gristly, yellowish, infiltrating mass at the level of the inferior orbital septum.
 Pathologic examination revealed anaplastic T lymphocytes with multiloculated, cerebriform nuclei that matched those of the primary mycosis fungoides skin tumors.
 Mycosis fungoides rarely spreads to the ocular and periocular structures, and this case was unique in that it presented as a pure orbital lesion with sparing of the overlying lids and adnexal structures.
