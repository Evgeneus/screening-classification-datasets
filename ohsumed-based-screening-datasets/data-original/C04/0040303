Identification of a monocyte receptor on herpesvirus-infected endothelial cells.
 The adhesion of circulating blood cells to vascular endothelium may be an initial step in atherosclerosis, inflammation, and wound healing.
 One mechanism for promoting cell-cell adhesion involves the expression of adhesion molecules on the surface of the target cell.
 Herpes simplex virus infection of endothelium induces arterial injury and has been implicated in the development of human atherosclerosis.
 We now demonstrate that HSV-infected endothelial cells express the adhesion molecule GMP140 and that this requires cell surface expression of HSV glycoprotein C and local thrombin generation.
 Monocyte adhesion to HSV-infected endothelial cells was completely inhibited by anti-GMP140 antibodies but not by antibodies to other adhesion molecules such as VCAM and ELAM-1.
 The induction of GMP140 expression on HSV-infected endothelium may be an important pathophysiological mechanism in virus-induced cell injury and inflammation.
