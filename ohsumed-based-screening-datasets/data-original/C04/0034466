Upper abdominal cancer surgery in the very elderly.
 From January 1981 to December 1987, 59 major upper abdominal operations were performed on 57 patients aged 80 to 90 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
 Procedures for primary adenocarcinoma of the stomach, distal esophagus, pancreas, or hepatobiliary system were performed with curative intent or for palliation in 34 of 59 patients (58%) and bypass with limited or no resection in 13 of 59 patients (22%) patients.
 Emergency operations were performed in six (10%) patients for gastric bleeding, perforation, or outlet obstruction.
 Six (10%) patients underwent laparotomy for benign biliary obstruction (1), splenectomy for secondary thrombocytopenia (2), or gastrectomy for sarcoma (2) or lymphoma (1).
 Hospital mortality was 15% overall and 9% for major resections, 15% for bypass, and 67% for emergency procedures.
 Major complications occurred in 10 (20%) elective procedures.
 Mortality was associated with respiratory or cardiac failure while complications most commonly included arrhythmias and wound infection.
 Mean postoperative hospitalization was 18 days overall and 45 patients (76%) were discharged home.
 Median survival following major resection was 17.5 months but less than 2 months after bypass procedures.
 A protocol of pre-operative evaluation, intra-operative hemodynamic monitoring and postoperative intensive care has been formalized for use in elderly or poor-risk patients.
