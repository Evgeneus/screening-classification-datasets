Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the terminal ileum.
 A case of squamous cell carcinoma of the terminal ileum with no underlying duplication or inflammatory disorder is described.
 The neoplasm seemed to have originated from the surface epithelium, invading the wall and metastasising to the regional lymph nodes.
 The 65 year old patient was free of disease three years after having had the tumour removed.
 Previous reports of squamous carcinoma of the small intestine have been associated with intestinal duplication or metastatic disease from distant sites.
