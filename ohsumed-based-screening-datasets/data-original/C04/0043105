Feasibility of universal screening mammography. Lessons from a community intervention.
 It is estimated that 44,500 American women will die of breast cancer in 1991.
 The breast cancer screening guidelines of the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute calling for annual mammography for all women older than 50 years have been endorsed by numerous professional groups.
 Third-party reimbursement for screening mammography is becoming more prevalent, and payment for screening mammography is now a Medicare benefit.
 Our studies, conducted as part of a National Cancer Institute grant to increase the routine use of screening mammography and clinical breast examination in women 50 to 75 years of age, have uncovered a number of significant barriers to the implementation of screening guidelines among women, primary care physicians, and providers of mammography services.
 These barriers, as well as methods to assure the quality of mammography, need to be addressed before universal screening is feasible.
