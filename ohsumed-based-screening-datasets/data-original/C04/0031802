Brain and brain tumor uptake of L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine: competition with natural L-amino acids 
 SPECT studies with L-3-[123I]iodo-alpha-methyl tyrosine (IMT) were carried out in 10 patients with different types of brain tumors--first under fasting conditions (basal) and a week later during intravenous infusion of a mixture of naturally-occurring L-amino acids (AA load).
 An uptake index (UI) was calculated by dividing tissue count rates by the integral of plasma count rates.
 The UI decreased by 45.6% +/- 15.4% (n = 10, p less than 0.001) for normal brain and by 53.2% +/- 14.1% for gliomas (n = 5, p less than 0.01) during AA load compared to basal conditions, while two meningiomas and a metastasis showed only a minor decrease (23.9 +/- 5.7%, n.s.).
 Two pituitary adenomas could not be delineated on the SPECT scans.
 These data indicate that IMT competes with naturally-occurring L-amino acids for transport into normal brain and gliomas.
 Transport characteristics of IMT into tumors of nonglial origin appear to be different from those of gliomas.
 For both types of tumors, it is advisable to perform IMT-SPECT under fasting conditions.
