Two-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of intracardiac masses in infants and children.
 We studied six infants and children with intracardiac masses of different causes.
 The diagnosis was made noninvasively using two-dimensional echocardiography in all six patients.
 In five patients, surgical excision of the mass was undertaken with good results.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic tool that allows the clinician to determine the size and location of intracardiac masses in infants and children.
