Characterization of the mononuclear cell infiltrate and HLA-Dr expression in 19 oligodendrogliomas.
 We have studied frozen tissue from 19 oligodendrogliomas with a panel of antibodies to lymphocytes and their subsets, macrophages, natural killer cells, and HLA-Dr antigens.
 Macrophages were detected in moderate numbers in 60%-100% of tumors depending on the antibody used.
 T lymphocytes were fewer in number than macrophages and were present in 62% of cases.
 Most of the T lymphocytes were of the CD8 phenotype.
 CD4 lymphocytes were very few in number and present in only 18%.
 B cells and natural killer cells were absent from all cases.
 HLA-Dr antigens were expressed by macrophages in all cases but never on tumor cells.
 The implications of these findings are that macrophages and, to a lesser extent, CD8 lymphocytes are the predominant cells infiltrating oligodendrogliomas and that they may exert cellular immune functions.
