Magnetic resonance imaging of cutaneous neoplasms: clinicopathologic correlation.
 Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been reported to be clinically useful, in selected cases, in patients with melanocytic skin lesions.
 This report describes good resolution, clinically useful MRI scans of squamous cell carcinoma, dermatofibroma, and primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma.
 The tumor depth measured by MRI was in excellent correlation with Breslow's depth measurements, indicating that MRI is probably the radiologic technique of choice for preoperative evaluation of the extent and depth of primary and recurrent skin tumors.
 This report also provides the authors' recommendations for obtaining optimal MRI images of cutaneous lesions.
