Enhanced tumor growth of both primary and established human and murine tumor cells in athymic mice after coinjection with Matrigel.
 Previously we found that the reconstituted basement membrane matrix Matrigel, when premixed with human small-cell lung carcinoma cells and injected subcutaneously into athymic mice, permitted tumor growth, whereas cells injected in the absence of Matrigel did not form tumors.
 In the present study, we examined additional cell types and determined some of the underlying mechanisms involved in the promotion of tumor formation by Matrigel.
 The tumor cell lines that we studied included transformed mouse Englebreth-Holm-Swarm tumor cells (T-EHS), human submandibular carcinoma A253 cells, mouse melanoma B16F10 cells, human epidermoid carcinoma KB cells, and human primary renal cell carcinoma cells.
 When coinjected subcutaneously with Matrigel, these cell lines formed rapidly proliferating tumors.
 Primary biopsy specimens of human colon carcinoma, when dispersed and coinjected with Matrigel, also formed tumors.
 Only A253, KB, and B16F10 cells formed small tumors in the absence of Martrigel, but a fivefold to tenfold increase in tumor size was observed in the presence of Matrigel.
 These data demonstrate a useful method for improving the growth of human tumors in athymic mice.
