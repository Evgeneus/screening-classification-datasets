Radical vulvectomy with partial rectal resection and temporary colostomy as primary therapy for selected patients with vulvar carcinoma.
 The patient with carcinoma of the vulva may present with tumor involvement of the perirectal area.
 Traditional treatment has often involved ultraradical therapy including a radical vulvectomy with posterior or total pelvic exenteration in an effort to obtain adequate surgical margins.
 Five-year survival rates for these patients range from 20-50%, and major operative morbidity as well as psychological problems are associated with this extensive surgery.
 Five patients treated for a locally advanced vulvar carcinoma involving the perirectal area were thought to be candidates for a rectum-sparing procedure.
 They underwent a radical vulvectomy, bilateral inguinal lymphadenectomy, partial rectal resection, and a diverting colostomy.
 Four of the five patients agreed to a colostomy closure 6 months after their primary therapy; these four patients have resumed normal bowel function.
 All patients remain clinically free of tumor.
