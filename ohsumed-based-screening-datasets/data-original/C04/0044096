Resectable gastric carcinoma. An evaluation of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy.
 Patients with locoregional gastric carcinoma often die because of the low rates of curative resection and frequent appearance of distant metastases (mainly peritoneal and hepatic).
 To evaluate the feasibility of preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, 25 consecutive previously untreated patients with potentially resectable locoregional gastric carcinoma received two preoperative and three postoperative courses of etoposide, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin (EFP).
 Ninety-eight courses (median, five courses; range, two to five courses) were administered.
 Six patients had major responses to EFP.
 Eighteen patients (72%) had curative resections, and three specimens (12%) contained only microscopic carcinoma.
 At a median follow-up of 25 months, the median survival of 25 patients was 15 months (range, 4 to 32+ months).
 Peritoneal carcinomatosis was the most common indication of failure.
 One patient died of postoperative complications, but there were no deaths due to chemotherapy.
 EFP-induced toxic reactions were moderate.
 Preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy for locoregional gastric carcinoma is feasible, and additional studies to develop regimens that could result in 5% to 10% complete pathologic responses may be warranted.
