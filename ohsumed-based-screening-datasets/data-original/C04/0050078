Complement activation by artificial blood substitute Fluosol: in vitro and in vivo studies.
 A perfluorocarbon blood substitute, Fluosol, is undergoing clinical trials as an adjunct to chemotherapy.
 The adverse effects associated with its administration have been postulated to result from complement activation.
 When gel electrophoresis and Western blotting of Fluosol are used after its incubation with serum, activated C3 and factors Bb and H are bound to the Fluosol particles in a time-dependent fashion, which suggests that complement activation with Fluosol, as does that with zymosan, occurs on the surface of the particles.
 Paradoxically, it is found, both by the measurement of Fluosol-bound C3d and by fluid-phase C5a, that lower concentrations of Fluosol cause greater amounts of complement activation, which suggests a complex interaction of activators and inhibitors that changes as the available surface area is decreased.
 Studies performed with bystander red cell-bound C3d demonstrated in vivo complement activation occurring in six patients receiving Fluosol as an adjunct to chemotherapy for colon cancer.
 In two patients, there was a marked increase in red cell-bound C3d after Fluosol infusion; these two patients also developed adverse reactions during Fluosol infusion.
 These studies suggest that the Fluosol surface plays a major role in the initiation and regulation of complement activation that is seen during Fluosol infusion.
