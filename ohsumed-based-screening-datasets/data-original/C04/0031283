A phase II study of idarubicin in the treatment of measurable gastric cancer.
 Idarubicin is one of the new anthracycline analogues.
 It has a higher therapeutic index than either doxorubicin or daunorubicin in a variety of murine leukemias and solid tumors.
 The authors performed a multicenter Phase II trial of idarubicin in patients with advanced gastric cancer.
 Seventeen patients with measurable metastatic disease were entered into the trial and treated with idarubicin at a starting dose of 15 mg/m2.
 This dose was escalated or reduced according to toxicity.
 There were no documented responses.
 The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression.
 These data did not compared favourably with the data on doxorubicin in the treatment of gastric carcinoma.
 A conclusion could not be reached on whether idarubicin has minimal activity in the treatment of gastric carcinoma.
