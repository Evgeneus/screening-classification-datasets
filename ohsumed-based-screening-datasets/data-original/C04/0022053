Fibrosarcoma of the head and neck. The UCLA experience.
 Between 1955 and 1987, twenty-nine patients with the diagnosis of fibrosarcoma of the head and neck were seen at the UCLA Medical Center.
 Follow-up ranged from 15 to 192 months, with a median of 66 months.
 Absolute 5-year survival was 62% (13/21).
 Five of 17 patients treated initially with surgery alone achieved local control and long-term survival.
 All five had low-grade lesions.
 Five patients received postoperative radiation therapy because of positive surgical margins.
 Three were rendered disease free, and all had low-grade lesions.
 Radiation therapy was used as primary treatment in six patients, four of whom received additional chemotherapy.
 Of these six, two are disease free with longer than 5-year follow-up.
 Surgery with and without adjuvant therapy successfully salvaged 42% (5/12) of the patients with local recurrence.
 Eighty percent (12/15) of the patients with low-grade lesions were ultimately rendered disease free vs only 8% (1/12) of the patients with high-grade histologic features.
 Seventy-two percent (13/18) of the patients with local recurrence were known to have positive surgical margins.
 Sixty-eight percent (13/19) of the patients with recurrent disease had high-grade lesions and/or tumor size larger than 5 cm.
 Tumor grade is the most important prognostic factor followed by tumor size and surgical margin status.
 Patients with low-grade lesions and adequate surgical margins are treated well with surgery alone.
 Patients with high-grade lesions or positive surgical margins should receive adjuvant treatment.
