Localization of nuclear matrix proteins (NMPs) in multiple tissue types with NM-200.4 (an antibody strongly reactive with NMPs found in breast carcinoma).
 Nuclear matrix proteins (NMP) are nonhistone proteins found in the nucleus of many eukaryotic cells.
 Furthermore certain NMPs are reported to be cell-type specific and expressed differentially by malignant cells.
 To study the specificity of NM-200.4 (an antibody reactive to NMPs extracted from cultured breast carcinoma cells of the T-47D line), cancers and benign tissues from multiple body sites were surveyed.
 All 17 breast carcinomas showed strong reactivity to tumor cell nuclei.
 Also nuclei from one of two lung carcinomas, a papillary thyroid carcinoma, an ovarian fibroma, and a lymphoma were strongly reactive.
 One leiomyosarcoma and a dermoid cyst were negative.
 Although 1 benign breast with duct hyperplasia showed moderate reactivity, only 1 of 10 benign breast biopsies without hyperplasia showed reactivity.
 Three of 4 skin biopsies, 2 liver biopsies, 6 of 9 kidney biopsies, and 5 of 10 gastrointestinal mucosal biopsies showed reactivity in benign nuclei.
 It is concluded that, although breast carcinoma nuclei showed the most consistent reactivity for NM-200.4, both benign and malignant nuclei from other body sites also show reactivity.
