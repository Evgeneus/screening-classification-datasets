Restricted V gene usage in T-cell lymphomas as detected by anti-T-cell receptor variable region reagents.
 Monoclonal antibodies reactive with variable regions of the human T-cell receptor (TCR) may be used to detect populations of T lymphocytes with restricted V gene usage.
 The authors have studied a series of 44 T-cell lymphomas with a panel of seven reagents reactive with four different TCR beta-chain variable region families.
 The authors found that, with this limited panel, restricted V gene usage of the neoplastic cells could be demonstrated in 29% of TCR-positive lymphomas.
 Whereas this is somewhat higher than expected, no preferential use of specific families could be demonstrated.
 An additional, unexpected finding was that most large cell T-cell lymphomas did not express TCR despite the presence of cytoplasmic CD3.
 The findings indicate that with a somewhat expanded panel it should be feasible to demonstrate restricted V gene usage as an indicator of clonality in a majority of T-cell lymphomas in a manner similar to the application of anti-immunoglobulin subclass antibodies in the diagnosis of clonal B cell proliferations.
