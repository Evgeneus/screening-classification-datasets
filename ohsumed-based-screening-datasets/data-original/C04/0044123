Knowledge and beliefs about cancer in a socioeconomically disadvantaged population.
 Americans living in poverty experience a higher incidence of and greater mortality from cancer than the nonpoor.
 At least 50% of the difference in mortality is believed to be due to delay in diagnosis, although risk-promoting lifestyles and behaviors also contribute to decreased survival.
 A potential exacerbating factor among the poor is inadequate information and knowledge about cancer and its treatment.
 Interviews were conducted with 128 cancer patients from a socioeconomically disadvantaged population to assess knowledge of cancer and its treatment and to evaluate care-seeking behaviors.
 Results indicated that although patients relied primarily on their physicians for information about their disease and treatment, a number of misconceptions regarding cancer existed in this population.
 Notably, nearly 50% of the patients surveyed either denied or did not know that smoking was related to the development of cancer.
 Additionally, patients frequently reported inappropriate care-seeking behaviors when asked to respond to a series of common disease-related signs or symptoms.
 These findings suggest that misinformation and misconceptions regarding cancer and its treatment among patients in this sample may contribute to inappropriate care-seeking behaviors.
