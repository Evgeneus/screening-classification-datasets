Surgical management of pulmonary metastatic leiomyosarcoma with gross endobronchial extension.
 Metastatic leiomyosarcoma occasionally is seen with gross endobronchial extension without invasion of the bronchial wall.
 These patients have major airway obstruction and partial or total atelectasis of the lung.
 Precise bronchoscopic assessment coupled with intraoperative bronchotomy allows the surgeon to determine the origin of the tumor and to save uninvolved pulmonary parenchyma.
 Our experience with 4 such patients illustrates the possibility of saving lung tissue despite total bronchial obstruction.
