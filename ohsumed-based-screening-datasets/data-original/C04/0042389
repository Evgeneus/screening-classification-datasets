VpreB gene expression in hematopoietic malignancies: a lineage- and stage-restricted marker for B-cell precursor leukemias.
 We show here that analysis of VpreB gene transcription can be a specific way to identify acute leukemias of cells at very early stages of B-cell development.
 Northern blot analysis of RNAs from 63 leukemia samples showed that VpreB RNA was present in malignancies of precursor B cells, the expression being a feature of both common acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (CD10+) and null ALL (CD10-).
 It was absent from malignancies of mature B cells (surface Ig positive), from acute leukemias of the T-cell lineage and granulocyte-macrophage lineages, and from normal tonsil B and T lymphocytes.
 Chronic myeloid leukemia blast crises of the B-precursor-cell type expressed the VpreB gene while myeloid blast crises did not.
 VpreB RNA was also expressed in the neoplastic cells of one of three patients with acute undifferentiated leukemias.
 These data show that VpreB RNA expression is a marker of the malignant forms of precursor B cells, and that it appears at least as early as cytoplasmic CD22 and CD19 in tumors of the B-cell lineage.
