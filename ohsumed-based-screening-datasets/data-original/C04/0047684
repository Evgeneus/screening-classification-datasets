Cost analysis of microsurgical reconstruction in the head and neck.
 In a cost-conscious environment, pressure exists to justify the use of expensive techniques such as reconstructive microsurgery in head and neck patients.
 Therefore, the costs and effectiveness of 39 consecutive free tissue transfers in patients with head and neck defects due to neoplasia (77%), trauma (13%), or congenital causes (10%) were assessed by reviewing clinical and billing records.
 The technical success rate was 95% with a 29% rate of complications.
 Most patients returned to preoperative levels of social activities, and none admitted dissatisfaction with their results.
 Average cost was $27,000 per case with 16 days of hospitalization.
 Average cost for aerodigestive tract tumors was $37,400 with 21 days of hospitalization.
 Costs were directly related to the etiology of the defect and incidence of complications.
 Applying cost-effectiveness principles we believe that these costs are justified by the high level of patient satisfaction and enhanced quality of life.
