Early-initiated zidovudine therapy prevents disease but not low levels of persistent retrovirus in mice.
 An F1 hybrid mouse strain containing the Rfv-3r/s genotype was inoculated with Friend virus complex (FV) and treated with zidovudine (ZDV) intraperitoneally three times daily for 20 days beginning as early as 10 min after initial viral exposure.
 This strain of mice develops FV-specific neutralizing antibodies that aid in reducing viremia and splenic virus titers but do not prevent splenomegaly and eventual FV-associated death.
 The virally exposed mice treated with ZDV did not develop splenomegaly or have detectable viremia after the last drug treatment.
 On day 21, a single animal had demonstrable virus in the spleen as determined by a focal immunoenzyme assay; 57% had detectable virus at 5 weeks, but non displayed splenic virus after 35 weeks.
 None of the animals died after the 35-week holding period, compared to 38% dying in placebo-treated mice.
 To detect low levels of the virus, or potentially latent virus, splenocytes were cocultivated with a cell line known to readily propagate FV, and the cells were subsequently passaged four times to amplify replication of the virus.
 After amplification, a significant increase was seen in the number of mice testing positive for virus.
 Thus, ZDV treatment initiated early after virus exposure was effective in preventing FV-induced splenomegaly and death, but did not prevent low levels of persistent retrovirus in the mice.
