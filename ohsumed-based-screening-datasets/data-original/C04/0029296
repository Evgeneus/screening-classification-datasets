Prolactin reduction after combined therapy for prolactin macroadenomas.
 The ability of surgery or bromocriptine to produce endocrine control of a prolactin macroadenoma decreases as the prolactin level increases.
 Guidelines for the use of multimodality therapy have not been developed for tumors associated with markedly elevated prolactin levels.
 We reviewed the records of 21 patients with prolactin levels greater than 200 ng/ml treated by transsphenoidal surgery and postoperative radiotherapy with or without a dopamine agonist.
 Values before and after treatment were available for 19 patients (13 men and 6 women).
 The mean basal prolactin level before treatment for the entire group was 2410 ng/ml.
 Surgery and radiotherapy resulted in a 90% reduction and serum prolactin levels within normal limits in 0 of 7 patients, versus the combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and dopamine agonist, which resulted in a 99.5% reduction and values within the normal range in 12 of 12 patients.
 Spontaneous physiological improvement was not often observed.
 One woman and two men were able subsequently to have children.
 A plan for these patients is discussed.
