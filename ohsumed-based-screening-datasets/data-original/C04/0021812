Supraclavicular lymph node metastases in carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction: assessment with CT, US, and US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy.
 The preoperative assessment of supraclavicular lymph node metastases was prospectively studied in 100 patients with carcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction.
 Findings at computed tomography (CT), ultrasound (US), and palpation were compared, and US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of nodes with a small axis of 5 mm or greater was performed.
 Supraclavicular metastases were detected on CT scans in 11 of 13 patients (85%) and on US scans in 14 of 16 patients (88%) but were palpable in only three of the 16 patients (19%).
 The predictive value of a supraclavicular node indicating metastases was .74 at US and .85 at CT.
 Metastases were diagnosed in 10 of 46 patients with squamous cell carcinoma (22%) and five of 50 patients (10%) with adenocarcinoma.
 Nodes with metastases had a round configuration, with a statistically significant greater short-axis to long-axis ratio than that of benign nodes (0.89 vs 0.54; P = .05).
 In four of 16 patients (25%) with supraclavicular metastases proved with cytologic examination, neither CT nor US of the mediastinum and abdomen showed enlarged nodes.
