Thoracoscopic diagnosis and treatment of chylothorax after pneumonectomy.
 Chylothorax after pneumonectomy was treated successfully by selective application of fibrin glue through a thoracoscope.
 Conservative therapy for 18 days failed to close the fistula.
 The site of leakage was identified during thoracoscopy, and fibrin glue was applied under direct vision.
 Leakage decreased immediately and eventually stopped completely.
 This technique is less invasive than standard surgical treatment and should be considered in all patients with postoperative chylothorax.
