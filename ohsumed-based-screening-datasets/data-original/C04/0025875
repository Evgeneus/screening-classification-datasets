Metastatic meningioma in the neck.
 Although meningiomas represent 15 per cent of tumours of the central nervous system, they rarely metastasize.
 A case is presented in which metastasis to a cervical lymph node occurred, together with local recurrence, nine years after initial diagnosis and treatment.
 This case serves to illustrate that malignant meningioma is a rare cause of a neck mass.
