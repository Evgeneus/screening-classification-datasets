Recurrent adnexal torsion and cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue.
 Torsion of the adnexa is rare, and diagnosis is difficult because of the sparse clinical findings.
 I describe a patient with recurrent torsion of the right adnexa, involving a cystadenoma of aberrant ovarian tissue.
 Her only symptom was recurrent right-sided pelvic pain.
