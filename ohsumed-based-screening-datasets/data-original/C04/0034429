Intracellular gastrin in human gastrointestinal tumor cells.
 Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses of the human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line MKN45G identified an intracellular peptide recognized by an anti-gastrin-17 (G17) antiserum but not by an anti-cholecystokinin-specific antiserum.
 Staining was not associated with the parental line MKN45, of which MKN45G is a clonal variant.
 The MKN45G cell line had elevated in vitro growth in serum-free medium in which the proliferation of MKN45G cells but not MKN45 cells was reduced to 58% of the control value by treatment with a rabbit anti-G17 antiserum.
 This inhibition of proliferation was reversed by preabsorbing the antiserum with excess G17.
 Disaggregated primary human gastric and colorectal tumors were screened for gastrin immunoreactivity by flow cytometry, and 6 of 28 colorectal and 8 of 22 gastric tumors had greater than 20% positively staining cells.
