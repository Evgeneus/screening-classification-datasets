Unproven methods of cancer management. Livingston-Wheeler therapy.
 Livingston-Wheeler's cancer treatment is based on the belief that cancer is caused by a bacterium she has named Progenitor cryptocides.
 Careful research using modern techniques, however, has shown that there is no such organism and that Livingston-Wheeler has apparently mistaken several different types of bacteria, both rare and common, for a unique microbe.
 In spite of diligent research to isolate a cancer-causing microorganism, none has been found.
 Similarly, Livingston-Wheeler's autologous vaccine cannot be considered an effective treatment for cancer.
 While many oncologists have expressed the hope that someday a vaccine will be developed against cancer, the cause(s) of cancer must be determined before research can be directed toward developing a vaccine.
 The rationale for other facets of the Livingston-Wheeler cancer therapy is similarly faulty.
 No evidence supports her contention that cancer results from a defective immune system, that a whole-foods diet restores immune system deficiencies, that abscisic acid slows tumor growth, or that cancer is transmitted to humans by chickens.
