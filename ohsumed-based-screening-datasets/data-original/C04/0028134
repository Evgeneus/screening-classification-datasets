Inoperable recurrence after breast-conserving surgical treatment and radiotherapy.
 Factors associated with inoperable local recurrence were investigated by a clinical and pathologic review of 596 patients with Stages I and II carcinoma of the breast treated by breast-conserving operations and megavoltage radiotherapy.
 After a median follow-up period of 71 months, 13 of 70 local recurrences observed were anatomically unsuitable for salvage surgical treatment, affecting 2.2 per cent of patients initially treated.
 In most, inoperable recurrences clinically resembled primary inflammatory carcinoma of the breast.
 All inoperable failures occurred in patients with invasive ductal carcinoma and were associated with the presence of unfavorable prognostic features (positive nodes, histologic grade 3, negative estrogen receptor, vascular invasion and lymphocytic stromal reaction).
 Despite doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, prognosis after inoperable recurrence was quite poor, although survival time in excess of two years was seen in receptor positive, lower grade recurrent tumors in which treatment included hormone therapy.
