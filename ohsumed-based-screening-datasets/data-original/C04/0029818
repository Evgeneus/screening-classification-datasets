Implications of the uptake of 131I-radiolabelled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) for the targeted radiotherapy of neuroblastoma.
 Selective uptake of radiolabelled meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) in neuroblastoma provides a possible approach to biologically targeted radiotherapy of this disease.
 A mathematical model was used to predict absorbed doses to tumours of varying size from therapeutic 131I-mIBG, based on measurements of 125I-mIBG uptake in surgically excised tumours from six patients.
 Two size categories of tumour target were considered: bulk tumour and microscopic disease.
 The predicted absorbed doses were compared with doses calculated to achieve a 50% probability of tumour cure.
 The analysis shows that the probability of tumour cure depends strongly on mIBG uptake, effective half-life of mIBG in tumour and tumour diameter.
 Small microtumours may be relatively resistant to mIBG treatment owing to the limited absorption of 131I beta-energy.
 The product of patient mass and percentage uptake per unit mass of tumour may be a useful indicator of therapeutic outcome when targeted radiotherapy is used for the treatment of paediatric tumours.
