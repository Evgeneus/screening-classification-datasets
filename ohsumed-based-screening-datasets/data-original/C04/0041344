Interval report of a phase I-II study utilizing multiple modalities in the treatment of invasive bladder cancer. A bladder-sparing trial.
 Clinicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital have used two cycles of methotrexate, cisplatin, and vinblastine (MCV) before radiotherapy and cisplatin in 53 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer.
 Eleven patients did not complete the protocol, but overall, the toxicity was not formidable.
 Of the total patients accessioned, 34 are alive.
 Of the 34 patients in the series who completed the full treatment protocol, the estimated survival rate at 54 months is 77%.
 This interim analysis suggests that the treatment is achieving at least limited success in saving lives and bladders.
