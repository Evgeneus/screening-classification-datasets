Regulation of MHC class II antigen expression. Opposing effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced HLA-DR and Ia expression depends on the maturation and differentiation stage of the cell.
 MHC class II induction by cytokines has been suggested to play a major role in the initiation and propagation of immune and autoimmune processes.
 TNF-alpha has been found both to enhance and also to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression.
 In the present studies, the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression was tested in various cell lines.
 On the basis of the data, we propose that, depending on the stage of differentiation and maturation of the cells, TNF-alpha might synergize or antagonize the affects of IFN-gamma on the regulation of MHC class II expression.
 Thus, in immature cells such as HL-60 or THP-1, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class II expression.
 However, when differentiation was induced in these cells by TPA or IFN-gamma, the additive effect of TNF-alpha on the IFN-gamma induced DR expression was eliminated.
 Furthermore, TNF-alpha down-regulates the IFN-gamma-induced class II expression in differentiated cells such as human skin fibroblasts or activated macrophages.
 In bone marrow cells induced to differentiate in vitro, TNF-alpha decreased the IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression in a maturation-dependent fashion.
 These results provide a rational explanation for the conflicting reports regarding the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced class II expression.
 But more importantly they may be relevant to the biologic function of TNF-alpha.
 Thus, we show that TNF-alpha-treated mice have reduced level of Ia expression on peritoneal macrophages and in vivo treatment with TNF-alpha antagonizes the ability of IFN-gamma to induce class II expression on these macrophages.
