Pituitary microcirculation: physiological aspects and clinical implications. A laser-Doppler flow study during transsphenoidal adenomectomy.
 The anterior and posterior pituitary lobes (AL and PL, respectively) are assumed to differ in the type of vascular supply and structure of their microvascular networks.
 Animal experiments have shown that the pituitary microvascular flow differs between the two lobes, being extremely high in the PL and low in the AL.
 For technical reasons, it has hitherto not been possible to study pituitary microflow in humans.
 Laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) is now a well-established method for real-time monitoring of microcirculation, applicable also in humans.
 In a prospective clinical study, the microflow in the AL and PL was measured during transsphenoidal microsurgery in 52 patients with adenomas of different size, growth characteristics, and endocrinological activity.
 The mean microflow in the PL (177.7 +/- 12.6 [flux]) was found to be about six times higher than that in the AL (27.4 +/- 2.7 [flux]).
 No difference in the laser-Doppler fractional volume of the lobes could be detected (0.73 +/- 0.06 [] vs.
 0.77 +/- 0.07 [], where [] designates the ratio of the alternating current output to the direct current output signals).
 Microflow within the pituitary lobes was influenced neither by the histological type nor the size of the adenoma.
 Additionally, LDF signal-averaging triggered by the electrocardiogram allowed detection of different characteristic pulsatile microvascular flow patterns in the AL and PL.
 Our findings provide strong physiological support for the idea that the angioarchitecture of the pituitary lobes differs.
 With this method, the AL and PL can be identified objectively during surgery.
 LDF might provide useful information concerning intraoperative surgical approach.
