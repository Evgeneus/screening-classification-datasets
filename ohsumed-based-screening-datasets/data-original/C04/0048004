Characterization of syngeneic rat monoclonal antibodies to the HSN tumor using syngeneic monoclonal anti-idiotopic antibodies.
 Twelve syngeneic anti-idiotopic mAb (anti-idiotypic/idiotopic antibodies Ab2)) were prepared from CBH/Cbi rats immunized with one of three monoclonal anti-HSN antibodies (Ab1) (11/160, ALN/11/53, or ALN/16/53) specific for the HSN tumor.
 The sera of the rats used for hybridoma production and all of the monoclonal Ab2 specifically inhibited the binding to HSN of the immunizing Ab1 only.
 It is concluded that, in this completely syngeneic system, only the private idiotopes associated with the antibody-combining site were immunogenic.
 Analyses using Western blotting showed that the Ab2 bound to intact Ab1 and to isolated H chains where the intra-strand disulfide bonds remained intact.
 The Ab2 did not bind to L chains or to fully reduced H chains of the Ab1.
 It is concluded that the idiotopes expressed on the H chain were conformational.
 When a panel of 13 monoclonal Ab1 (including the three used for immunization) were tested for reactivity with the Ab2, three reacted specifically with their respective Ab2 and 8 gave no binding suggesting that each Ab1 had a distinct idiotypic specificity despite the fact that all the Ab1 competed with each other for binding to Ag.
 However, the two remaining Ab1 (ALN/9/94 and ALN/12/17) generated from different tumor-bearing rats, were found to possess the same idiotypic specificity as 11/160.
 A detailed analysis using seven Ab2 raised against 11/160 showed that while the idiotype of ALN/9/94 and 11/160 were very similar, that of ALN/12/17 showed some clear differences.
 These three Ab1 have been shown previously to bind a sequential epitope on the HSN Ag in Western blots and it is postulated that the common idiotype of these Ab1 reflects their recognition of a sequential epitope.
 This may also account for the relatively frequent occurrence in tumor bearer sera of antibodies with this Id.
