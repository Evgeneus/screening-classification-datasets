Vascularized omentum graft for the reconstruction of the skull base after removal of a nasoethmoidal tumor with intracranial extension: case report.
 A 16-year-old boy with rhabdomyosarcoma occupying the nasal cavities and the ethmoid sinus with intracranial extension underwent transcranial surgery.
 The intradural tumor was resected first with the affected dura of the anterior skull base, and the dural defect was repaired with fascia harvested from the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle.
 The remaining tumor contiguous to the nasal cavities was completely extirpated.
 The cranial cavity was then exposed to the opened nasal cavities, where a revascularized omental graft was used to separate these compartments.
 Lyophilized dura was placed beforehand beneath the omental graft, as a roof to the nasal cavity, and was removed 3 weeks later through the nostril.
 A bony skull base repair was performed over the omentum using the inner table of the bone flap.
 Subcutaneous fat from the abdomen was placed on the bone graft for fixation and as an additional seal for the dural defect.
 Reconstruction of the anterior skull base with a vascularized omental transfer provides an efficient barrier to the nasal cavity.
 It also serves as an excellent supporting structure for regeneration of the mucosal epithelium of the nasal cavities.
