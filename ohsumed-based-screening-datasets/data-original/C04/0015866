Endoscopic ultrasonography in diagnosis of the extent of gallbladder carcinoma.
 Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) was performed preoperatively in 39 patients with gallbladder carcinoma.
 Diagnosis of the anatomical extent of gallbladder carcinoma was compared with histologic analysis, and staging accuracy was evaluated according to the TNM classification.
 Carcinoma considered to be at an early stage with no lymph node metastasis was correctly diagnosed in 87.5%.
 Differential diagnosis between early and advanced staged tumors was possible in 79.5%.
 Overall accuracy for depth of tumor invasion (T) was 76.9%.
 Limitations were due to many stones in the gallbladder and microinfiltration of carcinoma.
 Assessment of regional lymph node metastasis (N) was at a sensitivity of 81.8% and specificity of 92.9%, for an overall accuracy of 89.7%.
 We believe endoscopic ultrasonography is useful in the clinical staging of gallbladder carcinoma.
