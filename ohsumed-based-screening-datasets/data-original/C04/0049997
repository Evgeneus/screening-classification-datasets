A prospective study of liver function in infants and children exposed to daily isoflurane for several weeks.
 Eleven infants and children presenting for daily radiotherapy for a period of at least 2 weeks were anaesthetised with isoflurane in 33% oxygen and nitrous oxide.
 They were unpremedicated and given no other agents to supplement anaesthesia.
 The average number of exposures was 24 (SD 11; range 10-39) and the total anaesthetic time per exposure varied between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Liver function was assessed by determining serum total bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase, gamma glutamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase before the start of treatment and at 5-daily intervals thereafter.
 There was no measurable change in any of these determinants of liver function.
 All children accepted daily induction of anaesthesia with isoflurane.
 Induction, maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia were uncomplicated.
