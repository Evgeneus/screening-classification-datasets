Positive selection of candidate tumor-suppressor genes by subtractive hybridization.
 A positive selection system designed to identify and recover candidate tumor-suppressor genes is described.
 The system compares mRNA expression of genes from normal and tumor-derived human mammary epithelial cells grown in a special medium that supports similar growth rates of the two cell types.
 mRNAs uniquely expressed in normal cells are recovered as cDNAs after subtraction with mRNA from tumor cells.
 Seven different clones, from 0.6 to 4.8 kilobases in transcript size and including both rare and abundunt transcripts, were recovered in the first 23 clones analyzed.
 Among the isolated clones were genes encoding the gap-junction protein connexin 26, two different keratins, and glutathione-S-transferase pi, as well as an unknown gene in the S100 family of small calcium-binding proteins.
 In principle, tumor-suppressor genes include two classes: class I, in which loss of function results from mutation or deletion of DNA and class II, in which loss of function is from a regulatory block to expression.
 A class II suppressor gene is assumed to be regulated by a different suppressor gene that lost its function by mutation or deletion.
 Both classes of tumor-suppressor genes may provide valuable proteins with clinical applications in cancer diagnosis or therapy.
 Class II suppressors may be especially useful because the normal genes are present and their reexpression may be inducible by drugs or other treatments.
