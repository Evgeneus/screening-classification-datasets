Immediate mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates.
 Mandibular reconstruction at the time of tumor resection remains a surgical dilemma.
 Primary reconstruction allows for immediate reconstitution of mandibular form and function.
 Various methods have been attempted, but none enjoys uniform success.
 With advances in the field of microvascular surgery have come numerous options in replacing these defects.
 These procedures, however, require special surgical teams and are associated with an increase in operative time as well as morbidity at the donor site.
 An alternative method involves the use of mandibular reconstruction plates to bridge the defect between segments.
 This review focuses on 19 patients whose jaws were reconstructed in this fashion.
 Although not free of complications, mandibular plate reconstruction offers the advantages of (1) lack of donor site morbidity, (2) expediency, (3) excellent mandibular contour, and (4) the ability to reconstruct the condyle when necessary.
 The technique, results, and complications associated with this procedure are discussed.
