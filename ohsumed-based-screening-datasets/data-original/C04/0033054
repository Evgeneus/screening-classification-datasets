 The authors present a rare case in which a choroid plexus papilloma originating in the left cerebellopontine angle region metastasized and formed a space-occupying lesion in the right temporal region.
 A 46-year-old woman with choked disks presented with two separate mass lesions in the right temporal and the left cerebellopontine angle regions.
 Magnetic resonance imaging exhibited the relationship between the tumors and the surrounding structures.
 To our knowledge, no case has been reported in which a choroid plexus papilloma originating in the cerebellopontine angle region formed a space-occupying lesion in the right temporal region.
