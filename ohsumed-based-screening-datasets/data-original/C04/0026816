Oral Kaposi's sarcoma in a woman as a first indication of HIV infection.
 Although Kaposi's sarcoma has been well described in homosexual men at risk for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus, there have been fewer reports of KS in women, and most of these have been in women who became infected with HIV through intravenous drug use.
 This report describes a woman who had no history of intravenous drug use in whom intraoral KS and hairy leukoplakia were the first indication of her infection with HIV.
