Correlation between molecular and clinical events in the evolution of chronic myelocytic leukemia to blast crisis.
 A patient with typical Philadelphia chromosome (Ph1)-positive chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) was studied during sequential phases of disease: (1) initial chronic phase; (2) myeloid blast crisis; (3) second chronic phase; and (4) accelerated disease.
 A point mutation in the coding sequence of the p53 gene first appeared concomitantly with the blast crisis and then disappeared with the re-establishment of a second chronic phase.
 The chromosomal concomitant of the molecular alteration was a deletion of 17p.
 These observations suggest that abnormalities of the p53 anti-oncogene are temporally related to the clinical progression of some cases of CML and are probably responsible for the development of blast crisis in these cases.
