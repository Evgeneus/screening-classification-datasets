Perioperative chemotherapy in oral cancer.
 This is an interim report of a study of perioperative adjuvant chemotherapy following radical surgery for oral cancer, based on the hypothesis of Goldie and Coleman.
 135 patients of alveolobuccal carcinoma, clinically stage III and IV, were entered on the protocol.
 After a curative resection, they were randomized.
 The test arm received methotrexate 50 mg/m2 on the 3rd, 10th, and 17th postoperative days.
 The control arm was only observed.
 This analysis at 12 months showed a disease free survival of 71% in the test arm vs.
 45% in the control arm, which is statistically highly significant (P less than 0.01).
 Analysis of recurrence pattern showed that recurrence at the primary site was dramatically reduced during the first 6 postoperative months (P less than 0.01).
 Our study provided further clinical evidence in support of the concepts of Goldie and Coleman that the timing of chemotherapeutic drugs is very critical for a successful end result.
