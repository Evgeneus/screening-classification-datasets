Squamous carcinoma of the temporal bone: a revised staging.
 Carcinoma of the middle ear is a difficult tumour to treat.
 We present ten cases and discuss staging of these tumours.
 Our results would suggest that a revised staging system may allow better identification of patients that would benefit from surgery whilst sparing some multilating surgery that offers little to improve their quality or quantity of life.
