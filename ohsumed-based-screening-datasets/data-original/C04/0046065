Meakin adjuvant regimen in premenopausal patients with breast cancer.
 A 10-year experience using ovarian ablation and prednisolone as adjuvant therapy for premenopausal patients with breast carcinoma, emphasizing tolerability and morbidity is reported.
 Thirty patients (15 aged less than 45 years, 15 aged greater than or equal to 45 years; range 28-54 years) underwent mastectomy/lumpectomy with axillary clearance (with or without local irradiation) followed by ovarian irradiation and prednisolone therapy (2.5 mg three times daily for 5 years).
 Patients were reviewed every 3 months for the first 3 years and every 6 months thereafter.
 Follow-up was between 1.5 and 10 years (median 5 years).
 Twenty-four patients are still alive.
 Three patients stopped therapy because of side-effects.
 There was a mean(s.e.m.) weight gain of 8.46(1.69) per cent on therapy.
 Nineteen patients have been weaned off prednisolone over a period of 0.5-7.5 months (median 2 months) and the median length of time off steroids is now 3 years (range 0.5-5 years).
 This regimen appears to be associated with an acceptable level of patient tolerability and a low chronic morbidity rate and should be considered as an alternative to adjuvant systemic cytotoxic therapy.
