Efficacy and morbidity of partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy.
 In recent years, we have seen increasing use of partial laryngectomies for larger lesions that were previously treated by total laryngectomy.
 The resultant closer margins have made postoperative radiation therapy an important adjuvant treatment to conservation laryngeal surgery.
 We review the University of California, Los Angeles, experience with combination partial laryngectomy and postoperative radiation therapy between 1973 and 1987 for treatment of carcinoma of the larynx.
 Twenty-four such patients who underwent partial laryngectomies and postoperative radiation therapy are examined.
 Techniques of treatment, complications, and the functional ability of the remaining larynx are discussed.
 The locoregional control rate at 5 years was 80%.
 Risk factors associated with an increased risk of recurrence were positive margins, vascular invasion, and extranodal spread.
 There were no major problems with postoperative wound healing or airway management during the radiation treatment.
 Vocal and swallowing function were well preserved in most cases.
 We conclude that combination partial laryngectomy and radiation therapy permits preservation of laryngeal function without serious complications, and therefore is an effective treatment for selected patients with carcinoma of the larynx.
