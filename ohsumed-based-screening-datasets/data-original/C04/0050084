Positive direct antiglobulin tests in myeloma patients. Occurrence, characterization, and significance.
 Review of direct antiglobulin testing (DAT) in 88 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and five with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia revealed 26 cases with a positive DAT.
 Twenty-two of these had immunoglobulin G-M protein, three had light chain MM, and one had immunoglobulin A-MM protein.
 None of the immunoglobulin GD-MM (n = 2), nonsecretory MM (n = 5), or Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia patients (n = 5) were positive.
 None of the patients had hemolysis attributable to the adsorption of the M protein.
 The serum concentration of M protein was higher in DAT-positive patients (57.6 +/- 3.8 g/L, mean +/- SEM) than in the negative ones (35.7 +/- 6.4 g/L; probability value of the difference was less than 0.01).
 The erythrocyte eluates from DAT-positive patients contained a single immunoglobulin, of the same class as the M protein, and did not react with a panel of ABO-compatible erythrocytes.
 Addition of melphalan during incubation did not affect the results.
 The M protein of DAT-positive patients was of immunoglobulin G-3 subclass in 7 of 10 patients.
 A positive direct antiglobulin test frequently is seen in patients with multiple myeloma, the reaction is due to passive adsorption of the M protein onto the erythrocytes, is most frequently observed with immunoglobulin G3-MM, and usually does not produce hemolysis.
