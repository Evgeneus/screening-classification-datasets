Perirenal lipoma versus renal cell carcinoma.
 Pure renal and perirenal lipomas are rare.
 They arise from renal cortex, capsule, or perirenal tissue, and may be difficult to distinguish from renal adenocarcinomas.
 We report on a patient who presented with a renal mass that had the radiologic findings suggestive of a renal cell carcinoma, but proved to be a simple lipoma.
