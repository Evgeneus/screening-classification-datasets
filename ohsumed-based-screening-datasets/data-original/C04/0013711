Use of gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging for differentiating mucoceles from neoplasms in the paranasal sinuses.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether additional clinically useful information could be obtained from gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging compared with the information obtained from nonenhanced MR imaging and computed tomography (CT).
 Therefore, the authors selected 41 patients, whose results at CT examinations demonstrated a variety of pathologic conditions of the paranasal sinuses, to undergo MR imaging both with and without the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast enhancement.
 In 22 of 35 cases of neoplasms and mucoceles occurring separately, the lesions were correctly differentiated by established MR signal criteria alone.
 However, 32 of these 35 cases were accurately differentiated when gadolinium-enhanced MR images were obtained.
 Six cases demonstrated co-existing neoplasm and mucocele: Gadolinium-enhanced MR enabled correct differentiation of five of these lesions, while unenhanced MR enabled correct differentiation of three.
 On the basis of these results, the authors conclude that the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine for contrast enhancement at MR imaging is useful for differentiating mucoceles from neoplasms in the sinonasal tract.
