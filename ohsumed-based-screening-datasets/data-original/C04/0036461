Cross-resistance patterns in ACNU-resistant glioma sublines in culture.
 Three ACNU-resistant clones (R1, R3, and R12) were isolated from 9L rat glioma cells under selection pressure of ACNU in vitro.
 The authors have investigated the mechanisms of resistance and characteristics of these clones at the cellular level by studying cross-resistance patterns to chemical and physical agents.
 Although these resistant sublines showed complete cross-resistance to methyl-chloroethylnitrosourea (MCNU), no cross-resistance was observed for other alkylating agents, while each of the resistant sublines showed partial cross-resistance to structurally dissimilar toxic agents (vinblastine, Adriamycin, and VP-16).
 No difference in ACNU uptake was observed between 9L and R3 cells, and resistance patterns among alkylating agents suggested that the mechanism of ACNU resistance was specific to bifunctional nitrosoureas.
 Based on a transport study, this multidrug resistance could be explained by reduced intracellular uptake of these drugs, but there seemed little possibility that membrane P-glycoprotein, which usually is observed in typical multidrug-resistant cells, was expressed in these ACNU-resistant cells because enhanced drug efflux was not found in ACNU-resistant sublines.
 Significant collateral sensitivity to L-asparaginase indicated that ACNU might disturb the asparagine synthetic pathways by its mutagenic action.
 The increased level of total glutathione in the resistant sublines may be one mechanism of radiation or ACNU resistance.
