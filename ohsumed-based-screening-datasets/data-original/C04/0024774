A prospective, randomized evaluation of intensive-course 5-fluorouracil plus doxorubicin as surgical adjuvant chemotherapy for resected gastric cancer.
 This study evaluated combined 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and doxorubicin as postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy for patients who had undergone potentially curative resection of a primary gastric adenocarcinoma.
 One hundred twenty-five eligible and evaluable patients were stratified according to extent of surgical resection, location of the primary tumor within the stomach, and lymph node status.
 They were then randomized to either receive three cycles of chemotherapy or be observed.
 The median time from patient entry was 7 years.
 Results showed no significant difference in time to recurrence.
 The 5-year survival rate was 33% for the observation arm and 32% for the adjuvant therapy arm.
 The data excluded a 16% improvement in the 5-year survival rate for patients receiving chemotherapy with a P value less than 0.05.
 There were two drug-related fatalities due to sepsis.
 These results demonstrate no substantive benefit for this chemotherapy regimen as postoperative adjuvant treatment of resected gastric cancer.
