Subcutaneous lidocaine for treatment of neuropathic cancer pain.
 Three patients with terminal malignancy reporting ineffective analgesia using systemic and subsequently spinal opiates were treated with subcutaneous infusion of 10% lidocaine hydrochloride.
 During the infusion, reasonably stable blood concentrations were achieved and maintained using a subcutaneous infusion at varying dose rates over days to months with improvement of the pain complaints which continued to be refractory to conventional analgesics.
 Blood lidocaine levels obtained at regular intervals revealed effective concentrations between 2 and 5 micrograms/ml for each patient.
