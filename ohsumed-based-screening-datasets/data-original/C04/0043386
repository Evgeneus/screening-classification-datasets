Use of the argon-pumped tunable dye laser for port-wine stains in children.
 The authors reported previously a new technique using a low power argon-pumped tunable dye laser at a wave-length of 577nm (yellow light) to treat port-wine stains in adults.
 The authors report their results using this same technique as a form of treatment for 92 children with facial port-wine stains.
