Thermography as a predictor of prognosis in cancer of the breast.
 Although thermography is generally considered to lack sufficient sensitivity to be a useful in diagnosis of cancer of the breast, the association of a thermal abnormality with some breast cancers cannot be discounted.
 Breast cancers demonstrating such a thermographic abnormality have been reported to be associated with decreased survival when compared with patients with no such change.
 In a study of 214 patients confirmed to have breast cancer without distant metastases, 121 were found to have a thermographic abnormality.
 Patients whose tumors were thermographically abnormal had significantly larger primary lesions and a higher proportion of metastatic axillary lymph nodes.
 However, both the 5-year survival and the 5-year disease-free survival were not significantly different from patients who had no thermographic abnormality.
