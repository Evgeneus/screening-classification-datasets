Suture technique affects perianastomotic colonic crypt cell production and tumour formation.
 Suture line recurrence is an important cause of failure after potentially curative resection for colonic carcinoma.
 Our aim was to determine whether suture technique affected the incidence of perianastomotic tumours in experimentally induced colonic cancer.
 Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups.
 A 1 cm longitudinal colotomy was repaired with four interrupted 6/0 polypropylene monofilament sutures, using either a transmural technique (n = 18) or a seromuscular technique (n = 18).
 Control animals (n = 18) had a sham laparotomy.
 All animals received nine, weekly, subcutaneous injections of azoxymethane (total dose 90 mg/kg) starting 6 weeks after laparotomy.
 Surviving animals were killed 32 weeks after laparotomy.
 Five animals from each group were given intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine (100 mg/kg) 1 h before being killed.
 At death, perianastomotic tumours occurred more frequently in animals with transmural sutures than in either controls or those with seromuscular sutures.
 This difference was associated with a greater mucosal bromodeoxyuridine crypt cell labelling index in the transmural suture group.
 We conclude that a transmural anastomotic suture technique promotes the development of experimental perianastomotic colonic tumours.
