Should all patients with node-negative breast cancer receive adjuvant therapy? Identifying additional subsets of low-risk patients who are highly curable by surgery alone.
 This study, which used combined first-generation prognostic factors (tumor size, histologic differentiation, and age) on 408 patients with axillary node-negative (ANN) breast cancer treated by surgery alone without systemic adjuvant therapy between 1976 and 1987 at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, discerned four subsets of low-risk patients with a 7-year relapse rate of 6% or better.
 The first subset consisted of 48 patients (12% of the population) with tumors 1 cm or less in diameter that were well or moderately differentiated.
 These patients had a disease-free rate (DFR) of 100% (95% confidence interval [CI], 94% to 100%).
 The second subset consisted of 35 patients (9% of the population) with tumors less than or equal to 1 cm that were poorly differentiated or anaplastic.
 These patients older than 50 years of age had a DFR of 97% (95% CI, 91% to 100%).
 The third subset consisted of 36 patients (9% of the population) with tumors 1.1 to 2 cm that were well or moderately differentiated.
 These patients were older than 50 years of age and had a DFR of 94% (95% CI, 85% to 100%).
 The fourth subset consisted of 36 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ with microscopic invasion.
 These patients had a DFR of 100% (95% CI, 87% to 100%).
 Twenty-two of these patients, not in the other subsets mentioned, comprised 5% of the total population.
 These patients at low risk of recurrence, who comprise one third of the entire node-negative population, are highly curable by local therapy alone and may be spared the risks and costs of routine adjuvant systemic therapy (AST).
 Patients with tumors larger than 2 cm (152 patients; 37% of the population) are at high risk of recurrence (26% with a DFR of 74% [95% CI, 64% to 84%]) and should routinely receive systemic adjuvant therapy.
 Patients with tumors up to 2 cm who are not in the low-risk groups fall in a gray area (recurrence, 15% to 21%; DFR, 79% to 85%).
 For these groups, combining second-generation prognostic factors such as DNA ploidy, S-phase fraction, or cathepsin D should give the physician additional information to aid in making decisions regarding adjuvant therapy.
