Ca2(+)-sensitive binding of thrombospondin to U937 cells is due to the formation of calcium precipitate in the binding medium.
 Thrombospondin (TSP) binds to U937 monocytic cells in a Ca2(+)-enhancible and EDTA-inhibitable manner (Silverstein, R.

 We reproduced the results when RPMI cell culture medium, but not when HBSS was used as binding medium.
 Addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to RPMI medium increased the binding of TSP to suspended U937 cells more than eightfold; the increase was blocked by EDTA but not by heparin.
 Further studies showed that addition of 1 mM Ca2+ to RPMI medium resulted in an insoluble precipitate, which did not form when EDTA was present or when 1 mM extra Ca2+ was added to HBSS.
 TSP bound to the precipitate in a saturable and specific manner.
 The precipitate enhanced binding of TSP to MG63 osteosarcoma cells in a monolayer binding assay.
 Enhancement of binding in the monolayer assay was observed for fibronectin and vitronectin as well.
 Our data indicate that there is not a specific Ca2(+)-dependent TSP receptor on U937 cell surface.
 Instead, the extra binding enhanced by Ca2+ is due to the formation of insoluble salts in the medium.
