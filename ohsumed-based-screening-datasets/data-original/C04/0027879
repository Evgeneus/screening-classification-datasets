A case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma.
 We have recently observed a rare case of pheochromocytoma associated with meningioma.
 To determine the mechanism of such a coexistence in this particular case, we compared the constitutional and pheochromocytoma genotypes of the patient using polymorphic four DNA markers, and we found a loss of heterozygosity at the D1S7 locus.
 A loss of heterozygosity at this locus has previously been reported by Mathew et al.
 in pheochromocytoma patients, and our results were in agreement with that study.
 Therefore the allelic deletion at the D1S7 locus may be an important step in the tumorigenesis of pheochromocytoma in this case.
