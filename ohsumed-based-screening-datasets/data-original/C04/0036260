Intramedullary nailing for impending pathological subtrochanteric fractures.
 We reviewed ten patients with metastatic carcinoma and impending pathological fractures of the subtrochanteric region of the femur who had prophylactic insertion of the Russell-Taylor reconstruction nail.
 There were no operative complications or long-term mechanical failures.
 This reconstruction nail has some technical and biomechanical advantages over other implants and is ideal for the management of such cases.
