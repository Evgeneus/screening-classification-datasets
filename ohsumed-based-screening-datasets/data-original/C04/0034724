Deregulation of a homeobox gene, HOX11, by the t(10;14) in T cell leukemia.
 Molecular cloning of the t(10;14)(q24;q11) recurrent breakpoint of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia has demonstrated a transcript for the candidate gene TCL3.
 Characterization of this gene from chromosome segment 10q24 revealed it to be a new homeobox, HOX11.
 The HOX11 homeodomain is most similar to that of the murine gene Hlx and possesses a markedly glycine-rich variable region and an acidic carboxyl terminus.
 HOX11, while expressed in liver, was not detected in normal thymus or T cells.
 This lineage-restricted homeobox gene is deregulated upon translocation into the T cell receptor locus where it may act as an oncogene.
