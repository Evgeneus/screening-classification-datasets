18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose uptake into human tumor xenografts. Feasibility studies for cancer imaging with positron-emission tomography.
 The positron-emitting glucose analogue 18F-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) was evaluated for its accretion into the following subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude mice: B-cell lymphoma (Namalwa or Raji), ovarian carcinoma (HTB77), colon cancer (SW948), choriocarcinoma (BEWO), bladder cancer (UM-UC-2), renal cell carcinoma (UM-RC-3), neuroblastoma (Mey), melanoma (HTB63), and small cell lung carcinoma (NCI69).
 Two hours postinjection, tumor uptakes ranged from 0.027 (colon cancer) to 0.125% kg injected dose/g (melanoma); and was greater than 0.085 in the Namalwa lymphomas and the renal cell carcinomas.
 Tumor-blood ratios of up to 23:1 were seen 2 hours postinjection (melanoma) with a mean tumor-blood ratio for all tumors of 12.3 +/- 1.8.
 Uptake in the other tumors was intermediate.
 When evaluated, tumor uptake was slightly greater at 1 than at 2 hours postinjection, although target-background ratios were generally higher at 2 hours postinjection.
 This compound, FDG, may have broad applicability as a tracer for positron-emission tomographic imaging of many human malignancies.
