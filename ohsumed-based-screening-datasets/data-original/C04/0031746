Postoperative treatment of nonmetastatic visible residual neuroblastoma: a Pediatric Oncology Group study.
 The Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) evaluated in a prospective study the hypothesis that patients who had localized, visible residual neuroblastoma without regional lymph node involvement after surgery (POG stage B) have a favorable prognosis when treated with moderate intensive chemotherapy.
 Eligible patients were initially treated with five courses of Cytoxan (cyclophosphamide; Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Evansville, IN) and Adriamycin (doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) followed by surgery (CY/AD +/- surgery).
 Those patients not achieving a complete remission (CR) crossed over to five courses of cisplatin and teniposide (PL/VM) +/- surgery.
 Radiation therapy (XRT) was given to selected patients who still were not in CR after the crossover therapy.
 Of the 61 eligible patients, 38 (62%) patients achieved CR after CY/AD proven by clinical (31) or surgical (seven) evaluation.
 One (2%) patient in clinical partial remission (PR-C) entered CR without further therapy.
 Nineteen (31%) patients achieved CR with the following salvage therapies: surgery (five), PL/VM +/- surgery (five) followed by XRT (three) or autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) (one) and further courses of CY/AD +/- PL/VM instead of courses of PL/VM (five).
 The overall CR rate was 95% (58 of 61).
 Four patients had recurrence of the disease.
 The probability of being disease-free at 3 years after initial or salvage therapy was estimated at 84% (SE, 5%).
 The overall prognosis of children older than 1 year and younger than 1 year was similar (P = .26).
 If, however, the three remission deaths (all younger than 1 year) were censored, there was only one other failure in 32 children younger than one versus seven of 29 children older than 1 year (P = .018).
 These results confirm the excellent prognosis for patients with POG stage B neuroblastoma and indicate that most patients are curable with CY/AD +/- surgery, and those not achieving CR with this therapy are curable with alternate therapy.
