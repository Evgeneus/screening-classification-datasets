Stimulation of protein, RNA, and nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes after abdominal surgery is not affected by postoperative amino acid supply.
 The effects of abdominal surgery on protein, RNA, and de novo purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes, and modification of these changes by postoperative amino acid supply, were investigated in 24 patients undergoing cholecystectomy (n = 12) or removal of gastric cancer (n = 12).
 Mono-nuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral venous blood and incubated with radioactive tracers in vitro.
 Protein and RNA synthesis, as measured using [14C] glycine and [3H]uridine, respectively, increased postoperatively.
 Nucleotide synthesis determined by the incorporation of radioactivity from [14C] glycine into nucleotides increased simultaneously.
 The concentration of 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) estimated by the incorporation of [14C]adenine into nucleotides also increased.
 These changes were greater and of longer duration in patients with cancer operation than in those with cholecystectomy.
 In neither case were they affected by the amount of amino acid intake, or increases in energy intake.
 These results suggest that abdominal surgery stimulates protein and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis in lymphocytes.
 Increased RNA synthesis may be ensured by increased synthesis of nucleotides, and increased PRPP concentrations appear to regulate the rate of nucleotide synthesis.
 The responses are apparently dependent upon the severity of surgery, but unrelated to the amount of amino acid supplied postoperatively.
