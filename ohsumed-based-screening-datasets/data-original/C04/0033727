Rare choroidal tumour simulating a malignant melanoma.
 A 15-year-old boy had been treated for a central chorioretinitis of his right eye.
 The other eye had always been normal.
 Two years later he presented a relapse with deterioration of central visual acuity.
 All clinical tests, including fluorescein angiography, suggested an inflammatory process this time again.
 Thereafter, the patient did not show up for 6 years.
 Then he came to hospital because of strong pains in his right eye.
 Now, a blind and inflamed eye was found with a huge tumour from the optic nerve extending to the temporal periphery.
 All clinical investigations, amongst others ultrasonography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance tomography, suggested a choroidal melanoma with extrabulbar extension.
 An enucleation with partial exenteration was performed.
 A demonstration and discussion of the clinical findings and the rare and complicated histological diagnosis of a very unusual ectopic meningioma-like lesion are given.
