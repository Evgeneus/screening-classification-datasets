Cell-surface ganglioside GD2 in the immunohistochemical detection and differential diagnosis of neuroblastoma.
 The expression of the disialoganglioside GD2 was analyzed in 67 solid tumors and normal tissues from children by using the GD2-specific murine monoclonal antibody 3A7 and the indirect immunoperoxidase method.
 GD2 was expressed in all of 28 neuroblastomas and was most abundant in stroma-poor tumors.
 In differentiating stroma-rich neuroblastomas, neuroblastic clusters, neurofibrils, and most ganglion-like cells were positive, whereas Schwann's-cell stroma did not express GD2.
 In ganglioneuromas, only a few ganglion-like cells showed GD2, whereas all other structures were negative.
 Scattered foci of ganglioside GD2 also were found in some non-neuronal tumors, such as rhabdomyosarcomas and osteosarcomas, but not in lymphomas, Askin tumors, or most Wilms' tumors.
 The monoclonal antibody 3A7 is a useful aid in the immunohistochemical diagnosis of neuroblastoma.
 In addition, the intense cell surface staining of neuroblastoma cells by this reagent makes it potentially useful for detecting residual neuroblastoma in bone marrow samples and lymph node biopsies.
