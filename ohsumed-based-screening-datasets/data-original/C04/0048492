Carbon dioxide laser ablation of cutaneous metastases from malignant melanoma.
 Multiple cutaneous and superficial subcutaneous metastases from malignant melanoma in 30 patients were treated palliatively by carbon dioxide laser ablation when lesions were to numerous, too large or recurring too rapidly for multiple local excisions.
 The number of lesions per patient ranged from three to 250 (median 30).
 Patients were treated under local or general anaesthetic and as day cases or inpatients.
 After a median follow-up interval of 8 months fewer than 1 per cent of lasered metastases have recurred locally.
 Sixteen patients have developed cutaneous metastases at other sites requiring further treatment.
 Approximately 2000 lesions have been treated on 64 occasions.
 Patients reported little or no pain after the operation and required only simple dry dressings.
 Wounds were completely healed in 2-6 weeks with good cosmetic results.
 This simple and effective treatment is becoming an alternative to isolated limb perfusion.
