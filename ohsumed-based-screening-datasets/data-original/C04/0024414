Bone marrow: ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide for MR imaging.
 An ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) preparation was evaluated as a potential intravenous contrast agent for magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of bone marrow.
 One hour after administration of USPIO (40, 80, and 160 mumols of iron per kilogram body weight) in rats and rabbits, T1 and T2 relaxation times were, respectively, approximately 30%, 50%, and 65% lower than precontrast relaxation times.
 Maximum decrease in relaxation times of marrow occurred within 1-24 hours after intravenous administration; thereafter, relaxation times slowly returned to normal within 7 days.
 In vivo MR imaging of rabbits and rats confirmed that USPIO decreases signal intensity of red and yellow marrow.
 The decrease was most marked with gradient echo pulse sequences.
 An animal model of intramedullary tumor demonstrated the potential of USPIO to enable differentiation between tumor and normal red marrow.
 USPIO-enhanced MR imaging improves detection of smaller tumors and allows differentiation of tumor deposits from islands of hyperplastic or normal red marrow.
