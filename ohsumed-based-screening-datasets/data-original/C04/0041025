Angiofibromas of the postnasal space: a critical appraisal of various therapeutic modalities.
 Angiofibromas of the postnasal space are an enigma to the treating surgeon in view of their extensions around the skull base.
 The availability of modern investigative procedures has to some extent facilitated the decision making process in choosing a suitable surgical approach.
 Proper tumour staging and the earliest and widest possible exposure tailored to the needs of the specific situation together with adequate blood replacement is the key to success in minimizing the chances of the recurrence.
 The present study aims at an evaluation of the methodology adopted in 100 serial cases of angiofibromas of the postnasal space.
 After initial surgery, a further 31 procedures were needed for the management of recurrences.
