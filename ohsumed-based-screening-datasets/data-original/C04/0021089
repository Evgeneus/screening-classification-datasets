Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for advanced locoregional and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
 Seven patients with advanced locoregional or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the skin were treated with cis-daimminedichloroplatin (cisplatin) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU).
 Responses were seen in six of seven patients (three partial responses [PR] and three complete responses [CR]).
 One patient is alive and disease-free at 2 years.
 These results indicate that cisplatin and 5-FU is an effective combination regimen that should be used in future clinical trials in squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
