Ovulation induction with gonadotropins in women with polycystic ovary disease.
 Seventy-two infertile women with polycystic ovary disease (PCOD) and clomiphene citrate treatment failure underwent 220 human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment cycles for ovulation induction over a period of 19 months.
 Forty-two patients ovulated but failed to conceive on clomiphene, and the remaining 30 failed to ovulate on clomiphene.
 Monitoring of treatment consisted of serum 17 beta-estradiol (E2) levels and ultrasonic assessment of follicular growth.
 Treatment was withheld whenever the E2 levels exceeded 1,500 pg/mL and/or when more than two follicles greater than or equal to 17 mm in diameter each were encountered on ultrasonography.
 Twenty-nine patients conceived (40.2%), and 23 delivered viable infants.
 Twenty-three of the 29 pregnancies were achieved in the 42 patients who ovulated on clomiphene, while only 6 pregnancies resulted in the 32 anovulatory patients on clomiphene.
 Six patients (20.6%) aborted in the first trimester.
 Multiple pregnancies consisted of only two sets of twins (6.9%).
 There were only two cases of mild hyperstimulation (2.7%) and no severe hyperstimulation.
 Because of the low occurrence of multiple pregnancies and hyperstimulation and the reasonable success rate, all PCOD patients should be started on this protocol.
