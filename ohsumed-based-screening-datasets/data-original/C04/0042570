IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--The Netherlands.
 Guarded optimism is justified in light of the results of treatment of IIB osteosarcoma in the Netherlands.
 This is due to improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques, staging, adjuvant chemotherapy, and surgical treatment.
 Five-year survival rates have increased from 25% to 80%.
 En bloc resection is currently possible.
 This makes reconstructive procedure justified, both from an oncologic and orthopedic view.
 Many questions are still unanswered, concerning evaluation of tumor necrosis because of chemotherapy, optimal adjuvant therapy, functional evaluation of different types of reconstruction, and psychological development of the patient.
 An international gathering of data on the overall treatment of IIB osteosarcoma is advocated to find answers on the above-mentioned questions.
 A noninvasive adjustable-lengthening prosthesis is mentioned as a Dutch solution to leg-length discrepancy.
 This prosthesis can be used after limb-saving surgery in young children.
