Histopathologic study of otitis media in individuals with head and neck tumors.
 Five temporal bones, each including the eustachian tube, were obtained from five adults with advanced malignant tumors of the head and neck.
 The specimens were from the side on which the tumor had occurred.
 Otitis media had been detected clinically in two cases, and was detected histopathologically in the other three.
 We discuss the possibility that otitis media might have been caused by tumor invasion of the paratubal area, by postoperative inflammation in the nasopharynx, or by an inflammatory reaction of tubal structures to radiotherapy, or that these conditions may have coexisted.
