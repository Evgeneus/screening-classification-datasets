Pleomorphic melanoma mimicking sarcoma.
 Malignant melanoma may display a wide variety of unusual morphologic patterns that simulate unrelated neoplasms.
 The diagnostic approach to such complex and morphologically divergent lesions requires thorough and extensive scrutiny not only by routine light microscopy, but also by immunohistochemical and ultrastructural evaluation.
 We have reported the case of a patient with a mass on the heel exhibiting complex morphology that illustrates the value of such a systematic approach.
