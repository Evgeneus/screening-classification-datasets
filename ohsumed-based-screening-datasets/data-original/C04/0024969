Immune dysfunction in mice with plasmacytomas. I. Evidence that transforming growth factor-beta contributes to the altered expression of activation receptors on host B lymphocytes.
 Plasmacytoma-bearing mice (PC-mice) develop a polyclonal B cell immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by marked impairment of: a) primary antibody responses and b) proliferative responses to B cell mitogens.
 The present investigations used two-color flow cytometry to examine B lymphocytes from the spleens and lymph nodes of PC-mice and found decreased surface membrane expression of surface IgM (sIgM), transferrin receptors (TfR) and IgE FcR (CD23), increased expression of class II MHC, but normal expression of B220, Mel-14, Fc gamma RII, and Fc mu R.
 These changes were not related to the H chain class or the amount of Ig produced by the plasmacytoma.
 When cultured with IL-4, B lymphocytes from PC-mice increased their expression of sIgM and class II MHC, but not of CD23.
 Several findings implicate transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) in the mechanism that modulates receptor expression on B lymphocytes in PC-mice: a) ascites fluid from PC-mice contains large quantities of TGF-beta 1; b) supernatants of cultured spleen cells from PC mice contain up to eightfold more TGF-beta than is found with normal spleen cells; c) cloned plasmacytoma cells produce TGF-beta in vitro; and d) the abnormal phenotype of B cells from PC-mice, i.e., decreased CD23, sIgM, and TfR, and increased class II MHC, is induced on normal B cells cultured in the presence of TGF-beta 1.
 Because sIgM, TfR, class II MHC, and CD23 are molecules that play fundamental roles in the activation of normal B cells, their modulation by TGF-beta 1: a) identifies molecular mechanisms that could account for some of the known immunosuppressive properties of TGF-beta 1 and b) implicates TGF-beta in the pathogenesis of the polyclonal B cell immunodeficiency that is characteristic of plasma cell tumors.
