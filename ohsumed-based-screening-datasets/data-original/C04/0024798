Disseminated leiomyosarcoma in a child with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
 A child with disseminated leiomyosarcoma and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is reported.
 She was originally believed to have peptic ulcer disease by radiographic and endoscopic evaluation but was found subsequently to have hypergastrinemia, hypochlorhydria, and a smooth muscle tumor.
 Leiomyosarcoma in children and its evolution in AIDS are discussed.
