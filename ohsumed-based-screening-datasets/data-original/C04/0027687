Increased cisplatin tissue levels with prolonged arterial infusion in the rat.
 Prolonged arterial infusions of cisplatin (DDP) have been effective in the treatment of regionally confined malignancies.
 It is unclear whether the route or schedule of DDP administration was responsible for the observed therapeutic benefit.
 To resolve this issue, tumor and normal tissue platinum (Pt) levels were determined in rats bearing hind-limb rat mammary tumors after intravenous (IV) and intra-arterial (IA) DDP infusions of constant dose and varying lengths.
 Infusions of DDP at 6 mg/kg were conducted IA over 30 minutes, and 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours and IV over 30 minutes and 48 hours.
 After infusion, Pt concentrations in solubilized tissue homogenates were measured by flameless atomic absorption spectroscopy.
 Maximum tumor Pt levels were seen after 48-hour IA infusion (29.3 micrograms Pt/mg tissue).
 IA infusions of 24 hours or less resulted in significantly lower Pt levels.
 Maximum tumor Pt concentration after IV administration was only 0.98 micrograms/mg tissue (48-hour infusion).
 Muscle Pt levels adjacent to the tumor were highest in the IA infused extremities, but at the 48-hour interval, were 53-fold less than tumor levels.
 Tumor and adjacent muscle Pt levels were not significantly different from each other after IV administration.
 This study provides pharmacologic evidence that lengthening the duration of IA DDP infusion increases tumor levels of Pt over that of IV or rapid IA administrations.
 The benefit of prolonged IA DDP infusions is dependent upon both route and schedule of drug administration.
