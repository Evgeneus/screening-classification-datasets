Response to tumor necrosis factor in two cases of psoriasis.
 A 70-year-old woman was treated for renal cell carcinoma with recombinant human tumor necrosis factor, 450,000 U/m2 of body surface area, daily for 5 days, once a month.
 She had had psoriasis for 25 years.
 After two courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor her psoriasis resolved.
 A 40-year-old man with severe psoriasis was subsequently treated with a total of seven complete and incomplete 5-day courses of recombinant human tumor necrosis factor at doses of 50,000 to 300,000 U/m2/day.
 Significant toxicity (fever, chills, hypertension, and hypotension) was encountered.
 Partial resolution of the lesions was seen.
 Tumor necrosis factor is an active agent in psoriasis.
