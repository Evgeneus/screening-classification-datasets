Mediastinal involvement by alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma: evaluation with computerized tomography.
 We have reported a case of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with mediastinal involvement occurring in a 15-year-old boy.
 Computerized tomography revealed an anterior mediastinal mass with internal mammary nodal involvement, which had metastasized from a tumor of the abdominal wall musculature.
 When making the differential diagnosis of a mediastinal mass with concurrent distant soft tissue and muscle involvement in an adolescent, rhabdomyosarcoma should be considered.
