Cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma.
 Apart from choriocarcinoma, involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) by gynecologic malignancy is rare.
 A 10-year retrospective review at the University of Washington Medical Center (Seattle, WA) and Swedish Hospital and Medical Center Tumor Registry (Seattle, WA) identified 14 patients with cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma.
 Median age at diagnosis of cerebral metastases was 52.5 years.
 Median interval from the diagnosis of ovarian carcinoma to the diagnosis of CNS metastases was 14.5 months.
 Seven patients had received cisplatin therapy before CNS relapse.
 Seven patients underwent second-look procedures before developing CNS metastases; in three, results were negative.
 Eight patients had evidence of extraperitoneal spread to other sites at the time of CNS relapse.
 Clinical manifestations included motor weakness, seizures, headache, confusion, and speech disturbance.
 All lesions were contrast enhancing on computed tomography (CT) scans and were located in the cerebral hemispheres.
 Nine patients had single lesions, five of whom underwent surgical resection of the lesion with histologic confirmation of metastases from the primary site.
 Median survival was 2 months in patients receiving radiation therapy alone and 17 months in patients who received surgery and radiation.
 Median survival of the entire series was 3 months.
 The presence of multiple cerebral metastases or evidence of extraperitoneal spread elsewhere in the body was adversely associated with survival.
 The prognosis of patients with cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma appears poor.
 However, early diagnosis by routine CT scanning followed by surgical resection and radiation may improve overall survival in a select group of patients.
