Angiosarcoma of the face and scalp. A case report with complete spontaneous regression.
 A wide, hemorrhagic lesion occurred on the face and scalp of a 75-year-old woman who had no history of previous trauma to the region.
 Histology showed features consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma.
 Clinical and radiologic investigations failed to show any sign of internal involvement.
 The lesion completely regressed without any therapy within a few months from onset, and the patient is alive and free of disease 36 months after the first observation.
 Repeated clinicoradiologic investigations failed again to prove visceral diffusion of the tumor.
 Spontaneous regression of an angiosarcoma is an exceptional event, and only one similar case has been reported in the literature.
