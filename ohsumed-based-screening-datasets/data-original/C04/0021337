"Pinch modification" used to repair a large surgical defect on the scalp: other proposed uses.
 Dr Peng's "pinch modification" of the linear advancement flap, a reconstructive technique used to correct surgical wounds on the nose and suggested as a surgical alternative in other non-hair-bearing skin, was used successfully to correct a surgical defect of 55 mm in diameter located on the occipital area, on hair-bearing skin.
 Other possible uses for this technique are suggested.
