Access to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment.
 The American Cancer Society Hearings on Cancer and the Poor made visible to the nation the harsh realities and consequences of lack of access to health care among the poor and uninsured in America.
 Access to care is more than mere availability; it is also financial accessibility, effectiveness, acceptability, appropriateness, and comprehensiveness of care.
 The problems and consequences of lack of health care access and its impact on the cancer problem among poor Americans are explored, and ways practitioners and public advocates can improve access are suggested.
 Local communities have risen to action to make health care more accessible.
 Successful programs have done their research to document access problems; then they have taken their findings to county governments to request additional funding and to health care institutions to request institutional policy and service changes to make health care more available and accessible.
