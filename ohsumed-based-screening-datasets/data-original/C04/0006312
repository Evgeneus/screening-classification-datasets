Mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate with endobronchial metastasis.
 Endobronchial metastases can manifest clinical symptoms and x-ray findings mimicking a centrally located bronchogenic carcinoma.
 The authors recently encountered a case of endobronchial metastasis from a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the prostate that was originally diagnosed as a primary bronchogenic carcinoma.
 The correct diagnosis was made on the basis of the morphologic similarities between the primary prostatic lesion and the lung lesion and was corroborated by immunohistochemical analyses.
