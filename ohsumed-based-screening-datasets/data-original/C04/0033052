Resection of intrinsic tumors from nondominant face motor cortex using stimulation mapping: report of two cases.
 We report two right-handed patients who underwent resection of intrinsic glial tumors from the nondominant hemisphere, face motor cortex.
 Both patients underwent preoperative assessment with computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging localizing the tumor in the inferior region of the Rolandic cortex.
 With the patients under general anesthesia and without muscular paralysis, the tumor volume was determined by intraoperative ultrasound and resective surgery accomplished with the aid of cortical and subcortical stimulation mapping techniques.
 Radical resection of the tumor from the face motor cortex was achieved in both patients.
 A transient contralateral facial weakness and apraxia were noted in each patient, and this resolved within 6 to 8 weeks following surgery.
 Removal of intrinsic tumors involving the nondominant face motor cortex may be safely achieved using brain mapping techniques to localize inferior Rolandic cortex and avoid resection of the hand motor cortex and descending subcortical motor pathways.
 Permanent disability will be prevented due to the bilateral representation of face motor function at the neocortical level.
 However, due to language localization in cortical zones contiguous with the dominant hemisphere, face motor cortex, we do not recommend resection of this region.
