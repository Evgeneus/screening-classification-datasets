Central neurogenic hyperventilation in invasive laryngeal carcinoma.
 We describe a patient with central neurogenic hyperventilation secondary to extension of a laryngeal tumor into the base of the brain, resulting in extrinsic compression of the medulla.
 Such an association has not been previously described.
 Unique features which distinguish this patient from previously reported cases are emphasized.
 Possible mechanisms involved in pathogenesis, as well as types of therapy, are outlined.
