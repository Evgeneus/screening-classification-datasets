Osteosarcoma of the spermatic cord.
 Malignant tumors of the spermatic cord are rare but the vast majority of these tumors are sarcomas.
 We report on a patient with osteosarcoma arising in the spermatic cord.
 Left radical orchiectomy with high dissection of the spermatic cord was performed, and the patient remains free of recurrence 2 years postoperatively.
 We could find no previous discussion or report of this tumor.
