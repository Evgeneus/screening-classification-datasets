Expression of c-erbB-2 oncoprotein in gastric carcinoma. Immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 protein is an independent indicator of poor short-term prognosis in patients with gastric carcinoma.
 Correlations of c-erbB-2 protein expression with clinical outcomes of gastric carcinomas were studied in 189 gastric carcinomas.
 There were 23 (12.2%) carcinomas with evidence of c-erbB-2 protein in which the reaction was localized to the cell membrane.
 There was no significant association between c-erbB-2 staining and the macroscopic or histologic type of the carcinomas.
 c-erbB-2-stained tumors were more likely to be associated with serosal invasion, nodal involvement, and peritoneal metastasis, than c-erbB-2-unstained ones.
 In addition, c-erbB-2 was stained in none of early gastric carcinomas.
 The 5-year survival rates of the c-erbB-2 protein-positive and the protein-negative group were 11% and 50%, respectively.
 When the c-erbB-2 tissue status and seven clinicopathologic variables as conventional prognostic factors were entered simultaneously into the Cox regression model, serosal invasion, hepatic metastasis, peritoneal metastasis, nodal status, and c-erbB-2 tissue status emerged as independent prognostic variables.
 The results suggested that c-erbB-2 protein expression might be enhanced in advanced stages during the progression of gastric carcinoma.
 In this particular group of patients, immunoreactivity for c-erbB-2 protein is an indicator of poor short-term prognosis.
