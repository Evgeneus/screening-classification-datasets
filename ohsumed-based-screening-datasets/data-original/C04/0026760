The efficacy and tolerability of CV 205-502 (a nonergot dopaminergic drug) in macroprolactinoma patients and in prolactinoma patients intolerant to bromocriptine.
 We studied the effect of CV 205-502 in 12 patients with macroprolactinomas and 8 patients with PRL-secreting tumors, who were selected because of previous repeatedly shown intolerance to bromocriptine in even small doses.
 We also investigated serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels before and during CV 205-502 therapy.
 In 12 macroprolactinoma patients followed for 1 yr, 0.075-0.450 mg CV 205-502 lowered PRL levels by 91.2 +/- 5.4%.
 Only 3 of the patients had transient side-effects of nausea, dizziness, or fatigue.
 In eight patients with PRL-secreting tumors who were bromocriptine intolerant, CV 205-502 (0.075-0.300 mg daily) lowered PRL levels by 80.2 +/- 6.3%.
 Four of these patients showed transient side-effects (nausea, fatigue, and/or tachycardia).
 None of the patients discontinued therapy.
 There was a close correlation between pretreatment circulating PRL levels and tumor size, expressed in cubic millimeters.
 The decrease in pituitary tumor size after 52 weeks of CV 205-502 therapy (-74 +/- 6%) was also correlated with the decrease in PRL levels (P less than 0.01).
 In four patients with hypopituitarism, lowered IGF-I levels did not change during CV 205-502 therapy.
 However, in seven previously untreated patients with macroprolactinoma and normal CV 205-502 is a potent dopaminergic drug, which effectively controls PRL secretion and induces tumor shrinkage.
 At the doses used in our study, it causes only mild and transient side-effects in a minority of patients and can also be used to treat hyperprolactinemic patients who have shown intolerance to bromocriptine therapy.
