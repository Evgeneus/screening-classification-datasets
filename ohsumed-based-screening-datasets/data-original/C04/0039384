Childhood cancers--New Jersey, 1979-1985.
 In New Jersey, cancers among children aged 0-14 years account for fewer than 1% of all cancers diagnosed annually; however, childhood cancers account for the greatest number of years of potential life lost from cancer.
 This report summarizes a study by the New Jersey State Department of Health (NJSDH) that determined the incidence and death rates for the most frequent cancers among children aged 0-14 years in New Jersey during 1979-1985; these rates are compared with those for the United States for a comparable period.
