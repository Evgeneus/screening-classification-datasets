An unusual organoid tumor. Alveolar soft part sarcoma or paraganglioma?
 The histogenesis of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS) is a subject of continued debate.
 Although many recent reports suggest a muscle origin, others advocate a neuroendocrine derivation.
 A tumor in the chest wall of a 16-year-old woman was diagnosed and treated as ASPS.
 The light microscopic, electron microscopic, and immunohistochemical findings showed features of both ASPS and paraganglioma.
 In addition, this lesion was positive for antibody to glucagon, a characteristic of neither ASPS nor paraganglioma, although seen in a few gangliocytic paragangliomas.
 This case demonstrates the need for continued inquiry into the histogenesis of ASPS.
