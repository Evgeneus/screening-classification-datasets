Mitogenic effects of coagulation factor XII and factor XIIa on HepG2 cells.
 The structure of coagulation factor XII (Hageman factor), inferred from its DNA sequence, includes two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-homologous domains in its amino-terminal region.
 This suggests that factor XII may exhibit EGF-like activities.
 Reciprocal antigenic cross-reactivity between factor XII and EGF was shown by exposing purified human factor XII or mouse EGF to anti-mouse EGF or anti-human factor XII.
 Western blot analysis showed that anti-mouse EGF recognized intact factor XII at 80 kDa.
 Together, these results suggest that the EGF-homologous domains are accessible for anti-EGF binding in native factor XII.
 To determine whether factor XII has mitogenic activity, HepG2 or L cells (10(4) cells per well) were grown in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of factor XII or kaolin-activated factor XII (factor XIIa).
 Both factors XII and XIIa (6.0 micrograms/ml) enhanced cell proliferation by approximately 2-fold (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.005, respectively).
 In contrast, L cells, which are not EGF target cells, were not affected by either factor XII or factor XIIa.
 Various doses of factor XII enhanced cell proliferation, [3H]thymidine incorporation, and [3H]leucine incorporation in HepG2 cells cultured under the same conditions.
 These data indicate that factor XII, like EGF, is a mitogen for HepG2 cells and suggest a possible autocrine role in the liver.
