Danazol-induced hepatocellular adenomas. A case report and review of the literature.
 We report a case of hepatocellular adenomas in a 39-year-old woman who had been taking danazol for uterine fibroids.
 To our knowledge, this is the first case in which multiple hepatocellular adenomas were discovered after only 6 months of danazol intake.
