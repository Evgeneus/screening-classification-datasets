Ureteral stump carcinoma incidentally found at cystectomy for bladder cancer.
 We report on a sixty-five-year-old man with hematuria secondary to superficial bladder cancer.
 Because of previous urethral trauma, a complete transurethral resection of his bladder tumor could not be done.
 He, therefore, underwent cystectomy, at which time we incidentally found a transitional cell carcinoma of the left ureteral stump that had been left from a previous left nephrectomy for a World War II-related injury.
 This case underscores the importance of a thorough investigation of the complete urinary tract in a patient with hematuria or other urinary tract symptoms even if an obvious cause is found for his symptoms.
