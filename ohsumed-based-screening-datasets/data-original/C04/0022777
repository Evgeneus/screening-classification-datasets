Growth factor requirements of childhood acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia: correlation between presence of chromosomal abnormalities and ability to grow permanently in vitro.
 Cells from 10 cases of childhood acute T-lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) were cultured in the presence of recombinant human interleukins (rhIL) or colony-stimulating factors (CSF) to analyze their growth factor requirements and differentiative potential.
 Although cells from most leukemic samples displayed a short-term proliferative response to several hematopoietic growth factors, only the ones featuring chromosomal translocations could be established as permanent cell lines.
 Two cell lines could be initiated only in the presence of IL-3 (TALL-103 and TALL-106), one in granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) (TALL-101), and one in IL-2 (TALL-104); only one cell line (TALL-105) was originated in the absence of growth factors.
 The TALL-101 and TALL-103 cell lines, derived from very immature T-ALL cases, underwent growth factor-dependent phenotypic conversion (lymphoid to myeloid).
 However, the T-cell receptor rearrangement and karyotype of the original leukemic clones were retained.
 In contrast, the TALL-104, -105, and -106 cell lines which originated from more mature T-ALL cases, maintained a T-lymphoblastic phenotype regardless of the growth factors in which they were expanded.
 These data demonstrate in vitro the aggressive nature of T-ALL cases bearing chromosomal abnormalities, and indicate that the lineage commitment of the malignant clone depends on its stage of maturation in T-cell ontogeny.
