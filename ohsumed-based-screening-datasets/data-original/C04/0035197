Establishment and characterization of a human carcinoid in nude mice and effect of various agents on tumor growth.
 The authors have established a long-term tissue culture cell line (BON) derived from a metastatic human carcinoid tumor of the pancreas.
 The cells have been in continuous passage for 46 months.
 Tissue culture cells produce tumors in a dose-dependent fashion after SC inoculation of cell suspensions in athymic nude mice.
 BON tumors, grown in nude mice, are histologically identical to the original tumor; they possess gastrin and somatostatin receptors, synthesize serotonin and chromogranin A, and have a doubling time of approximately 13 days.
 The antiproliferative effects of the long-acting somatostatin analogue, SMS 201-995 (300 micrograms/kg, t.i.d.), and 2% alpha-difluoromethylornithine on BON xenografts in nude mice were examined.
 Tumor size was significantly decreased by day 14 of treatment with either agent and at all points of analysis thereafter until the animals were killed (day 33).
 In addition, tumor weight, DNA, RNA, and protein contents were significantly decreased in treated mice compared with controls.
 Establishment of this human carcinoid xenograft line, BON, provides an excellent model to study further the biological behavior of carcinoid tumors and the in vivo effect of chemotherapeutic agents on tumor growth.
