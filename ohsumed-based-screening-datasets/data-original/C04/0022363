Gestational trophoblastic disease of the fallopian tube.
 Tubal gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) was diagnosed in 16 (0.8%) of 2,100 women with GTD managed at the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center.
 Tubal partial mole, complete mole and choriocarcinoma were present in 5, 5 and 6 patients, respectively.
 Patients with tubal GTD were not clinically distinguishable from those with traditional tubal pregnancies.
 While only one patient with tubal mole developed metastases, four patients with tubal choriocarcinoma presented with metastases.
 All the patients achieved complete, sustained remission.
