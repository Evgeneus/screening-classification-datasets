Adenotin and adenotin-like proteins coexist with adenosine receptors in mammalian tissues.
 The relationship of adenotin, a low-affinity adenosine-binding protein, to adenosine receptors was examined in two human tissues and two mammalian cultured cell lines.
 An adenosine A2 receptor exists in the membranes from platelets, PC-12 cells, and JAR cells as shown by a stimulation of adenylate cyclase related to 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) or a NECA-related increase in intracellular cAMP levels.
 In contrast, binding studies with tritiated NECA revealed typical adenotin-like low-affinity binding sites on the membranes from the sources studied with agonist potencies as follows: NECA greater than 2-chloroadenosine greater than R-PIA.
 No evidence was found of coupling to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein.
 Solubilization of platelet and placental membranes and precipitation with polyethylene glycol separated adenotin or the adenotin-like protein from a second adenosine binding site in each tissue.
 The pharmacologic properties of the precipitated binding sites were compatible with an adenosine A2 receptor in platelets and an adenosine A1 receptor in placenta.
 Our observations indicate that adenotin-like proteins exist outside the placenta.
 In addition, adenotin and adenotin-like proteins coexist with the adenosine A1 or A2 receptor in a number of cells and tissues and do not couple to a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein and stimulate adenylate cyclase.
 Therefore, adenotin is pharmacologically distinct from adenosine receptors, and its function remains to be discovered.
