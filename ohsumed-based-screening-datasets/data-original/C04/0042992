Approaches to immunotherapy of cancer: characterization of lymphokines as second signals for cytotoxic T-cell generation.
 Lymphokines, the soluble molecules produced by cells of the immune system, regulate cell-cell interactions and, consequently, the functional status of the immune system.
 Altering immunoregulatory pathways with lymphokines in vivo may provide a mechanism for controlling a variety of immunologic disorders.
 Although normally produced in vivo in very small quantities, the widespread availability of recombinant lymphokines has made it possible to study the molecular signals involved in production of lymphocyte effectors with activity against tumor.
 For example, interleukin-2-based cancer immunotherapy programs have, in certain clinical situations, suggested that immunologic intervention can influence the regression of metastatic cancer.
 Ultimately the successful application of these biologic agents requires an understanding of the interaction between the immune system and tumor on a molecular level.
 To induce a given biologic effect, it is necessary both to classify the required lymphokines and to identify the relevant effector cell populations.
 This review will examine the progress made in identifying the requirements for lymphokine-induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte function.
