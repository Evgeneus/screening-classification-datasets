Flow cytometric deoxyribonucleic acid analysis in stage I renal cell carcinoma.
 Tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content was analyzed by flow cytometry in 60 consecutive patients with stage I renal cell carcinoma.
 Of 59 evaluable tumors 27 (46%) were homogeneously diploid, 1 (2%) was tetraploid and 31 (52%) were aneuploid.
 Of the 32 nondiploid tumors 25 were heterogeneous concerning ploidy.
 One of the 27 patients with diploid tumors had metastases compared to 5 of the 32 patients with nondiploid tumors (not significant).
 There was a significant difference in survival between patients with diploid and nondiploid tumors (p = 0.043).
 Neither nuclear grade, tumor cell type nor tumor size correlated with survival.
 Analysis of DNA content seems to predict survival significantly for patients with stage I renal cell carcinoma.
