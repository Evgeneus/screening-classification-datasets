Community cancer programs as strategic alliances: challenges and guidelines for action.
 This paper assesses the utility of strategic alliances as a way of expanding and improving the quality of cancer care provided in communities with limited access to major treatment centres.
 Alliances provide an organizational model for future community-based cancer programs by accommodating a growing need for interdependence among organizations and providers while permitting substantial independence and autonomy.
 Five managerial challenges to ensuring effective and efficient delivery of cancer services are identified: to secure mutually reinforcing exchanges between and within all levels of cancer care, to develop protocols and programs relevant to the unique characteristics of patients and providers, to provide treatment and cancer control services, to involve interdisciplinary teams of providers at all levels of care and to achieve quality assurance, improvement and evaluation.
 In addition, the paper includes a set of guidelines to facilitate the implementation of community cancer programs as strategic alliances: reaffirm the role of community oncologists, primary care physicians and nurses as partners in the program; define the structure and culture necessary for commitment rather than simply compliance; redefine the role of management; establish data-monitoring systems; modify reward systems; and set realistic time frames and expectations.
