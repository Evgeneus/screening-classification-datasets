Sensitive detection of clonal antigen receptor gene rearrangements for the diagnosis and monitoring of lymphoid neoplasms by a polymerase chain reaction-mediated ribonuclease protection assay.
 This report describes a novel assay involving the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and RNase protection for the rapid and sensitive detection of malignant lymphoid cells by nucleotide sequences within their individual rearranged gamma T-cell receptor (TCRG) genes.
 In this assay, clonal rearrangements are amplified from the DNA of diagnostic tumor specimens using a consensus V segment primer and a consensus J segment primer to which the promoter for T7 RNA polymerase has been appended.
 The PCR product from this amplification is transcribed into a radiolabeled RNA probe.
 Test RNA transcribed from the opposite DNA strand is synthesized by similar methods from TCRG genes of a subsequent biopsy specimen.
 The test RNA is hybridized with the probe, and mismatched nucleotide sequences in the RNA hybrids are digested by RNase A.
 Detection of fully protected probe by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography indicates the presence of malignant cells in the test specimen.
 Dilution experiments with DNA of cell lines from acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALLs) show that detection of one tumor cell among 10(5) normal bone marrow cells is usually possible.
 Residual disease was also successfully detected in several cases of ALL during clinical remission, including detection in one case at the 10(-5) level.
 The procedure described here may provide a simplified and rapid method for the sensitive diagnosis and monitoring of lymphoid malignancies.
 This procedure should be applicable to most antigen receptor genes, and unlike most comparable methods, requires neither analysis of nucleotide sequence nor synthesis of tumor-specific oligonucleotide probes or primers.
