Positive regulation of human thyrotropin receptor mRNA by thyrotropin.
 We have assessed the influence of natural and recombinant thyrotropin (TSH) on mRNA specific for the human TSH receptor (TSHR) in normal and abnormal adult human thyroid monolayer cells.
 Using physiological concentrations of TSH (less than 100 mU/L), a marked increase in the level of TSHR mRNA was observed within 12 hours and reached a greater than 1000% increase after 24 hours exposure.
 At high TSH concentrations (greater than 1000 mU/L), this increase in TSHR-specific mRNA was markedly reduced.
 However, at no time were basal TSHR mRNA levels suppressed even with 100 U/L of TSH for 48 hours.
 These observations demonstrate ligand-induced up-regulation of the human TSHR mRNA by physiologically relevant concentrations of TSH.
