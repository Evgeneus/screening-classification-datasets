Intrarectal sonography. A new technique for the assessment of rectal tumors.
 Preoperative staging of rectal tumors provides a selective therapeutic approach.
 Twenty-three patients were evaluated with prospective intrarectal sonography.
 Endosonography identified all 21 rectal lesions.
 Two patients with previous rectal carcinoma had no evidence of recurrence.
 Thirteen of 17 patients (76%) with rectal carcinoma were correctly staged by endosonography.
 A submucosal leiomyosarcoma and pararectal arachnoid cyst were correctly identified.
 Preoperative assessment of lymph node status was accurate in five of ten patients (50%).
 Results of preoperative digital rectal examination predicting rectal wall involvement correlated with pathologic findings in 11 of 15 patients (73%).
 Intrarectal sonography is an important staging technique for preoperative evaluation of rectal wall invasion and guides appropriate surgical intervention.
