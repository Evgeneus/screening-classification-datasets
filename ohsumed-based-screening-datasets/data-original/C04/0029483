Comparison of needle aspiration cytologic diagnosis with excisional biopsy tissue diagnosis of palpable tumors of the breast in a community hospital.
 Fine needle aspiration cytologic examination has not extensively been used in our hospital in the work-up evaluation of solid tumors of the breast and its reliability as a basis on which to perform definitive treatment of carcinoma of the breast was in question.
 One hundred and five aspiration cytologic specimens were obtained from palpable solid tumors of the breast just prior to excisional biopsy.
 Specimens were numbered and submitted to three different staff pathologists for diagnosis in a single blind manner.
 Results were then compared with tissue diagnosis of the same tumors.
 Of 105 specimens taken at biopsy of the breast, 28 malignant lesions were diagnosed on the final tissue report.
 Of those, ten were diagnosed as malignant (Class V), two were highly suspicious (Class IV) and six were insufficient specimens (Class O).
 Of those diagnosed as class IV and V by the results of cytologic examination, all were malignant on permanent section for a specificity of 100 per cent and a sensitivity of 36 per cent.
 The cytologic diagnoses of Classes I, II and III did not correlate with any histologic report, benign or malignant.
 Malignant growths were misdiagnosed by cytologic examination in 36 per cent and missed because of inadequate specimens in 28 per cent.
 We believe that a Class V cytologic finding is sufficient basis on which to perform definitive treatment of carcinoma of the breast provided rigid criteria are used.
 There is a learning curve associated with this diagnostic modality.
