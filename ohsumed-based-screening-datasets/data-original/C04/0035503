Positron emission tomography of pituitary macroadenomas: hormone production and effects of therapies.
 Positron emission tomography with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) was carried out in 24 patients with pituitary macroadenomas (32 studies) to assess the glucose utilization of these tumors in vivo.
 The adenoma metabolic index, which is the ratio of FDG uptake of tumor to a whole brain slice, was calculated.
 Comparisons were made between tumor uptake of FDG and hormone secretion and response to therapies.
 In each positron emission tomography study, the macroadenoma could be easily identified visually as an area of increased FDG uptake near the region of the sella.
 FDG uptakes were highest for nonfunctional adenomas, and the prolactin, growth hormone, and thyroid-stimulating hormone-producing groups displayed similar levels of glucose metabolism.
 The adenoma metabolic index for all tumors averaged 1.3, ranging from 0.3 for a thyroid-stimulating hormone adenoma to 3.5 for a nonfunctional tumor.
 Tumors did not exhibit metabolic rates that could characterize the type of hormone produced.
 Recurrent macroadenomas displayed metabolism similar to tumors not operated on, whereas irradiated adenomas showed lower glucose uptake than nonirradiated tumors.
 Drug therapy with bromocriptine or the long-acting somatostatin analogue octreotide also decreased the glucose utilization of the tumor.
 There was no correlation between the amount of hormone produced and the adenoma metabolic index when a group of tumors was analyzed.
 Patients scanned more than once, however, demonstrated changes in hormone levels that changed or did not change in parallel with tumor metabolism.
 Thus, positron emission tomography offers the potential capability for predicting and defining the growth of pituitary adenomas.
 This may be of particular value when plasma hormone assays and conventional imaging techniques prove inadequate for monitoring patient response to therapy.
