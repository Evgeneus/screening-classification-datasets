Partial, non-thrombotic, superior sagittal sinus occlusion due to occipital skull tumours.
 Two cases are described in which raised intracranial pressure occurred as a result of superior sagittal sinus (SSS) occlusion by an occipital skull tumour.
 One was a plasmacytoma, the other a metastatic deposit from a Ewing's sarcoma.
 The difficulties in diagnosis of this syndrome are illustrated together with the importance and success of appropriate treatment.
 From the literature it appears possible that these two tumours may be particularly likely to occlude the SSS and the reasons for this are discussed.
