Rhabdomyosarcoma of the ciliary body.
 Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common malignant orbital tumor of childhood.
 It has twice been reported to arise within the globe from the iris.
 In addition, teratoid medulloepithelioma, a tumor arising from the ciliary epithelium, can contain a rhabdomyoblastic component, often in combination with other heteroplastic elements.
 The authors report what may be the first recorded case of an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the ciliary body, possibly representing a one-sided differentiation of a malignant teratoid medulloepithelioma.
