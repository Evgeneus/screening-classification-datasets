Responsiveness of patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma to tamoxifen. A Gynecologic Oncology Group study of second-line therapy in 105 patients.
 One hundred five patients with Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian cancer whose disease had persisted or recurred after primary surgery and first-line chemotherapy were given tamoxifen (20 mg orally twice daily) and evaluated for response.
 Eighteen percent of the patients responded: 10% demonstrated a complete response (CR) and 8% showed a partial response (PR).
 Thirty-eight percent of the patients had short-term disease stabilization.
 CR had a median duration of 7.5 months, with the longest lasting 17 months.
 For patients with PR or stable disease, the median duration of response was 3 months (maximum duration, 9 months).
 When estrogen receptors of tumor tissue from patients demonstrating CR were evaluated, eight of nine (89%) had elevated estrogen receptor levels.
 This contrasts with patients who had stable or progressive disease as only 59% of them had measurable estrogen receptors (P = 0.16).
