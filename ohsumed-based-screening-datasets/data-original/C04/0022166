Biology of basal cell carcinoma (Part II).
 Host-tumor relationships involve several factors that can enhance or suppress neoplastic growth.
 This second part of a review of basal cell carcinoma biology examines the role that hormones, cytokines, local and systemic immunity, congenital and genetic syndromes, and environmental factors play in the development of this neoplasm.
 Theories of etiology and pathogenesis are discussed, and transplantation and cell culture techniques used to study this cancer are explored.
 Valuable second-line therapies for treatment of multiple tumors are reviewed, and important areas of present and future research are emphasized.
