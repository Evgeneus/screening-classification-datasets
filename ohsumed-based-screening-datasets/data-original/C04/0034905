Localized depigmentation after steroid injection of a ganglion cyst on the hand.
 Presented is the case of a man who had localized depigmentation after local injection of triamcinolone diacetate.
 Search of the literature indicates that this is a rare complication of such therapy.
 Localized depigmentation may have important cultural implications for dark-skinned patients.
 There is some experimental evidence that less-potent and shorter-acting steroid preparations have a lower likelihood for depigmenting side effects, and such agents may be more appropriate when injecting subcutaneous structures to prevent this complication.
