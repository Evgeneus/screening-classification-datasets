 Trigeminal neuralgia is most commonly idiopathic, although it can be associated with multiple sclerosis.
 Tumors are rare causes of trigeminal neuralgia.
 A case is presented of trigeminal neuralgia with normal neurological examination and responsive to carbamazepine, secondary to a cerebellopontine angle meningioma.
 Literature relative to neoplastic etiologies of trigeminal neuralgia is reviewed.
 The role of electrodiagnostic testing in the evaluation of trigeminal neuralgia is considered.
 A normal neurological examination and responsiveness to carbamazepine do not exclude tumor as an etiology of trigeminal neuralgia.
