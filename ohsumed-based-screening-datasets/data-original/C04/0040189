The role of radiosurgery in the management of chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the cranial base.
 Despite conventional multimodality treatment (surgery and fractionated radiation therapy), recurrence and clinical progression of cranial base chordomas and chondrosarcomas are common.
 The malignant behavior of these tumors is a result of their critical location, locally aggressive nature, and high recurrence rate.
 To explore the role of radiosurgery in the treatment of these skull base neoplasms, we assessed its use in four patients with chordoma and two with chondrosarcoma.
 In five of the patients, radiosurgery was used as adjuvant therapy for residual or recurrent tumors after surgical debulking, and in one patient with a chordoma, it was the primary treatment.
 No patient received fractionated external beam radiotherapy.
 All tumors were less than 30 mm in diameter and were treated with 20 Gy to the tumor margin.
 Skull base computed tomography and magnetic resonance images were essential to define the anatomic relationships between tumor and adjacent basal structures.
 During follow-up (mean, 22 mo; range, 8-36 mo), we found no progression of the treated tumor volume in any patient.
 Neurological deficits before treatment improved in three patients; the other three patients remained in stable neurological condition.
 Serial follow-up imaging studies demonstrated that two patients showed reduction in tumor size and four patients had no tumor growth.
 In one patient, a metastatic parietal lobe chondrosarcoma developed and was treated by microsurgery.
 Another patient showed tumor progression outside of the radiosurgical treatment volume.
 Our results attest to the value of stereotactic radiosurgery as an adjuvant or primary treatment for selected patients with chordoma or chondrosarcoma and demonstrate its potential advantages over standard fractionated irradiation.
 Analysis of the long-term clinical and imaging effects after radiosurgery is warranted.
