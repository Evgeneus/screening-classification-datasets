Recurrence and treatment of urinary bladder cancer after failure in radiotherapy.
 One hundred fifty-five patients with urinary bladder cancer who were not suitable for radical surgery were treated with full-course radiotherapy, 6600 cGy in 9 weeks, split-course.
 After the treatment recurrences were observed in 94 patients (60%), 49 (53%) were treated with transurethral surgery and intravesical cytostatics, local surgery, systemic cytostatics, or palliative radiotherapy.
 The median survivals for the patients were 33, 10, 4, and 2.4 months, respectively.
 The outcome of treatment for radiotherapy failures was related to the nature of the failure, ureteric obstruction, the recurrence rate, and the mode of treatment.
 Shrinkage of the bladder was observed in 15 patients (16%).
 The occurrence of bladder shrinkage was related to the increase in frequency of recurrences and of different types of treatments.
