The choice between surgical resection and radiation therapy for patients with cancer of the esophagus and cardia: a retrospective comparison between two treatments.
 The choice of treatment for patients with cancer of the esophagus and cardia is controversial.
 Since overall survival is poor, the most important aim of treatment should be improvement of the main complaint: the inability to eat.
 In a retrospective analysis of 265 patients, referred to the University Hospital in Leiden, The Netherlands, comparisons were made between palliative effects of surgical resection (N = 92) and irradiation (N = 128).
 Several methods of comparing surgery with irradiation are possible: (1) all surgical patients vs.
 all irradiated patients; (2) only those surgical patients who survived the operation (N = 70) vs.
 all irradiated patients (N = 128); and (3) survivors after resection (N = 70) vs.
 only those irradiated patients treated with "curative" radiation (N = 62).
 Analysis of prognostic factors showed that in both surgical and irradiated patients, the only statistically significant factor was the (dis)ability to eat.
 Criteria to be considered to make individual recommendations for either treatment are presented.
