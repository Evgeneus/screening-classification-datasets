Solid and cystic pancreatic tumors. Clinical, histochemical, and electron microscopic features in ten cases.
 Ten cases of the rare solid and cystic pancreatic tumors are presented.
 All except one occurred in young women (mean age, 25 +/- 9.2 years).
 The large neoplasms were evenly distributed across the pancreas; in one case, metastasis occurred; all other cases were free from disease after complete resection.
 Histologic hallmarks of solid and cystic neoplasms were papillary growth, large intracytoplasmic granules, and immunoreactivity with alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, phospholipase A2, and neuroendocrine markers (neuron-specific enolase [NSE], synaptophysin).
 This suggests both endocrine as well as exocrine differentiation.
