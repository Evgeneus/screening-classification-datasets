Abnormal growth patterns and adult short stature in 115 long-term survivors of childhood leukemia.
 Significant growth retardation was found in 115 survivors of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who had completed their growth.
 These children were diagnosed before 12 years of age and treated on four protocols in a single institution; all received either cranial (n = 78) or craniospinal (n = 37) prophylactic irradiation.
 Patients' heights at diagnosis were within expected ranges, but final heights were greater than or equal to 1 SD below population means in 74% of cases and greater than or equal to 2 SD in 37%.
 Effects on growth were more pronounced for children who had received craniospinal irradiation, but decrements were also significant in the cranial irradiation group, with adult heights greater than or equal to 2 SD below population norms in 32%.
 Growth retardation was significantly greater (P less than .0001) in children who had earlier disease onset.
 Growth deceleration occurred not only during chemotherapy but during a later period that followed an interval of improved growth in many cases.
 Thus, late decrements in growth may be missed in studies that do not follow patients until they have attained final heights.
 These findings indicate that abnormally short stature among survivors of ALL merits further clinical and research attention.
