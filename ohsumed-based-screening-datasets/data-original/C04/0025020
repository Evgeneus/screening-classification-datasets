Recombinant interferon beta: a phase I-II trial in children with recurrent brain tumors.
 A multicenter phase I-II trial of intravenous (IV) human recombinant interferon beta (rIFN-beta; Betaseron; Triton Bioscience Inc, Almeda, CA) was conducted in children with recurrent or progressive primary brain and spinal cord tumors.
 A total of 29 patients were enrolled: high-grade astrocytoma (12), brainstem glioma (nine), and primitive neuroectadermal tumor (three), ependymoma (two), germ cell (two), and spinal cord astrocytoma (one).
 Betaseron was given by IV infusion over 30 minutes 3 times per week (Monday-Wednesday-Friday [MWF]).
 Four dose levels were studied, and at least three patients were entered at each dose level.
 The treatment plan began with a three-step dose escalation for each patient over 6 weeks (initiation phase).
 The dose-escalation schema for the four dose levels was: 50-100-200, 100-200-400, 200-300-500, and 300-400-600 x 10(6) (M) IU/m2.
 Patients experiencing an objective response or stable disease after 6 weeks entered the maintenance phase at the final escalated dose, ie, 200, 400, 500, or 600 mlU/m2 (MWF).
 Common transient effects included chills, fever, and fatigue.
 Dose-limiting toxicities were hematologic, hepatic, and CNS.
 The maintenance maximum-tolerable dose (MTD) was 500 mlU/m2, ie, dose level 3.
 Response was assessed at completion of the initiation phase and at 2-month intervals during the maintenance phase.
 Objective partial responses were seen in patients with high-grade astrocytoma (two) and brain-stem glioma (two).
 Thus, four of 21 (19%) assessable patients had partial responses for a median of 4 months.
 Eight patients had stable disease for a median of 5+ (2 to 14+) months.
 Antineoplastic activity has been identified in children with high-grade astrocytomas and brainstem gliomas in a dose-intensive regimen.
