Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced rapid acquisition spin-echo MR imaging of the liver.
 Rapid acquisition spin-echo (RASE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows for coverage of the entire liver with highly T1-weighted SE images during a single 23-second breath-holding period.
 The RASE sequence was implemented in conjunction with rapid intravenous injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine to enable performance of dynamic contrast material-enhanced MR imaging of the liver.
 Prospective evaluation of 24 patients with 62 liver lesions 1 cm or greater in diameter was performed.
 Images obtained with RASE were devoid of respiratory-related ghost artifacts or edge blurring.
 The dynamic contrast-enhanced RASE technique resulted in contrast-to-noise and contrast-to-artifact values and time efficiency measures significantly greater (P less than .05) than those obtained with use of conventional T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences, indicating a higher likelihood for lesion detectability.
 Lesion conspicuity was maximal during or immediately following bolus administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, with lesions often becoming obscured at delayed postcontrast imaging.
