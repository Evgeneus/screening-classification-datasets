Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 
 Four cases of T-cell lymphoma occurring in the setting of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) have been reported previously.
 We describe a 46-year-old man with AIDS in whom a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with lymph node involvement developed.
 Immunohistochemical staining of the skin revealed the lymphoid infiltrate to be CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and T-cell antigen receptor alpha/beta positive.
 Co-infection with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I was not detected by polymerase chain reaction.
 Human immunodeficiency virus infection may have contributed to the development of this patient's lymphoma.
 This case represents the rare occurrence of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and AIDS.
