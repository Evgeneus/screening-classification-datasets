Dental implants placed in a patient with multiple myeloma: report of case 
 A 69-year-old male, under active treatment for multiple myeloma, fractured his left maxillary second premolar palatal abutment tooth and requested treatment because his upper partial denture no longer fit.
 Several other teeth were deemed hopeless, and construction of a maxillary complete denture presented problems.
 There are general contraindications regarding dental implant surgery in the terminally ill patient; however, in this case, the patient wished to maximize his quality of life and opted to undergo implant surgery.
 With close management, the treatment was successful.
