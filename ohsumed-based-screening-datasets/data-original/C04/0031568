Acetylcholine regulates pancreastatin secretion from the human pancreastatin-producing cell line (QGP-1N).
 Studies were made of pancreastatin (PST) secretion from a human PST-producing cell line (QGP-1N) in response to various secretagogues.
 Cells with immunoreactivity for PST were observed in monolayer cultures of QGP-1N cells.
 Carbachol stimulated PST secretion and the intracellular Ca2+ mobilization concentration dependently in the range of 10(-6)-10(-4) M.
 The PST secretion and Ca2+ mobilization induced by carbachol were inhibited by atropine.
 The calcium ionophore (A23187) stimulated PST secretion.
 However, cholecystokinin and gastrin-releasing peptide did not stimulate either PST secretion or Ca2+ mobilization.
 Secretin also did not stimulate PST secretion.
 The glucose concentration in the culture medium had no effect on PST secretion.
 These results suggest that PST secretion is mainly regulated by acetylcholine through a muscarinic receptor, and that an increase in intracellular Ca2+ plays an important role in stimulus-secretion coupling in QGP-1N cells.
