'Locked-in syndrome' for 27 years following a viral illness: clinical and pathologic findings.
 We describe a man who, after a presumed encephalitic illness, was "locked-in" for 27 years.
 His CT and autopsy findings showed atrophy of the brainstem and a cystic lesion at the base of the pons.
 He survived longer than most other patients in a similar state.
