Reconstruction of the medial half of the lower eyelid using a "switch" split-lid procedure.
 Reconstruction of the medial half of the lower eyelid has one major disadvantage: It produces a scar at right angles to the eyelid rim.
 In contrast, use of a "switch" split-lid procedure avoids this inconvenience.
 The lateral half of the lower eyelid is split in two lamellae.
 The inner layer is transferred medially, and the resulting defect is closed with a buccal graft.
 The outer layer is drawn laterally to cover the raw surface of the mucosal pedicle and graft.
 The surplus of skin over the lateral canthal area is removed.
 This procedure, which so far has been used in three patients, promises to be a useful alternative for reconstruction of the medial half, but not more, of the lower eyelid.
