Null cell adenoma of the pituitary with features of plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation.
 The case of a 35-year-old man with pituitary macroadenoma who was complaining of reduced sexual activity is presented.
 Histologic examination showed a chromophobic adenoma corresponding mainly to a null cell adenoma at the ultrastructural level.
 Focal plurihormonality and plurimorphous differentiation of adenoma cells were demonstrated by immunohistochemical and electron-microscopic studies.
 It is suggested that adenomatous null cells represent pluripotent progenitor cells capable of transforming to different hormone-producing cell types.
 The factors accounting for differentiating to various cell populations have yet to be elucidated.
