The desmoid tumor: "benign" neoplasm, not a benign disease.
 The desmoid tumor is a rare neoplasm which, because of its histopathologic appearance, has been traditionally considered to be benign.
 Despite its benign microscopic features, it has an aggressive local behavior and, if not excised adequately, has a tendency to recur locally and invade neighboring structures with significant potential for morbidity, deformity, or even death.
 Two cases of recurrent extraabdominal desmoid tumors are presented not only because they are highly representative of this disease, but also because they emphasize the need for aggressive surgical treatment.
 Also, they are unusual and challenging cases from a reconstructive standpoint.
 Based on this experience and on the most recent literature, we believe that this tumor, regardless of its microscopic features, should be addressed and treated as a malignancy.
