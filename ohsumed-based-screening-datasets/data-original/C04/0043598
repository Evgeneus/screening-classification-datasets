Results of multimodal therapy in Ewing's sarcoma: a retrospective analysis of 20 patients.
 A retrospective analysis was performed of 20 patients with Ewing's sarcoma treated by combined modality therapy, consisting of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
 Fourteen patients (70%) achieved complete remission and 5 patients (25%) were in partial remission at the end of treatment.
 One patient (5%) failed to respond to combined modality therapy.
 The overall 5 year actuarial survival was 64% and the disease free survival, 55%.
 Persistent or recurrent disease occurred in 8 patients (40%); one of them was salvaged by surgery and chemotherapy.
 Site and extent of primary lesion were prognosticators of patients' outcome.
 One patient developed radiation-related-sequelae.
 The efficacy of aggressive management consisting of wide surgery, radiotherapy and intermittent high dose chemotherapy is discussed.
