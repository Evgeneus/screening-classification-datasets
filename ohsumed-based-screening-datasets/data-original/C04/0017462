Combined gadolinium-enhanced and fat-saturation MR imaging of renal masses.
 Combined gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement and fat-saturation (FS) spin-echo (SE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging for the detection and characterization of renal masses was evaluated in 43 patients with a total of 71 lesions (28 solid masses and 43 cysts).
 SE MR sequences compared were the following: short repetition time (TR)/echo time (TE), conventional SE, short TR/TE FS SE, long TR/TE conventional SE, gadolinium-enhanced short TR/TE conventional SE, and gadolinium-enhanced short TR/TE FS SE techniques.
 MR findings were compared with findings of contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and with pathologic findings in all patients.
 The sensitivities for detection of renal masses with gadolinium-enhanced FS (71 of 71 lesions) and with gadolinium-enhanced short TR/TE conventional (65 of 71 lesions) SE sequences were significantly (P less than .01) greater than with any unenhanced (short TR/TE conventional [40 of 71 lesions], or long TR/TE [39 of 71 lesions]) SE sequence.
 Lesion characterization was also best with the gadolinium-enhanced FS SE sequence (65 of 71 lesions correctly classified).
 When combined pre- and postcontrast short TR/TE FS SE images were analyzed with both qualitative (visual) and quantitative (region-of-interest measurements) assessment, lesion characterization improved even further (70 of 71 lesions were correctly characterized).
 All lesions detected with CT were visualized with the gadolinium-enhanced FS SE MR sequence, which in addition depicted seven cysts and two small renal cell carcinomas.
 In summary, the use of gadopentetate dimeglumine, especially when combined with the FS technique, was superior to unenhanced MR imaging for detection and characterization of renal lesions.
