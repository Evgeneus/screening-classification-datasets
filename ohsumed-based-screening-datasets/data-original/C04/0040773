Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with myocardial dysfunction and acute leukemia.
 The role of amsacrine in inducing remission in patients with cardiac disease and acute leukemia was evaluated.
 There were 17 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), six with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one with biphenotypic leukemia.
 In this series of 24 patients whose disease had relapsed and who had reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, nine had a complete remission, seven with AML and two with ALL.
 In addition, four of six with newly diagnosed acute leukemia and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction also responded.
 Among nine patients who underwent endomyocardial biopsy, none had morphologic changes of sufficient degree to account for drug-induced heart failure.
 Patients with preexisting arrhythmias received amsacrine without incident if their serum potassium level was higher than 4.0 mEq/l at the time of drug administration.
 Amsacrine is safe and effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and cardiac disease.
