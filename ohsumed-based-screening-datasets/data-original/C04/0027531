Gastric emptying after gastric interposition for cancer of the esophagus or hypopharynx.
 Transhiatal esophagectomy with primary anastomosis to the stomach (gastric pull-up) is an attractive surgical alternative to colic interposition in patients with cancer of the esophagus and hypopharynx.
 However, the lack of intrinsic gastric peristalsis and complaints by patients of postprandial regurgitation prompted us to measure the effect of body posture on the rates of gastric emptying in these patients.
 The rates of solid and liquid gastric emptying were measured in 14 patients who had undergone gastric interposition for esophageal and hypopharyngeal carcinoma.
 Rates of emptying were measured in both the supine and upright position using a dual-isotope radiolabeling technique.
 In these patients, the rate of gastric emptying of both solids and liquids was significantly slower in the supine position than in the upright position.
 Emptying in supine patients was also prolonged when compared with supine normal volunteers.
 Conversely, the upright rate of solid and liquid emptying in the patients was accelerated when compared with published values for upright normal volunteers.
 We conclude that gastric emptying after gastric interposition is dependent on upright posture after meals.
