Natural history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia.
 The natural history of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) was studied in 23 patients followed for at least 3 years with no treatment.
 The mean age of the patients was 41 years of age.
 A large proportion of the VAIN lesions (50%) were multifocal, and approximately one half of the lesions were associated with concomitant cervical or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia.
 Progression to invasive vaginal carcinoma occurred in two (9%) cases, persistence of VAIN occurred in three (13%) cases, and regression of VAIN occurred in 18 (78%) cases.
 The risk for progression to invasive carcinoma emphasizes the significance of colposcopic examination of the vagina with directed biopsy specimens obtained from all lesions.
