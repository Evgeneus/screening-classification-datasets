Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis testis.
 Malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis is an extremely rare tumor.
 Appropriate treatment consists of inquinal orchiectomy with close followup.
 Treatment of locally recurrent malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis has not been standardized.
 We recommend radical resection for the initial presentation of locally recurrent disease rather than saving surgical resection as salvage therapy after other treatment modalities have failed.
 We report case 37 of malignant mesothelioma of the tunica vaginalis and review the literature.
