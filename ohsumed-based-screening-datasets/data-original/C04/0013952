Acute myeloid leukemia and background radiation in an expanded case-referent study.
 A case-referent study that investigated possible associations between environmental and occupational exposures and acute myeloid leukemia was performed on 86 cases and 172 referents, all of whom were living.
 Exposure information was obtained through a questionnaire mailed to each subject.
 An association was found between time spent in concrete buildings at home and work and leukemia morbidity.
 In addition, extensive x-ray examinations that occurred more than 5 y prior to diagnosis were more common among cases than referents.
