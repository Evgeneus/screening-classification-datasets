Possible etiologic heterogeneity of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia. A correlation of pathologic characteristics with human papillomavirus detection by in situ hybridization and polymerase chain reaction.
 A correlated histopathologic and molecular virologic study of 30 cases of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 (VIN 3) and six associated invasive vulvar carcinomas was performed.
 Paraffin sections were examined for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 by in situ hybridization for viral transcripts and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of HPV and of the beta-globin gene.
 Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 was histologically subclassified into warty (bowenoid) (20 cases) and basaloid (undifferentiated) (ten cases) types.
 Warty VIN characteristically was composed of squamous cells displaying abnormal proliferation and maturation and an undulating or spiked surface creating a "condylomatous" appearance whereas basaloid VIN had a smooth surface and was composed of undifferentiated basaloid cells resembling carcinoma in situ of the cervix.
 Human papillomavirus-16 was the only type detected in 16 of 30 VIN 3 and in five of six invasive carcinomas.
 The HPV-positive women were younger than HPV-negative women (mean age at diagnosis, 49 versus 60 years), their lesions more frequently demonstrated koilocytotic atypia (94% versus 43%), and they were more likely to have warty compared with basaloid VIN lesions (65% versus 30%).
 These findings suggest that there are at least two different types of VIN which have differing clinical, pathologic, and viral profiles.
