Assessment of value of routine bone scans in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.
 The value of routine bone scans as a staging procedure was assessed in patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer.
 Records from 277 patients were reviewed retrospectively to determine the serum acid and alkaline phosphatases, the presence or absence of bone pain, and the results of bone scans and other radiographic studies at the time of initial diagnosis.
 We determined the sensitivity and specificity of an abnormal acid phosphatase, an abnormal alkaline phosphatase, and the presence of bone pain used in combination for assessing bone metastases.
 If at least one of these three parameters was present, the sensitivity was 97 percent, whereas if all three tests were normal, the specificity was 78 percent.
 The negative predictive value for all three tests combined is 99 percent.
 These results suggest that a routine bone scan to stage patients with newly diagnosed prostate cancer who have no bone pain and normal acid and alkaline phosphatases may not be warranted in all cases.
