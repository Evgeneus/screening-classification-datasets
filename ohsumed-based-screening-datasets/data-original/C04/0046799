Stomal recurrence after laryngectomy: interrelated risk factor study.
 This study was designed to identify pathogenic factors in recurrent carcinoma at the tracheal stoma.
 The charts of 444 patients with laryngeal cancer who were treated surgically between 1976 and 1988 revealed stomal recurrence in 15 (3.4%).
 Eighty percent of the patients with stomal recurrence had tumors in the subglottis.
 In comparison to patients with different sites involved this was significant (p less than 0.001).
 Other variables examined and analyzed included primary stage, previous treatment, neck pathologic status, neck treatment, age, sex, postoperative adjunctive therapy, and timing of tracheotomy.
 Tumor involvement of the subglottis is the single most important variable in stomal recurrence of carcinoma.
 Previous conservation laryngeal surgery and preoperative/emergency tracheotomy are not related to stomal recurrence of carcinoma.
 Mean length of survival for patients with stomal recurrence of carcinoma in our series was 8.9 months.
 Two patients were successfully treated with extensive surgical resection.
 The dismal prognosis of stomal recurrence of carcinoma suggests that management of this condition should focus on prevention.
 Treatment of patients with tumors of the subglottis should include attention to the paratracheal region and superior mediastinum, in conjunction with laryngectomy immediately after initial diagnosis.
