Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus after total gastrectomy 
 A 64-yr-old Japanese male who underwent a partial gastrectomy for a duodenal ulcer at the age of 21, a total resection of the remnant stomach for a stomal ulcer at age 25, and in whom Barrett's esophagus was diagnosed at age 47, was found to have a tumor at the distal esophagus and was operated on by thoracic esophagectomy.
 The tumor was a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading down to the muscularis propria.
 The entire esophageal mucosa in the resected specimen was lined by columnar epithelium.
 This tumor was thought to derive from the Barrett's esophageal epithelium.
