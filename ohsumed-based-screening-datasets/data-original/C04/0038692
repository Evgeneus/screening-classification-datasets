Epidural analgesia in Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome. Effects on respiratory function.
 The anaesthetic management of a patient with Eaton-Lambert myasthenic syndrome undergoing thoracotomy is described.
 Epidural anaesthesia, in combination with a light level of general anaesthesia, provided good operating conditions and postoperative analgesia.
 Pulmonary function and ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide and hypoxia were measured before operation.
 These tests were repeated after the epidural administration of 8 ml 2% lignocaine before surgery and after 2 mg morphine sulphate in 10 ml saline postoperatively.
 Minor reductions in some of the ventilatory parameters were observed.
 The epidural technique appears to be a useful and safe method by which to manage patients with Eaton-Lambert syndrome undergoing thoracotomy.
