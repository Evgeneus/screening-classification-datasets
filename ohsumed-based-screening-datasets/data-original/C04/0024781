13-cis-retinoic acid induces cellular differentiation and durable remission in refractory cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma.
 A 35-year-old man with refractory cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma was salvaged successfully with oral 13-cis-retinoic acid (1 mg/kg/day).
 He had a complete remission lasting for 20 months before a single nodule recurred on his skin.
 Excisional biopsy of the recurrent tumor revealed a distinct morphologic change, suggesting cellular differentiation toward a more benign phenotype.
 No significant side effects were noted except mild xerostomia, bone pain, and hyperlipidemia.
 The authors believe that 13-cis-retinoic acid should be considered in the treatment of cutaneous Ki-1 lymphoma.
