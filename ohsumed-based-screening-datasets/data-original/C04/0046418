Carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations, pulse oximetry and arterial blood-gas tensions during jet ventilation for Nd-YAG laser bronchoscopy.
 Oxygen saturation measured with pulse oximetry (SpO2) is overestimated in the presence of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb).
 Smoke produced during laser resection of tracheobronchial malignancies may increase concentrations of COHb.
 We have measured COHb concentrations in 14 patients undergoing laser resection and compared SpO2 with functional oxygen saturation (SaO2) to ascertain if pulse oximetry is an accurate monitor of oxygen saturation.
 During the procedure frequent changes occur in ventilatory mechanics.
 Arterial blood-gas tensions were measured to see if gas exchange was satisfactory.
 Mean preoperative COHb was 1.4%.
 There was no significant change in COHb in any patient at any stage during treatment.
 The highest value was 2.05%.
 The mean difference between SaO2 and SpO2 was 1.13% (95% confidence interval 0.70-1.56%).
 Oxygen saturation may therefore safely be monitored by pulse oximetry in patients managed by our technique.
 Empirical setting of a jet ventilator provided acceptable blood-gas tensions, although sometimes it was necessary to increase the FlO2 to greater than 0.3 to maintain oxygenation.
