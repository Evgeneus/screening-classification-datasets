Intracarotid chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin for malignant brain tumors.
 Chemotherapy for tumors of the central nervous system has a limited efficacy presumably because of restricted blood-brain barrier permeability.
 The advantage of regional intra-arterial administration of anticancer drugs is an increased uptake during the first passage of the drugs through tumor capillaries.
 Twenty patients with high-grade astrocytomas (HGA) and 28 patients with metastatic brain tumors (MBT) received intracarotid/intravertebral infusion of etoposide and cisplatin.
 Eight patients with HGA who underwent incomplete resection responded to chemotherapy alone.
 Four additional patients had complete resection of the tumor.
 Median survival time of the group (responders and nonresponders) has been 14 months.
 Twelve patients with MBT responded to chemotherapy alone (six had complete response [CR], and six had partial response [PR]) with a median survival time of 7 months.
 Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) appears to be effective with acceptable toxicities.
 Accrual of additional patients is required before a final conclusion can be reached.
