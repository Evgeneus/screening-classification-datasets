Hydatidiform mole and fetus with normal karyotype: support of a separate entity.
 Repetitive hydatidiform mole was observed in four pregnancies.
 The pregnancies presented with heavy bleeding and vomiting, but the post-evacuation courses were uncomplicated, with rapid regression of serum hCG levels.
 Cytogenetic investigations, analyses of restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and flow cytometry in three pregnancies were consistent with diploid, biparental conception as the origin of fetal tissue and molar and nonmolar villi.
 In one pregnancy, the analyses of cytogenetic markers suggested the coexistence of two different cell lines of dizygotic, biparental origin, whereas DNA analysis was consistent with a single conception.
 With incomplete genetic information, a hydatidiform mole with coexistent normal fetus is generally considered to result from dizygous twinning comprising an androgenetic complete mole and a normal conception.
 In the present gestations, the results based on several techniques applied on numerous samples from different tissues render this possibility unlikely.
 Some of the contradictions between histologic and cytogenetic classifications of hydatidiform mole may be explained by diploid, biparental partial mole, which seems to constitute a separate subgroup within hydatidiform mole.
 Following chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis, continued pregnancy may be considered, depending on prenatal diagnosis including genetic marker analysis.
