Squamous carcinoma of the posterior pharyngeal wall.
 We have reviewed a 12-year experience with 295 patients treated for squamous carcinoma of the pharynx in order to focus on 78 patients whose lesions arose in the posterior wall.
 Surgery was the definitive therapy for the primary tumor in 57 (73%), including 3 treatment groups.
 Thirty-two patients had limited resections that preserved the larynx, involving local excision (7 patients), anterior pharyngotomy (7 patients), lateral pharyngotomy (6 patients), median labiomandibular glossotomy (6 patients), or median mandibulotomy with paralingual extension (6 patients).
 The second group consisted of 21 patients with more extensive tumors who required a laryngectomy and complex reconstruction, often with postoperative radiotherapy.
 Finally, there were four patients who developed metachronous second primaries in the pharynx subsequent to a laryngectomy.
 All required flap reconstruction.
 Of the 21 patients whose primary treatment was radiotherapy, 5 had lesions that were implanted after access was provided by a mandibulotomy.
 Cumulative 5-year survival was 32% and ranged from 44% in those with favorable lesions to 15% in those with extensive tumors.
 Our experience highlights the variety of treatment approaches available in patients with pharyngeal carcinomas confined to the posterior wall.
 Surgery in this setting carries acceptable morbidity and yields survival rates that compare favorably with those achieved by external radiation therapy alone.
 Results in patients with extensive lesions still leave much to be desired, despite radical surgery and aggressive radiotherapy.
 Innovative brachytherapy techniques using surgery for access deserve further investigation.
