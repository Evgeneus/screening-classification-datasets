Impaired binding properties of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease.
 To determine the factors underlying the apparent reduction in binding ability of thyroxine-binding globulin in hepatocellular carcinoma, hormone-binding characteristics were further examined in patients with this disease and in control subjects.
 No differences in affinity constants with respect to triodothyronine or serum thyroxine-binding globulin from hepatocellular carcinoma, cirrhotic and normal subjects were found.
 The affinity for thyroxine was significantly reduced in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.41 +/- 0.13 x 10(10) mol-1) and cirrhotic (0.65 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) mol-1) patients compared with normal subjects (0.94 +/- 0.7 x 10(10) mol-1).
 Investigations carried out on liver tissue obtained from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and chronic liver disease showed that thyroxine-binding globulin within tumor tissue was elevated and bound less exogenous tracer hormone compared with that obtained from nontumor tissue.
 Tumor-derived thyroxine-binding globulin with altered binding properties is, at least partly, responsible for the abnormal behavior of the serum protein in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
