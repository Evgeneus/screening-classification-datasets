Le Fort I osteotomy approach to the skull base.
 Horizontal osteotomy allows the surgeon to safely down-fracture the maxilla for wide exposure of the central skull base.
 This surgical approach is easily extended posteriorly in the midline to include the clivus and the arch of C1, providing 8 cm of horizontal anterior exposure and 5 cm of posterior.
 Wide operative exposure and a low rate of complications afford superior functional and cosmetic preservation in removing tumors of the central cranial base.
