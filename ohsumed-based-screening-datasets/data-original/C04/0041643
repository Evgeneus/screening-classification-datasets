Activation signals leading to proliferation of normal and leukemic CD3+ large granular lymphocytes.
 The activation signals leading to proliferation of normal and leukemic CD3+ large granular lymphocytes (LGL) were studied in vitro.
 Anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) alone (P less than .01) and recombinant interleukin-2 (IL-2) alone (P less than .01) caused significant stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from four CD3+ LGL leukemia patients, as measured in a 3H-thymidine incorporation assay.
 Recombinant interleukin-4 (IL-4) alone had no effect (P = .11).
 The combination signals of anti-CD3 MoAb and either IL-2 or IL-4 produced a proliferative response greater than anti-CD3 MoAb alone (P less than .01) or lymphokine alone (P less than .01).
 Leukemic LGL, purified by two-color sorting, were subsequently activated by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2 and assessed for DNA content by viable Hoechst No.
 33342 (HO) staining.
 Results of these studies demonstrated that leukemic LGL were stimulated directly by anti-CD3 MoAb and IL-2, with the percentage of cells in cell cycle (S + G2/M) ranging from 16% to 72%.
 Normal CD3+ LGL were also stimulated to enter the cell cycle by anti-CD3 and IL-2.
 These results show that leukemic LGL proliferate in vitro after activation through the T-cell receptor and/or lymphokine.
