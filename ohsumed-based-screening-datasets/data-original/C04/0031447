Secretagogue response of azaserine-induced rat pancreatic acinar tumors in vivo.
 This study investigates digestive and lysosomal enzyme secretion of azaserine-induced pancreatic acinar carcinomas in response to cholecystokinin in rats.
 After 15-20 months of treatment, 95% of the animals developed pancreatic acinar carcinomas encompassing more than 90% of the tissue.
 In anesthetized rats basal trypsin output was significantly elevated in the tumor group despite diminished fluid secretion.
 There was a linear correlation between tumor size and basal amylase and trypsin secretion.
 Intravenous infusion of cholecystokinin (25 IDU.kg-1.h-1) induced a significantly lower secretion of fluid per gram pancreas, as well as decreased amylase and trypsin output, in the tumor group compared with the control group.
 Plasma amylase and lipase levels were significantly elevated in the tumor group under both basal and stimulated conditions.
 The output of the lysosomal enzymes beta-D-glucuronidase and alpha-D-glucosidase was significantly increased in the tumor group under background secretin infusion.
 Additional cholecystokinin infusion caused a sharp increase in glucuronidase output in this group with only minimal increase in controls.
 Glucosidase output increased similarly in both groups.
 Amylase, lipase, and trypsin tumor tissue concentrations were markedly reduced by 85%, 90%, and 87%, respectively.
 It was concluded that the decreased secretory response of digestive enzymes may result from decreased synthesis, lowered storage capabilities, and/or a decreased/increased responsiveness to cholecystokinin.
 Increased glucuronidase secretion may reflect an augmented cell turnover of malignant tissue.
