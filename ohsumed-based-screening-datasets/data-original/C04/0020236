Changing cancer care in the 1990s and the cost.
 Progress in cancer research in the 1980s has led to predictions of a technologic explosion in the 1990s.
 Yet, with this progress there has been a groundswell of protest at the rapidly escalating costs of health care.
 More than $600 billion was spent on health care in 1989 and estimates of $1.5 trillion are made for the year 2000.
 Repeated attempts at cost containment have failed.
 It has been suggested that only by retarding technologic advances will we be able to control costs.
 Many observers believe that rationing of health care is the only solution, but new technology not only improves cancer care, it often decreases cost.
 It is not rational to retard advances that may later reduce costs, nor is it humane to retard advances that improve care, even if they cost more.
 In identifying priorities we should begin with the principle that treatments be restricted to clinical trials unless they have been demonstrated to prolong survival or improve the quality of life.
 If the payers reimburse procedures in an investigative setting, they will be on firm ground when they deny support for those same procedures outside an investigative setting.
 This is both an ethical and a fiscally responsible position for the third parties to take.
 It will not be easy for the profession or for the payers to deal with these problems.
 Public education and patient education will be key elements of any solution.
 Shifting the blame from politician to payer to professional will only make the problems worse.
