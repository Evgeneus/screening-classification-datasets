Conservation therapy for breast cancer following augmentation mammaplasty.
 Breast conservation therapy (wide local excision, axillary lymph node dissection, and whole-breast irradiation) is an increasingly popular alternative to mastectomy for breast cancer patients.
 A sizable (and growing) number of breast cancers occur in women with prior augmentation mammaplasty.
 Augmented breast cancer patients are currently being treated with conservation therapy, but no study has investigated complications and cosmetic results of radiation therapy specifically in this group of women.
 Between 1981 and 1988, we used conservation therapy in 17 augmented breast cancer patients.
 Fifteen patients were available for follow-up.
 In 10 (67 percent), significant capsular contracture occurred in the irradiated breast an average of 12 weeks following completion of treatment.
 Four patients have undergone revisionary surgery to correct symptoms arising from contracture.
 This poor outcome contradicts the results reported in previously published studies.
 We conclude that irradiation of the breast for cancer in augmented women results in a high incidence of scar-tissue contracture and poor cosmetic results.
