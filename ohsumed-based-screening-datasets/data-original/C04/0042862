Origin of malignant centrofacial granulomas: surface markers and gene rearrangement of malignant cells.
 Malignant centrofacial granuloma (MCFG) is a clinical entity characterized by a relentless ulceration of the upper airway involving the nose, palate, and face, without any demonstrable etiology.
 The origin of 11 cases were analyzed with the help of cell-surface immunostaining in all and with T-cell receptor gene (TCR) rearrangement in 3.
 The results show that most of the cases of MCFG are in fact T-cell lymphomas with cell-surface antigens (CD2, CD7, CD3) consistent with either early or mature T lymphocytes.
 However, some cases exhibit B-lymphoid (CD19, CD20) or histiomonocytic (CD13, CD14) lineage-specific markers.
 In conclusion, despite its remarkable clinical unity, MCFG is a heterogeneous group of neoplastic diseases, most but not all of which may be classified as T-cell lymphoma.
