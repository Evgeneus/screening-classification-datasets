Capillary hemangioma of the right main bronchus treated by sleeve resection in infancy.
 Respiratory distress developed in a 5-month-old female infant with roentgenographic evidence of hyperinflation of the right lung.
 Bronchoscopy revealed a vascular tumor extending from the medial wall of the right main bronchus leading to a check-valve mechanism.
 Radionuclide lung scans showed ventilation and perfusion of the right side reduced to 36 and 11% of the total lung ventilation and perfusion, respectively.
 At the age of 7 months a sleeve of the right main bronchus was resected and a reanastomosis performed.
 The operation specimen contained a capillary hemangioma measuring 1.2 X 0.6 cm.
 The postoperative course was uneventful.
 Perfusion of the right lung had markedly improved 6 months after the operation, and at the age of 2 yr and 9 months it was completely normal.
 Capillary hemangiomas must be considered a cause of bronchial obstruction in infancy, and surgery can be performed successfully.
