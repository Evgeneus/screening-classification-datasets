Experimental hepatocellular carcinoma: MR receptor imaging.
 Relaxation time measurements and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were performed in three different animal models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 After intravenous administration of asialoglycoprotein-directed arabinogalactan-stabilized ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (10 mumol Fe/kg receptor agent), T2 of normal liver decreased from 41.6 msec +/- 1.0 to 19.4 msec +/- 1.7 (P less than .05) in rats.
 T2 of HCC implanted in normal liver or liver with chronic hepatitis was essentially unchanged.
 These results were similar to those obtained by administration of a reticuloendothelial cell-directed conventional iron oxide; however, the required dose of receptor agent was lower.
 MR imaging in a woodchuck model of virally induced HCC confirmed the distribution of the hepatocyte-directed agent to regions of functioning and differentiated hepatocytes but not to malignant tumor tissue.
 The results suggest that MR receptor imaging may play a role in the differentiation between primary liver tumor and functional liver tissue such as that in normal liver hepatitis or regenerating nodules.
