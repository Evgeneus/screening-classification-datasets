Effect of chronic D-Ala,2 D-Leu5-enkephalin or pertussis toxin treatment on the high-affinity state of delta opioid receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells.
 Chronic treatment of neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells with the opioid agonist D-Ala,2 D-Leu5-enkephalin (DADLE) induces a homologous desensitization of the delta opioid receptors present in these cells.
 Since the Kd value of the delta opioid receptor's high-affinity state reflects the potency of the agonist, we examined the effect of receptor desensitization in NG108-15 cells on the percentage of receptor in the high-affinity state.
 When NG108-15 hybrid cells were treated with 10 or 100 nM DADLE for 4 hr at 24 degrees C, loss of DADLE's ability to inhibit adenylate cyclase was observed.
 However, when competition binding experiments were carried out with P2P3 membranes isolated from the delta opioid-desensitized hybrid cells, it was determined that 41.7 +/- 3.4% of the total binding sites remained in the high-affinity state, with no apparent alteration in the Kd value of either high- or low-affinity states.
 Similarly, when NG108-15 cells were treated with 100 ng/ml of pertussis toxin for 3 hr at 37 degrees C, 39.9 +/- 3.6% of the binding sites remained in the high-affinity state.
 This reduction in the percentage of receptor in high-affinity state was agonist specific, for chronic treatment of hybrid cells with levorphanol, a partial agonist, or the antagonist naloxone did not alter the percentage of opioid receptors in the high-affinity state.
 Furthermore, the delta opioid receptors remaining in the high-affinity state after chronic DADLE treatment were still sensitive to both Na+ and guanyldylimidodiphosphate, indicating that opioid ligand binding remained coupled to the G-proteins.
