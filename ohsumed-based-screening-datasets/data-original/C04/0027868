Polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma of the palate in a child.
 We report a case of polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma involving the palate of a 12-year-old girl, the first example of this tumour occurring in the paediatric age group.
 The tumour displayed infiltrative growth, neural invasion, variegated histological patterns, and minimal cytological atypia.
 The patient remained disease-free four years after wide local excision of the tumour.
 The distinction of polymorphous low grade adenocarcinoma from pleomorphic adenoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma is also discussed.
