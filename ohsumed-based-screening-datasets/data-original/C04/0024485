Antispasmodic effects of flavoxate, MFCA, and REC 15/2053 on smooth muscle of human prostate and urinary bladder.
 The antispasmodic effects of the flavone compounds flavoxate hydrochloride, 3-methylflavone carboxylic acid (MFCA), and REC 15/2053 (and in the case of the detrusor, oxybutynin), on the human detrusor, prostatic adenoma, prostatic capsule, and bladder neck, were studied by the in vitro isometric method.
 All the compounds inhibited, in different orders of potency, potassium-induced contractions of the tissues.
 Flavoxate showed a slightly greater activity than the other two compounds in the prostatic and bladder neck tissues.
 However, REC 15/2053 displayed greater activity in the detrusor than in the other tissues.
 The relaxant effect on the prostatic tissues suggests a potential use for these compounds in benign prostatic obstruction.
