Removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths by the hysteroscopic resectoscope.
 Fifty-three patients underwent 55 procedures with a resectoscope for the removal of large symptomatic intrauterine growths.
 The presenting complaint was menorrhagia, menometrorrhagia, or heavy postmenopausal bleeding in 38 patients; excessive menses plus infertility in 13 patients; and infertility alone in two patients.
 Forty-three patients had pedunculated or sessile submucous myomas and ten patients had large endometrial polyps.
 The long-term results are based on 45 patients followed for longer than 1 year.
 Excessive bleeding was controlled in 40 of the 43 women (93%).
 Failure to control abnormal bleeding was apparent within the first year.
 Seven of the 12 infertility patients (58%) delivered live-born infants.
 Five patients have undergone subsequent hysterectomies (9%).
 Two patients had repeat resectoscopic removal of myomas and two had subsequent non-resectoscope myomectomies.
 No major complications were encountered.
