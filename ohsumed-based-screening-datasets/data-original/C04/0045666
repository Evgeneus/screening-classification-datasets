Differentiation of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells induced by the c-jun and activated c-Ha-ras oncogenes.
 The activated c-Ha-ras oncogene induced AP1-site DNA-binding activity in F9 cells.
 This induction appeared to be due, at least in part, to the induction of c-jun transcription.
 Both activated c-Ha-ras and c-jun induced the differentiation of F9 cells to endoderm-like cells.
 Thus, AP1 appears to play a key role in the initial stage of F9 cell differentiation.
