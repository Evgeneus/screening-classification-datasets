Adrenal cortical carcinoma with vena cava tumor thrombus requiring cardiopulmonary bypass for resection.
 We believe this is the fifteenth case report of adrenal cortical carcinoma with tumor thrombus to the vena cava, and the fourth reported case of a left-side tumor propagating thrombus to the vena cava.
 The patient underwent successful resection which required cardiopulmonary bypass.
 The caval tumor thrombus was very friable and gelatinous, unlike many renal cell thrombi, and required special surgical considerations.
