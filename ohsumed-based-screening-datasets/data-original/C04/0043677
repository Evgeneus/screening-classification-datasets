Hemidystonia due to a contralateral parieto-occipital metastasis: disappearance after removal of the mass lesion.
 A patient presented with left-sided hemidystonia.
 CT revealed a contralateral parieto-occipital mass lesion compressing the basal ganglia, which were spared by the mass.
 After microsurgical resection of the tumor, which was verified histologically as a metastasis of a large-cell anaplastic carcinoma, the movement disorder dissolved completely.
