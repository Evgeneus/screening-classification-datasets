An unusual manifestation of Paget's disease of bone: spinal epidural hematoma presenting as acute cauda equina syndrome.
 Neurologic sequelae of Paget's disease of bone include involvement of the spinal cord or cauda equina due to mechanical compression by enlarged vertebrae, ischemia caused by a spinal artery, steal syndrome or neoplasm.
 We describe a patient with Paget's disease of bone who presented with acute cauda equina syndrome due to a spinal epidural hematoma.
 Clinicians need to recognize this entity since surgical intervention may result in a favorable outcome.
