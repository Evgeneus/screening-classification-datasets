Effect of tocotrienols on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by 2-acetylaminofluorene in rats.
 The effects of tocotrienols on hepatocarcinogenesis in rats fed with 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) were followed morphologically and histologically for a period of 20 wk.
 No differences between treated and control rats in the morphology and histology of their livers was observed.
 Cell damage was extensive in the livers of AAF-treated rats but less extensive in the AAF-tocotrienols-treated rats when compared with normal and tocotrienols-treated rats.
 2-Acetylaminofluorene significantly increases the activities of both plasma and liver microsomal gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) and liver microsomal UDP-glucuronyltransferase (UDP-GT).
 Tocotrienols administered together with AAF significantly decrease the activities of plasma GGT after 12 and 20 wk (P less than 0.01, P less than 0.002, respectively) and liver microsomal UDP-GT after 20 wk (P less than 0.02) when compared with the controls and with rats treated only with tocotrienols.
 Liver microsomal GGT also showed a similar pattern to liver microsomal UDP-GT but the decrease was not significant.
 These results suggest that tocotrienols administered to AAF-treated rats reduce the severity of hepatocarcinogenesis.
