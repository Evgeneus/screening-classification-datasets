Hydrogen peroxide as a mediator of dopac-induced effects on melanoma cells.
 Dopac increases tyrosinase activity and exerts cytotoxic effects in cultures of human melanoma cells.
 The possible role of hydrogen peroxide in these actions was examined.
 Catalase (100 micrograms/ml) completely reversed the cytotoxic action of 0.3 mM dopac and reduced its tyrosinase-stimulating effect by approximately one half.
 The results show that extracellular hydrogen peroxide is a mediator of both the tyrosinase-stimulating and cytotoxic actions of dopac.
 Analysis of the degradation products of melanin from dopac-treated melanoma cells after hydriodic acid (HI) hydrolysis revealed the presence of aminohydroxy-phenylacetic acid (AHPAc).
 This substance is obtained by HI hydrolysis of melanin formed by oxidation of cysteinyl-dopac.
 Thus, the presence of AHPAc indicates that dopac is transported into the melanocytes where it serves as a substrate for tyrosinase.
