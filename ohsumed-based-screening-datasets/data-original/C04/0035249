Expression of androgen receptor mRNA in human hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatoma cell lines.
 The expression of androgen receptor messenger RNA in hepatocellular carcinomas and hepatoma cell lines was studied using Northern-blot analysis and the complementary DNA-polymerase chain reaction method.
 Androgen receptor messenger RNAs were detected (although in low levels) in both hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and noncancerous tissues of the liver in all eight cases we studied, except for the tumor sample of one case.
 None of the hepatoma cell lines studied, however, expressed detectable levels of androgen receptor messenger RNA except for the SK-HEP-1 hepatoma cell line.
