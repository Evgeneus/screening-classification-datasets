Establishment and characterization of 20 human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines in a serum-free defined medium (ACL-4).
 To facilitate the studies in cell biology and drug sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer, cell samples from 55 patients have been used to establish cell lines in culture using a chemically defined medium (ACL-4).
 A total of 20 cell lines (36 percent) were directly established and characterized: 14 (44 percent) from pleural effusions, five (29 percent) from resected primary tumors, and one (25 percent) from ascitic fluids.
 They comprised 16 adenocarcinoma, two large cell carcinoma, one squamous cell carcinoma, and one malignant mesothelioma.
 Each cell line had distinct gross morphologic features and population doubling times from 21 to 75 h.
 The plating efficiency was 0.01 to 9.51 percent.
 The modal chromosome number varied from 45 to 108.
 Secretion of tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen, sialyl Lewis Xi, CA 50, CA 125, and CA 19-9) into the medium was also different in each cell line.
 Most of the cell lines have been xenografted into nude mice and found to be tumorigenic.
 Survival of 20 patients whose tumor cell specimens continually grew in culture at any time during their clinical course was significantly shorter than that of 35 patients with no in vitro tumour growth (median survival time of 28 weeks vs 53 weeks, p = 0.0093).
 Our study indicates that in vitro tumor cell growth appears to be an adverse prognostic factor in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.
