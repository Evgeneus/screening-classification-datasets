Multiple adenomas of the human pituitary. A retrospective autopsy study with clinical implications.
 In a review of autopsy material from two centers, 20 pituitary glands were found containing multiple adenomas.
 In total, 44 adenomas were identified histologically; 16 glands contained double tumors and in four glands triple adenomas were found.
 Size was measured in 30 tumors, all of which were microadenomas.
 Thirty-four adenomas were located in the lateral wings and 10 lay in the median wedge.
 Forty-one tumors were chromophobic and three were basophilic.
 Immunocytochemical analysis of the 44 tumors demonstrated the presence of prolactin in 11, adrenocorticotropic hormone in three, growth hormone in one, and alpha-subunit as well as follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone in one.
 Of the 20 patients studied, there were 11 men and nine women, with an average age of 69 years.
 All patients died from various nonendocrine causes.
 With the exception of one patient who appeared mildly acromegalic, no correlation was observed between pituitary morphology and clinical data.
 This study found a 10.4% frequency of adenomas in pituitaries studied randomly at autopsy.
 Multiple tumors were encountered in 0.9% of cases.
 Despite its low frequency, adenoma multiplicity may underlie surgical failure in cases in which one adenoma is removed and the other is left behind.
