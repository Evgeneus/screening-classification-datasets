Comparison of the Finapres and direct arterial pressure monitoring during profound hypotensive anaesthesia.
 The Finapres was compared with direct intraarterial pressure monitoring in 10 patients undergoing local resection of choroidal melanoma, an operation that requires a period of profound hypotension.
 Good agreement was recorded for systolic arterial pressure and heart rate over a range of pressures.
 However, agreement of mean and diastolic pressures was poor, with the Finapres tending to overestimate these values.
 In cases requiring profound hypotension, direct arterial pressure monitoring remains the method of choice.
