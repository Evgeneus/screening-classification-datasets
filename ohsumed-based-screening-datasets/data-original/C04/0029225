Complications after intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin: rhabdomyolysis and metastatic infection.
 Two cases of adverse reaction to bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) bladder instillations are reported.
 In both cases transient fevers and systemic symptoms developed following the instillations.
 After an additional instillation 1 patient had high fevers, severe myalgias and profound weakness followed by rhabdomyolysis and anuric renal failure, which required 3 weeks of hemodialysis before recovery.
 Extensive evaluation revealed no cause other than the BCG instillations.
 In the other patient a firm subcutaneous nodule gradually developed on the chest wall, which contained nonviable acid fast bacilli.
