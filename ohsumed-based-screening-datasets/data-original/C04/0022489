Ganglioglioma: a clinical study with long-term follow-up.
 Gangliogliomas are uncommon tumors of mixed neoplastic glial and neuronal elements.
 Because of their low incidence, few large series exist that fully describe the clinical characteristics of patients afflicted with this tumor.
 We have reviewed the medical records of 20 patients at Duke University Medical Center with histologically proven gangliogliomas.
 These patients typically presented within the first three decades of life and their most common presenting symptom was seizures.
 Therapies included surgical resection, either partial or total, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.
 Long-term follow-up was achieved by chart review and by telephone interview.
 Patients who underwent gross total resection alone seemed to fare the best when comparing all treatment groups, and we therefore recommend this as the main form of treatment.
