The modified transcochlear approach to the cerebellopontine angle.
 We have modified the transcochlear approach to improve exposure of the anterior petrous apex, clivus, anterior cerebellopontine angle, and the prepontine region.
 These changes include resection of the external auditory canal, middle ear, glenoid fossa, and posterior zygomatic arch.
 This approach provides improved exposure of the petrous carotid artery, jugular bulb, and clivus.
 It offers the largest and most lateral access to the anterior cerebellopontine and prepontine region.
 The results of this approach in 11 patients are discussed.
