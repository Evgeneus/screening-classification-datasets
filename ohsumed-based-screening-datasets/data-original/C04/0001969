A predominantly adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma.
 A 61-year-old woman who presented with diabetes, nausea, weight loss and sweating was found to have a phaeochromocytoma secreting adrenaline, with a small amount of N-methyladrenaline.
 There was no significant increase in noradrenaline secretion.
 She was normotensive, and developed profound hypotension in response to the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phenoxybenzamine.
 These features are unusual in phaeochromocytoma, but similar features occurred in the very few previous reported cases of pure adrenaline-secreting phaeochromocytoma.
 We conclude that it is important to identify such patients, so that they should not be given alpha-adrenergic antagonist drugs.
