Primary seminoma of the seminal vesicle: report of a case.
 We report on the clinical and histological findings of a primary extragonadal germ cell tumor that was proved to be a seminoma of the seminal vesicle.
 The patient had left ureteral obstruction at diagnosis.
 The testes were normal on physical and ultrasound examination, and the retroperitoneum was free of tumor.
 There was no recurrence 8 months postoperatively.
