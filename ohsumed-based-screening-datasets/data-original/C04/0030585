Flexible cystoscopy compared with ultrasound in the detection of recurrent bladder tumours.
 A combination of transrectal and transabdominal ultrasound was compared with flexible cystoscopy as a means of detecting recurrent bladder tumours.
 The study group comprised 50 patients who had previously had rigid cystoscopy.
 They underwent combination ultrasound in the out-patient department 1 week before flexible cystoscopy.
 Combination ultrasound identified 25 patients with recurrent tumours and flexible cystoscopy identified 26.
 Thirty-four patients (68%) preferred ultrasound, 10 (20%) preferred flexible cystoscopy, 3 (6%) preferred general anaesthesia and rigid cystoscopy and 3 (6%) had no preference.
 The main objection to ultrasound was the use of the transrectal probe.
