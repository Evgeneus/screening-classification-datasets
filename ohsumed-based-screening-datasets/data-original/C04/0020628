Chondrosarcoma of the jaws: clinical findings, histopathology, and treatment.
 Three cases of chondrosarcoma involving the jaws are presented, one in the maxilla and two in the mandible.
 The salient points of clinical presentation elucidated by this series of cases are that a widened periodontal ligament space is present in chondrosarcomas as well as in osteosarcomas, and that a slowly increasing diastema may be the earliest clinical sign.
 The most important lesson to be learned from the histopathology is that one should not accept a diagnosis of a benign cartilaginous tumor of the jaws.
 Treatment of these lesions should consist of wide surgical excision and consideration of adjunctive or palliative radiotherapy, especially in the maxilla.
 It should also be noted that recurrences may develop 10 to 20 years later, and follow-up should be lifelong.
