The prognostic significance of autologous bone marrow transplant in advanced neuroblastoma 
 This report provides strong evidence for conducting a controlled randomized clinical trial of autologous bone marrow transplantation versus conventional chemotherapy in childhood neuroblastoma, which is disseminated beyond the intracavity nodes, and which is diagnosed in children older than 12 months of age.
 On the basis of two Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) studies, one a surgery plus conventional chemotherapy study (POG 8441) and the other an elective autologous transplant pilot protocol (POG 8340), there was no significant prognostic benefit of switching in remission from the surgery plus chemotherapy protocol to the transplant protocol (P = .91) or of switching in remission from the surgery plus chemotherapy protocol to any transplant (P = .75).
 The analysis is based on 116 patients achieving a complete or partial remission, 32 of whom received transplants on the pilot protocol, and 17 of whom received transplants outside the pilot protocol.
 While potential selection bias precludes cause-effect conclusions, these data strongly suggest that a large randomized trial of autologous bone marrow transplantation should be conducted before accepting this form of therapy as standard.
