Detection of field change in oral cancer using oral exfoliative cytologic study.
 Four smears were taken from the normal buccal mucosa of 55 oral cancer patients and 76 cancer-free patients.
 In each case, two were stained by the Papanicolaou method and two underwent Feulgen hydrolysis.
 Quantitative assessment of nuclear area (NA) and cytoplasmic area (CA) of the Papanicolaou smears was undertaken using a semiautomatic image analysis system.
 DNA profiles were assessed from the Feulgen smears using a Vickers M85 microdensitometer (Vickers Instruments, York, England) and were found to be diploid for all patients.
 Results were then analyzed with respect to those patients who took alcohol, tobacco, combination of alcohol and tobacco, and those who took neither.
 A significant reduction in CA for the oral cancer group (P equals 0.001) but no change in NA (P equals 0.74) was observed.
 A detailed analysis of alcohol and tobacco habits could identify no significant role for these two factors, in the reduction in cytoplasmic area.
 Such field change may prove to be of value in predicting the development of second malignant tumors.
