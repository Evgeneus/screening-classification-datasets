Gastrointestinal lipoma and malignancies.
 Twenty gastrointestinal lipomata in 18 patients are reviewed: 15 located in the colon, 3 in the distal ileum, one in the duodenum, and one in the stomach.
 They were found most frequently in European-born, elderly women and presented with variable abdominal symptomatology.
 Four lipomata were removed during endoscopy, the remainder at laparotomy, partial colectomy being performed in 10 cases.
 All, except 2 subserosal types, were located in the submucosa, and their average size was 2.7 cm diameter.
 Microscopically, none showed true encapsulation, and all were composed of mature fat cells without cellular atypia.
 In spite of nonspecific changes at endoscopy, one-half of the cases showed, on microscopic examination, atrophy of the overlying glands and a prominent eosinophilic and/or lymphoplasmocytic infiltration of the lamina propria.
 Two large subserosal lipomata were associated with Crohn's disease.
 In addition, in 39% of cases, malignant tumours, either single or double, were present in the gastrointestinal tract or elsewhere.
 Gastrointestinal "lipomata" are located in the sites of normal fatty infiltration in the elderly; these growths could be a local aging or reactive process of the intestinal wall rather than true neoplasms without any potential malignancy.
 However, coexistent malignancies should be carefully searched for in elderly patients with colonic lipoma.
