Endometrioma of the liver.
 Hepatic endometriosis is extremely rare.
 We describe a patient sent to us with epigastric pain as the only symptom and who was found to have associated endometrioma of the liver and left ovary.
 We suggest a gynecologic evaluation before surgery for hepatic cyst of unknown cause.
