Potentiating effect of ribavirin on the in vitro and in vivo antiretrovirus activities of 2',3'-dideoxyinosine and 2',3'-dideoxy-2,6-diaminopurine riboside.
 2',3'-Dideoxyinosine (DDI) and 2',3'-dideoxy-2,6-diaminopurine riboside (ddDAPR) are potent and selective inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication in MT-4 cells.
 They are also inhibitory to the transformation of C3H/3T3 cells by Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV).
 In vivo, they are only marginally effective in delaying MSV-induced tumor formation, and mortality associated therewith in newborn NMRI mice.
 When combined with ribavirin, DDI and ddDAPR become much more effective in inhibiting MSV and HIV replication in vitro and MSV-induced tumor formation in vivo.
 These observations point to the potential role of ribavirin in potentiating the anti-HIV activity of DDI in AIDS patients.
