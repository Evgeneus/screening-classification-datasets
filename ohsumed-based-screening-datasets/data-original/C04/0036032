Devine exclusion for unresectable carcinoma of the stomach.
 Between July 1986 and July 1988, Devine exclusion was performed in 20 patients with unresectable carcinoma of the gastric antrum.
 All 20 patients presented with repeated vomiting.
 On endoscopy, 16 patients had complete gastric outlet obstruction while the remainder manifested significant gastric outlet stenosis.
 There was no hospital mortality.
 All except two patients could take an oral diet after surgery until their demise.
 Devine exclusion is safe and effective in relieving gastric outlet obstruction and is not associated with prolonged delay in return of gastric emptying.
