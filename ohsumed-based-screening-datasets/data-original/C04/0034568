In situ DNA hybridization analysis of oral papillomas, leukoplakias, and carcinomas for human papillomavirus.
 Twenty-one papillomas, 23 ordinary benign keratoses, 13 smokeless tobacco keratoses, 10 verrucous hyperplasias, 10 verrucous carcinomas, 17 squamous cell carcinomas, 3 epithelial dysplasias, and 6 lichen planus lesions were evaluated for human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6/11, 16/18, and 31/33/35, with biotinylated double-stranded DNA probes by in situ hybridization.
 Sixty-two percent (13/21) of oral squamous papillomas were positive for HPV DNA.
 HPV DNA types 6 and 11 demonstrated the strongest reactivity.
 Of the 13 cases, 10 also showed some reactivity with HPV-16/18 and -31/33/35.
 None of the cases of keratoses, epithelial dysplasia, squamous cell carcinoma, verrucous hyperplasia, verrucous carcinoma, or lichen planus were positive for HPV DNA.
 This study confirms the consistent and frequent finding of HPV DNA in oral squamous cell papillomas and the inconsistency of being able to identify HPV DNA in keratotic, premalignant, or cancerous lesions of the oral mucous membranes.
