Preoperative prostate-specific antigen in predicting pathologic stage and grade after radical prostatectomy.
 Preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was measured in 63 men who had clinically localized, previously untreated adenocarcinoma of the prostate and underwent subsequent radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection.
 Pathologic stage and grade were correlated to the serum PSA value.
 Patients with organ-confined (P1, P2) and extracapsular (P3, P3N +) prostate cancer had elevated preoperative serum PSA levels (greater than 4 ng/mL) in 61 and 90 percent of cases, respectively.
 Patients with low-grade and high-grade tumor histology had elevated preoperative PSA levels in 62 and 80 percent of cases, respectively.
 In distinguishing between organ-confined and extracapsular disease with a preoperative serum PSA of 10 ng/mL as a cutoff value, the sensitivity was 68 percent, the specificity was 66 percent, the positive predictive value was 46 percent, and the negative predictive value was 83 percent.
 Although there was a trend of increasing preoperative serum PSA levels with higher pathologic stage or grade, there was no significant difference in preoperative serum PSA values with pathologic stage and/or grade considered as a group or in determining stage and/or grade preoperatively on an individual basis.
