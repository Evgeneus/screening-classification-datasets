Role of histamine in natural killer cell-mediated resistance against tumor cells.
 The formation of lung metastases by i.v.-injected B16 melanoma (F1 and F10 strain) cells in Swiss albino, C57BL/6, and BALB/c mice was reduced by a single dose of histamine given 24 h before tumor cell inoculation.
 The antimetastatic effect of histamine was specifically mediated by histamine H2-receptors (H2R): it was blocked by the H2R antagonist ranitidine and mimicked by dimaprit, a specific H2R agonist but not by an H2R-inactive structural analog of this compound, nor-dimaprit, or the H1R agonist 2-thiazolyl-ethylamide.
 A single dose of any of the H2R antagonists ranitidine, tiotidine, famotidine, or cimetidine drastically augmented metastasis.
 Effects of H2R-interactive compounds on B16 metastasis required intact NK cells, as judged by the inability of histamine or ranitidine to affect B16 metastasis after NK cell depletion in vivo using antibodies to asialo-GM1.
 NK-cell-mediated lysis of YAC-1 lymphoma cells in vivo was enhanced by histamine and reduced by ranitidine within 4 h after inoculation of tumor cells.
 The antimetastatic effect of IL-2 was potentiated by histamine; in some experiments, combined treatment with a low dose of IL-2 (6000 U/kg) and histamine completely eliminated metastasis, whereas concomitant treatment with ranitidine abrogated antimetastatic effects of IL-2; animals treated with ranitidine and IL-2 displayed the same level of enhanced metastasis as those treated with ranitidine alone.
 The presented data are suggestive of an earlier unrecognized role for histamine in NK cell-mediated resistance against metastatic tumor cells.
