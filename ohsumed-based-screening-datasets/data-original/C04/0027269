Placental site trophoblastic tumor in a postmenopausal woman.
 Placental site trophoblastic tumor is a rare neoplasm that arises in the trophoblastic tissue of the placental bed.
 This case report is unusual because of the patient's advanced age at the time of diagnosis and the favorable response of the disease to chemotherapy.
 Although the clinical course is benign for most patients with placental site trophoblastic tumor, the malignant variant of the disease is characterized by recurrence, relative insensitivity to radiation and chemotherapy, and death.
 To the authors' knowledge, the 53-year-old woman reported is the oldest patient with histologically confirmed placental site trophoblastic tumor.
 Initially, surgery, radiation, and multiagent chemotherapy failed to control vaginal and pulmonary metastatic disease.
 After administration of four treatment cycles of a "second-line" chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of cyclophosphamide and cisplatin, complete clinical and radiologic remission was achieved.
 The patient's serum level of human chorionic gonadotropin has remained undetectable, and she has been without measurable evidence of disease for 16 months.
