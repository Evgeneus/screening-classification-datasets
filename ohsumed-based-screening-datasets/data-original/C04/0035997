Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in cervical carcinoma: a report on 30 cases.
 T1 and T2 relaxation times were calculated, before radiation therapy, in 30 patients with cervical carcinoma.
 Eight healthy young women were submitted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to determine T1 and T2 times of the normal cervix.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was repeated, in 22 patients, during radiation therapy and at follow-up.
 During treatment and follow-up, patients with complete tumour response showed a significant T1 reduction compared with the pre-treatment values.
 With persistence of palpable or visible tumour, T1 times showed a small decrease during therapy, and a marked increase at subsequent examinations.
 The results suggest that the modifications of T1 times, during radiation therapy and follow-up, could be considered as a useful discriminant between patients with differing tumour response.
