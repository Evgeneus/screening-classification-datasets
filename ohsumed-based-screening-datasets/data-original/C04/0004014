Caseating hepatic granulomas in Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 A 68-year-old man presented with recurrent Hodgkin's lymphoma after a 9-year disease-free interval induced by chemotherapy.
 In addition to histological evidence of recurrent Hodgkin's disease, the liver biopsy specimen showed extensive caseating granulomas.
 Cultures of bone marrow and liver tissue tested negative for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
 No antituberculous treatment was administered, and the patient had an excellent clinical response to additional chemotherapy for lymphoma.
 Hodgkin's lymphoma should be added to the list of disease entities associated with caseating granulomas in the liver.
