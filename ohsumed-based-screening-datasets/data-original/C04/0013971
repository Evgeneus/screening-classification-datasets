Bone marrow necrosis in leukemic-phase follicular lymphoma.
 Bone marrow necrosis has been regarded as a rare entity in specimens obtained from living patients and has been associated with a poor prognosis.
 It is most commonly found in patients with neoplastic disorders, severe infections, and sickle cell anemia.
 We present an unusual case of a small-cleaved type follicular lymphoma associated with bone marrow necrosis and a leukemic phase occurring in a 55-year-old woman.
 Specimens were studied by morphologic, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic, and DNA hybridization techniques.
