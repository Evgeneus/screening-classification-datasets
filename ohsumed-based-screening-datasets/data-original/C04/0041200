Subependymoma with rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation: report of a case and literature review.
 A unique gliomesenchymal neoplasm, consisting of a subependymoma, a form of low-grade glioma, and a rhabdomyosarcoma, is described.
 It arose and recurred in the brain stem of a 52-year-old man.
 Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated the presence of a neuroectodermal marker S-100 protein within some sarcoma cells.
 The occurrence of this rare tumor supports the concept that striated muscle may derive from a neuroectodermal precursor lesion.
