T-cell receptor tau delta +/CD3+4-8-T- cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias: a distinct subgroup of leukemias in children. A report of five cases.
 In a 10-year study of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL) in children, we have identified five cases expressing the T-cell receptor tau delta (TCR tau delta).
 The incidence (26%) of TCR tau delta+T-cell leukemias in our material was high.
 Clinically, the TCR tau delta+ leukemias represented a distinct subgroup of T-cell leukemias.
 Mean age at onset of disease, 1.8 years, was remarkably low for mature T-cell leukemias.
 White blood cell counts were high, lymph node enlargements were discrete, and no mediastinal tumors were seen.
 Four of five TCR tau delta+ leukemias carried rearrangements of the C tau 2 gene, and transcribed the T-early alpha genetic element.
