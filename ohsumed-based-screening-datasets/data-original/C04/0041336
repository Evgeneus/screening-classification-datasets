Local failure after definitive radiation or surgical therapy for carcinoma of the prostate and options for prevention and therapy.
 The incidence of local failure and its relation to distant failure following definitive therapy of carcinoma of the prostate is discussed.
 Local failure may arise from incomplete resection, tumor spillage, clones of radioresistant cells, development of new tumors in an organ left in situ, or inadequate treatment portals.
 The authors review the various measures used as prophylaxis or treatment of local failure in relation to clinical and pathologic stage.
