Endoscopic palliative management of rectal cancer.
 Laser ablation and bipolar coagulation have been used to palliate rectal cancer and avoid surgery.
 Indications are distal metastatic disease, extensive local invasion, obstruction and bleeding from nonresectable rectal tumor, or refusal of surgery.
 From Jan 1, 1986, to Jan 1, 1989, I saw 26 patients who met those criteria; 19 already had metastatic disease and three repeatedly refused abdominoperineal resection.
 A two-laser approach using both CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers was used in patients with low-lying lesions; others were treated by the Nd:YAG laser only.
 For rectal tumors, bipolar esophageal tumor probes were used via the rigid sigmoidoscope.
 The number of laser sessions averaged three per patient, and the number of bipolar coagulation sessions averaged five per patient.
 Bleeding followed bipolar coagulation in one patient.
 There were no perforations in either treatment group, and no patient has required colostomy.
 Of the 19 patients who already had metastatic disease, 12 are still alive, the longest survival being 20 months.
 Of those medically unfit for surgery, three have died of coincidental disease, and one is alive with controlled rectal cancer after 16 months.
 All three patients who refused surgery are alive; the longest survival is 13 months.
