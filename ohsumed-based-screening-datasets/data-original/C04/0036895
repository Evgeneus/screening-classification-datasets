Expression of immunoreactive E-cadherin adhesion molecules in human cancers.
 E-cadherin (E-CD), a Ca(2+)-dependent adhesion molecule, plays a major role in the maintenance of intercellular junctions in normal epithelial cells in most organs.
 The expression of E-CD in human carcinoma samples (esophagus, stomach, and breast) was investigated using immunohistochemical staining, which was performed on surgical specimens using a monoclonal antibody for human E-CD.
 E-cadherin was strongly expressed in all normal epithelium examined.
 However E-CD expression in primary tumors of esophagus (11 of 15: 73%), stomach (5 of 20: 25%), and breast (9 of 20: 45%) was reduced, and 68% of these (esophagus: 8 of 11, stomach: 4 of 5, breast: 5 of 9) displayed heterogeneous E-CD expression.
 In some tumor cells with reduced E-CD expression, E-CD molecules were located in the cell cytoplasm.
 These results indicate that there are human cancer cells in which E-CD-related intercellular adhesion is impaired.
