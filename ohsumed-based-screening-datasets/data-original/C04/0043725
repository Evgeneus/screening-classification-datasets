Oral leukoplakia and adolescent smokeless tobacco use.
 The recent increase in smokeless tobacco (ST) use has prompted investigators to assess the health effects of ST use.
 This study attempted to evaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia among adolescent users and to determine factors associated with its presence.
 During their annual physical examination, 1116 teenaged football players (567 black, 546 white) answered a 34-question survey and received an oral screening examination.
 Results indicated that 0.5% of nonusers, 1.5% of previous users, and 13% of current users had clinically evident oral leukoplakia.
 Factors statistically associated with higher leukoplakia rates included history of ST use, regular ST use, years of ST use, and the weekly quantity consumed.
 Factors not associated included use of alcohol, use of cigarettes, type of ST used, and hours of ST use.
 One brand of snuff was found to be associated with a relative risk of leukoplakia higher than that of another brand of snuff.
 Overall, in ST users oral leukoplakia was six times more likely to develop than in nonusers.
 Earlier ages of ST use may lead to greater periods of use (in years) and to possible increases in deleterious long-term health effects in current adolescents.
