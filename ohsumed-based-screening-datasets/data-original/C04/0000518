Pregnancy after in vitro fertilization in a patient with stage I endometrial carcinoma treated with progestins.
 A 35-year-old woman with chronic anovulation and bilateral tubal disease was found during infertility evaluation to have grade I endometrial carcinoma confined to an endometrial polyp.
 She was treated with polypectomy and endometrial curettage followed by high-dose progestagens for 6 months.
 Endometrial curettage at 3 and 6 months of therapy indicated regression of the lesion and the patient subsequently achieved successful pregnancy with IVF.
