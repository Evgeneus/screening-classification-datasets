Pentavalent technetium-99m-DMSA uptake in a patient having multiple myeloma without amyloidosis.
 A pentavalent 99mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan was performed on a patient with multiple myeloma without amyloidosis.
 A high accumulation of the tracer was found in numerous tumors.
 We believe that the accumulation of DMSA is unrelated to amyloidosis and that the DMSA scan may have potential for the staging of tumors in patients presenting with multiple myeloma.
