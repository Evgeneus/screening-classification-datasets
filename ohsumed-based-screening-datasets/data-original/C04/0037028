Surgical options in 424 patients with primary breast cancer without systemic metastases.
 Mastectomy was dictated by medical considerations in about 40% of 424 consecutive patients who had invasive breast cancer with no evidence of systemic metastases.
 Half of the women considered suitable for local excision of the breast cancer followed by radiotherapy (conservation) elected to have mastectomy, and intraoperative findings dictated mastectomy in about 20% of those electing conservation.
 Consequently, conservation was accomplished in about one quarter of those treated for breast cancer.
 Younger rather than older women more frequently expressed the desire for breast conservation.
