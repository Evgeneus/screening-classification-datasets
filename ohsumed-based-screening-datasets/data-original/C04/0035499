Open surgery assisted by the neuronavigator, a stereotactic, articulated, sensitive arm.
 A new computed tomographic-stereotactic device that translates the operating point onto preoperative computed tomographic (CT) images, the Neuronavigator, has been developed.
 We have applied this system to various neurosurgical procedures to examine its usefulness.
 The system consists of a 6-joint sensing arm and a 16-bit personal computer.
 It projects the location of the arm tip onto a corresponding CT slice with a cursor that guides the surgeon toward the intracranial target during open surgery.
 The system also projects the location of the tip onto angiograms, and when used in conjunction with echography or a transcranial Doppler (TCD) flow meter, the surgeon's ability to navigate is enhanced.
 Sixty-eight patients underwent operation with the Neuronavigator.
 The navigation system worked as the core of a multimodal three-dimensional data base that proved to be useful during surgery.
 The maximum detection error was 2.5 mm, which was considered sufficient for open microsurgery.
 It also proved useful in designing the position of a craniotomy, in targeting deep-seated mass lesions, and in tracing the tumor edge, which had been identified on a CT scan.
 When the angiogram was combined with the navigator, it became easy to identify key vessels within a small operating field.
 The system was also combined with a TCD flow meter.
 This combination makes it possible to translate the measuring point of the TCD directly into CT coordinates, improving the precision of location of the TCD probe.
 The Neuronavigator combines various diagnostic images into one database and effectively guides the surgeon during surgery.
