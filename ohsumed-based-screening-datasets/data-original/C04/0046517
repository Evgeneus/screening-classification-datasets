Choledochal cysts: classification and cholangiographic appearance.
 A classification scheme for choledochal cysts is outlined and their appearance on cholangiograms is illustrated.
 Choledochal cysts are uncommon anomalies of the biliary system and are probably congenital in origin.
 They are manifested by cystic dilatation of the extra- or intrahepatic biliary tree or both.
 The classification system described here divides choledochal cysts into one of five main types.
 The most common, which is manifested by cystic or focal segmental dilatation of the common bile duct or fusiform choledochal dilatation, accounts for 80-90% of cases.
