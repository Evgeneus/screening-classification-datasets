Vaginal adenosis and clear cell carcinoma after 5-fluorouracil treatment for condylomas.
 Vaginal adenosis and clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina occurred in a 44-year-old woman after treatment for condylomata acuminata.
 She had no known exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero.
 Biopsy-proven vaginal adenosis appeared 8 months after intravaginal 5-fluorouracil application for recurrent urogenital condylomata acuminata.
 Forty months later, biopsies showed residual adenosis with foci of clear cell adenocarcinoma.
 Although clear cell adenocarcinoma is associated with vaginal adenosis and cervical ectropion in DES-exposed women, its occurrence in adenosis after 5-fluorouracil therapy has not been reported to the authors' knowledge.
 In this report, this rare but serious complication of treatment of condylomata acuminata is highlighted, and the literature regarding the development of non-DES-associated vaginal adenosis is discussed.
