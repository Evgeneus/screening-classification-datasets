Gastric leiomyosarcoma. Prognostic factors and surgical management.
 Information on gastric leiomyosarcoma, such as important prognostic factors, patterns of disease recurrence, and optimal methods of treatment, are derived from limited patient experience.
 We address these questions, with specific focus on whether an advantage could be demonstrated for radical resection compared with wide local excision, by retrospectively investigating 53 patients who underwent surgical treatment at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn.
 Abdominal pain and/or gastrointestinal bleeding associated with an intramural or exogastric mass were typical features of this disease.
 Only tumor size and histologic grade were statistically significant prognostic factors.
 With analysis of survival curves and patterns of recurrence, neither the addition of lymphadenectomy nor the wider tumor-free margins of a radical gastrectomy seemed superior to the more conservative local excision.
 Therefore, wide local excision remains the preferred treatment when technically feasible.
