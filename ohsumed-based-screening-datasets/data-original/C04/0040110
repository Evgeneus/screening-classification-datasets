PET measurements of hyperthermia-induced suppression of protein synthesis in tumors in relation to effects on tumor growth.
 Hyperthermia-induced metabolic changes in tumor tissue have been monitored by PET.
 Uptake of L-[1-11C]tyrosine in rhabdomyosarcoma tissue of Wag/Rij rats was dose-dependently reduced after local hyperthermia treatment at 42, 45, or 47 degrees C.
 Tumor blood flow, as measured by PET with 13NH3, appeared to be unchanged.
 The L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake data were compared to uptake data of L-[1-14C]tyrosine and with data on the incorporation of L-[1-14C]tyrosine into tumor proteins.
 After intravenous injection, the 14C data were obtained from dissected tumor tissue.
 Heat-induced inhibition of the incorporation of L-[1-14C]tyrosine into tumor proteins tallied with the L-[1-11C]tyrosine uptake data.
 Heat-induced inhibition of amino acid uptake in the tumor correlated well with regression of tumor growth.
 It is concluded that PET using L-[1-11C]tyrosine is eligible for monitoring the effect of hyperthermia on tumor growth.
