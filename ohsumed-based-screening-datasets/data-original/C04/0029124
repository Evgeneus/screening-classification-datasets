Radioimmunoassay of insulin-like growth factors in cyst fluid of central nervous system tumors.
 Tumor cells are characterized by abnormalities in growth and metabolism, including the autocrine secretion of certain growth factors.
 The authors have previously shown the presence of insulin-like growth factor receptors in tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) and in this study examine whether CNS tumors are capable of autocrine secretion of insulin-like growth factors in situ.
 To investigate the production of insulin-like growth factors I and II by CNS tumors, the authors have developed specific radioimmunoassays for these growth factors.
 In situ production of insulin-like growth factors was studied by immunoassay of CNS tumor cyst fluid aspirated at the time of surgery from 12 cystic tumors: seven primary brain tumors, four metastatic tumors, and one spinal schwannoma.
 For immunoassay, cyst fluid was treated overnight with acetic acid, then insulin-like growth factors were separated from binding proteins by a refined solid-phase technique, then dried and reconstituted in immunoassay buffer.
 Normal human serum and cerebrospinal fluid served as controls.
 Insulin-like growth factor I was detected in all 12 tumors studied.
 In contrast, insulin-like growth factor II was detected only in three low-grade astrocytomas, the spinal schwannoma (which had the highest insulin-like growth factor II level of all tumors studied), and three metastatic lung cancers.
 These results suggest that CNS tumors may be capable of autocrine production of insulin-like growth factors in situ.
 Furthermore, there appears to be a difference in the type of insulin-like growth factors produced by different types of CNS tumors.
 Preferential production of insulin-like growth factors may be an important marker of tumor differentiation and useful as a diagnostic tool.
