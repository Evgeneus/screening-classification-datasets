Normal P300 following extensive damage to the left medial temporal lobe.
 Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded during auditory and visual "oddball" tasks from a patient with a severe verbal memory deficit due to a low grade infiltrating glioma which involved the full extent of the left medial temporal lobe.
 In both sensory modalities, the patient's oddball-evoked P300s were symmetrical and of normal amplitude.
 These findings are difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that the hippocampus, or any other medial temporal structure, makes a substantial contribution to the scalp P300.
