Inferior vena caval involvement by renal cell carcinoma. Use of venovenous bypass as adjunct during resection.
 Venovenous bypass allows the safe conduct of operation during resection of renal cell carcinoma with inferior vena caval involvement by allowing venous return when the inferior vena cava is clamped, thus preventing hypotension.
 It obviates the heparin required for full cardiopulmonary bypass and therefore decreases postoperative bleeding.
 A blood retrieval system decreases the volume of banked blood required.
 A Moretz clip placed early on the intrapericardial inferior vena cava allows adequate venous return and prevents a massive pulmonary tumor embolism.
