Fusiform dilatations of the carotid artery following radical surgery of childhood craniopharyngiomas.
 Between 1982 and 1990, a series of 31 children with craniopharyngiomas underwent initial surgery at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with an attempt at total tumor removal.
 Nine (29%) of them were found to have fusiform dilatation of the supraclinoid carotid artery either at the time of surgery for recurrence (one patient) or on routine surveillance with enhanced computerized tomography 6 to 18 months postoperatively (eight patients).
 The finding of carotid enlargement was confirmed in seven cases with magnetic resonance angiography and in one case with a formal arteriogram.
 Eight of the nine patients remain alive at a mean of 3.7 years after diagnosis.
 None have experienced hemorrhage or other symptoms referrable to fusiform dilatation of the carotid artery, which is believed to result from surgical manipulation of the carotid artery.
