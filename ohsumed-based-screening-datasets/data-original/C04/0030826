Venous haemangioma of the neck and mediastinum.
 A case of cervico-mediastinal venous haemangioma with diffuse upper respiratory airway involvement is reported.
 The lesion was considered to be an ordinary supraglottic haemangioma at first.
 We recommend that adult cases of laryngeal haemangioma should be carefully examined for extra-laryngeal lesions.
