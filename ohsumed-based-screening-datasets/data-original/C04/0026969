Synovial fluid immunocytology in the diagnosis of leukemic synovitis.
 We describe a patient with leukemic synovitis complicating acute lymphoplastic leukemia.
 Leukemic cells were identified in the synovial fluid by an indirect immunofluorescent technique using monoclonal antibodies against early B cell antigens.
 Since focal leukemic lesions may be missed in synovial biopsy specimens, immunocytological analysis of joint fluids may facilitate early diagnosis of leukemic arthritis.
