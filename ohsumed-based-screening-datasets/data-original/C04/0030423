Evaluation of neck lymph node dissection for thoracic esophageal carcinoma 
 We studied a series of 150 patients treated for thoracic esophageal carcinoma at our institution.
 The patients were divided into two matched groups.
 Group B underwent transthoracic esophagectomy with mediastinal and abdominal lymphadenectomy only; group A also underwent bilateral neck lymph node dissection.
 The rates of operative mortality and operative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups.
 The 5-year survival rate was 38.7% overall (48.7% in group A and 33.7% in group B).
 Group A had a significantly better survival curve than group B.
 Twenty patients (26.0%) in group A had metastasis in the dissected neck lymph nodes.
 The 4-year survival rate of these patients was 47.9%.
 The significantly better survival of group A and the satisfactory prognosis in the patients with positive cervical lymph nodes demonstrates the effectiveness of neck lymph node dissection in radical operation for thoracic esophageal carcinoma.
