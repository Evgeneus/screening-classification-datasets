Patterns of epithelial migration in the unaffected ear in patients with a history of unilateral cholesteatoma.
 Epithelial migration in a centrifugal manner is an established phenomenon in the normal human tympanic membrane.
 This pattern of migration is symmetrical in both ears of any one individual.
 We present a prospective study on the pattern of tympanic ink dot migration on the normal drum, in patients with a history of cholesteatoma in one ear.
 It was demonstrated that patients who develop cholesteatoma have a normal migratory pattern and rate in the unaffected ear.
 The conclusion from this study is that defective migration is not the initiating factor in the development of acquired cholesteatoma.
