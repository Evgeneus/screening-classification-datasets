Laryngeal papillomas: histomorphometric evaluation of multiple and solitary lesions.
 Laryngeal papillomas from 20 patients (162 papillomas) were subjected to histomorphometric analysis: Based on clinical parameters, the papillomas were divided into juvenile multiple papillomas, adult multiple papillomas and adult solitary papillomas.
 The volume fractions of basal cells, koilocytes and nuclei as well as the mean nuclear volume were determined for each group.
 Significant differences between the 3 groups were not found and it is therefore concluded that they all represent the same basic lesion.
