MR evaluation of CNS tumors: dose comparison study with gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol.
 In phase II and III trials of gadoteridol (Gd-HP-D03A), a new nonionic, low-osmolar contrast agent, 40 patients with intracranial neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with experimental doses of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg.
 Fifteen patients also underwent contrast studies with the standard dose (0.1 mmol/kg) of gadopentetate dimeglumine.
 Both gadopentetate dimeglumine and gadoteridol appear to have a similar effect when given in equal doses (0.1 mmol/kg, n = 5).
 Lesion enhancement and delineation were better at higher experimental doses (0.2 or 0.3 mmol/kg, n = 7) and worse at a lower experimental dose (0.05 mmol/kg, n = 3).
 Quantitative analysis of 10 lesions examined with identical imaging protocols revealed a directly proportional relationship (r = .975) between lesion contrast ratio and dose over a range of 0.05-0.3 mmol/kg.
 Phantom experiments support the clinical results.
 Improved enhancement, detection, and delineation of central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms resulting from increased injected doses of gadoteridol have the potential to be clinically significant and may justify the possibly higher cost of increased contrast material dosage.
 Lower doses may not be adequate for the evaluation of most CNS tumors.
