Primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the iris.
 We describe herein a 4-year-old girl with primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the right iris.
 Malignant cells were aspirated from the aqueous humor, and the eye was enucleated 7 months after the tumor appeared.
 To our knowledge, only two cases of primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the iris have been reported.
 Both of these patients received radiation therapy prior to enucleation.
