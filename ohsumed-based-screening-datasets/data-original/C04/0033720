Cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis in Coats' disease.
 A 28-year-old man with unilateral Coats' disease and cystoid macular edema secondary to juxtafoveolar telangiectasis underwent successful juxtafoveolar argon green laser photocoagulation therapy with resolution of the edema and improvement in metamorphopsia and visual acuity.
 Despite this success, the effect of laser therapy in these patients remains uncertain.
 It should be considered only after detailed discussion with the patient about the possibility of posttreatment paracentral scotomata and the alternative of a reasonable period of observation for possible spontaneous resolution of the edema.
