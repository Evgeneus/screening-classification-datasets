Fibrocystic disease of the breast in premenopausal women: histohormonal correlation and response to luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analog treatment.
 Sixty-six patients with fibrocystic mastopathy were enrolled in the trial after being selected according to clinical, radioultrasonographic, and histologic criteria.
 No characteristic hormonal profile was noted in most patients (52%).
 Estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors, or both, were found in 57% of patients.
 Hormone receptor levels were correlated with atypical proliferative mastopathy (87.5%).
 Mastopathy was associated with a uterine fibroma or a fibromatous uterus in 73% of cases.
 All patients received intramuscular injections of a sustained delivery system (microcapsules) of luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist [D-Trp6]-LHRH, Ipsen-Biotech, Paris) for 3 to 6 months.
 In case of partial response at 3 months, an antiestrogen (tamoxifen, 40 mg/day, for estrogen receptor-predominant lesions) or a progestin (cyproterone acetate, 50 mg/day, for progesterone receptor-predominant lesions) was added to the luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist.
 A complete response was observed in more than half of the patients (n = 35, 53%) treated by [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone (n = 29) or associated with tamoxifen (n = 4) or cyproterone acetate (n = 2).
 A significant partial response was observed in 30 other patients (45%).
 Additionally, half of them received inhibitory drugs.
 The best responses were seen with cyst reformation (complete response, 100%) and fibrous block.
 Clinical responses to treatment with [D-Trp6]-LHRH alone were independent of hormone receptor status, but synergistic effects occurred with concomitant use of the corresponding inhibitory drugs.
 We conclude that chronic mastopathy, particularly when associated with uterine fibroma, can be successfully treated by luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogs in premenopausal women.
