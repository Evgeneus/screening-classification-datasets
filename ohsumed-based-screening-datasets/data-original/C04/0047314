Extramedullary nasal plasmacytoma.
 The literature on this rare tumour has been reviewed and three cases of nasal plasmacytoma are described.
 Immunohistochemistry demonstrated cytoplasmic IgA and Kappa determinants in all cases.
 Two patients are disease-free at the present time, the third developed an IgG-k multiple myeloma, previously not described in the literature.
