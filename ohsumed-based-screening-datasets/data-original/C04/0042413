Haemangioma of the urinary tract: review of the literature.
 General features.
 Haemangiomas are benign vascular tumours.
 They can regress spontaneously as a result of fibrosclerosis, suggesting a conservative approach wherever possible.
 Asymptomatic haemangiomas do not require treatment.
 Renal haemangioma.
 In all, 198 cases have been reported.
 The lesion is usually solitary and unilateral and occurs most often in the pyramid, and in the mucosa or subepithelial tissue of the pelvis.
 In some cases a tentative diagnosis of haemangioma has been made by means of selective renal angiography and pre- or per-operative renoscopy.
 Partial nephrectomy is recommended in cases of minor haemangioma.
 Ureteric haemangioma.
 Six cases have been described.
 When haemangioma is suspected a conservative operation is recommended.
 Bladder haemangioma.
 A total of 106 cases have been reported.
 Many of the tumours had the characteristics of an iceberg, with considerable extravesical extension making endoscopic management less suitable because of the possibility of massive haemorrhage or recurrence.
 Consequently, many authors prefer local excision.
 In the case of endoscopic treatment the patient should be prepared for open surgery.
 Urethral haemangioma.
 Twenty cases have been described.
 The lesions often extend further than is immediately apparent.
 Endoscopic management is recommended for small lesions and, in the case of more extensive lesions, open exploration is advised followed by appropriate urethral reconstruction.
