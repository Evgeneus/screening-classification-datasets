The epithelial changes associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva: a review of the clinical, histological and viral findings in 78 women.
 Seventy-eight excised specimens of squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were reviewed retrospectively for the presence of lichen sclerosus or vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) at sites proximal to the tumour or more distant.
 Lichen sclerosus was evident in 61% and VIN alone in 31%.
 VIN III (differentiated) was associated with over 50% of the specimens with lichen sclerosus.
 HPV 16 was found in six of the 11 VIN lesions, investigated but in none of the six with lichen sclerosus.
