Management of osteogenic sarcoma in children and adolescents.
 The management of osteogenic sarcoma in children has made a fantastic step on the survival rate, but there still remains unexpected late metastatic recurrence even in initially good responders to chemotherapy and lower survival rate in the bad responder group.
 Therefore, the research on etiology and on the understanding and rating of oncologic power of the tumoral cells as well as other kinds of treatment (vaccine, immunotherapy, and other types of chemotherapy) must be increased.
 The initial function after replacement is good and is often excellent but increasing deterioration is noticed during each follow-up evaluation.
 A considerable effort is still to be done for bone and joint replacement.
 Biocompatible material with mechanical strength and resistance to wear will be used for a long time because of the young age of the patients.
 There must be better use and understanding of the allograft revascularization, as well as a better biologic connection between the bone host and replacement device.
 This will probably be used in the future with less cement and more of a modular system.
 The final prognosis will remain for a long time in the perfect cooperation between the various members of the teams (oncologist, surgeon, imager, pathologist, and research team) who treat the patients.
