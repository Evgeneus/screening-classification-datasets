Glomus tumours of the skin: an immunohistochemical investigation of the expression of marker proteins.
 Immunohistochemical studies were carried out on cutaneous glomus tumours from 10 patients.
 The glomus areas in these tumours reacted strongly with anti-smooth muscle (CGA-7), anti-muscle (HHF-35) and anti-vimentin antibodies.
 Their neural supply was analysed using several nervous tissue markers (anti-neurone specific enolase, anti-S 100, anti-Leu 7, anti-neurofilaments).
 The results indicate a sprouting and proliferation rather than entrapment of pre-existing nerve fibres.
