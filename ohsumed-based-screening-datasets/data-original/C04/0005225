Metastatic tumors of the umbilicus: a review 1830-1989.
 Umbilical metastases from known and unknown primary cancers are rare.
 The eponym "Sister Mary Joseph's nodule" has been used by generations of physicians.
 The first reports of this clinical sign were from Walshe in 1846.
 A review of the literature revealed 265 cases from then until 1989.
 Only 85 cases of umbilical metastasis from unknown primary tumors were found.
 This review should help us to focus on the common and uncommon primary sites in the diagnosis of patients with this finding.
 A single case report and the work-up for the hidden primary tumor are described.
