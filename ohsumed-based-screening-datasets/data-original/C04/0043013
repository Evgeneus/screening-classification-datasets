Pathologic review of consecutive radical prostatectomy specimens. Nerve sparing versus nonnerve sparing.
 Retrospective pathologic analysis was conducted of specimens from 88 radical retropubic prostatectomy operations performed between 1982 and 1987 inclusive.
 The median age of patients was sixty years (range, 46 to 73 years).
 Of the 88 radical prostatectomies performed, 51 were nerve-sparing (40 bilateral) and 37 were nonnerve-sparing (11 unilateral) procedures.
 Preoperative clinical staging was similar in both groups.
 Thirty-five of 37 patients (95%) in nonnerve-staging group and 51 of 51 patients (100%) in nerve-sparing group had clinical Stage B2 disease or less.
 Pathologic staging in both groups was also similar.
 In 26 of 37 patients (70%) in nonnerve-sparing group and in 35 of 51 patients (69%) in nerve-sparing group, disease remained localized to the prostate.
 Both groups were analyzed retrospectively to determine whether or not the incidences of microinvasion of capsule and of extraprostatic disease differed.
 Review of the apical and lateral margins of the specimens revealed no statistically significant difference in either the degree of microinvasion of capsule or the incidence of extraprostatic disease between the groups.
