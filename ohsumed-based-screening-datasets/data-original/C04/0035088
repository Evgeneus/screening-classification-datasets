Acantholytic dyskeratotic epidermal naevus in a patient with guttate psoriasis on PUVA therapy.
 A 79-year-old male with psoriasis developed a zosteriform acantholytic dyskeratotic epidermal naevus during PUVA therapy.
 The eruption was successfully treated with etretinate 0.75 mg/kg/day and a subsequent course of PUVA with the affected area covered prevented a recurrence of the naevus.
