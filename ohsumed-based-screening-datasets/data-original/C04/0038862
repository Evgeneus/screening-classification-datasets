Osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck. The UCLA experience.
 Eighteen cases of osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck were treated at our institution between 1955 and 1987.
 The patients' ages ranged from 5 to 73 years, with a median age of 28 years.
 The sex distribution was equal.
 Follow-up ranged from 1 to 276 months, with a median of 79 months.
 The primary site of the tumor was the mandible in nine cases, maxilla and paranasal sinuses in six, skull in two, and orbit in one.
 Six of 18 patients were free of disease with greater than 5 years of follow-up.
 Four of the six received combined surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy as their primary treatment.
 Of the five patients treated with surgery alone, four suffered recurrences, one of whom was salvaged with further surgery and chemotherapy.
 Five patients were treated initially without surgery.
 They received radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy; all five developed local recurrence.
 We conclude that osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck is an aggressive tumor, prone to both local and distant failure.
 Based on our series and from published experience involving the extremities, osteogenic sarcoma of the head and neck should be managed with multimodality therapy.
