Management of verrucous carcinoma of the larynx.
 Eight patients with a verrucous carcinoma of the larynx have been seen at the Charing Cross Hospital between 1970 and 1985.
 Seven patients were treated by primary radiotherapy and one by primary endoscopic laser excision.
 Four of those treated with radiotherapy developed recurrent disease which was treated by radical surgery in three and by endoscopic laser excision in one.
 The place of radiotherapy in the management of this condition requires further evaluation in view of the high rate of recurrence.
 Endoscopic laser excision may be a reasonable alternative to more radical surgery in this highly differentiated neoplasm.
