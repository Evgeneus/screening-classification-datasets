Antisense-mediated reduction in thrombospondin reverses the malignant phenotype of a human squamous carcinoma.
 Thrombospondin (TSP) is a trimeric glycoprotein which is synthesized and incorporated into the extracellular matrix by a wide variety of cells.
 TSP is involved in a number of cellular processes which govern tumor cell behavior including mitogenesis, attachment, migration, and differentiation.
 To directly assess the role of TSP in tumor cell growth and spread, a human squamous carcinoma cell line, with high TSP production and an invasive phenotype, was transfected with a TSP cDNA antisense expression vector.
 Five unique transfected clones were obtained with reduced TSP production.
 Expression of the transfected antisense sequence in these clones was verified by a ribonuclease protection assay.
 These clones demonstrated reduced growth rates in vitro when compared with a vector transfected control.
 After subcutaneous inoculation into athymic mice, the antisense clones formed either no tumors or tumors that were slow growing and highly differentiated.
 This contrasted with the vector-transfected clone which produced poorly differentiated, rapidly growing, invasive tumors.
 Our results argue in favor of a direct role for TSP in determining the malignant phenotype of certain human tumors.
