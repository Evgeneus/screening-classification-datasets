Endometrial ablation for the treatment of menorrhagia: a comparison of patients with normal, enlarged, and fibroid uteri.
 One hundred sixty-one patients underwent endometrial ablation with the Nd:YAG laser for the treatment of refractory menorrhagia.
 Patients were divided into one of three groups: those with a normal-sized uterus; those with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm); and those with uterine fibroids, which had been documented clinically, ultrasonographically, or by a combination of hysteroscopy and laparoscopy or by one or the other.
 All patients were considered candidates for hysterectomy.
 Both preoperatively and postoperatively, patients monitored their menstrual cycles and evaluated their flow according to predetermined categories of amenorrhea, light flow, normal flow, heavy flow, and severe flow.
 After treatment, 68% of patients with normal-sized uterus and 91% of patients with an enlarged uterus (greater than 10 cm) and 88% of patients with uterine fibroids became amenorrheic or had light flow.
 None of the patients in this last group have had to undergo hysterectomy.
 This study indicates that the patient with an enlarged or fibroid uterus may not have contraindications for endometrial ablation.
 Endometrial ablation may be effective in at least temporarily controlling bleeding in those patients with enlarged or myomatous uterus.
