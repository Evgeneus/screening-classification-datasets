alpha Fetoprotein producing early gastric cancer with liver metastasis: report of three cases.
 Three cases of alpha fetoprotein producing early gastric cancer are presented.
 Liver metastases occurred in all patients shortly after curative gastrectomy and all died within two years.
 The incidence of liver metastasis was significantly higher than that in alpha fetoprotein negative early gastric carcinoma (p less than 0.001).
 The incidences of lymph node metastasis and invasion in lymph vessels and veins were also substantially higher in this group of patients.
 Two radical hepatic resections, including extended right lobectomy, were performed on one patient but the tumour recurred immediately.
