A comparison of tocopherol and tocotrienol for the chemoprevention of chemically induced rat mammary tumors.
 Two forms of vitamin E, tocopherol and tocotrienol, were tested for chemopreventive activity in two chemically induced rat mammary-tumor models.
 When mammary tumors were induced by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA, 50 mg/kg), only the tocotrienol group had a statistically significant increase in tumor latency.
 There was no effect of either compound on tumor multiplicity.
 When tumors were induced by N-nitrosomethylurea (NMU, 30 mg/kg), neither analogue of vitamin E modified latency, whereas tocotrienol increased tumor multiplicity.
 In summary, neither vitamin analog had a major impact on mammary-tumor development after tumor induction with either DMBA or NMU.
