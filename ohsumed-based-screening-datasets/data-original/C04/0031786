Primary angiosarcoma of the central nervous system. Study of eight cases and review of the literature.
 Angiosarcoma arising in the central or peripheral nervous system has rarely been reported.
 Eight patients with primary angiosarcoma of the central nervous system are described here; these included five males and three females ranging in age from 2 weeks to 72 years (mean 38 years).
 Of the eight neoplasms, six were located in the cerebral hemispheres and one was in the meninges; the site was unknown in the other.
 All patients underwent surgical resection.
 Five of the eight patients died, four within 4 months after surgery and one after 30 months.
 Two of the remaining three patients were 17 and 27 years old at the time of diagnosis and were alive at follow-up review 39 and 102 months after surgery, respectively.
 One patient was lost to follow-up monitoring.
 Microscopically, all eight tumors demonstrated a well-differentiated pattern with irregular vascular channels and intraluminal papillae; in addition, four showed poorly differentiated solid areas.
 Immunohistochemical staining of neoplastic cells to factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus agglutinin I was performed in five tumors and was focally positive in four.
 No correlation could be shown between the histological features and the growth and biological behavior of the tumors.
