cis-platinum ototoxicity in children.
 Despite the recognized ototoxicity of cis-platinum, a clinical outline for the audiologic evaluation of patients receiving this drug has not been clearly defined.
 In a practical approach to this problem, the audiograms of 48 pediatric patients referred for monitoring during planned cis-platinum therapy were reviewed.
 Eleven patients tested with auditory brain-stem response (ABR) audiometry demonstrated several limitations of this modality.
 Fourteen children underwent initial ABR testing followed by at least two pure-tone audiograms.
 The remaining 23 patients had their hearing evaluated by pure-tone audiometry only.
 Various factors such as patient age, cis-platinum dosage, and cranial radiation exposure were analyzed for apparent effect.
 Younger patients tended to be more susceptible to audiologic changes with the administration of cis-platinum.
 The proportion of patients who demonstrated a hearing loss increased with successive dosing as did the severity of the hearing loss.
 Prior exposure to cranial radiation was strongly linked to the development of hearing loss following cis-platinum therapy.
 Guidelines are presented regarding the use of clinical audiometry in the screening of these pediatric oncology patients.
