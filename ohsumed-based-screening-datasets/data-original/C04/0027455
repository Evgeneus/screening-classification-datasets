In vitro activities of acridone alkaloids against Pneumocystis carinii.
 Acridone alkaloids isolated from plants of the family Rutaceae have antiplasmodial activity in rodent models of malaria.
 Because a variety of antimalarial agents have also been shown to have activity against Pneumocystis carinii, we tested six of these alkaloids in an established culture model for P.
 carinii.
 Atalaphillinine and glycobismine A inhibited growth of cultured P.
 carinii at concentrations of 2.7 and 1.7 microM, respectively.
 This potency of effect is similar to that of chloroquine (3 microM) but somewhat less than that of primaquine (0.4 microM), which was previously evaluated in the same system.
