Intracerebral Hodgkin's disease in a human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patient.
 Intracerebral involvement of Hodgkin's disease (HD) is rarely described, with only 42 cases in the literature.
 Since the outbreak of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic, there has been an increasing number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected (HIV+) persons who have diffuse non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and, more recently, atypical aggressive HD.
 The authors report the case of a patient with a history of intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) and Stage IVB HD who, after a drug-induced clinical remission, had intracerebral mixed-cellularity HD.
 This appears to be the first report of intracerebral HD in a person who is HIV+.
