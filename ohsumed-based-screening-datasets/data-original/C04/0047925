Interleukin 4 promotes expression of mast cell ICAM-1 antigen.
 Cell recognition molecules play a crucial role in the regulation of immune cells.
 We recently found that mast cells (MCs) express leukocyte recognition molecules, including ICAM-1 antigen, a natural ligand of LFA-1.
 We here report that interleukin 4 (IL-4), a pleiotropic cytokine and mast cell differentiation factor, selectively promotes expression of surface ICAM-1 antigen and ICAM-1 mRNA in human MCs.
 IL-4 also up-regulates ICAM-1 antigen in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage but has no effect on ICAM-1 antigen expressed on basophils, fibroblasts, or lymphocytes.
 The increase in expression of mast cell/macrophage ICAM-1 antigen induced by IL-4 may contribute to the accumulation of leukocytes and facilitate cell-contact-dependent regulation of immune cells in inflamed tissues.
