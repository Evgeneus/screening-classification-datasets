Bladder outlet obstruction treated with transurethral ultrasonic aspiration. One-year follow-up on 59 patients.
 Fifty-nine males with bladder outlet obstruction were treated with transurethral ultrasonic aspiration of the prostate.
 Utilizing a 26.5F urethral sheath, surgery was accomplished with a 10F, 0-700-micron-vibration-level ultrasonic tip with an excursion rate of 39 kHz.
 Complete removal of the adenoma was accomplished followed by transurethral electrocautery biopsies of both lateral lobes to compare pathologic specimens.
 One year follow-up revealed satisfactory voiding patterns in 57 of 59 men (96%).
 Bladder neck contractures developed in 2 men.
 Pathologic comparisons showed 100 percent correlation between aspirated and TUR specimens (56 BPH, 3 adenocarcinoma).
 Forty-seven men were active sexually preoperatively (6 with inflatable penile prostheses).
 Post ultrasonic aspiration, 46 men had erectile function similar to preoperative levels with 1 patient suffering erectile dysfunction.
 Forty men (85%) had antegrade ejaculation while 7 (15%) experienced retrograde or retarded ejaculation.
 No patients were incontinent.
