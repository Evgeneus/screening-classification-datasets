Transcriptional regulation of c-jun gene expression by arabinofuranosylcytosine in human myeloid leukemia cells.
 Previous studies have demonstrated that 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) induces terminal differentiation of human myeloid leukemia cells.
 Other studies have shown that the c-jun protooncogene is expressed during phorbol ester-induced myeloid differentiation.
 This work examines the effects of ara-C on c-jun gene expression in human KG-1 myeloid leukemia cells.
 The results demonstrate that c-jun transcripts are undetectable in uninduced KG-1 cells and that ara-C induces expression of this gene in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.
 Ara-C treatment was also associated with increases in c-jun transcripts in U-937, THP-1, and HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells.
 Furthermore, transcriptional run-on analysis has demonstrated that exposure to ara-C increases the rate of c-jun gene transcription.
 The results also demonstrate that while inhibition of protein synthesis superinduces c-jun mRNA levels in phorbol ester-treated KG-1 cells, cycloheximide had no effect on the induction of c-jun transcripts during ara-C treatment.
 Moreover, the half-life of c-jun transcripts in ara-C-treated KG-1 cells was 42 min.
 These findings suggest that the increase in c-jun mRNA observed during ara-C treatment is regulated by a transcriptional mechanism, and that c-jun may be involved in the induction of differentiation and regulation of gene expression by ara-C.
