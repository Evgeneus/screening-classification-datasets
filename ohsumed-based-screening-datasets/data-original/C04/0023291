Biliary and pancreatic metastases of breast carcinoma: is surgical palliation indicated?
 Obstructive jaundice developed in a patient concomitantly with the diagnosis of breast carcinoma.
 Abdominal exploration disclosed a metastatic tumor in the head of the pancreas, the distal bile duct, and the gallbladder.
 A cholecystectomy and choledochojejunostomy were performed and later, because of intestinal obstruction, the patient underwent gastrojejunostomy.
 Pathological examination demonstrated metastatic lobular carcinoma of breast with strongly positive staining for estradiol.
 Additional hormonal therapy has been given to the patient since the operation.
 The patient is alive 16 months after the diagnosis of her disease.
 This case suggests that a vigorous diagnostic approach should be adopted in every jaundiced patient with metastatic breast cancer in order to exclude causes of jaundice other than diffuse metastatic involvement of the liver.
 Patients with extrahepatic biliary metastasis should be treated by aggressive surgical treatment, combined with systemic therapy which can offer them significant palliation and better survival.
