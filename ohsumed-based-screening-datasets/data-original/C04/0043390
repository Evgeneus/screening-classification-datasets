Excision of exposed cartilage for management of Mohs surgery defects of the ear.
 Cartilage of the ear is often exposed during Mohs surgical procedures.
 Fenestration of the cartilage with a skin punch has been recommended to stimulate granulation tissue where the perichondrium has been destroyed.
 This article describes an alternative method--the excision of a window through the exposed cartilage, fully exposing the perichondrium on the other side of the cartilage.
 This promotes the rapid healing by second intention or provides a vascular bed for immediate skin grafting.
 Also, aggressive excision of nonviable cartilage helps prevent chondritis or perichondritis.
