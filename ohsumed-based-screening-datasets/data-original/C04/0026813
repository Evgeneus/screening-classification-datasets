Is there a link between fluoridated water and osteosarcoma?
 To test the hypothesis that fluoride is a risk factor for osteosarcoma, a case control study compared the complete residential fluoride histories of osteosarcoma patients with matched hospital-based controls.
 Fluoridation was not found to be a risk factor for osteosarcoma in the study population.
 The trend in the data from this small sample study suggests the hypothesis that a protective effect may exist against the formation of osteosarcoma for individuals consuming fluoridated water.
