Liver metastases: results of percutaneous ethanol injection in 14 patients.
 Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) was performed under ultrasound (US) guidance in the outpatient department in 14 patients with 21 metastases 1.0-3.8 cm in diameter.
 The primary cancer was colorectal adenocarcinoma (seven patients), adenocarcinoma of the stomach (four patients), abdominal leiomyosarcoma (one patient), gastrinoma of unknown origin (one patient), and bronchial carcinoid (one patient).
 The indicators of therapeutic efficacy were US, computed tomography, fine-needle biopsy, and serologic markers.
 No complications occurred after a total of 175 treatment sessions.
 Complete response was obtained in 11 lesions, nine of which were less than 2 cm in diameter, and in all endocrine metastases (four lesions in two patients) with a maximum, recurrence-free follow-up of 38 months.
 Carcinoembryonic antigen values decreased in all patients but one for a 2-6-month period.
 The natural course of metastatic disease strictly limits the applicability of PEI, a local treatment.
 Single, metachronous, nonoperable metastasis of adenocarcinoma and endocrine metastases seem to be the only indications for PEI.
