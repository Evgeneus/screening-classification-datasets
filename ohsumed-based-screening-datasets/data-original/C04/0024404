Bronchial carcinoid tumors: assessment with CT of location and intratumoral calcification in 31 patients.
 Bronchial carcinoid tumors (BCT) have long been regarded as predominantly central and rarely calcified.
 The authors retrospectively reviewed computed tomographic (CT) findings in 31 patients (thin-section CT studies in 18) who were seen at their institution with the histopathologic diagnosis of BCT (27 typical, four atypical) during the years 1978-1989.
 Eighteen BCT (58%) were central and 13 (42%) peripheral, with peripheral defined as located more than 2 cm distal to the origin of the appropriate segmental bronchus.
 CT scans revealed varied patterns of calcification in seven (39%) of the 18 central BCT and in one (8%) of the 13 peripheral BCT (P less than .1); overall, CT scans revealed calcification in eight (26%) of the BCT.
 The eight calcified tumors were each of the typical histopathologic type.
 Peripheral BCT (42%) were nearly as common as central BCT (58%), and CT detection of calcification in BCT was not uncommon (39% of central lesions; 26%, overall).
