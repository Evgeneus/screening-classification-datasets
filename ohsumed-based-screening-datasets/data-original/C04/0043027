Multielement analysis of kidney tissue with renal calculi.
 Tissue distribution and concentration gradients of macro- and micro-elements in the papilla, medulla, and cortex of human kidney with renal calculi were measured with spectrometer.
 An uninvolved portion of the hypernephroma kidney was used as control.
 Cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), and molybdenum (Mo) were least in amount in renal papilla as compared with the cortex and medulla in renal stone kidney.
 Overall there was less Mo in stone kidney tissue, and also significantly less when compared with that of control renal papilla.
 Considering the reported fact that Mo was found in high concentrations in urinary tract stones and our data that Mo was less in stone kidney, it is speculated that Mo may play some unexplained but significant role in certain stage(s) of the stone formation.
