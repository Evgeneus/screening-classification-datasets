Transformation of T lymphocytes by the v-fos oncogene.
 Activation of T lymphocytes through the T cell antigen receptor has been shown to stimulate a rapid and transient accumulation of c-fos mRNA and protein.
 Transfection of a normal murine T lymphocyte clone with the FBJ-v-fos oncogene resulted in generation of a cell line that was morphologically transformed, had lost the requirement for IL-2 for proliferation, and was tumorigenic in adult syngeneic mice; however, the transformed cells retained the ability to proliferate in response to IL-2.
 The transformed cells did not show constitutive expression of IL-2 or c-fos mRNA, although the promoter regions of both IL-2 and c-fos genes contain AP-1 sites that are expected to be targets for binding of Fos/Jun complexes.
 In contrast, the transformed T cells showed increased constitutive expression of IL-2R alpha and c-myc mRNA; these genes may represent cellular targets for transformation by v-fos and physiologic activation by c-fos.
 We discuss the possibility that these transformed cells behave as cells partially activated through the TCR, and that transformation occurs through a mechanism independent of IL-2.
