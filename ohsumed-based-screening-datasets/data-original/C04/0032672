Congenital anomalies in children of patients who received chemotherapy for cancer in childhood and adolescence.
 BACKGROUND.
 Many patients who have been treated successfully for childhood cancer with regimens that contain one or more mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents are concerned that their own treatment during childhood or adolescence may adversely affect their children.
 METHODS.
 To determine the effect of chemotherapy for cancer during childhood and adolescence on the outcome of subsequent pregnancies, we reviewed the records of 306 men and women who had been treated for pediatric cancer and who responded to our questionnaire.
 One hundred of the 306 patients reported 202 pregnancies.
 Among the patients who had received chemotherapy as part of their treatment for cancer, 60 patients or wives of patients had had one or more pregnancies of 20 or more weeks' gestation.
 The 60 former patients had a total of 100 live-born and 2 stillborn children.
 RESULTS.
 The frequency of congenital anomalies was 8.1 percent (5 of 62) among the live-born children of the women and 7.9 percent (3 of 38) among the live-born children of the men.
 Structural congenital cardiac defects were identified in 10.0 percent (2 of 20) of the children of women who had been treated with dactinomycin, as compared with 0.6 percent (144 of 24,153) among the children in a multicenter survey of fetal anomalies (P = 0.0126).
 We found no relation between the number of mutagens received or the cumulative dose of any agent received and the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 These data suggest that treatment of children and adolescents with mutagenic chemotherapeutic agents, in the dose ranges we examined, does not increase the frequency of congenital anomalies in the children subsequently born to the former patients.
 However, the possible adverse effect of dactinomycin on the children of such patients requires further study.
