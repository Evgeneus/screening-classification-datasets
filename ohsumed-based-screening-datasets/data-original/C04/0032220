Stage IB squamous cell cancer of the cervix: clinicopathologic features related to survival.
 Three hundred forty-five patients with stage IB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1970 through 1985.
 The overall cumulative 5-year survival was 89%.
 The clinical characteristics included mean age 44.6 years, nulliparity 10%, married 93%, obese 38%, hypertension 32%, diabetes mellitus 5%, smoking 54%, symptoms of bleeding 68%, positive cytologic smear 83%.
 Lymph nodes were diseased in 45 of 261 (17%) with 26 unilateral (10%) and 19 bilateral (7%).
 Tumor differentiation showed: grade 1, 112 (33%); grade 2, 144 (42%); grade 3, 86 (25%).
 Factors that did not influence survival included age, presence or absence of positive cervical cytologic smear, the interval from previous papanicolaou smear, hypertension, smoking history, patient's blood type, and transfusion at radical hysterectomy.
 In all patients survival was significantly influenced by the following features: tumor classified as well differentiated (95%) or poorly differentiated (82%); tumor size less than 3 cm (91%) or greater than 3 cm (76%); negative lymph nodes (93%) or positive lymph nodes (61%).
 When three or fewer lymph nodes were involved, the survival was 79% compared with 33% when four or more lymph nodes were involved.
 In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival was significantly influenced by the amount of residual cervical disease: no residual disease, 100%; less than 50% penetration, 96%; greater than 50% penetration, 83%.
 Involvement of the lower uterine segment reduced survival to 73% compared with 95% when the lower segment was uninvolved.
 One hundred seventeen patients without angiolymphatic invasion had a 97% cumulative 5-year survival whereas 70 patients without disease in the lymph nodes but with angiolymphatic invasion had an 88% cumulative 5-year survival rate.
 A Cox model, multiple proportional hazard analysis was performed for all patients, and the factors that influenced survival included tumor grade, tumor size, presence of metastatic disease in the lymph nodes, and diabetes mellitus.
 In patients undergoing radiation therapy, the tumor grade and size were significant factors in survival.
 In patients undergoing radical hysterectomy, survival was influenced by the depth of cervical penetration and lower uterine segment involvement whereas the tumor grade, tumor size, patient's age, and removal of ovaries were not significant.
