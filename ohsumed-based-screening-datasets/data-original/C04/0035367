A phase II trial of intraperitoneal cisplatin and etoposide as salvage treatment for minimal residual ovarian carcinoma.
 We conducted a phase II study of intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP-16) as salvage therapy in patients with ovarian cancer who had persistent disease or who had relapsed after primary systemic chemotherapy and had residual disease of less than 2 cm.
 Two hundred eleven courses of IP chemotherapy consisting of CDDP 200 mg/m2 and VP-16 350 mg/m2 were administered.
 All patients received intravenous (IV) thiosulfate protection.
 Treatment was given once every 4 weeks for a median of six cycles.
 Twenty-four of 37 assessable patients were clinically free of disease at the end of treatment (normal physical exam, computed tomographic [CT] scan, CA-125 and peritoneal cytology); one patient had a partial response.
 Ten of these 24 patients consented to reexploration at the end of treatment, and nine were in pathologic complete remission, while one patient had positive peritoneal washings as her only evidence of persistent disease.
 The median survival of the 37 patients was 26 months from the first day of IP treatment and 51 months from diagnosis.
 The major toxicity was myelosuppression, with median nadir WBC, granulocyte, and platelet counts of 2,400, 684, and 134,000/mm3, respectively.
 There was no cumulative renal damage, hypomagnesemia, or chemical peritonitis.
 We conclude that IP CDDP and VP-16 can produce pathologic complete remissions when used as a second-line regimen for patients with ovarian cancer who have received systemic cisplatin-based therapy and have less than 2 cm disease.
