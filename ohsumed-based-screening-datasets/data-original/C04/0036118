Survival of cancer of the larynx related to treatment.
 Analysis of 3445 cases of cancer of the larynx has been made with reference to primary (first) and secondary treatments.
 It is easy to confirm that while radiotherapy is inferior to laryngectomy in the cure of larger glottic tumours, it is preferable in many cases because salvage surgery is possible and successful.
 Salvage surgery cannot be shown to be successful in larger supraglottic tumours, which should be considered for primary surgery.
 Radiotherapy appears better than surgery for small tumours.
