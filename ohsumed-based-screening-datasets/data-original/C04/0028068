MR imaging evaluation of endometrial carcinoma: results of an NCI cooperative study.
 A prospective study to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma was undertaken by five institutions under the auspices of the National Cancer Institute.
 Six different MR imagers were used, ranging in magnetic field strength from 0.15 T to 1.5 T.
 For each unit, appropriate T1- and T2-weighted sequences in the transverse plane and T2-weighted sequences in the sagittal plane were used.
 Initially, 107 patients were entered in the study, but only 88 fulfilled all the criteria and provide the basis for this study.
 The abnormality within the endometrial cavity was demonstrated with MR imaging in 81% of the patients.
 The overall accuracy with MR imaging for staging endometrial carcinoma was 85%.
 In the evaluation of depth of myometrial invasion for stage I disease, overall accuracy with MR imaging was 74%.
 The accuracy of MR imaging in assessing tumors confined to endometrium or tumor with superficial myometrial invasion was 89% and decreased to 54% in assessing deep myometrial invasion.
 The results of this prospective study performed by multiple examiners with vastly different equipment demonstrate the inherent value of MR imaging in the evaluation of this neoplasm.
