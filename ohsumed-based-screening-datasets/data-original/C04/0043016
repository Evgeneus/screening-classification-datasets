Primary adenocarcinoma of bladder.
 Between April 1983 and December 1987, we have treated and followed 16 patients at the University of Southern California for adenocarcinoma of the bladder.
 In 10 patients, the cancer originated from a nonurachal source; all underwent radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion.
 The other 6 patients had an apparent urachal origin of their cancer.
 Half of these patients were treated with radical cystectomy and urinary diversion and half were treated initially with segmental cystectomy.
 Presenting characteristics (age, sex ratio, and symptoms) were similar for both groups.
 Three-year adjusted acturial tumor-free survival rates for the two groups were 48 percent and 31 percent, respectively.
 We advocate an aggressive approach of radical cystectomy, bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection, and urinary diversion for all invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder, regardless of location.
