Patterns of gene expression that characterize the colonic mucosa in patients at genetic risk for colonic cancer.
 We have used a computer-driven scanning and image-processing system to identify a panel of 30 cDNA clones whose pattern of expression in individual biopsy specimens distinguishes the flat, normal-appearing colonic mucosa of patients in two genetic groups at high risk for development of colorectal cancer from that of normal colonic mucosa in low-risk individuals.
 The two high-risk groups, familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer, are indistinguishable based on the pattern of expression of the 30 selected clones.
 This suggests that the extensive pleiotropic effects of the inherited loci, which may play an important role in the mechanism of increased risk and early onset of the disease, are similar in these populations.
