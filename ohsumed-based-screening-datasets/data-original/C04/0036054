Radical hysterectomy versus radiation therapy for stage IB squamous cell cancer of the cervix.
 Three hundred forty-five patients with Stage IB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix were treated at the University of Michigan Medical Center from 1970 to 1985.
 The overall cumulative 5-year survival rate was 89% and the mean age was 44.6 years.
 In 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy the cumulative 5-year survival rate was 92%; 14 patients were explored for radical hysterectomy that was not performed due to high risk features and their survival rate was 50%.
 Ninety-seven patients underwent radiation therapy as initial treatment and had a 5-year survival rate of 86%.
 There was no significant difference when radiation therapy was compared with radical hysterectomy (P = 0.098).
 The survival rates for lesions 3 cm or smaller were 94% for radical hysterectomy and 88% for radiation therapy.
 When the lesion was larger than 3 cm, the survival rates were 82% with radical surgery and 73% with radiation therapy.
 Metastatic disease to lymph nodes was present in 26 of the 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy.
 When 1 to 3 nodes were involved 16 of 19 patients survived and when 4 to 10 nodes were involved 3 of 7 patients survived.
 The addition of radiation therapy did not influence survival.
 Complications were similar in both treatment groups.
 Fistulas occurred in 4 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 1 of 111 undergoing radiation.
 Second surgery for a complication was required in 6 of 213 patients undergoing radical hysterectomy and 7 of 111 undergoing radiation.
 Survival and complication rates in early stage squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix are equal with either radical surgery or radiation therapy.
