Survival of children and adolescents with acute lymphoid leukemia. A study of American Indians and Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites treated in New Mexico (1969 to 1986).
 During the period 1969 to 1986, 196 American Indian and Hispanic and non-Hispanic white children and adolescents (ages, 0 to 19 years) were treated for acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL) at the University of New Mexico affiliated institutions.
 There were 28 American Indians (14%), 91 Hispanic whites (46%), and 77 non-Hispanic whites (39%).
 Median survivals for patients undergoing antileukemic therapy ranged from 8 months for American Indian boys to 140 months for non-Hispanic white girls.
 American Indian boys had the highest initial median leukocyte count (WBC) at 23.8 X 10(9)/l.
 Compliance problems occurred most commonly among American Indian children of both genders.
 Other clinical and pathologic features evaluated in this study were distributed similarly among the ethnic gender groups.
 Multi-variate analysis revealed that independent prognostic variables for survival included initial WBC, age, and gender.
 Ethnicity and compliance problems were possible, but confounded, prognostic variables.
 To the authors' knowledge this represents the most comprehensive study to date of ALL in American Indian patients.
