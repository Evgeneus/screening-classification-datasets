Correlation of the antiproliferative effect and the Mx-homologous protein induction by IFN in patients with malignant melanoma.
 The human interferon-induced intracellular protein homologous to the murine Mx-protein has recently been identified by means of a specific monoclonal antibody.
 Three of six melanoma cell lines elicited this intracellular human Mx-homolog upon incubation with IFN-alpha or IFN-gamma, yet all six melanoma cell lines tested were susceptible to the antiproliferative effect of IFN-alpha and IFN-gamma.
 Compared per antiviral unit, IFN-gamma had weaker Mx-inducing but stronger antiproliferative activity than IFN-alpha.
 These data suggest that the IFN-induced Mx-homologous protein is not involved in the antiproliferative action of IFN on malignant melanoma cell lines.
 Furthermore, 51 patients with advanced malignant melanoma were treated thrice weekly with 10 x 10(6) IU rIFN-alpha-2b and 6 x 10(6) nIFN-alpha, respectively.
 Nine of the 51 patients experienced systemic objective tumor responses (3 complete response, 6 partial response), but had Mx concentrations in their mononuclear cells equal to the Mx levels of non-responders during IFN-alpha therapy.
 Therefore, the level of Mx-homologous protein induced during IFN therapy is not a predictive marker for an antitumor response in malignant melanoma.
