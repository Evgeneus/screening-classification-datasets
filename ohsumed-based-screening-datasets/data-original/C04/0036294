Use of life-sustaining care for the elderly.
 Advanced age has been proposed as one criterion for limiting the use of life-sustaining medical treatment, but very little is known about current practices.
 We retrospectively studied utilization rates of intensive care (IC) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in admissions to a university hospital over 1 year (n = 9,998), to test whether these treatments are used more selectively for elderly patients.
 Overall utilization rates did not vary by age.
 However, among 524 terminal admissions, IC was used for 63% of patients age 35-74 but for only 50% of patients 75 and older (P less than 0.01).
 Among elderly patients, nursing home residence, diagnosis of advanced malignancy, severe chronic illness, and older age were independent predictors of withholding IC prior to death.
 Despite more selective use, survival rates were lower for elderly than for younger patients receiving IC (88% vs 78%, P less than 0.001).
 CPR showed similar but non-significant trends.
 Intensive care is being used less frequently prior to death for elderly patients, based on diagnosis and functional status as well as chronologic age.
