Incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer in New Hampshire and Vermont.
 A survey of skin cancer occurrence between June 1979 and May 1980 among residents of New Hampshire and Vermont identified 277 cases of squamous cell carcinoma and 1761 cases of basal cell carcinoma.
 The age-adjusted incidence rates for squamous cell carcinoma (32 per 100,000 in men, 8 per 100,000 in women) and for basal cell carcinoma (159 per 100,000 in men, 87 per 100,000 in women) were similar to those reported in other populations in the northern United States.
 Skin cancer incidence was particularly high among men more than 70 years of age and a large proportion (greater than 30%) of patients 55 years or older had a history of at least one previous skin cancer.
