Regression of hepatic metastases from gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma after hepatic arterial chemoembolization.
 Two patients with gastrointestinal leiomyosarcoma metastatic to the liver were treated by hepatic chemoembolization with cisplatin and polyvinyl sponge followed by hepatic arterial infusion of vinblastine.
 Effective palliation in terms of durable tumor regression was achieved in both patients after two chemoembolization-infusion procedures.
 These results suggest that regional therapy may offer new hope for the subset of sarcoma patients who have liver metastases resistant to combination systemic chemotherapy.
