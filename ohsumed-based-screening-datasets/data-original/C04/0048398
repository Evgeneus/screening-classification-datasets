Specific release of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and IFN-gamma by human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes after autologous tumor stimulation.
 Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) have been cultured from a variety of human tumors, and some melanoma TIL have demonstrated specific, MHC-restricted recognition of autologous tumor in short term lysis assays.
 The current study investigates cytokine release by TIL as an indicator of specific tumor recognition.
 We have identified two of four melanoma and one of seven breast carcinoma TIL cultures that specifically release granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma after autologous tumor stimulation.
 The other cultures either do not secrete cytokine or secrete cytokine in a nonspecific fashion.
 The amount of specific cytokine released is directly related to the number of TIL and stimulating tumor cells.
 Studies of TIL, from two melanoma patients, separated into CD4+ and CD8+ populations revealed that CD8+ cells were responsible for virtually all of the specific cytokine secretion, although both populations released cytokines when activated by immobilized anti-CD3 antibody.
 Specific cytokine release by CD8+ TIL was inhibited by anti-MHC class I mAb.
 Specific cytokine release was also detected from a CD4+ breast cancer TIL culture, and this was inhibited by anti-MHC class II mAb.
 The clinical significance of this specific mode of immune antitumor reactivity is currently under investigation.
