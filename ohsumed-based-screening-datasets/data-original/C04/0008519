Epididymal metastasis from prostatic adenocarcinoma mimicking adenomatoid tumor.

 The initial histologic findings were suggestive of adenomatoid tumor, but a diagnosis of metastatic adenocarcinoma of prostatic origin has been established by prostatic acid phosphatase and prostate-specific antigen immunoperoxidase staining.
