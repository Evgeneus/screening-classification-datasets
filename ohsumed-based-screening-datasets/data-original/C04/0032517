Model for studying virus attachment. II. Binding of biotinylated human T cell leukemia virus type I to human blood mononuclear cells potential targets for human T cell leukemia virus type I infection.
 Purified human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) was biotinylated and used to study its attachment to human PBMC.
 The use of biotinylated HTLV-I (biot-HTLV-I) in conjunction with mouse mAb specific for selected cell-surface molecules and flow cytometric analysis allowed us to positively identify virus-binding cells among a heterogeneous blood mononuclear cell population.
 Biot-HTLV-I efficiently bound not only to T cells, but also to B cells and monocytes.
 Preincubation of monocytes with excess of unlabeled HTLV-I significantly reduced the attachment of biot-HTLV-I.
 HTLV-I not only bound to, but also infected, B cells, as suggested by: i) in situ hybridization of a 35S-labeled full length HTLV-I DNA probe with EBV-transformed B cells, previously cocultured with HTLV-I-producing (G11MJ) T cells, and ii) hybridization of the same nick-translated 32P-labeled DNA probe with blotted DNA from similar HTLV-I-infected EBV-transformed B cells.
 HTLV-I infection did not affect the ability of B cells to secrete IgG.
 These findings suggest that HTLV-I cannot only infect cells of the T lineage, but can also infect B cells.
