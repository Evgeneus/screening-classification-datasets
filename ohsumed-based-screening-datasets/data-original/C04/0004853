Administered dose and tumor dose of bleomycin labeled with cobalt-57 in mice and men.
 Tumor concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drug, bleomycin, labeled with cobalt-57 (Co-bleo) were compared in mouse tumor models and in human lung tumors using quantitative single-photon emission computed tomography.
 Drug concentrations in histologically similar human tumors showed marked variability for the same injected dose (ID).
 Small cell carcinomas showed concentrations between 1.09 and 8.85 %ID/cc x 10(-3) while non-small cell lung tumors showed a concentration variation between 0.36 and 6.75 %ID/cc x 10(-3).
 In contrast to the situation in human tumors, uptake in mouse tumors showed only slight variability in animals with the same tumor model.
 EMT-6 tumors in mice showed at 6 hr significantly higher uptake of Co-bleo (p less than 0.001) and significantly higher tumor-to-lung ratio (p less than 0.001) when compared to murine fibrosarcomas.
 The EMT-6 tumors in contrast to the fibrosarcomas responded to bleomycin treatment in a dose dependent manner.
 The results indicate that while in mice the tumor dose closely follows the administered dose, in humans, the tumor dose and the tumor-to-lung ratio in the individual patient cannot be predicted from the administered dose.
