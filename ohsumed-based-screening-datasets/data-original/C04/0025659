Metsovo lung outside Metsovo. Endemic pleural calcifications in the ophiolite belts of Greece.
 Endemic PCs and high incidence of malignant mesothelioma from household use of asbestos have been reported in Metsovo in northwestern Greece ("Metsovo lung").
 In the present study, we present similar findings in six more areas of Greece.
 Like Metsovo, all these areas are located within ophiolite belts.
 Like Metsovo, material similar to "Metsovo whitewash" has been used for various domestic uses.
 Asbestos fibers (chrysotile, antigorite and tremolite) were found in three of the six areas.
 Also, in two, MPM has been diagnosed.
 These findings suggest that "Metsovo lung" occurs in several areas of Greece and has similar etiology and epidemiology.
