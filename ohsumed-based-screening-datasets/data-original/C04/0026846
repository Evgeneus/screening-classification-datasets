Physician recommendations for screening mammography: results of a survey using clinical vignettes 
 BACKGROUND.
 Although experts estimate that 30% of breast cancer deaths could be prevented if women were screened according to published guidelines, fewer than 50% of physicians follow screening mammography guidelines, and fewer than 30% of women are screened with mammography.
 METHODS.
 Physician recommendations for screening mammography were examined in a questionnaire mailed to 300 randomly selected physicians of the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians.
 Physicians responded with their likelihood of recommending screening mammography to 24 clinical vignettes that high-lighted patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics.
 RESULTS.
 Seventy-one percent responded.
 Ninety-one percent reported almost always recommending screening mammography to a 55-year-old woman at her yearly examination.
 They were significantly less likely to recommend mammography to women who were young (40 years old), were old (70 years old), were poor, had small breasts, had painful mammograms, did not want the doctor to look for cancer, lived in a nursing home, or were retarded.
 Physicians recommended mammography less often when the mammography unit was far away or produced poor quality films or ambiguous interpretations.
 When physicians ran behind schedule, perceived a more urgent medical problem during the encounter, or saw a woman for an acute visit, they recommended mammography significantly less often.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Patient, mammographic, and encounter characteristics significantly limit physician recommendations for screening mammography as assessed by clinical vignettes.
 These characteristics must be addressed if breast cancer mortality is to be reduced with early screening.
