Establishment and characterization of a new human prostatic carcinoma cell line (DuPro-1).
 A new human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line (DuPro-1) has been established from the athymic nude mouse supported xenograft DU5683.
 This was accomplished by embedding dispersed xenograft cells in 0.1 by 5.0 cm.
 spaghetti-like strands of Basement Membrane MATRIGEL [BMM (Collaborative Research, Inc.)], a unique technique facilitating the transition to tissue culture.
 Now passed over 30 times, the cells display anchorage and serum concentration independent growth with a doubling time of 22 to 24 hours.
 Cells exhibit pronounced morphological differences when grown on BMM coated culture dishes, assuming a pseudoglandular configuration, in contrast to typical homogeneous monolayer growth on plastic culture dishes.
 Light and electron microscopy show cohesive sheets of anaplastic epithelial cells, consistent with prostate carcinoma.
 Karyotypic analysis revealed all human chromosomes, near tetraploidy, 10 to 12 markers, and 3 to 4 X chromosomes, without a Y chromosome.
 Cells injected s.c.
 or embedded in BMM and implanted in the subrenal capsule space are equally tumorigenic in male and female athymic mice, suggesting that DuPro-1 cells are hormonally insensitive.
 Embedding cells in BMM may be useful in developing other tissue culture cell lines from neoplasms difficult to initiate in vitro.
 DuPro-1 should provide a valuable means to study the biology, immunology, and chemosensitivity of human prostate cancer.
