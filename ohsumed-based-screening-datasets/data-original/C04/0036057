Evaluation of salvage surgery in heavily irradiated cancer of the buccal mucosa.
 This report describes the authors' experience with salvage surgery in 78 patients with carcinoma of the buccal mucosa who failed after high-dose radical radiation therapy at Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, India.
 Forty-four patients (56%) required a hemimandibulectomy for adequate tumor clearance.
 Fifty-four patients (69%) required a primary reconstructive procedure for wound closure.
 Follow-up periods ranged from 28 months to 63 months (median follow-up, 41 months).
 Thirteen patients (17%) developed nonfatal postoperative complications.
 Thirty-one patients recurred after surgery, five of whom were again salvaged by further surgery.
 Overall, the recurrence rate was 36%.
 Most of the recurrences (26/31) were at the primary site.
 The overall 5-year actuarial disease-free survival after salvage surgery was 59.7%.
 T stage of the recurrent tumor and its skin infiltration emerged as factors which significantly influenced disease-free survival (P less than 0.05).
