Binding and internalization of transforming growth factor-beta 1 by human hepatoma cells: evidence for receptor recycling.
 Cellular processing of 125I-labeled transforming growth factor-beta 1 was investigated in the human hepatoma cell lines Hep G2 and Hep 3B.
 Binding of 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 to cell surface receptors was specific, saturable and calcium-independent.
 Both cell lines exhibited a single class of high-affinity (Kd = 2.2 x 10(-10) mol/L) binding sites (4.5 x 10(3) for the Hep G2 cell; 1.5 x 10(3) for the Hep 3B cell) for both human and porcine transforming growth factor-beta 1.
 Binding was temperature dependent, time dependent and pH dependent.
 Cell-bound 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 was removed by brief exposure to acidic medium (pH less than 4) but was converted into an acid-resistant state rapidly after shifting the cells to 37 degrees C.
 Spontaneous dissociation of bound ligand over a 6 hr period at 4 degrees C was less than 10%.
 Disuccinimidyl suberate was used to covalently label 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 to cell-surface binding sites.
 Labeling of the ligand/receptor complexes was inhibited by unlabeled transforming growth factor-beta 1 but was unaffected by other growth factors.
 The radiolabeled complexes showed approximate molecular weights of 280,000, 85,000 and 65,000 when run on reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
 Cell-bound 125I-transforming growth factor-beta 1 was internalized and degraded at 37 degrees C, and the products were released into the medium as trichloroacetic acid-nonprecipitable radioactivity.
 The lysosomotropic base chloroquine and the carboxylic ionphore monensin inhibited degradation and release of 125I-labeled products from the cells.
