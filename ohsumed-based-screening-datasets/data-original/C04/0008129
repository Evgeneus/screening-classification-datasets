Complete spontaneous regression of multiple basal cell carcinomas in the basal cell nevus syndrome: the possible role of transepithelial elimination.
 A 36-year-old Latin American man with the basal cell nevus syndrome had multiple, soft, hairless, depressed scars of the face, scalp, neck, and back, ranging in size from 0.3 x 0.5 cm to 3.5 x 3.9 cm.
 These areas had never been treated and previously were sites of basal cell carcinomas that underwent complete spontaneous regression 4-5 years from the date of onset.
 Pathology of these spontaneously regressed sites was consistent with the criteria established by Curson and Weedon (1979).
 Type III transepithelial elimination was demonstrated for a basal cell carcinoma.
 Type III transepithelial elimination may play a role in the spontaneous regression of basal cell carcinomas.
