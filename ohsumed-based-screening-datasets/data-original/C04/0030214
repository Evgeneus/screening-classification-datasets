Possible metastatic routes via portacaval shunts in renal adenocarcinoma with liver metastasis.
 Renal adenocarcinoma findings from autopsies on patients with and without liver metastasis (635 and 936 patients, respectively) were investigated concerning the mode of metastasis.
 The patients with liver metastasis showed a significantly higher frequency of metastases to the lungs, lymph nodes, contralateral kidney, adrenals, pancreas, spleen, peritoneum, and intestines; in the female patients, those with liver metastasis had a higher frequency of metastasis to the ovary and uterus than patients without liver metastasis.
 Some of the metastases to those organs are explainable by venous spread via portacaval shunts as well as ordinary hematogenous or lymphogenous spread, especially, those to the contralateral kidney, adrenals, spleen, intestines, or ovary.
