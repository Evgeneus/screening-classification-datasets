Allograft prosthetic composite arthroplasty for osteosarcoma and other aggressive bone tumors.
 Allograft prosthetic composite arthroplasty is a reconstruction alternative after limb salvage for aggressive bone tumors.
 It combines an off-the-shelf implant with a fresh-frozen allograft and has several potential advantages over conventional techniques.
 Good clinical results can be achieved with acceptable morbidity.
 The procedure can be performed successfully even in patients receiving chemotherapy.
 Nonunion was the most common complication encountered but was amenable to autogenous iliac bone graft.
 The procedure can be customized to meet the needs of the patient, making custom implant manufacturing delay and expense unnecessary.
