Salvage therapy with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow support in the treatment of primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors.
 The authors reported their experience with the use of high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow rescue (ABMR) as salvage therapy in the treatment of patients with recurrent and refractory primary nonseminomatous mediastinal germ cell tumors (PMGCT).
 Since 1987, the authors have treated 12 patients with PMGCT with high-dose carboplatin (1500 mg/m2 to 1800 mg/m2) and etoposide (1200 mg/m2 to 1350 mg/m2) (in two patients ifosfamide [10 g/m2] was added) with ABMR.
 Patients were either in second relapse or cisplatin refractory (progression within 4 weeks of last cisplatin dosing).
 They had received a median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range, one to three), all had had prior cisplatin therapy, and most had failed ifosfamide-based therapy.
 Six patients were cisplatin refractory and of these only one achieved a partial response (PR) that was of short duration.
 It was planned that all patients would undergo two rounds of therapy; however, only 5 of 12 patients received two courses.
 The remainder had only one round of therapy either because of inadequate response (three patients) or excessive toxicity (four patients).
 There were four patients who died in the peritransplant period due to sepsis (two patients) or bleeding (two patients).
 The median survival of the group was 107 days (range, 14 days to 347 days).
 No patient achieved a complete remission, but there were six partial remissions, four with stable disease, and two with progressive disease.
 The use of high-dose carboplatin and etoposide with or without ifosfamide and ABMR was not effective in the treatment of this group of patients with PMGCT who were in second relapse or cisplatin refractory.
