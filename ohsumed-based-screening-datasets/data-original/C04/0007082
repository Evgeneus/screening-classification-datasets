Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an intermediate in IL-1-induced proliferation of leukemic human megakaryoblasts.
 We have examined the in vitro effects of recombinant human (rh) interleukin-1 (IL-1) on the growth of purified megakaryoblasts obtained from patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia.
 We demonstrate that both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta treatment of these cells led to stimulation of DNA synthesis (as shown by increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation up to 35-fold) and also resulted in colony formation of leukemic megakaryoblasts.
 However, the stimulatory effect of IL-1 was dependent on endogenous production of IL-6, because addition of neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to IL-6 abrogated the stimulatory activity of IL-1.
 In contrast, neutralizing MoAbs to granulocyte (G)-colony stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, and macrophage (M)-CSF failed to counteract the growth-enhancing effects of IL-1.
 Leukemic megakaryoblasts accumulated IL-6 mRNA and released IL-6 protein into their culture supernatant when exposed to rh IL-1 but failed to disclose transcripts for G-, GM-, and M-CSF under these conditions.
 Analysis of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) transcript levels demonstrated that megakaryoblasts constitutively expressed IL-6R mRNA and that these transcripts are down-regulated to undetectable levels upon exposure to IL-1 and IL-6.
 Increase of 3H-thymidine incorporation by megakaryoblasts could be duplicated by exogenous IL-6 that could be blocked by neutralizing MoAb to IL-6.
 In conclusion, our results suggest that leukemic megakaryoblasts could produce and secrete IL-6, and express IL-6R, and that the growth-enhancing effect of IL-1 on these cells is indirect, via production of IL-6 by leukemic cells.
