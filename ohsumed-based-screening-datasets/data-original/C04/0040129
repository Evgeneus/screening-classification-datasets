Effect of cell wall skeleton and monophosphoryl lipid A adjuvant on the immunogenicity of a murine B16 melanoma vaccine.
 We examined the effect of a new adjuvant consisting of purified mycobacterial cell wall skeleton (CWS) and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) on the immunogenicity of a murine melanoma vaccine.
 C57BL/6 mice were immunized to partially purified B16 melanoma vaccine given alone or together with different dose levels of adjuvant, or with saline or adjuvant alone.
 Humoral response, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), in vitro cytotoxicity, and tumor-protective immunity to melanoma were measured following three biweekly immunizations.
 The adjuvant potentiated the antibody response to some, but not all, melanoma antigens in a dose-dependent fashion.
 The adjuvant also potentiated cellular immunity as measured by in vitro cytotoxicity assays.
 No potentiation of tumor-protective immunity was detected.
 In comparison to Freund's complete adjuvant, cell wall skeleton plus monophosphoryl lipid A (CWS:MPL) induced fewer cutaneous toxic effects and stronger antibody and DTH responses but resulted in no greater in vitro cytotoxicity or tumor-protective immunity.
 Thus, the adjuvant had a selective and dose-dependent effect on humoral responses to vaccine immunization but did not potentiate a tumor-protective immunity to B16 melanoma.
