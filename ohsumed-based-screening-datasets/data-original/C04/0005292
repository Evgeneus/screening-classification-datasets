The efficacy of comprehensive neck dissection with or without postoperative radiotherapy in nodal metastases of squamous cell carcinoma of the upper respiratory and digestive tracts.
 Neck recurrence-free curves corrected for local recurrence were compared for 494 patients who underwent 565 comprehensive neck dissections.
 In 42 dissections, no radicality could be obtained.
 Of the 523 histologically radical dissections, examination revealed tumor in 352 cases.
 Patients in whom three or more positive nodes or extranodal spread in one or more nodes were found received postoperative radiotherapy.
 In the histologically N0 group, the incidence of neck recurrence after 5 years was 3%; in the N+ group as a whole, it was 10%.
 Analysis of the influence of extranodal spread and the number of positive nodes showed that the group with one or two positive nodes without extranodal spread (that did not receive postoperative radiotherapy) did not statistically differ from the other groups.
 This suggests that the results of the group with one or two positive nodes without extranodal spread can be improved by postoperative radiotherapy.
