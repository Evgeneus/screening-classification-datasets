Elevated serum gastrin levels in patients with gastric cancer.
 Elevated plasma gastrin levels have been found in patients with colorectal cancer.
 We measured fasting serum gastrin levels in control subjects (n = 12), patients with gastric cancer (n = 43), and patients with carcinoma of the esophagus (n = 55).
 Serum gastrin levels were significantly higher in patients with gastric cancer compared to normal controls (P less than 0.005) and those with esophageal cancer (P less than 0.05).
 This information may add to our understanding of the pathogenesis of gastric cancer.
