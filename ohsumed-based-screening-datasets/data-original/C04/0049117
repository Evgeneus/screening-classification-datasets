Subrenal capsule assay using nude mice as a predictor of the response of the gastric cancer to chemotherapy.
 Feasibility of utilizing human gastric cancers as first transplant generation xenografts in nude mice for determining tumor sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents was demonstrated by applying subrenal capsule (SRC) assay.
 A total of 55 human gastric tumors from patients were tested in this assay.
 Mitomycin-C (MMC) and hexycarbamyl-5-FU (HCFU, 5-FU derivative) were selected for the treatment of these patients after surgery and also for this assay as first transplant.
 Evaluable rate of MMC in this assay was 92.7% and that of HCFU was 90.9%.
 Sensitivity of tumors to MMC was 25% and to HCFU was 32%.
 Correlation between response to chemotherapy of human tumors in patients and in nude mice was 78.6%.
 These results indicate that this assay could predict effective drugs for patients with gastric cancer.
