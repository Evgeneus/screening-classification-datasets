Socioeconomic status and survival from soft-tissue sarcomas: a population-based study in northern Italy.
 BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Differential prognosis among cancer patients according to socioeconomic status (SES) has been reported.
 We analyzed survival from soft tissue sarcomas (STS) according to different SES indicators.
 METHODS: We followed up all the adult patients with a new diagnosis of STS occurring between 1.1.1981 and 31.12.1983 in an area of Northern Italy (N = 86).
 RESULTS: The overall three-year survival rate was 57 percent.
 After adjustment for confounders, both low education and blue collar jobs were negatively associated with survival.
 CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that patients of low SES have a poorer prognosis for STS.
