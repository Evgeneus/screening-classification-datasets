Pseudolymphoma of the parapharyngeal space.
 A case report of pseudolymphoma of the parapharyngeal space is presented, together with a literature review of pseudolymphoma and management suggestions for such lesions when they occur in the head and neck.
 To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the first case report of pseudolymphoma presenting within the parapharyngeal space.
 The key to management of these lesions is based on accurate diagnosis, with differentiation of pseudolymphoma from lymphocytic lymphoma, the disease process which it mimics.
