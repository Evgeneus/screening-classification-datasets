The IVBF dual-blade plate and its applications.
 A recently developed simple device, the intervertebral body fixation dual-blade plate, was used in 88 cases of different spinal disorders.
 This patients in the first series were operated on from 1984 to 1986.
 The device is biomechanically simple and its application safe and easy.
 Using a proper bone grafting technique, it is a reliable device to establish spinal stability in spine surgery through an anterior approach.
 Its application in cases of fractures and fracture-dislocations of the thoracolumbar spine with paraplegia, tuberculous spondylitis, and primary tumors of vertebral bodies is presented.
 The midterm results, covering a follow-up period of 24-49 months (mean, 32 months) were satisfactory; there were no serious complications directly related to the device.
 There were four cases of pseudarthrosis due to insufficient bone graft technique.
 Of these, there were three cases of failure of the dual-blade plate.
