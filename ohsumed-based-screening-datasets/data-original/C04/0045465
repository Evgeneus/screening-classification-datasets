Simultaneous occurrence of cutaneous T cell lymphoma and low-grade B cell lymphoproliferative diseases. A report of two cases.
 Two previously unreported patients with cutaneous T cell lymphoma associated with systemic low-grade B cell proliferations are presented.
 The first patient had Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and the second had simultaneous chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
 The use of immunosuppressive drugs or a genetic predisposition may have contributed to the second malignancy.
 However, the possibility that malignant helper/inducer T lymphocytes were a factor in the promotion of the proliferation of B cells cannot be excluded.
