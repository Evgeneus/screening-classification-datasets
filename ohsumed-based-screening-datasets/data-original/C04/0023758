Immunophenotypic analysis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia using routinely processed bone marrow specimens.
 Monoclonal antibodies have been recently developed that react with antigens expressed on T and B lymphocytes in routinely processed, paraffin-embedded lymphoid tissues.
 In this study, we assessed bone marrow clot and/or core biopsy sections of 19 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) using routinely decalcified, B5- or formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections and a panel of monoclonal antibodies, including LN1, LN2, L26, Leu-22, UCHL-1, and LCA.
 Each case had been previously phenotyped using freshly obtained aspirate material and a standard immunophenotypic protocol.
 Our results demonstrate the utility of the LN2 antibody in differentiating between precursor B-cell (pre-B) and precursor T-cell ALL.
 The LN2 antibody stained 11 of 12 cases of pre-B ALL and did not react with any of the seven T-cell ALLs.
 The other antibodies tested were less helpful.
 The Leu-22 antibody stained both pre-B and T-cell ALLs, while the results with UCHL-1 revealed peculiar nuclear staining of pre-B and T-cell ALLs; this we attributed to processing artifact.
 The L26 antibody reacted with only one case of pre-B ALL (also CD20 antigen positive), while the LN1 antibody did not react with any pre-B ALLs.
 Neither L26 nor LN1 stained any cases of T-cell ALL.
 The LCA antibody stained in only four (21%) of 19 cases, two pre-B and two T-cell ALLs.
 The results also suggest that this panel of antibodies may be useful in differentiating ALL from mature B-cell and T-cell lymphomas involving the bone marrow.
