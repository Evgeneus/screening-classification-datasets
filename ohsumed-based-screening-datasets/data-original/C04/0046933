Ig repertoire of human polyspecific antibodies and B cell ontogeny.
 A total of 463 EBV Ig-secreting clones were derived from embryonic tissues, cord blood, and adult peripheral blood.
 Subcloning and analysis of the H and K loci (germline vs rearranged DNA status) of 44 primary clones insured clonality in at least 92% of cases.
 Whatever the cell origin, a somewhat constant proportion of clones (i.e., 11 to 16%) expressed polyspecific antibodies when tested on a panel of nine Ag, including self-Ag.
 The VH and VK repertoires have been studied using VH1-VH6 and VK1-VK4 family-specific probes.
 For all EBV clones the VH and VK utilization was similar to that of the normal untransformed population.
 A correlation was observed between the level of expression and the gene number for VH, whereas a clear distortion appeared for VK.
 Moreover, the usage pattern of VH and VK families of the polyspecific clones did not significantly differ from that of clones of unknown specificity, suggesting that polyspecificity was not linked to a restricted repertoire.
