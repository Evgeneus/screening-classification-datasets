Post-laryngectomy stomal recurrence: tumour implantation or paratracheal lymphatic metastasis?
 In the treatment of obstructing laryngeal cancer, an association has often been noted between emergency tracheotomy for airway relief and subsequent post-laryngectomy stomal recurrence.
 It is however unclear whether this is due to tumour implantation in the tracheotomy track, or paratracheal lymph node metastasis.
 To investigate the pathophysiology of stomal recurrence, the recurrence rate and clinical outcome of 26 cases of T3N0M0 glottic cancer treated with emergency tracheotomy and subsequent laryngectomy were analysed, and compared with 65 stage-matched cases treated with laryngectomy alone.
 Analysis shows the 'emergency tracheotomy' group to have a very poor prognosis with a higher incidence of recurrence at the stoma, and also in the regional lymph nodes.
 These findings suggest that paratracheal lymph node metastasis is an important mechanism in the development of stomal recurrence and thus has considerable implications for the prevention of such a recurrence following laryngectomy in the patient presenting with malignant airway obstruction.
