High-intensity focused ultrasound in the treatment of experimental liver cancer.
 High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) was used to treat Morris rat hepatoma 3924A implanted in the liver.
 Treatment was administered with a lens-focused 4-MHz transducer that created a focused beam of 550 W/cm2 at peak intensity.
 One hundred twelve rats with liver tumors were divided into two groups of 56 each.
 Group 1 received HIFU therapy while group 2 (the control group) did not.
 All rats were killed immediately or 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, or 28 days after treatment.
 Eight rats in each group were killed at each interval for pathologic and biochemical studies.
 Significant inhibition of the tumor growth was seen in the HIFU-treated group, with tumor growth inhibition rates of 65.4% to 93.1% from the third to the 28th day after treatment.
 Ultrasound-treated tumors showed direct thermal cytotoxic necrosis and fibrosis.
 An additional 56 ACl rats with liver tumors were divided into four groups of 14 each.
 Group 1 received doxorubicin hydrochloride intraperitoneally and HIFU therapy; group 2, HIFU therapy; group 3, doxorubicin hydrochloride; and group 4 (the control group), neither HIFU nor doxorubicin hydrochloride.
 Significantly improved survival rates were noted in HIFU-treated animals (groups 1 and 2) compared with those of groups 3 and 4.
 These data suggest that HIFU may be a useful method for local treatment of hepatic tumors.
