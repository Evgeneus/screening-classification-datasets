Open biopsy without wound closure for skeletal neoplasms.
 During the past several years, the indications for limb salvage in musculoskeletal neoplasms have been expanded.
 As a result, interest in the topic of diagnostic biopsy has been renewed.
 Post biopsy hematoma formation and the iatrogenic spread of cancer cells has led to universally accepted guidelines for biopsy technique.
 These include meticulous hemostasis and wound closure.
 A technique of open biopsy without wound closure in which the biopsy site in a long bone with contained neoplasm remains open and hematoma allowed to drain into the dressings is outlined.
 A discussion of the theoretical advantages and disadvantages of this technique is presented.
