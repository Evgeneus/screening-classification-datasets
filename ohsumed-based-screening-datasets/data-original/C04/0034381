Flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser for port-wine stains in infancy: earlier versus later treatment.
 Twelve children, 6 to 30 weeks of age (average 14.9 weeks), with port-wine stains of the head and neck were treated with the flashlamp-pumped pulsed dye laser at 585 nm and 450 microsecond pulse duration.
 Ten of 12 patients (83%) showed more than 50% lightening of their port-wine stains after 2.9 treatment sessions (2.9 +/- 1.4 [+/- standard deviation]).
 Forty-five percent of the patients demonstrated 75% or more lightening of their lesions after a mean of 3.8 treatments (+/- 1.6).
 No lesions in this group cleared completely after a mean of 2.8 treatments.
 Treated skin was identical in texture to normal skin in all patients.
 There was no evidence of depressed scars, atrophy, hyperpigmentation, or hypopigmentation in the treated areas.
 These results indicate that pulsed dye laser treatment of port-wine stains can be undertaken safely in infancy.
