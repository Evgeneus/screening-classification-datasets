Prognostic factors associated with recurrence in clinical stage I adenocarcinoma of the endometrium.
 Two hundred sixty-four consecutive patients with clinical stage I endometrial adenocarcinoma who underwent primary surgical therapy between July 1979 and August 1988 were followed prospectively and evaluated for disease recurrence for 8-112 months (mean 51.5).
 Thirty-three patients (12.5%) developed recurrence or died of disease.
 In univariate statistical analysis, prognostic factors significantly associated with disease recurrence were as follows: age (mean 68.6 years with versus 60.3 years without recurrence; P = .0001); histology (adenocarcinoma 8.8%, adenosquamous 35.7%, papillary 25%, clear-cell 57.1%; P less than .0001); tumor grade (grade 1, 7.7%, grade 2, 10.5%, grade 3, 36.1%; P less than .0001); depth of myometrial invasion (none 9.8%, less than one-half 7.4%, one-half or greater 29.6%; P = .0001); lymph node status (negative 8.3%, positive 47.6%; P less than .0001); non-nodal extrauterine disease spread (absent 11.0%, present 50%; P = .0003); peritoneal cytology (negative 9.4%, positive 26.3%; P = .004), and tumor size (2 cm or less 7%, greater than 2 cm 17.3%; P = .05).
 Cervical extension and uterine size had no significant effect on recurrence.
 Using multivariate analysis, grade 3 tumor (P = .002), advancing age (P = .004), lymph node metastasis (P = .006), and presence of extrauterine disease spread other than lymph node metastasis (P = .038) were the only variables significantly associated with disease recurrence or death.
 This study supports the new International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics surgical staging system for endometrial cancer.
