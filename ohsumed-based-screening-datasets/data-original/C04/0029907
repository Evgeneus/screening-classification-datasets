Unusual initial calcification of primary and metastatic seminomas. Detection by computed tomography.
 Rare large ab initio calcifications of a primary mediastinal seminoma in a 16-year-old boy and of para-aortic nodal metastatic ovarian seminoma in a 14-year-old girl are demonstrated with CT but not with conventional radiography.
 They are most likely dystrophic calcifications because of the absence of other germ cell tumor components and infective granulomatous disease.
 Routine use of CT might detect more such calcifications in untreated seminoma.
