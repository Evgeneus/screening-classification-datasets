Isolated neurofibromas of the conjunctiva.
 We studied four histologically verified cases of isolated neurofibromas of the conjunctiva.
 The histologic pattern was diffuse in two patients, plexiform in one patient, and solitary in one patient.
 Simple excision was curative in all cases.
 We emphasize the importance of distinguishing neuromas (which may be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia) from neurofibromas.
