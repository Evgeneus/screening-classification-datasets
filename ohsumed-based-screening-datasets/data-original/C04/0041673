Is laterality important in neck node metastases in head and neck cancer?
 We present a series of 2219 previously untreated squamous carcinomas of the head and neck, 141 (6.5%) of whom had bilateral nodes at presentation.
 Bilateral nodes became progressively less common with increasing age but were not related to other host factors.
 They were also strongly related to the site of the primary tumour, its T-stage and its histological grade, being more common in tumours of the oro or naso-pharynx, in poorly or moderately differentiated tumours, and in tumour stages T3 or T4 at presentation.
 There were also interactions between these tumour factors, and patients with all three factors had a 25% incidence of bilateral nodes.
 126 of these patients could be matched for the main prognostic factors with 126 patients with unilateral neck node disease.
 The survival rate of the latter group was 9% better than that of the unilateral group.
 Further breakdown showed that the survival of patients with nodes smaller than 6 cm is not affected by laterality, whereas it is for patients with massive nodes.
