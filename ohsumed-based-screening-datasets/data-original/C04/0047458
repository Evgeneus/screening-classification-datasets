Radiographic evaluation of intraosseous implants of endodontic materials.
 Following several case reports of cyst development after endodontic treatment of decidous teeth, the osseous response to formaldehyde- or phenol-based materials was evaluated by a standardized radiographic technique.
 Endodontic medicaments contained in Teflon carriers were implanted between feline deciduous canine and molar teeth and the permanent successional teeth.
 Persistent radiolucency surrounding formocresol implants and sequestration of Kri-paste implants were noted in contrast to apparent bony healing around the zinc oxide-eugenol controls and those implants containing glutaraldehyde.
 These results suggest a greater tissue tolerance to glutaraldehyde-containing agents in contrast to the more traditional endodontic agents used in deciduous teeth.
