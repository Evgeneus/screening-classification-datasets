Dual modulation of 5-fluorouracil using leucovorin and hydroxyurea. A phase I trial.
 Oral hydroxyurea (HU) was added to a regimen of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus leucovorin (LCV) administered as a continuous 24-hour infusion for 14 days.
 A previous report of the 5-FU plus LCV infusion established optimal dosages of 200 mg/m2/d and 5 mg/m2/d, respectively, for each agent.
 Oral HU was added to the regimen in total dosages of 0.5 g/d, 1.0 g/d, 1.5 g/d, or 2.0 g/d.
 Twenty-two patients received a total of 45 courses of treatment.
 Stomatitis was the dose-limiting side effect; it occurred in 3 of 14 courses with HU at 0.5 g/d (21%) and 9 of 17 courses with HU at 1.0 g/d (53%).
 Dosage escalation to 1.5 g/d or 2.0 g/d was possible in only 3 of 22 patients (17%).
 The median time to stomatitis was 10 days (range, 7 to 12 days).
 One response was observed in this heavily pretreated population.
 Phase II trials of HU plus LCV dual modulation of infusional 5-FU should use initial HU dosages of 0.5 g/d for the 14-day regimen described, with dose escalation as tolerated.
 Variable oral absorption presumably accounts for the small group of patients who can tolerate the higher doses of HU.
