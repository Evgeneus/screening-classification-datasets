Epiglottic laryngoplasty after hemilaryngectomy for glottic cancer.
 Epiglottic laryngoplasty is technically feasible as a one-stage procedure with excellent functional results.
 Although the Kambic-Sedlacek-Tucker (K-S-T) technique of glottic reconstruction offers early extubation with an adequate airway, a subsequent wide neoglottis may increase the chance of aspiration and a poor voice.
 To better restore the laryngeal functions of closure and phonation, we made some modifications on the original K-S-T technique as follows: (1) One of the lateral margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the arytenoid region of the cricoid rather than a thyroid cartilage remnant.
 A neo-arytenoid is formed.
 (2) The other lateral margin of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic fold is sutured to the cut edge of the false and true cord instead of a thyroid ala remnant.
 Therefore both margins of the epiglottis with the aryepiglottic folds are lowered as much as possible to the level of the glottis.
 A new pseudocord is formed.
 (3) A cartilage cut is made at the anterior aspect of the epiglottis, leaving its laryngeal surface of mucoperichondrial intact.
 A new anterior commissure with a sharp angle is shaped by this maneuver.
 Nineteen hemilaryngectomies with modified epiglottic laryngoplasty have been performed by members of the Department of Otolaryngology of Guangxi Medical College since 1984.
 Results in this series are fairly good and indicate that the modified epiglottic laryngoplasty is effective in enhancing functional results in terms of respiration, deglutition, and phonation.
