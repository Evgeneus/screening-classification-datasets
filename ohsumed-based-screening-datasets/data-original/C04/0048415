Is melanoma changing?
 Nine hundred ninety-five cases of melanoma of the head and neck were divided into two groups so that certain comparisons could be made concerning the behavior of melanoma over a 55-year period.
 One hundred twelve melanomas of the ocular system were excluded from this review.
 The first group consisted of 660 melanomas seen during a period from 1932 to 1972.
 The second group consisted of 223 melanomas seen during a period from 1973 to 1987.
 Thirteen parameters, including sex, age, distribution, pre-existing mole, amelanotic melanoma, delay in diagnosis, classification, levels, local recurrence, regional metastasis, systemic metastasis, morbidity, and survival, were studied to assess the behavior and the variations.
 There is no question that the most important aspect of the favorable changes that have occurred are because of earlier diagnosis and better management by a larger group of well-trained specialists.
 There are some subtler changes that could possibly indicate biologic alterations, but this requires more time and study to substantiate.
