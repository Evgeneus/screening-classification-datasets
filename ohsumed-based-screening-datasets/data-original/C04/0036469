Cervical paraganglioma with subsequent intracranial and intraspinal metastases. Case report.
 Paragangliomas, tumors derived from the extra-adrenal paraganglion system, have commonly been found in the retroperitoneum, abdomen, mediastinum, skull base, and neck.
 Rare intraspinal cases have included involvement of the cauda equina and filum terminale, and a recent case has been reported of thoracic cord paraganglioma with metastasis to the cauda equina.
 The authors present the case of a patient with a cervical paraganglioma who underwent subtotal resection followed by postoperative irradiation; she subsequently developed multiple intracranial and intraspinal metastases 7 months following the first decompression procedure.
