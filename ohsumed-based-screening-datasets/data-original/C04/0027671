Intraoperative radiation therapy for recurrent head and neck cancer.
 Forty-seven patients with recurrent head and neck cancer in a previously irradiated field were treated with surgical resection and intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT).
 Recurrent disease occurred at a median of 18 months from primary treatment, and was at the primary tumor site in 31 and metastatic to regional lymph nodes in 16.
 Recurrences were squamous cell carcinomas in 42 and adenoid cystic in five.
 Surgical resection left microscopic residual disease in 41 and gross residual in six.
 All patients received IORT with a median of 20 Gy.
 Two-year actuarial survival is 54.9%, and 15 patients are alive and disease free with a median survival of 29 months.
 Two-year actuarial local control is 61.5%.
 A trend toward increased survival (P less than 0.09) and local recurrence control (P = 0.05) was noticed when treating microscopic residual disease as opposed to gross residual disease.
 Perioperative mortality was seen in 8.5% and there was no increase in morbidity secondary to IORT.
 The authors believe that surgical resection and IORT is an effective treatment modality for head and neck cancers recurrent in previously irradiated fields and is adaptable to tertiary care hospitals.
