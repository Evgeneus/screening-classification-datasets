Problems encountered with the Bethesda System: the University of Iowa experience.
 This paper provides a descriptive summary of 1 year's experience with the Bethesda Cytologic Classification System at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics.
 Cytotechnologists and pathologists criticized the failure of the new classification system to provide microscopic criteria for the following categories: adequacy of the smear (satisfactory, less than optimal, unsatisfactory), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance, and inflammation-associated changes.
 Clinicians criticized the "less than optimal" category and the reporting of koilocytosis, moderate dysplasia, and endometrial cells.
 Suggestions for modifying the Bethesda System include: eliminating the less than optimal response, defining what constitutes an unsatisfactory smear, eliminating the terms low-grade and high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion, and changing the reporting of endometrial cells.
