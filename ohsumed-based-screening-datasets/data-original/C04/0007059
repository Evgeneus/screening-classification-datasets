Metastasizing pleomorphic adenoma of the nasal septum.
 Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign tumor of glandular tissue occurring in the head and neck region.
 There have been several reports of metastasis of this benign-appearing tumor from the salivary glands to distant sites, suggesting hematogenous spread and implantation.
 Although occurrence of pleomorphic adenoma on the nasal septum has been described, to our knowledge this is the first reported case of recurrent septal pleomorphic adenoma with histologically benign tissue in an enlarged metastatic ipsilateral submandibular lymph node, suggesting lymphatic spread.
 The literature concerning the subject is reviewed.
 Wide septal excision and modified neck dissection is the recommended treatment.
