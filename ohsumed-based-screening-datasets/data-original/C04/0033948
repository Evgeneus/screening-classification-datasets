Perinatal vertical transmission of human papillomavirus and subsequent development of respiratory tract papillomatosis.
 This study prospectively examined the potential for human papillomavirus (HPV) to be transmitted vertically to newborns during delivery.
 Exfoliated cervical cells were extracted from 72 pregnant women during the third trimester and again during labor prior to delivery, and tested for the presence of HPV DNA.
 These results were compared with HPV DNA specimens from their newborns, who were sampled by exfoliated cells from the oral-pharyngeal cavity and vulva or tissue from the foreskin 24 to 72 hours after delivery.
 Among the mothers, 18.1% (13 of 72) typed HPV-positive by the ViraPap/ViraType DNA hybridization technique.
 Two neonates (2.8% or 2 of 72) tested positive from oral-pharyngeal specimens.
 This finding supports the hypothesis that respiratory tract papillomatosis may develop as a result of perinatal vertical transmission of HPV.
 Furthermore, this study suggests that neither cesarean section nor prepartum treatment of HPV lesions will always protect against neonatal acquisition of HPV.
