Cataract extraction after brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid.
 Thirteen eyes of 55 consecutive patients treated with brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid developed postirradiation cataracts.
 Cataract development was more common in older patients and in patients with larger and more anterior tumors.
 Eleven eyes had extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation.
 Initial visual improvement occurred in 91% of eyes, with an average improvement of 5.5 lines.
 Visual acuity was maintained at 20/60 or better in 55% of the eyes over an average period of follow-up of 24 months (range, 6 to 40 months).
 These data suggest that, visually, cataract extraction can be helpful in selected patients who develop a cataract after brachytherapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid.
