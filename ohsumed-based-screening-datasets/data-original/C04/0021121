Incidence and survival rates of children and young adults with osteogenic sarcoma.
 Gender-specific and race-specific incidence and survival rates of osteogenic sarcoma over a 14-year period are presented for persons aged 0 to 24 years from eight Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries.
 They were no significant gender or racial differences in age at diagnosis.
 There was no significant gender difference in overall incidence.
 Although incidence rates were slightly higher in blacks compared with whites, the difference was not significant after controlling for multiple comparisons.
 Females (median, 74 months) survived longer than males (median, 29 months), although this difference weakened after controlling for stage.
 No racial differences in survival were observed.
 White females survived the longest (median, 94 months), followed by black females (median, 41 months), black males (median, 34 months), and white males (median, 29 months).
 This striking difference in survival should be explored more fully.
