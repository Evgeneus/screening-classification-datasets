Localized irradiation of testes with carcinoma in situ: effects on Leydig cell function and eradication of malignant germ cells in 20 patients.
 Twenty men (median age, 31 yr) previously treated for unilateral testicular cancer received localized irradiation in a dose of 20 Gray in 10 fractions for carcinoma in situ of the remaining testis.
 Follow-up testicular biopsies performed 3 (n = 19) and 24 (n = 14) months after the treatment showed in all cases a Sertoli cell-only pattern.
 Hormonal evaluation was performed before as well as 3, 12, 24, and 36 months after radiation treatment.
 Endocrine parameters were followed for a median of 30 months (3-36 months).
 Baseline serum testosterone values decreased during the follow-up period from 13.3 +/- 6.0 to 10.8 +/- 6.4 nmol/L (mean +/- SD), although the decrease was not statistically significant (P = 0.06).
 Serum LH values increased during the first 3 months of follow-up from 10.4 +/- 5.4 to 15.6 +/- 7.3 IU/L (P less than 0.0001) and then remained unchanged.
 Significant decreases in GnRH- and hCG-stimulated testosterone levels also indicated an impairment of Leydig cell function.
 FSH levels increased (P less than 0.0001) during the first 3 months of follow-up from 21.8 +/- 11.1 to 33.2 +/- 13.2 IU/L.
 We conclude that localized irradiation of 20 Gray eradicated carcinoma in situ germ cells.
 Development of a second testicular cancer has until now been prevented.
 Leydig cell function was partially impaired by the radiation dose given.
