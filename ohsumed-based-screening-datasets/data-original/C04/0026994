Cytoreduction and sequential resection: a hope for unresectable primary liver cancer.
 For decades, unresectable primary liver cancer (PLC) determined by operation was incurable.
 However, a retrospective study of 24 years' materials with unresectable PLC indicated that 5-year survival of unresectable PLC has increased from 0% in 1966-1977 (n = 137) to 16.9% in 1978-1989 (n = 345).
 This encouraging improvement was mainly a result of cytoreduction therapy followed by sequential resection.
 Multimodality combination treatment with hepatic artery ligation, plus hepatic artery infusion with chemotherapy, plus radioimmunotherapy (or radiotherapy) yielded the highest sequential resection rate (30.6%) and 5-year survival (28.0%) as compared with double combination and single modality treatment.
 The 5-year survival of 33 patients receiving sequential resection after cytoreduction therapy was 63.2%.
 It is suggested that cytoreduction and sequential resection might offer a hope for surgically verified unresectable PLC.
