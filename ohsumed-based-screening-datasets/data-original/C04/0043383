Recurrence rates of treated basal cell carcinomas. Part 2: Curettage-electrodesiccation.
 This is the second article in a series that reviews the experience in the Skin and Cancer Unit, from 1955 through 1982, with the treatment of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs).
 This report deals with 2314 previously untreated (primary) BCCs removed by curettage-electrodesiccation.
 Multivariate analysis showed that increasing lesion diameter (P less than .001), high-risk anatomic sites (nose, paranasal, nasal-labial groove, ear, chin, mandibular, peri-oral, and peri-ocular areas) (P less than .001), middle-risk anatomical sites (scalp, forehead, pre- and post-auricular, and malar areas) (P less than .001), and time-span treated (1955 to 1963) (P = .012) were independent risk factors for high recurrence rates.
 The patient's age, sex, and lesion duration before treatment did not affect the recurrence rates.
 In order to best illustrate our current experience with BCCs, the last time-span (1973 to 1982) was examined in detail.
 For the low-risk sites (neck, trunk, and four extremities), BCCs of all diameters responded well to curettage-electrodesiccation with an overall 5-year recurrence rate of 3.3% (SE = 1.5%) determined by the modified life-table method.
 In the middle-risk sites BCCs less than 10 mm in diameter had a recurrence rate of 5.3% (SE = 2.7%).
 Finally, in the high-risk sites, lesions less than 6 mm in diameter had a recurrence rate of 4.5% (SE = 2.6%).
 Thus, BCCs less than 6 mm in diameter, regardless of anatomic site, as well as selected larger BCCs depending on their anatomic site, are effectively treated by currettage-electrodesiccation.
