Nonpigmented congenital iris stromal cyst.
 A nonpigmented iris stromal cyst was observed in the right eye of a 6-week-old girl.
 There was no past history of trauma or use of topical miotics, and the remainder of the ocular examination was normal.
 The pathophysiology and management of this rare developmental anomaly are controversial.
