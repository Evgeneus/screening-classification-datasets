Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation as therapy for primary induction failure for patients with acute leukemia.
 The survival of patients with acute leukemia who do not achieve a remission with primary therapy is very poor.
 High-dose chemoradiotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) has been shown to be effective therapy for patients with acute and chronic leukemia.
 Therefore, we determined the long-term disease-free survival of patients who did not achieve a remission and were then treated with high-dose therapy and bone marrow allografting from matched sibling donors.
 Twenty-one patients (median age, 28 years) who did not achieve a remission with induction chemotherapy were subsequently treated with allogeneic BMT.
 After BMT, 90% achieved a complete remission.
 Six died of complications of the therapy, and six patients relapsed between 27 and 448 days after BMT.
 Nine patients (43%; median age, 25 years) are alive between 556 and 4,174 days after BMT.
 The cumulative probability of disease-free survival at 10 years is 43%.
 This study suggests that allogeneic BMT can be an effective therapy to achieve long-term control of acute leukemia, even in those patients who do not achieve a remission with primary therapy.
