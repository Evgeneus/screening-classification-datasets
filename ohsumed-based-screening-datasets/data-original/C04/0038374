Histiocytic neoplasias: immunohistochemical evaluation of their frequencies among malignant lymphoma and related conditions in Japan.
 Through histologic review of 1,766 cases with malignant lymphoma and related conditions, 35 cases (2%) were selected as probable histiocytic neoplasias.
 Proliferating cells in these cases had voluminous, granulated cytoplasm, and round to irregularly shaped nuclei often with bi- or multinucleated forms showing monomorphous or polymorphous proliferation accompanying small lymphocytes, plasma cells, and, less frequently, eosinophils.
 Cases showing proliferation of convoluted cells with numerous benign-appearing histiocytes or large cells with clear cytoplasm were excluded under a diagnosis of T-cell lymphoma.
 To evaluate the immunologic character of proliferating cells, immunohistochemistry using antibodies Mx-Pan B, MB-1, MT-1, UCHL-1, lysozyme, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, S-100 alpha, S-100 beta, Leu M1, epithelial membrane antigen, and Ki-1 were carried out in 23 cases.
 Naphthol-ASD-chloracetate reaction and toluidine blue stain were also performed.
 These procedures revealed that 12 cases (52%) were B-cell type, three cases (13%) T-cell type, six cases (26%) true histiocytic type, and two cases null type.
 Therefore, the frequency of cases with true histiocytic neoplasias among cases with malignant lymphoma and related conditions in Japan may be 0.5%.
