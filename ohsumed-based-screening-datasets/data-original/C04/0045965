Soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma. Characterization in established cultures and xenografts with evidence of a neuroectodermic phenotype.
 This study characterizes the histogenesis of soft tissue Ewing's sarcoma (StEs) based upon an analysis of three tumors.
 Long-term cultured cell lines and nude mice xenografts were established from original neoplasms or from their metastases.
 Histologically they revealed a small round cell pattern without signs of differentiation.
 Several ultrastructural features of neural type were found; the same were also seen on culture cell lines.
 Moreover, immunohistochemical study for neural markers revealed the presence of HNK-1, NSE, LIRC-LON 36, S-100 protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilaments (70 kilodaltons), and chromogranin; some of these markers were present only in the transplants.
 Cytokeratin was also seen.
 The translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12) was found in all three neoplasms together with other chromosomal abnormalities.
 N-myc RNA gave negative results whereas c-myc RNA was expressed.
 Therefore it may be postulated that StEs displays neuroectodermal features somewhat similar to those seen in peripheral neuroepithelioma as well as in atypical Ewing's sarcoma of bone.
