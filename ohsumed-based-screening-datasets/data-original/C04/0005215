Adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett's esophagus.
 A review of nine adenocarcinomas of the esophagus arising in Barrett's epithelium was undertaken.

 Risk factors and incidence rate remain to be clarified.
 Only one patient was in a surveillance program and only he had carcinoma discovered "early." He still survives while only one of the eight whose diagnosis followed investigation of symptoms remains alive.
