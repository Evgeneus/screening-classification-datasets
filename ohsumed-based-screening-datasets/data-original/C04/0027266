Human papillomavirus types 16 and 18 in adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix.
 Many reports have shown a link between human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical squamous neoplasia.
 However, the association of HPV with cervical adenocarcinoma has been studied less extensively.
 The authors evaluated the presence of HPV-DNA in 106 patients with adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix by in situ hybridization, using 35S-labeled probes for HPV 16 DNA and HPV 18 DNA.
 The overall prevalence of HPV-DNA was 18% (19 of 106).
 HPV 16 was present in 2 (2%) cases, HPV 18 was observed in 15 (14%) cases, and both HPV 16 and HPV 18 were found in 2 (2%) cases.
 There was a correlation between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor stage (P less than 0.01) and tumor size (P less than 0.05), but there was no relationship between HPV-DNA positivity and tumor differentiation, proliferation (S-phase fraction), ploidy, lymph node metastases, or five-year survival rate.
 These results suggest that HPV 18 DNA is associated with cervical adenocarcinoma but the presence of HPV 18 has no influence on overall survival.
