Gliomatosis peritonei with malignant transformation: a case report and review of the literature.
 Gliomatosis peritonei is the implantation of glial tissue within the peritoneal cavity associated with ovarian teratomas.
 Previous reports have emphasized improved outcomes when these implants are found to be mature, even if the ovarian component is immature.
 A 16-year-old female with grade 3 immature teratoma was found on two subsequent laparotomies to have extensive peritoneal implantation of mature glial tissue.
 More than 5 years after the original surgery she was found to have a malignant abdominal glial neoplasm.
 This case illustrates a rare finding of malignant transformation of previously mature gliomatosis peritonei.
