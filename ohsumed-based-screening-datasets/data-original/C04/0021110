Adenoid cystic carcinoma of the esophagus. A clinicopathologic study of three cases.
 In a group of 245 cases of primary carcinoma of the esophagus the authors found three cases of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).
 Clinical and pathologic data of those patients (one female and two male; age range, 49-74 years) were analyzed.
 Tumors were localized in the middle third of the esophagus.
 One patient lived 15 months after surgery.
 Another is a case of early ACC who has been living 4.5 years after surgery and is without specific symptoms.
 The third patient had not had surgery and died 13 months after the onset of dysphagia.
 An autopsy showed only a locally invasive tumor growing into the surroundings of the esophagus, and regional lymph node metastases without distant parenchymal metastases.
 These findings support pathologic and biologic similarities between ACC of the esophagus and ACC of the salivary glands.
 There are synchronous tumors of the esophagus and the vital localization which makes the prognosis of ACC of the esophagus worse than ACC of the salivary glands.
