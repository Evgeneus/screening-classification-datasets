Pleomorphic fibroma of skin. A case report and immunohistochemical study.
 An immunohistochemical study of a clinically benin but cytologically atypical mesenchymal lesion of the skin is presented.
 This lesion has been previously reported as pleomorphic fibroma and was shown to follow a benign course with a potential for local recurrence.
 These lesions contain occasional markedly atypical enlarged spindle cells with anaplastic-appearing nuclei.
 Nonmirror image mitotic figures may be present.
 Histogenesis of this neoplasm remains controversial with a fibroblastic origin being favored by previous authors.
 Our immunohistochemical findings would support this conclusion.
