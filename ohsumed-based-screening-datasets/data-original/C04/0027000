Latissimus dorsi musculocutaneous flap for elbow extension.
 The latissimus dorsi mycocutaneous flap has developed a reputation for its versatility in both skin and soft tissue coverage and for restoration of elbow function in both flexion and extension.
 In a case presented, a large extra-abdominal desmoid was removed along with the entire deltoid and three-quarters of the triceps.
 The latissimus dorsi was elevated with a large overlying skin island and rotated on its neurovascular pedicle into the defect in the posterior shoulder and upper arm to replace the resected triceps and deltoid muscle, and to provide coverage in this region.
