Evaluating cervical cone biopsy specimens with frozen sections at hysterectomy.
 Frozen section evaluations of cervical cone biopsy specimens were performed at the time of hysterectomy to exclude invasive cervical cancer.
 During a two-year period we prospectively evaluated 43 cone biopsy specimens.
 We found all the diagnoses made with frozen sections to be accurate when compared with prospective permanent sections, and all patients received appropriate therapy.
 Thirty-eight cases showed no evidence of invasion.
 Two patients had invasive squamous cell cervical cancer, one had invasive cervical adenocarcinoma extending to the endometrial cavity, and two had microinvasion.
 All invasive cancers were diagnosed correctly with frozen sections and confirmed with permanent sections.
 When hysterectomy immediately followed conization, no complications occurred, and no significant increase in blood loss was noted.
 We found frozen section evaluation of a cone biopsy specimen at the time of hysterectomy to be a reliable procedure that saves time, eliminates the risk of additional anesthesia and decreases patients' costs.
