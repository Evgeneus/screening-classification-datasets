Ovarian cancer screening in asymptomatic postmenopausal women by transvaginal sonography.
 From November 1987 to January 1991, 1300 postmenopausal women underwent screening with transvaginal sonography (TVS).
 Women eligible for screening were all asymptomatic with no known ovarian tumors.
 Ovarian volume was calculated using the prolate ellipsoid formula, and a value in excess of 8.0 cm3 was considered abnormal.
 Ovarian abnormalities were detected in 33 women (2.5%), and 27 underwent exploratory laparotomy.
 Ovarian tumors were noted in all 27 patients, including 2 primary carcinomas and 14 serous cystadenomas.
 The two women with ovarian carcinomas had normal results of pelvic examinations and normal serum CA-125 levels.
 Both women had Stage I disease, and are alive and well after conventional therapy.
 TVS was time efficient, easy to perform, and well-accepted by patients.
 Currently, there are more than 3000 patient years of follow-up in the screened population, and there have been no deaths due to ovarian cancer.
 A multi-institutional trial to determine the efficacy of TVS as a screening method for ovarian cancer is indicated.
