Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in invasive bladder cancer: the evolving role of surgery.
 The role of an operation in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for clinically localized but invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder currently is evolving.
 An operation is essential for case selection and evaluation of local response but it also contributes to bladder preservation and survival.
 The procedure that is necessary to select for and assess response to chemotherapy may itself alter the actual or proceed to evolution of invasive bladder cancer.
 Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable therapeutic strategy in selected patients but it remains to be seen whether the results will prove to be superior to those achieved with standard endoscopic and open operations.
