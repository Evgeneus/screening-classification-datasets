Chondrosarcoma complicating total hip arthroplasty in Maffucci's syndrome.
 A 70-year-old woman who was followed for 60 years for Maffucci's syndrome required a total hip arthroplasty (THA) of the right hip for degenerative arthritis.
 This did not relieve pain.
 Three years later, chondrosarcoma of the femur developed around the femoral component and was fatal.
 The roentgenographic changes after the THA were incorrectly interpreted as being caused by infection.
