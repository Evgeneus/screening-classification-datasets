Growth-hormone releasing hormone in a bronchial carcinoid.
 The case is reported of a 43-year-old patient with a peripherally located bronchial carcinoid tumor containing large amounts of immunoreactive and bioactive growth-hormone releasing hormone (GHRH).
 Because no GHRH was found in the peripheral circulation, there was no quantitative or qualitative derangement of growth-hormone secretion.
 The tumor was excised completely by thoracotomy.
