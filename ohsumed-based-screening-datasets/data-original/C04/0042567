A review of 13-years experience of osteosarcoma.
 Since the inception of the authors' facility, 365 patients with osteogenic sarcoma have been treated.
 While other facilities were surgically treating patients with primary amputation, this facility attempted limb-salvage surgery.
 The majority of patients being treated with limb-salvage surgery had the resected bone replaced by a metallic endoprosthetic replacement.
 The emphasis on conservative surgery led to the development of growing endoprosthetic replacements with the first being used in 1975.
 The cumulative survival of those patients with Stage 2 osteosarcoma treated at this facility between 1977 and 1984 is 48% at five years.
