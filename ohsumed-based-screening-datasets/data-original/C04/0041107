Bacillus Calmette-Guerin and interleukin-2 for treatment of superficial bladder cancer.
 A total of 22 patients with bladder cancer received bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and interleukin-2.
 Significant bladder tumor remissions were noted in 15 of 17 patients (88%).
 Of 5 patients with carcinoma in situ 1 was noncompliant and he died of carcinoma in situ.
 The other 4 patients are in remission.
 BCG alone was instilled in 22 additional patients with superficial bladder cancer.
 The remission rates were encouraging.
 Of the 22 patients 13 (59%) had remission of the bladder tumor.
 A half dose of BCG (60 mg.) is adequate when given weekly for 6 weeks.
 Maintenance therapy is important as noted in both of our clinical arms.
 BCG and interleukin-2 therapy results in a higher remission rate.
