HTLV-I-associated myelopathy in a patient with adult T-cell leukemia.
 Disseminated erythematous papules and plaques developed in a 60-year-old man 3 years before the appearance of neurologic manifestations.
 A biopsy specimen of the plaque revealed Pautrier's microabscess and a dense mononuclear cell infiltration with atypical convoluted nuclei in the papillary dermis.
 These cells were helper/inducer T lymphocytes that expressed the interleukin 2 receptor.
 The patient's white blood cell count was normal, but 1% atypical lymphocytes and a high titer of anti-human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I antibody were detected in his serum.
 A smoldering type of adult T-cell leukemia was diagnosed.
 While he was being treated with PUVA, a gait disturbance developed.
 A high titer of anti-HTLV-I antibody, characteristic of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, was demonstrated in his cerebrospinal fluid.
