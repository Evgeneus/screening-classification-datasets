Intrascrotal adenomatoid tumors.
 Adenomatoid tumors are regarded as uncommon neoplasms of the paratesticular tissues, probably of mesothelial origin.
 The majority of cases reported have involved the epididymis.
 We report our experience with 8 cases of testicular tumors and 11 of epididymal adenomatoid tumors during a 13-year period, and review the relevant literature.
 The incidence of adenomatoid tumors relative to all tumors in the testis was 6.9% (8 of 116), exceeding that of Leydig cell tumors, which were previously believed to be the most common benign testicular neoplasms.
 The adenomatoid tumors included 38% epididymal tumors (11 of 29).
 The clinical course of the tumors was benign, without recurrences.
 Local excision is regarded as the treatment of choice for epididymal and testicular adenomatoid tumors.
