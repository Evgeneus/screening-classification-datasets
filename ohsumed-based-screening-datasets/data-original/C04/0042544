Intraarterial cisplatin in the management of stage IIB osteosarcoma in the pediatric and adolescent age group.
 Sixty patients with extremity osteosarcoma were treated with intraarterial cisplatin.
 This was followed by surgical resection (amputation or limb salvage) and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy utilizing two different protocols.
 Seventy-five percent of patients achieved an initial response.
 Overall disease-free survival was 58%.
 The number of patients treated with limb-salvage surgery gradually increased to the extent that 80% of newly-registered patients achieved a response and were subjected to limb salvage.
 Disease-free survival was 48% in amputation and 68% in limb salvage.
 The only factors found to have prognostic significance in determining disease-free survival were extent of tumor destruction induced by preoperative chemotherapy and tumor size.
