Increasing breast cancer screening among the medically underserved--Dade County, Florida, September 1987-March 1991.
 Efforts to detect breast cancer at early stages are critical in reducing breast cancer-associated mortality.
 However, in the United States, different barriers (e.g., lack of insurance, limited access to medical care, and limited awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment) prevent certain groups from using early detection services.
 To promote early detection of breast cancer among an estimated 67,000 medically underserved women aged greater than or equal to 40 years, the Early Detection Program (EDP) was begun in Dade County, Florida, in the fall of 1987 (1).
 This report summarizes the progress of the program for September 1987 through March 1991.
