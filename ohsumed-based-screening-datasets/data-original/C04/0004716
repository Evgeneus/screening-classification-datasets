Effect of microwave and ionizing radiation in patients with recurrent laryngeal carcinoma.
 This study describes the treatment and survival of 54 patients with gross recurrent laryngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy.
 Twenty-six patients were treated with local ultra-high frequency hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (HRCH).
 Twenty-eight control patients were treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy (RCh).
 Eight patients (33 per cent) in HRCh showed a three year survival but no patient in the RCh group.
 At two years 18 patients (75 per cent) in HRCh and two (7 per cent) in RCh survived.
