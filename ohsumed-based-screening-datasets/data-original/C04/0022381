Prognosticators of second-look laparotomy findings in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.
 Prognosticators of outcome at second-look laparotomy (SLL) were evaluated in 49 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma undergoing SLL.
 Residual tumor volume was found to be the most significant prognosticator of outcome, with initial tumor stage being of secondary importance.
 Grade of tumor played no role in outcome at SLL.
 The results of the study led us to the conclusion that the second-look procedure may be safely omitted in stage I patients.
 The importance of optimal cytoreduction during primary surgery was stressed.
