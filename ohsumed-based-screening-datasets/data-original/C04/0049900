Immunomodulation of the induction phase of lymphokine-activated killer activity by acute phase proteins.
 Effective treatment of head and neck cancer with biologic response modifiers may be benefitted by an understanding of in vivo factors capable of modulating the lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell phenomenon.
 Eighteen patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were studied.
 Killer cells from each patient, activated by recombinant interleukin-2 (10 U/ml), were induced in either complete medium alone or complete medium plus 10% autologous serum solution and analyzed.
 Cytotoxicity against both K562 and squamous cell carcinoma (MDA686-Ln) cell lines was determined by use of standard chromium-release assays.
 The immunomodulatory capacity of serum was correlated with levels of various acute phase proteins.
 Autologous serum significantly inhibited the induction phase of the LAK phenomenon in 61% of patients and stimulated it in 22%.
 No patients with early stage I or II disease had significant inhibition of induction.
 No direct correlation between inhibition and serum acute phase protein levels were seen.
 An inverse relationship was seen between the C3 component of complement and induction inhibition (r = -0.6).
 These findings suggest that advances of in vivo immunomodulatory therapy will require elucidation of mechanisms of serologic inhibition of the induction phase of the LAK phenomenon.
 Such studies may lead to serologic modification to enhance treatment efficacy of biologic response modifiers.
