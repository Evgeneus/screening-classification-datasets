Preoperative segmental localization of hepatic metastases: utility of three-dimensional CT during arterial portography.
 To evaluate the accuracy of a fast three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique in determining the segmental location of hepatic metastases, 14 patients (40 metastases) were prospectively investigated before surgery with dynamic two-dimensional (2D) computed tomography during sequential arterial portography (CTAP).
 All patients underwent subsequent hepatic tumor resection within 4 days.
 After computer-generated mapping of hepatic venous structures with high attenuation and metastases with low attenuation, 3D reconstruction was performed.
 Thirty-six of the 40 lesions (90%) were detected with 2D and 3D CTAP.
 The accuracy in determining the segmental location of hepatic metastases was 78% (28 of the 36 metastases) for 2D CTAP and 94% (34 of the 36 metastases) for 3D CTAP.
 The difference in localization rates between 2D CTAP and 3D CTAP was statistically significant.
 The 3D CTAP technique provides vital data unattainable with other imaging modalities that improve the preoperative assessment of the resectability of hepatic metastases and allows planning a safer surgical approach.
