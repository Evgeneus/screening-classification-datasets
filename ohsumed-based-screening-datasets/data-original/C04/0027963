Disruption of human circadian and cognitive regulation following a discrete hypothalamic lesion: a case study.
 We report a patient with rostral hypothalamic damage that significantly disrupted temporal patterning of the sleep-wake cycle, body temperature, and cognitive and behavioral functioning.
 The findings suggest that the suprachiasmatic region of the hypothalamus is important for the circadian control of human behavior, and that circadian organization may be essential for normal cognitive functioning.
