Carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract: prognostic factors and disease outcome.
 This study represents retrospective analysis of 87 patients with a carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract seen and followed in the British Columbia Cancer Agency (BCCA) from 1960 to 1986.
 In 49 cases, the primary site was the small bowel.
 The rest of the cases were distributed as follows: 11 appendix, 10 rectum, 5 stomach, and 7 undetermined.
 We extrapolated the Dukes' and modified Astler-Coller surgicopathological classifications used for colorectal cancer for use in our cases of carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract.
 A strong correlation was found, using this staging, with disease-specific survival.
 Other prognostic factors included histologic differentiation, the presence of macroscopic residual disease after initial surgery, and level of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in urine.
 Among 51 patients with surgically grossly removed disease, there was a tendency for the development of distant and distant/locoregional recurrence more often than locoregional recurrence alone.
 The liver was the commonest site of distant recurrence.
 Analysis of the effect of radiotherapy or chemotherapy on carcinoid tumour of the gastrointestinal tract proved unsuccessful because only a small portion of the patients had this treatment, and it was used mainly for palliation.
