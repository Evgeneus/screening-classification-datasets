Rehabilitation of physically disabled dentists: a model for a vocationally specific rehabilitation program.
 A unique collaborative program whose goal is to facilitate the return of disabled dentists to active dental practice is described.
 This approach includes comprehensive interdisciplinary evaluation and remediation, and it has succeeded in revealing previously undiagnosed impairments which should be considered in the formulation of a rehabilitation plan.
 A case report illustrates the process.
 This program can serve as a model for similar programs addressing the needs of other disabled health care professionals.
