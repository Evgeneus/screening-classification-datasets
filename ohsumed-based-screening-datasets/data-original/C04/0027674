Retinoblastoma. The long-term appearance of radiated intraocular tumors.
 A retrospective analysis of 50 patients with retinoblastoma was undertaken to determine the appearance of intraocular retinoblastoma that had received external beam radiation a minimum of 10 years previously.
 Of the 91 tumors found in 59 eyes, 76 (84%) continued to be ophthalmoscopically visible after 10 years.
 The most common ophthalmoscopic appearance was a Type III regression pattern.
 The type of radiation regression pattern correlated with the pretreatment volume of the tumor.
 The largest tumors (mean, 10.0 disc diameter [dd]) became Type I regression patterns, whereas the smallest tumors (mean, 1.0 dd) completely disappeared.
 This represents the first long-term follow-up of the intraocular status of radiated retinoblastoma.
