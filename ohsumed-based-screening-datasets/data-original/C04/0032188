Intraperitoneal contrast material improves the CT detection of peritoneal metastases.
 The preoperative detection of peritoneal metastases from gynecologic malignancies is difficult; in particular, CT often fails to detect peritoneal implants.
 This study was designed to determine if the administration of intraperitoneal iodinated contrast media would increase the CT detection of such peritoneal metastases.
 Prospectively, both standard and intraperitoneal contrast-enhanced CT studies of the abdomen and pelvis were performed in 16 patients with suspected gynecologic tumors.
 All patients then underwent operative staging, with the location and number of metastases documented.
 The intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies were more sensitive in the detection of peritoneal metastases than standard CT examinations.
 Whereas routine CT detected peritoneal metastases in seven (64%) of 11 patients with surgically proved implants, the intraperitoneal enhanced CT studies detected peritoneal metastases in all 11 patients.
 Depending on the specific intraperitoneal compartments involved, the sensitivity of intraperitoneal enhanced CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases was two- to fourfold greater than that of standard CT examinations.
 Our results suggest that intraperitoneal enhanced CT is superior to standard CT in the detection of peritoneal metastases.
