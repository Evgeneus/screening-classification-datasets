Multiple miliary osteoma cutis.
 We describe the clinical, radiographic, histologic, and metabolic features of an unusual case of multiple miliary osteoma cutis in an otherwise healthy 57-year-old woman.

 This finding prompted a brief therapeutic trial of a diphosphonate, not previously reported in the treatment of this condition.
