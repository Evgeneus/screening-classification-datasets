Minimal resection for bronchogenic carcinoma. An update.
 Minimal resection with curative intent was performed for 24 patients with stage I bronchogenic carcinoma at our institutions over a 12-year period.
 This was usually done for patients who could not tolerate more extensive resections.
 The five-year actuarial survival rate was 65 percent.
 The rate of local recurrences was 13 percent (3/24), and the rate of distant recurrences was 17 percent (4/24), with a median follow-up of 38 months.
 Survival and recurrence rates are similar for patients undergoing minimal resection and those being reported for patients undergoing more extensive resections for stage I bronchogenic carcinoma.
 In selected patients, minimal resection should be considered as an acceptable alternative treatment for patients with stage I bronchogenic carcinoma.
