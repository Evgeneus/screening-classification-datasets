Von Hippel-Lindau disease and erythrocytosis: radioimmunoassay of erythropoietin in cyst fluid from a brainstem hemangioblastoma.
 A 59-year-old woman with von Hippel-Lindau disease developed erythrocytosis and a recurrent intracranial hemangioblastoma.
 Radioimmunoassay showed an elevated level of erythropoietin in her serum.
 Cyst fluid from the tumor also contained erythropoietin, concentrated a thousandfold relative to the serum level.
 Production of erythropoietin by hemangioblastomas may explain the erythrocytosis present in some patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.
