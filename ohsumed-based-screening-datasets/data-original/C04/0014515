Pretreatment neuropsychological status and associated factors in children with primary brain tumors.
 We report on the neuropsychological status of 31 children with primary brain tumors who underwent assessment before receiving therapy.
 Overall, the children performed within normal limits in all test areas.
 The exception was the group with anterior hemispheric tumors who demonstrated deficits in executive cognitive functions.
 Also, when compared according to tumor type, children with midline tumors and hydrocephalus performed more poorly than others on measures of intelligence, executive abilities, visual-motor skills, and fine-motor functions.
 Although one-half to two-thirds of the children with supratentorial midline and infratentorial tumors had cranial nerve, oculomotor, or cerebellar deficits, only the latter were associated with specific neuropsychological deficits (poorer performance on fine-motor and visual-motor tests).
 Age did not appear to be a factor in these children's neuropsychological test performances.
