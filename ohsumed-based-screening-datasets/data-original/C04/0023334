Acoustic schwannoma and epidermoid cyst occurring as a single cerebellopontine angle mass.
 The case of a 66-year-old man with a 3-year progressive hearing loss and a homogeneous left cerebellopontine angle mass on magnetic resonance imaging scan is described.
 At surgery, the major portion of the mass was a typical encapsulated, solid, acoustic schwannoma, but the most rostral portion was a distinct, flaky, cystic mass without a well-defined capsule, typical of an epidermoid cyst.
 The radiographic and operative findings of this unique coexistence of two different benign cerebellopontine angle masses are presented.
