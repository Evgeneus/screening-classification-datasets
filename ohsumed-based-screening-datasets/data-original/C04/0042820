Peripheral ameloblastoma: a clinical and histologic study of 11 cases.
 Peripheral ameloblastoma (PA) is a rare odontogenic tumor.
 Previously, only 39 cases of PA had been reported in the English literature.
 In this article 11 additional cases of PA are presented.
 Concordance with previous cases was evident with regard to race, clinical appearance, and site of predilection.
 However, differences were observed with regard to age, sex distribution, and predominant histologic pattern.
 The average age in the current cases is younger, there is no male bias, and the most common histologic pattern is plexiform rather than follicular or acanthomatous.
 Recurrence following simple excision is rare, but has been reported.
 Long-term postoperative follow-up is recommended.
