Inflammatory pseudotumors of the spleen.
 Inflammatory pseudotumors are uncommon benign lesions that have been found in numerous organ systems.
 However, their appearance within the spleen is decidedly rare.
 Grossly, pseudotumors appear as well-circumscribed, encapsulated masses, while microscopic examination reveals a polymorphous inflammatory cell infiltrate occurring variably with granulomatous reaction, fibrosis, and cell necrosis.
 Because they often present either as unexplained, asymptomatic masses or with vague constitutional symptoms, splenic inflammatory pseudotumors can raise suspicion for a primary splenic neoplasm, such as lymphoma.
 Splenectomy is the treatment of choice.
