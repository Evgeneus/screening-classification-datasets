The epidermal basement membrane in basal cell carcinoma: an immunohistochemical study.
 An immunohistochemical study of basal cell carcinomas of varying histological type, using a panel of antibodies to constituents of the epidermal basement membrane, showed marked deficiencies in the expression of the antigens identified by the antibodies LH7.2, GB3 and G71.
 There was no correlation between loss of immunoreactivity to these antibodies and the histological features of the tumour.
