Disorders of the hair and scalp in children.
 A wide variety of disorders involving the scalp and hair exist that may be encountered in the pediatric and adolescent population.
 An approach to the differential diagnosis of many of these conditions can be considered once the patient is found to have either alopecia, scaling, or tumors of the scalp.
 Certainly other causes of scalp or hair disease exist but the more common disorders can be appropriately considered in this manner.
