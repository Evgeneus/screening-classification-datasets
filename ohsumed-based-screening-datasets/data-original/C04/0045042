Treatment with pulsatile luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone modulates folliculogenesis in response to ovarian stimulation with exogenous gonadotropins in patients with polycystic ovaries.
 Combined treatment with pulsatile LH-RH and hMG, given to eight patients who had anovulation associated with PCO and resistant to CC, significantly reduced the number of large follicles induced by hMG alone.
 A direct effect of pulsatile LH-RH on the ovary is postulated.
 This combined treatment eased the problems of multifollicular development, thereby increasing efficiency and reducing complications in patients with PCO stimulated by gonadotropins.
