Preneoplastic alterations in nuclear morphology that accompany loss of tumor suppressor phenotype.
 Alterations of nuclear shape are frequently observed in tumor cells, but the genes controlling these changes and the stage in the neoplastic process at which they occur are unknown.
 We have studied nuclear shape changes in chemically immortalized, nontumorigenic Syrian hamster embryo cell clones that had either retained (supB+) or lost (supB-) the ability to suppress the tumorigenic phenotype when they were hybridized with a tumor cell line (BP6T).
 Quantitative morphometric analysis of the nuclei of cells from each of two pairs of supB+/supB- variants indicated that the nuclei of supB- cells were significantly more out of round than those of their corresponding supB+ clones.
 These data indicate that modification of nuclear structure may represent an early, preneoplastic event in multistep chemical carcinogenesis and that loss of a tumor suppressor gene function may regulate alterations in nuclear morphology.
