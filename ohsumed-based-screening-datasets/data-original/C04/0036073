Sarcomatous change in a teratoma after treatment of testicular carcinoma.
 Treatment can transform the metastases of nonseminomatous germ cell carcinoma into histologically mature teratoma.
 These lesions typically have a benign clinical course.
 The authors present a case of leiomyosarcoma occurring within such a lesion.
 It arose 18 years after therapy for metastatic embryonal carcinoma of the testis and appears to have been radiation induced.
