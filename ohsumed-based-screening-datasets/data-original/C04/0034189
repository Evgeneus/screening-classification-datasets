Radial nerve paralysis and tumor.
 This paper presents ten cases of radial nerve paralysis because of tumor and reviews 38 previously reported cases.
 The tumor distribution was 35 lipomas, four neurofibromas, four ganglions, three neuromas, one fibroma, and one neurilemoma.
 Malignant tumors are not discussed in this review.
 Electromyography is of value if diagnostic problems occur.
 Postoperative results are normally good.
