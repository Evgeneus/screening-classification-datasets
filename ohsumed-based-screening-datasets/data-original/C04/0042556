Diagnostic imaging of osteosarcoma.
 The diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up evaluation of osteosarcoma rely heavily on a variety of imaging techniques.
 Plain roentgenography, radionuclide bone scanning, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging play important roles in defining local tumor extent, detecting metastatic disease, and monitoring for recurrent tumor.
 Invasive studies such as angiography are now rarely necessary.
 In the future, newer imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography, can be expected to become important tools for evaluation of these tumors.
