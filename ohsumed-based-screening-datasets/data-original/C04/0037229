Peritoneal seeding following potentially curative resection of colonic carcinoma: implications for adjuvant therapy.
 Adjuvant therapeutic strategies for colon cancer are based on the knowledge of tumor recurrence patterns following potentially curative resection.
 Innovative methods for regional delivery of chemotherapy to the liver and peritoneal surfaces are now available to complement systemic treatment.
 We reviewed clinical, reoperation, and autopsy series to determine the incidence of peritoneal seeding following colon cancer resection.
 The data suggest a 25-35 percent peritoneal failure rate among patients that recur, indicating that intraperitoneal chemotherapy is a sensible adjuvant approach.
 The theory behind intraperitoneal chemotherapy and potential complications is discussed.
 We suggest initiation of clinical trials combining systemic and intraperitoneal chemotherapy.
