The value of single versus multiple sections for detection of lymph node metastasis.
 This study was undertaken to determine the value of serial sectioning of lymph nodes as an aid in optimally examining cervical specimens for metastasis.
 The presence or absence of lymph node metastasis in 802 lymph nodes obtained from 51 consecutive neck dissection specimens were initially determined by the routine method, examination of one section from each node.
 This examination revealed 40 lymph nodes with metastatic involvement.
 Further study of the 716 lymph nodes that were initially interpreted as free of tumor by serial sectioning added only two positive nodes.
 Thus, serial sectioning did not contribute significantly to the detection of lymph node metastasis.
