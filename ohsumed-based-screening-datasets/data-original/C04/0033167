Safe and rapid palliation of dysphagia for carcinoma of the esophagus.
 Patients with carcinoma of the esophagus continue to present late when their tumors are inoperable.
 This makes palliation of their dysphagia the main therapeutic aim.
 The Nd-YAG laser has been used in our department to treat dysphagia resulting from cancer of the esophagus since 1986.
 Our rapid, one-stage cannulation technique using the Nd-YAG laser in both contact and noncontact modes was applied to 35 cases of carcinoma of the esophagus with the aim of achieving rapid and safe palliation of dysphagia.
 During the treatment we aimed not to coagulate the tumor and await sloughing, but to vaporize the tumor and ablate as much as possible in a single session.
 In this way there was less need for repeat sessions to create an adequate lumen.
 In a small number of patients (9) who had tight strictures with no visible lumen, a pre-laser dilation was required to allow visualization of the lumen and tumor vaporization.
 For nondilated patients (26) we achieved a 15-mm lumen in an average of 1.6 sessions, and in the dilated patients (9) this was achieved in one session in all patients.
 Functional improvement occurred in 28 patients (80%).
 There were four minor complications and no mortality associated with the procedure.
