Terminal duct adenocarcinomas of salivary tissues.
 Terminal duct adenocarcinoma is recommended as an encompassing diagnostic designation for a preponderantly intraoral salivary gland carcinoma that has also gone under the names of polymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma, lobular carcinoma, and low-grade papillary adenocarcinoma.
 The carcinoma is biologically low grade, with its papillary phenotype manifesting a more aggressive behavior than nonpapillary forms.
