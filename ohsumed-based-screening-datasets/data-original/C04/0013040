Clinical evaluation of plasma abnormal prothrombin (des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin) in hepatobiliary malignancies and other diseases.
 Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), a protein induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) was measured in the plasma of patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma and those with various other hepatobiliary and pancreatic diseases.
 DCP levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay (E-1023), using an anti-DCP monoclonal antibody.
 Forty-two of the 91 patients (46.2%) with hepatocellular carcinoma had abnormally elevated levels of DCP, whereas only one of the 24 patients with hepatic cirrhosis showed a slight increase.
 An increase was also observed in some patients with obstructive jaundice.
 There was no correlation between plasma levels of DCP and those of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).
 In most patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, plasma DCP levels normalized after curative surgical resection.
 Plasma DCP levels were not related to the plasma concentration of vitamin K in the patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Plasma DCP determination may be useful in the diagnosis and postoperative monitoring of the response of hepatocellular carcinoma.
