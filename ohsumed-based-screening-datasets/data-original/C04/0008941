Mechanism of antitumor activity of tumor necrosis factor alpha with hyperthermia in a tumor necrosis factor alpha-resistant tumor.
 Cells from a radiation-induced fibrosarcoma (RIF-1) are exceedingly resistant to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) in vitro.
 We tested whether the addition of mild hyperthermia (42.5 degrees C, 30 minutes) could enhance TNF-alpha activity against RIF-1 tumors growing in syngeneic hosts (C3H mice).
 TNF-alpha was administered intratumorally.
 Tumor cell killing essentially was not measurable following TNF-alpha, hyperthermia, or a combination of the two.
 Single-modality treatments also had no effect on tumor growth delay or on the x-ray dose (given 24 hours after the primary treatment) required to sterilize 50% of the tumors.
 The combination of TNF-alpha and hyperthermia, however, resulted in a marked increase in tumor doubling time and a highly significant reduction in the x-ray dose required to sterilize the tumors.
 Syngeneic lymph nodal lymphocytes and blood leukocytes did not appear to mediate the action of TNF-alpha on RIF-1 cells in vitro.
 Necrosis and hemorrhage were the most prominent histopathological alterations in the treated tumors.
 Electron microscopic studies 6 hours after therapy showed increased damage to capillary endothelial cells and accumulation of neutrophils in the capillaries of tumors treated with TNF-alpha with or without heat, suggesting that neutrophils may mediate the endothelial cell injury.
 These observations indicate a greater than additive tumoricidal effect of TNF-alpha with hyperthermia.
 Furthermore, they support the concept that the interaction between the two agents damages the vasculature, compromising the microcirculation and ultimately causing ischemic tumor necrosis.
