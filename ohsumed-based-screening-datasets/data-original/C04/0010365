Respiratory epithelium in a cystic choristoma of the limbus.
 A female newborn had a cystic, whitish gray mass at the inferotemporal limbus of the left eye.
 At age 3 weeks, the newborn underwent excision of the tumor, corneal patch grafting, and superior sector optical iridectomy.
 Histopathologic and electron microscopic examination of the excised tissue revealed a choristoma consisting of cysts lined with respiratory epithelium.
 To our knowledge, respiratory epithelium in a limbal choristoma has not been previously reported.
