PET studies of fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in patients with recurrent colorectal tumors receiving radiotherapy.
 Forty-four patients with recurrent colorectal carcinoma were examined prior to a combination of conventional photon radiotherapy (40 Gy) and neutron therapy (10 Gy).
 Twenty-one of these underwent a PET examination after photon therapy and 12 also were studied after the end of combined therapy.
 CEA plasma levels were measured from blood samples taken immediately before the PET study.
 A significant decrease in FDG uptake despite good palliative results were observed in only 50% of the patients.
 This may be explained by inflammatory reactions caused by radiation injury.
 Inflammation and metabolically active residual tumor tissue cannot be distinguished.
 It is concluded that an observation interval longer than 6 mo may more effectively detect residual tumor activity.
 In 14 of 41 examinations, an increased FDG uptake was associated with a normal CEA value, and in only two cases were normal FDG uptake values and increased CEA levels found, suggesting that PET is more sensitive than the measurements of CEA plasma levels for tumor recurrence.
