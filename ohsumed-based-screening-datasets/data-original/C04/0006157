Oncocytic renal tubular adenoma (so-called oncocytoma) in seventeen-year-old girl.
 Renal tubular neoplasms (adenomas or adenocarcinomas) are rare in children or young adults.
 Herein, we report an oncocytic renal tubular adenoma (so-called oncocytoma) that was found in a seventeen-year-old girl.
 Preoperative evaluation included aspiration of this tumor, and we suggest that preoperative aspiration is an important procedure in the diagnosis and management of suspected renal tumors in children and young adults.
