Sequestrin, a CD36 recognition protein on Plasmodium falciparum malaria-infected erythrocytes identified by anti-idiotype antibodies.
 The CD36 molecule expressed by human endothelial cells is a receptor for the adhesion of erythrocytes infected with the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
 A CD36-specific monoclonal antibody, OKM8, inhibits the adhesion of malaria-infected erythrocytes (IRBC) to purified CD36 and cells expressing CD36.
 Monospecific polyclonal anti-idiotype (anti-Id) antibodies, raised against monoclonal antibody OKM8, expressed determinants molecularly mimicking the CD36 binding domain for the adhesion of IRBC.
 Purified rabbit anti-Id antibodies reacted with the surface of IRBC by immunofluorescence, directly supported the adhesion of wild-type P.
 falciparum malaria isolates, and inhibited IRBC cytoadherence to melanoma cells.
 An approximately 270-kDa protein was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Id antibodies from surface-labeled and metabolically labeled IRBC and was competitively inhibited by soluble CD36.
 These results support the hypothesis that CD36 is a receptor and the approximately 270-kDa protein, sequestrin, is a complementary ligand involved in the adhesion of IRBC to host-cell endothelium.
 Sequestrin is a candidate malaria vaccine antigen, and anti-Id antibodies that recognize this molecule may be useful for passive immunotherapy of cerebral and severe P.
 falciparum malaria.
