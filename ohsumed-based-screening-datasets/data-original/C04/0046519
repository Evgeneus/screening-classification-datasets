MR imaging of synovial sarcoma.
 The MR imaging findings in 12 cases of synovial sarcoma are illustrated.
 The MR appearance most indicative of the tumor is an inhomogeneous septated mass with infiltrative margins located close to a joint, a tendon, or bursae, especially if soft-tissue calcification can be seen on CT scans or plain radiographs.
