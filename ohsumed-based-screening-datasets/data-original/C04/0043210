Needle aspiration of extrathoracic metastases from bronchogenic carcinoma.
 Five patients with suspected metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma underwent needle aspiration of peripheral metastatic lesions instead of a diagnostic bronchoscopy.
 Aspirates were from the soft tissue of the proximal arm (three patients), an axillary mass (one patient), and a skin nodule (one patient).
 Two patients had non-small cell carcinoma, two had small cell carcinoma, and one patient had a nondiagnostic aspirate.
 The procedure had insignificant morbidity, was easy to perform, quickly established a diagnosis of metastatic disease, and obviated the need for a more invasive diagnostic procedure in four of the five patients.
