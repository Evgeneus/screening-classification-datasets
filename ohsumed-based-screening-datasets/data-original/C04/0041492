Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV staining of cytologic preparations to distinguish benign from malignant thyroid diseases.
 Staining for dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DAP IV [EC: 3.4.14.5]) activity was applied to aspiration biopsy specimens or imprint preparations of surgical biopsy specimens from thyroid tumors.
 Material was obtained from 55 patients with histologically proven thyroid diseases: 9 with papillary carcinoma, 5 with follicular carcinoma, 11 with follicular adenoma, 13 with adenomatous goiter, 8 with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and 9 with other benign conditions.
 Most tumor cells, follicular lumina in cell clusters, and intranuclear inclusions were strongly positive for DAP IV in all examples of papillary or follicular carcinoma.
 In contrast, only a few epithelial cells were labeled for DAP IV in follicular adenoma and adenomatous goiter.
 Some Hurthle cells in Hashimoto's thyroiditis also were positive for DAP IV.
 When a DAP IV scoring system based on the percentage of positive cells and staining intensity was used, all benign tissues except one (from a follicular adenoma) were found to have extremely low scores.
 These results indicate that staining for DAP IV activity is a simple but useful tool to aid in distinguishing benign from malignant thyroid neoplasms.
