Malignant transformation of a Hurthle cell tumor: case report and survey of the literature.
 Hurthle cell carcinoma is a relatively uncommon type of well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma.
 Its diagnosis has been controversial due to the difficulty in separating Hurthle cell adenoma from Hurthle cell carcinoma, thus the term Hurthle cell tumor is often used to describe both lesions.
 The present case of anaplastic giant-cell carcinoma in an 81-yr-old woman arose in a Hurthle cell tumor.
 This case illustrates the propensity of Hurthle cell tumor to undergo "malignant transformation" and argues for a more aggressive approach to such tumors.
