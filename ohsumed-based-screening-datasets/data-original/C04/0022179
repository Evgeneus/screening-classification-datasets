Treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma with a combination of low-dose interferon alfa-2b and retinoids.
 In a pilot study the therapeutic effect and side effect profile of low-dose interferon alfa-2b in combination with a retinoid for the treatment of cutaneous T cell lymphoma were evaluated.
 Seven patients (four women, three men) with histologically confirmed cutaneous T cell lymphoma were included.
 Four patients had received therapy previously.
 The treatment schedule consisted of 2 million U of interferon alfa-2b administered subcutaneously three times per week and oral 13-cis-retinoic acid, 1 mg/kg/day, with subsequent dose reduction in case of response.
 The combination therapy produced two complete and two partial remissions.
 Responses were maintained by continuous therapy for up to 15 months even after dose reduction of both agents by 50%.
 Side effects were negligible and did not result in discontinuation of treatment in any patient.
