Peripheral ameloblastoma with clear cell differentiation.
 This report details a case of mandibular peripheral ameloblastoma having a clear cell component.
 The latter consisted of ovoid cells with vacuolated or clear cytoplasm and vesicular or pyknotic nuclei that may be disposed as discrete clusters or show direct transition from typical acanthomatous areas.
 Comparison of this lesion with other odontogenic and nonodontogenic tumors that contain clear cells is discussed in the context of the differential diagnosis.
