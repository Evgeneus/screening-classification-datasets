Ossifying fibroma in the sylvian fissure: case report.
 A rare case of an ossifying fibroma that developed in the sylvian fissure is reported here.
 During surgery, branches of the middle cerebral artery were encased in osseous tumor.
 The encased branches were divided and reanastomosed after the mass was removed.
 Postoperative angiograms demonstrated patency of the anastomosed arteries and a postoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan revealed no infarction distal to the arterial anastomoses.
 The authors recommend division and anastomosis of the encased arteries rather than partial removal of tumor from around the encased arteries, resulting in residual tumor being left behind.
