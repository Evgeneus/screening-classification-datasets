Endoprosthetic replacement for stage IIB osteosarcoma.
 Over an eight-year period, 100 patients with IIB osteosarcoma have been managed.
 Eighty-one were treated with limb-salvage procedures, 78 of which involved reconstruction utilizing endoprostheses.
 Only 19 patients received amputation as the primary treatment for local control.
 Since 1984, all patients received preoperative and post-operative adjuvant chemotherapy.
 Those patients who received chemotherapy had a statistically significant improvement in five-year survival over those who did not (57% and 32%, respectively, p = 0.014).
 The functional results were good overall, with excellent results seen in distal femoral reconstruction.
 Twenty-eight of the 78 patients treated with endoprosthetic reconstruction experienced 30 complications (36%).
 Mechanical failure was the most common complication (10%) but was generally correctable.
 The local recurrence rate was 5% and the infection rate was 3%.
 Local complications were manageable.
 A statistical analysis revealed that the relative risk of patient death was 2.5 times higher than prosthesis failure for the 78 patients with endoprosthetic reconstruction.
 The intermediate-term results, with a median follow-up period of 43 months, remains encouraging.
