Retinoic acid-induced growth inhibition of a human myeloma cell line via down-regulation of IL-6 receptors.
 In this report we demonstrate that retinoic acid (RA) down-regulated the number of IL-6R on human leukocyte cell lines, including the myeloma cell line AF10, and two B cell hybridomas that correspond to cells at earlier stages of B cell development.
 Using AF10 cells, whose growth was determined to be mediated by the autocrine action of IL-6, we found that RA reduction of IL-6R was concentration-dependent over a range of 10(-11) to 10(-5) M and corresponded to the ability of the retinoid to inhibit cell proliferation.
 The down-regulation of IL-6R number by RA was accompanied by reduced IL-6R mRNA expression.
 RA did not affect endogeneous IL-6 synthesis or secretion from AF10 cells.
 However, addition of exogenous rIL-6 could overcome RA-induced growth inhibition.
 Menthol, a structurally unrelated compound to RA, also suppressed IL-6R expression and, correspondingly, inhibited cell growth.
 Taken together, our results suggest that the antiproliferative action of RA on AF10 cells is caused by reduction of IL-6R expression and subsequent inhibition of IL-6-mediated autocrine growth.
 These findings suggest the possibility that down-regulation of IL-6R is a means by which RA can modulate immune function.
