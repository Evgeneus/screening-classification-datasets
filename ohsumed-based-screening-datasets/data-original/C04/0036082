Childhood cancer among the Polynesian population.
 From June 1981 through June 1989, 95 Polynesian children were seen for initial care of malignancy at the Princess Mary Hospital for Children (PMHC).
 The incidence of malignancy in the Polynesian populations served, the histology of the malignancies, and the outcome of therapy were reviewed and compared with 185 non-Polynesian (non-P) patients seen during the same period.
 Incidence figures for Polynesians and non-P were similar, but histologic patterns differed, showing an increased occurrence of leukemia, particularly nonlymphoblastic leukemia, an increased occurrence of bone tumors, and a decreased incidence of central nervous system tumors for Polynesians.
 Survival for Polynesian children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was worse than for non-P.
 Survival in all other disease categories was similar.
