Giant hemangioma of the liver with pain, fever, and abnormal liver tests. Report of two cases.
 In conclusion, we report the cases of two patients with large hemangiomas of the liver, abdominal pain, increased ESR and fibrinogen, increased serum alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyltransferase activity, and normal white blood cell counts.
 Clinical and biochemical abnormalities disappeared after surgical resection.
 Increased ESR and fibrinogen are probably related to thrombosis within the tumor.
 This mode of presentation may suggest a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
