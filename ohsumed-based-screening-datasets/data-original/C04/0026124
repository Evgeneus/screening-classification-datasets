Cardiac tumors and the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.
 Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is a multisystem disease with a wide range of initial symptoms that can be seen at any age.
 The most characteristic features are vertebral or rib anomalies, intracranial falx calcification, multiple basal cell carcinomas, odontogenic keratocysts of the jaw, and palmar and/or plantar pits.
 Pediatricians need to be aware that if any one of these major anomalies is seen, this diagnosis should be considered.
 There now appears to be an established association between cardiac tumors and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.
 Primary cardiac tumors have been associated with cerebral tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis, and evaluation of cardiac status is recommended when these genetically determined syndromes are diagnosed.
 This communication should serve to alert pediatricians to the need for complete cardiac evaluation and genetic counseling when a diagnosis of nevoid basal cell carcinoma is made.
