Cutaneous vasculitis associated with pheochromocytoma.
 We describe a patient who presented with constitutional symptoms, severe hypertension, and purpuric lesions over the knees, thighs, and penis.
 The patient was eventually diagnosed as having multiple endocrine neoplasia type II, with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
 The cutaneous vasculitis persisted despite treatment with high-dose systemic corticosteroids, but rapidly resolved after the removal of bilateral pheochromocytomas.
 This case demonstrates cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis in association with pheochromocytoma.
