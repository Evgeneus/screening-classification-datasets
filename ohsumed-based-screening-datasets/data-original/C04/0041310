Cerebral granular cell tumor occurring with glioblastoma multiforme: case report.
 A 65-year-old man presented with 4 weeks of partial right visual field loss.
 A left occipital granular cell tumor was diagnosed via open biopsy.
 No specific tumoricidal therapy was given, and the patient returned 2 weeks later with fluent dysphasia and mild right hemiparesis, and formed visual hallucinations.
 A large left parietotemporal mass, separate from the granular cell tumor, was diagnosed as a glioblastoma multiforme by stereotactic biopsy.
 The histogenesis of cerebral granular cell tumors is controversial; this case supports recent speculation of their possible glial origin.
