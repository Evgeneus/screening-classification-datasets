Squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea.
 We treated two patients with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the cornea without involvement of the corneoscleral limbus.
 Superficial keratectomy and cryotherapy in one patient and penetrating keratoplasty in the other patient resulted in no recurrence of the tumor after 46 and nine months, respectively.
 Actinic damage and late manifestation caused by poor vision in both eyes of both patients may have been the risk factors for development of this tumor.
