Carcinoma of the uterus: use of gadopentetate dimeglumine in MR imaging.
 This prospective study assessed the role of gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging in the detection and staging of carcinomas of the endometrium and cervix.
 Surgical-pathologic findings were used as the standard of reference.
 In the evaluation of endometrial carcinoma, contrast-enhanced imaging improved tumor detection and differentiation between viable tumor and retained debris.
 Use of contrast material significantly improved the staging accuracy.
 The ability to assess the depth of myometrial invasion was also improved.
 In the evaluation of cervical carcinoma, assessment of tumor location and size did not improve following contrast enhancement.
 Use of gadopentetate dimeglumine resulted in overestimation of stromal, parametrial, vaginal, and/or bladder wall invasion in eight patients.
 However, evaluation of intratumoral architecture and large lesions was easier with contrast-enhanced imaging.
 When only stage II and higher disease was analyzed, use of contrast material improved the evaluation of disease extent.
 The authors conclude that gadolinium enhancement adds to the accuracy of evaluation of endometrial carcinoma but is useful in only advanced cases of cervical carcinoma.
