Multicenter study of superficial bladder cancer treated with intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin or adriamycin. Results of long-term follow-up.
 We evaluated 158 cases of patients with superficial bladder cancers (Stages Ta, T1, and Tis).
 These cases were treated with either intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) (Tice strain) or Adriamycin (ADR), in a multicenter, nonrandomized study.
 One hundred thirty-one of these patients were followed up; the results continue to show a higher percentage of initial complete remissions with BCG (68%) than with ADR (57%).
 With additional therapy, both BCG and ADR achieved complete remission in 83 percent of the patients.
 When 7 failures with patients taking ADR were switched to BCG and the disease cleared, the rate of complete remission for BCG rose to 85 percent.
 The recurrence rate per 100 patient-months was only slightly different for BCG (0.9) and ADR (0.8).
 The percentage of progressions continued to be higher for BCG (8%) than for ADR (5%).
 Cystectomies were performed in 2.5 percent of the BCG patients.
 Using the Cox regression model with covariates, we found drug treatment, tumor grade, and sex to be statistically significant in determining failures throughout the protocol.
 Although both BCG and ADR were effective over the course of the study, BCG is the drug of choice for residual tumor (Stages T1 and Tis).
