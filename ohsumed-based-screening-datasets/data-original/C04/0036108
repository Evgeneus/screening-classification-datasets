Malignant tumours in patients with a history of multiple laryngeal papillomas: the significance of irradiation.
 For a period of more than 30 years irradiation was used in the treatment of multiple laryngeal papillomas, especially in children.
 The treatment was discontinued because a number of irradiated patients developed laryngeal carcinomas.
 There are however a number of reports of laryngeal and even bronchial carcinomas arising in patients with laryngeal papillomas who had not been irradiated.
 In addition, HPV type 11 has recently been found in laryngeal papillomas as well as in laryngeal and bronchial carcinomas, subsequently arising in the same patients, both irradiated and non-irradiated.
 The analysis of a series of 113 patients with laryngeal papillomas has shown that irradiated patients have a 16-fold increased risk of a subsequent carcinoma in the respiratory system.
