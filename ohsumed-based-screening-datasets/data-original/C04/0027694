Concomitant whole-abdominal radiation and intraperitoneal chemotherapy in advanced ovarian carcinoma. A pilot study.
 Because the use of cisplatin-based chemotherapy for ovarian carcinoma has not significantly improved 5-year survival rates compared with either whole-abdominal radiation (WAR) or single-agent chemotherapy, a pilot study was begun to assess the feasibility of concomitant radiation and chemotherapy.
 Eleven previously untreated patients with Stages III and IV ovarian carcinoma were treated concomitantly with 2000 cGy of WAR and intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin followed by additional IP cisplatin after debulking surgery.
 Toxicity was moderate to severe.
 Sixty-four percent of patients had Grades 3 to 4 hematologic toxicity, and 36% required hospitalization for sepsis during WAR/IP cisplatin.
 Hematologic toxicity was less pronounced during IP cisplatin alone.
 All patients experienced moderate gastrointestinal toxicity.
 The average percentage of total body weight lost was 13.5%.
 Fifty-five percent of all patients demonstrated a complete clinical response to therapy, and patients with minimal postoperative residual disease fared better.
 One patient with persistent disease had acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) 24 months after initial diagnosis.
 No patients with residual disease greater than 20 mm survived, while 50% of patients with less than 20 mm are clinically free of disease.
 Toxicity appears to be additive with the combination of WAR and IP cisplatin.
 Therapeutic efficacy was comparable with standard chemotherapy regimens, but no therapeutic or survival advantages were demonstrated with the use of this treatment protocol.
