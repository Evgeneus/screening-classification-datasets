Intraoperative localization of colorectal cancers using radiolabelled monoclonal antibodies.
 Radiation detectors may allow the intraoperative localization of small cancer deposits following administration of radiolabelled tumour-associated antibodies.
 This technique was evaluated in 16 patients with colorectal tumours (14 cancers, one adenoma, one lipoma) with the 111In-labelled monoclonal antibody (MAb) ICR2 which recognizes the tumour-associated epithelial membrane antigen (EMA).
 At operation counting was carried out (3 x 20 s per site) using a hand-held radiation probe over the primary lesions and any palpable lymph nodes in the mesocolon.
 The tumour to normal colon (T/NC) ratio of counts recorded at operation was more than 1.5:1 in eight of the 14 patients with cancer (mean(s.d.), 1.54(0.41):1) and 0.91:1 and 1.06:1 respectively in the two patients with benign tumours.
 Node to normal colon ratios were higher in lymph nodes containing metastases.
 The uptake of radiolabelled antibody (T/NC ratio) was higher in EMA-expressing cancers than in those not expressing the target antigen (mean(s.d.), 2.45(0.65):1 versus 1.40(0.20):1, P = 0.019).
 An abdominal tumour model was also developed.
 Radioactively filled containers of 0.5-10 ml representing tumour deposits were suspended in a tank of 111In solution representing the background activity found in normal tissues.
 The ratio of radioactivity in the 'tumour' to that of background varied from 2:1 to 8:1.
 The 'tumour' was considered to be detectable if the mean counts recorded over the 'tumour' exceeded the mean of counts recorded over background by three standard deviations.
 At a ratio of 2:1 only 'tumours' greater than 5 ml could be detected with a sodium iodide probe and those over 10 ml could be detected with a cadmium telluride (CdTe) probe.
 At a ratio of 8:1, 'tumours' of 0.5 ml could be detected with either probe.
 At all ratios and counting periods the NaI probe was more sensitive than the CdTe.
