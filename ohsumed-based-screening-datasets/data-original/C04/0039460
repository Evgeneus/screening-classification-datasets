Choroidal detachment associated with malignant choroidal tumors.
 The association of choroidal detachment with malignant choroidal tumors is not well recognized.
 The authors' experience with six cases suggests that choroidal detachment may be associated with both metastatic tumors and choroidal melanoma.
 In two of these cases, the choroidal or retinal detachment was so massive that echography was necessary to detect the underlying tumor.
 Three patients presented with painful visual loss, and three patients presented with painless visual loss or a visual field defect.
 In one patient, the correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment of the choroidal metastasis with external radiation relieved the patient's pain and improved visual acuity from 1/200 to 20/35.
 Metastatic and primary uveal malignant tumors should be added to the list of causes of choroidal detachment and can be excluded only after thorough clinical, and often echographic, examination.
