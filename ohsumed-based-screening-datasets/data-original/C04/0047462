Intratemporal facial nerve hemangiomas.
 Facial nerve hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that arise within the temporal bone and have a histologic appearance similar to both cavernous hemangiomas and vascular malformations.
 In contrast to facial nerve schwannomas, these are extraneural tumors that cause symptoms by compression and tend to produce deficits when very small in size.
 We report our experience at the House Ear Clinic with 34 patients having these nonglomus intratemporal vascular tumors.
 Hemangiomas arising in the internal auditory canal tend to produce a progressive sensorineural hearing loss and are demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), whereas those at the geniculate ganglion are usually first seen with facial nerve symptoms and may require high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) for detection.
 Facial electromyography is helpful in establishing the diagnosis.
 Because of their extraneural nature, early diagnosis can permit removal of the tumor with preservation of facial nerves in some patients.
