Formation of neutralizing antibodies against natural interferon-beta, but not against recombinant interferon-gamma during adjuvant therapy for high-risk malignant melanoma patients.
 In an adjuvant clinical trial, 34 high-risk malignant melanoma patients were treated with natural interferon (IFN)-beta and recombinant IFN-gamma.
 Patients with tumor location on head, neck, and trunk received 3 million IU IFN-beta intravenously (IV) three times weekly for 24 weeks.
 Patients with tumor location on the extremities received subcutaneous (SC) injection of 2 million IU of IFN-beta distal the locoregional lymph nodes instead.
 All patients were given 50 micrograms IFN-gamma SC on 3 consecutive days every 4 weeks.
 Antibody formation was detected by coincubation of IFN and patients' serum and assessment of the inhibition of the cytopathic effect by a virus suspension.
 Soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique.
 No antibodies against IFN-gamma were observed.
 The overall incidence of antibody formation to IFN-beta was 55.8% (19/34).
 Ninety-two percent of the SC-treated patients (13/14) and 30% (six of 20) of the IV-treated patients developed antibodies.
 Soluble interleukin-2 receptors were found to be significantly lower in antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients.
 The authors conclude that IFN-beta antibody formation is frequent and might influence IFN induced sIL-2R elevation in vivo.
