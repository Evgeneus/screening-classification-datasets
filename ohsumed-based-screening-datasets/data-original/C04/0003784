Endometrioma. An intra-abdominal troublemaker.
 A ten-year review of intestinal and abdominal wall endometriomas is reported.
 Seven cases of intestinal and two cases of abdominal wall endometriomas are presented.
 Symptoms were varied but a majority had some gynecologic complaint.
 In this select group of patients, preoperative investigations did not assist in establishing the diagnosis.
 All patients underwent surgery and coexisting inflammatory bowel disease was present in two patients.
 This review suggests that endometrioma of the intestine requires a high index of suspicion for diagnosis and that danazol does not appear to be effective treatment for these patients.
