Combined portal vein and liver resection for carcinoma of the biliary tract.
 Twenty-nine patients with advanced carcinoma of the bile duct or gallbladder underwent combined portal vein and liver resection.
 Segmental excision of the portal vein was performed in 16 cases and wedge resection of the vessel wall in 13.
 The operative mortality rate was 17 per cent.
 The median survival for the 24 patients who left hospital was 19.8 months.
 Actuarial survival rates at 1, 3 and 5 years for all 29 patients were 48 per cent, 29 per cent, and 6 per cent respectively, whereas the median survival for 46 patients with unresectable carcinoma was 3 months and the 1 and 3-year actuarial survival rates were 13 per cent and zero respectively.
 This difference in survival times between patients undergoing hepatectomy with portal vein resection and those with unresectable carcinoma were statistically significant (P less than 0.01).
 Combined portal vein and liver resection is recommended as a reasonable surgical approach in selected patients with advanced carcinoma of the biliary tract.
