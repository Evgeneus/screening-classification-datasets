Multiple, giant fibroadenoma.
 Multiple, giant fibroadenomas are histologic and clinical variants of "juvenile" or "giant" fibroadenomas.
 These tumors are rare and occur mainly in adolescent and young adult black females.
 The individual lesions are well encapsulated with a histologic pattern primarily of the "juvenile" type, although cases of the "adult" type have been reported.
 A high incidence of recurrence is noted upon local excision, although this may decrease as the patient becomes older.
 Management options include local excision with reconstruction, reduction mammoplasty, and simple mastectomy with reconstruction.
 A case is described of this condition with review of the literature.
