Endometriosis of the abdominal wall.
 Endometriosis of the abdominal wall typically occurs as a painful mass in a lower abdominal incision from previous cesarean section or hysterectomy.
 Most patients are young and in their active reproductive years.
 The histologic diagnosis requires a combination of either endometrial-like glands, endometrial stroma, or hemosiderin pigment.
 The diagnosis must be considered in any woman with an abdominal wall mass and a history of transabdominal gynecologic surgery.
 Wide excision offers the best chance to prevent recurrence.
