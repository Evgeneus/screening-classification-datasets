A randomized trial of levamisole versus placebo as adjuvant therapy in malignant melanoma.
 We conducted a long-term follow-up (median, 10.5 years) of patients included in a randomized trial of levamisole versus placebo as surgical adjuvant therapy in 203 patients with malignant melanoma.
 Of the patients randomized, 104 received levamisole, and 99 received placebo.
 The results show that there is no difference between the treatment and control groups with regard to any of the three end points analyzed.
 These included disease-free interval, time to appearance of visceral metastasis, and survival.
 Moreover, there was no significant difference between the treatment and control groups after adjusting for age, sex, or stage of disease.
