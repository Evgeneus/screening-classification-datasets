Expression of the insulin like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) gene is increased in human renal carcinomas.
 After we had established that the IGFBP-3 gene is expressed in normal human kidney we examined renal adenocarcinoma tissue for alterations of the expression of this gene.
 For this purpose we prepared poly(A)+ RNA from normal kidney tissue and adjacent renal adenocarcinoma of 18 adult patients and compared the levels of IGFBP-3 mRNA by Northern analysis in both samples.
 The mean content by densitometry was markedly increased in the carcinoma tissues; in 17 of 18 patients the carcinoma contained significantly more IGFBP-3 mRNA than the normal kidney sample.
 The highest mRNA levels were found in patients with N2 and N3 lymph node extensions.
 Comparative Southern analysis of paired samples of four of these patients did not reveal amplification of the gene as the cause of these increased mRNA levels.
 In one patient, however, we identified a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) present in normal and malignant cellular DNA.
 This suggests a participation of the IGFBP-3 gene in the development of human renal cell cancer.
