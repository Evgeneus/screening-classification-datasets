Insulin acutely suppresses parathyroid hormone second messenger generation in UMR-106-01 osteoblast-like cells: differential effects on phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase activation.
 Insulin modifies the effects of PTH on osteoblast-like cells.
 However, the basis for this effect is unknown.
 In bone and kidney cells, the effects of PTH on cellular function are mediated by second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems.
 Therefore, we examined the effects of insulin on PTH second messenger generation in UMR-106-01 rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells.
 PTH produced a rapid, transient increase in intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) which was maximal at 30 sec and was only minimally reduced in the absence of extracellular calcium.
 Inositol-triphosphate (IP3) production was increased in parallel.
 PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i was concentration-dependent from 0.5-1,000 nM, with half-maximal stimulation at approximately 50 nM PTH.
 A 30-sec exposure to 50 nM PTH produced 32% and 23% increases in IP1 and IP3 production, respectively (both P less than 0.05).
 Although insulin alone did not significantly alter basal [Ca2+]i, a 1-min exposure to 1-100 nM insulin produced a concentration-dependent suppression of the PTH-stimulated transient increase in [Ca2+]i and IP3 generation.
 100 nM insulin decreased 50 nM PTH stimulation of [Ca2+]i and IP3 levels by 84% (P less than 0.02) and 80% (P less than 0.001), respectively.
 Preexposure to insulin also decreased PTH stimulation of intracellular cAMP levels, but to a lesser degree.
 A 1-min exposure to 100 nM insulin produced a 32% (P less than 0.01) decrease in PTH-stimulated cAMP generation, but lower insulin concentrations were without significant effects.
 These results demonstrate that in UMR-106-01 cells, insulin suppresses PTH stimulation of second messengers generated through both the phospholipase C and adenylate cyclase systems, but has a more marked effect on the former.
