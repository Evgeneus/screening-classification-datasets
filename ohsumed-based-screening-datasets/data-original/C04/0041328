Management of renal cell carcinoma with vena caval thrombi via cardiopulmonary bypass and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.
 Cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest allows safe and effective removal of renal tumors with extensive thrombi involving the vena cava under controlled circumstances without permanent side effects.
 The technique averts extensive dissection of the inferior vena cava and occlusion of major vessels while providing up to 60 minutes of safe operating time in a bloodless field and complete visibility of the interior of the vena cava.
 Adjunctive procedures for tumor excision or cardiac revascularization can be performed at the same time without increased operative risk.
