Ten years after cryosurgical treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.
 From 1974 to 1977 we treated 96 patients for grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia with cryotherapy.
 They were monitored for 10 to 14 years with an attendance rate of 98%.
 Treatment resulted in cure in 92%.
 Nine patients had persisting lesions, and three patients had a recurrent lesion.
 The last recurrence was diagnosed 6.7 years after cryotherapy.
