Soft-tissue sarcoma: MR imaging vs sonography for detection of local recurrence after surgery.
 To determine the value of MR and sonography in detecting local recurrences of soft-tissue sarcomas after surgery, 26 MR and sonographic studies performed in 21 patients were reviewed retrospectively.
 Recurrences were confirmed histologically in 12 (46%) of 26 studies.
 The MR images and sonograms were obtained within 1 month of each other.
 The findings were classified as recurrence, no recurrence, or indeterminate.
 Sonography was instrumental in guiding fine-needle aspiration biopsy of impalpable lesions.
 In two cases, the findings on sonography were indeterminate.
 In both of these cases, the sonograms had been obtained soon after surgery (at 2 and 4 months).
 The sensitivity and specificity in the detection of local recurrences were 83% and 93%, respectively, for MR and 100% and 79%, respectively, for sonography.
 These differences were not statistically significant.
 We conclude that MR and sonography appear to be equally useful in the detection of local recurrences of soft-tissue sarcomas, sonography can be used for routine follow-up and in guiding needle biopsies, sonography may be more difficult to interpret than MR during the early postoperative period, and MR should be used if sonography is inconclusive.
