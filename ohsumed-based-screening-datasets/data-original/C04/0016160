Haemangiopericytoma of the temporal bone.
 Haemangiopericytoma is an uncommon vascular tumour with a widespread distribution.
 Although meningeal involvement is well recognized, only a few sporadic cases of temporal bone lesions have been documented, all with doubtful sites of origin.
 Late presentation together with the restrictive anatomy of this region often precludes its effective removal and even minimal residual disease may progress rapidly.
 A series of three such patients are presented in order to discuss the natural history, histological features and treatment of this disease.
