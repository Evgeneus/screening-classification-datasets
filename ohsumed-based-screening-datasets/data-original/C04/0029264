Autofluorescence of normal and malignant bronchial tissue.
 In vivo autofluorescence spectra were obtained in 5 patients with carcinoma in situ, 26 patients with invasive tumors, and 1 patient with severe dysplasia.
 Significant spectral differences were observed between pre-cancerous, cancerous, and normal bronchial tissues.
 This difference may afford a method to image and/or detect early lung cancer by using tissue autofluorescence alone.
