Hepatofugal arterial signal in the main portal vein: an indicator of intravascular tumor spread.
 Five patients with thrombosis of the main portal vein underwent Doppler ultrasound (US).
 Three of these patients had confirmed hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Doppler US allowed differentiation between bland thrombus and tumor thrombus in two of the three patients.
 Tumor thrombus of the main portal vein was characterized at US by an intraportal arterial waveform in a hepatofugal direction.
