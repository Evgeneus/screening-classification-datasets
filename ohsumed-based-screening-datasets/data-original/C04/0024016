Symptomatic pancreatic heterotopia treated by local excision.
 Non-ulcer dyspepsia is a continuing problem and in many cases a precise cause is never identified.
 We present five patients with an allegedly uncommon condition--pancreatic heterotopia.
 They were managed by local excision of the tumour and after a mean (range) follow up of 42 (9-80) months all remain free of the original symptoms.
