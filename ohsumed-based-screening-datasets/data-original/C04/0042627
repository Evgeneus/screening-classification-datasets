Proliferative activity of neuroendocrine tumours of the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system: DNA flow cytometric and immunohistological investigations.
 The proliferative activity of 16 tumour specimens from 13 patients with neuroendocrine tumours of the gastroenteropancreatic endocrine system was studied by DNA flow cytometry and immunohistology for the nuclear Ki67 proliferation antigen.
 Equivalent results were obtained with both methods, which showed the proliferative activity of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumours to be heterogeneous.
 In four malignant small intestinal carcinoids and one extravisceral carcinoid localised in the retroperitoneum the percentage (index) of proliferating tumour cells as measured by DNA flow cytometry ranged from 2.9 to 36.2% corresponding to low, moderate, or high proliferative activity.
 In four malignant pancreatic endocrine tumours and their metastases indices ranged from 8.7 to 18.3%, corresponding to low, moderate, or high proliferative activity.
 In four benign pancreatic endocrine tumours indices ranged from 4.3 to 7.7%, all corresponding to low proliferative activity.
 This heterogeneity of proliferative activity may in part explain the heterogeneous results reported of chemotherapy treatment.
 As chemotherapy of tumours is largely affected by favourable cell cycling kinetics, individual diagnostic investigations of the proliferative activity of these neuroendocrine tumours may be of value for identifying patients suitable for this treatment.
