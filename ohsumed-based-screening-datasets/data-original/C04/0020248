Patient perceptions.
 The cancer patient's perceptions about treatment, prognosis, and long-term care have emerged in the context of interaction with the changing healthcare system.
 A brief overview of cancer patients' perceptions regarding their disease and subsequent care is provided.
 The economic, organizational, and technological environment in which this care is provided and the patient's perceptions of that environment are discussed.
 In addition to economic pressures, the ever-increasing number of cancer patients, prolonged survival, and patients' perceptions have created changes in the healthcare system.
 These changes are mediated by important socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic characteristics of the cancer patient.
 Recommendations to address these changes are discussed.
