Fine needle aspiration biopsy of superficial masses in children.
 Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is an underused diagnostic procedure in children, particularly in the evaluation of superficial masses.
 A total of 54 FNABs of superficial masses were performed in children aged 1 month to 15 years.
 Adequate material for diagnosis was obtained in 50 attempts.
 The cytologic diagnosis increased clinical understanding and provided a guide for treatment in 46 of the 50 cases.
 The cytologic diagnosis was confirmed in 15 of 19 patients who underwent an operation.
 Surgical intervention was obviated in 31 patients.
 There was one false-positive diagnosis of cancer.
 We describe the role of FNAB in children and its technique, accuracy, and diagnostic problems.
