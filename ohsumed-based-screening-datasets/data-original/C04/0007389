Immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma presenting as an eyelid tumor.
 A 59-year-old white man presented with an ulcerating mass of the left upper eyelid of 6 months' duration.
 A biopsy specimen of the tumor was diagnosed as an immunoblastic T-cell malignant lymphoma.
 The lesion completely regressed after 4000 cGy of cobalt-60 radiation therapy.
 In the ensuing 33 months, multiple, widespread skin nodules of the same neoplasm developed including a right upper eyelid tumor.
 To the authors' knowledge, this is the first reported case of an immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma initially manifesting as an eyelid neoplasm.
