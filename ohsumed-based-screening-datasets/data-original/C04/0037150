Familial juvenile polyposis coli and colorectal cancer.
 A 40-year-old mother and her 7-year-old son underwent colectomy for polyposis coli.
 Both colectomy specimens contained predominantly juvenile polyps.
 The mother's specimen also had numerous tubular adenomas and one 5-cm severely dysplastic villous adenoma without invasive carcinoma.
 Foci of adenomatous change in juvenile polyps were present in the son's specimen.
 The histologic features of both cases suggest a sequence of change from juvenile polyps to adenomatous polyps to cancer.
