Isolation, physicochemical characterization and preclinical efficacy evaluation of soluble scleroglucan.
 Herein we describe the isolation, physicochemical characterization and preclinical evaluation of a water-soluble biologic response modifier extracted from Sclerotium glucanicum.
 Alkaline extraction of insoluble S.
 glucanicum exopolymers produced a soluble scleroglucan composed of a triple-helical beta-1,3-linked glucopyranose backbone with single beta-1,6-linked glucopyranosyl branches every third subunit.
 Scleroglucan has a weight average molecular mass of 1.56 x 10(6) Da, a weight average root mean square distance from the center of gravity of the molecule to its farthest elements of 51.8 nm, a polydispersity (weight-average molecular mass/number average molecular mass) of 1.83 and intrinsic viscosity of 3.081 dl/g.
 Scleroglucan (250 mg/kg, intravenously) stimulated in vivo murine macrophage phagocytic activity (66%, P less than .001) and increased in vitro macrophage tumor cytotoxicity against syngeneic tumor targets by 124% (P less than .05).
 Scleroglucan enhanced (P less than .001) murine bone marrow proliferation in a biphasic manner by up to 328%.
 Scleroglucan therapy increased survival of mice challenged with syngeneic lymphoma, melanoma or adenocarcinoma.
 AKR/J mice bearing syngeneic lymphoma (1 x 10(3) cells, intraperitoneally) demonstrated increased (P less than .001) long-term survival (100% vs.
 0%, greater than 64 days).
 C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic melanoma B16 (5 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased long-term survival (64% vs.
 0%, P less than .05).
 C57Bl/6J mice bearing syngeneic adenocarcinoma BW10232 (1 x 10(5) cells, subcutaneously) demonstrated increased (P less than .05) median survival time.
 In addition, scleroglucan prophylaxis increased resistance of mice to challenge with Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and mouse hepatitis virus A-59.
 Scleroglucan did not induce toxicity or hepatomegaly.
 We conclude that: 1) a branched, water-soluble beta-1,3-linked scleroglucan biologic response modifier can be extracted from S.
 glucanicum; 2) scleroglucan will stimulate immunity, modify experimental neoplastic disease and increase resistance to microbial challenge; and 3) scleroglucan shows promise as an immunopotentiating drug.
