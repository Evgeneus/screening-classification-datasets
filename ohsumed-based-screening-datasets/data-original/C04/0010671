Rapid sequence treatment of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract: a pilot study.
 A review of the literature suggested that prolonged treatment time may lessen the probability of cure for patients with advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.
 To shorten treatment time, rapid sequence treatment (RST) was devised in which chemotherapy, surgery, and irradation were administered in a total treatment time of 8 weeks.
 Twelve patients were treated and followed 3 years or longer.
 Medical complications were minor.
 Osteonecrosis occurred in each of the first five patients and was the only major complication of the protocol.
 Surgical techniques were modified, and no additional patient developed osteonecrosis.
 No patient developed local or regional recurrence.
 Two patients developed distant metastases and three other patients developed second primaries.
 Absolute survival was 50%.
 Rapid sequence treatment is an aggressive and potentially hazardous protocol that yielded encouraging results in this pilot study.
