A significant association of Ha-ras p21 in neuroblastoma cells with patient prognosis. A retrospective study of 103 cases.
 To evaluate biologic characteristics of neuroblastoma, the authors examined the expression of Ha-ras gene (Ha-ras p21) in 103 primary tumors obtained at the time of diagnosis.
 Higher expression of the Ha-ras p21 in tumor cells showed a significant association with lower clinical stage of the tumor at diagnosis (chi-square = 35.418, degrees of freedom [df] = 9, P less than 0.001) and survival of the patients (chi-square = 37.111, df = 3, P less than 0.001).
 Thirty-six (84%) of 43 patients with decreased Ha-ras p21 expression died of aggressive disease.
 The Ha-ras DNA was examined in the 32 tumors by Southern blot analysis.
 Neither augmentation nor deletion of the Ha-ras DNA was observed.
 Amplification of the N-myc DNA was also examined in 43 cases in comparison with Ha-ras p21 expression.
 N-myc amplification was detected in 12 (55%) of 22 patients who died, and 19 (86%) of the 22 patients showed a low expression of the Ha-ras p21 in tumor cells.
 Eighteen (86%) of 21 survivors showed a high expression of the Ha-ras p21.
 The expression of Ha-ras p21 was thought to be a clinically important marker for prognosis in children with neuroblastoma.
