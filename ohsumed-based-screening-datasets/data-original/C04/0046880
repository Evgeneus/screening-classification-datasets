Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide acetate) induced ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in a woman undergoing intermittent hemodialysis.
 Moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome occurred after LA was administered to control menorrhagia in an anephric woman who required hemodialysis.
 We postulate that women who require dialysis may be at special risk for the development of this syndrome.
