Automated procedure for dewaxing and rehydration of paraffin-embedded tissue sections for DNA flow cytometric analysis of breast tumors.
 Flow cytometric DNA analysis of paraffin-embedded tumors is an important diagnostic and prognostic tool in clinical pathology.
 The technique is limited, however, by the time-consuming multistep procedure for dewaxing and rehydrating tissue.
 The authors developed an automated procedure to complete the dewaxing and rehydration of tissue using a routine histologic tissue processor with a 24-hour timer.
 This technique provided excellent tissue recovery and reproducible DNA histograms comparable to those obtained by manual methods.
 Subsequently, the authors analyzed the DNA content of 93 paraffin-embedded breast cancer tissues.
 The automation of a significant portion of the routine processing required for paraffin-embedded tissue makes cytometric DNA analysis a more practical procedure in the laboratory.
