Non-ominous micrometastases of gastric cancer.
 So-called R2 or wider meticulous node dissection was performed in 1368 patients with resected gastric cancer invading beyond the submucosa but without distant metastases.
 Survival rates were similar in subsets of patients with or without microscopic node metastases and macroscopically normal lymph nodes.
 The extent of node metastases has previously been shown to be one of the two most important prognostic factors in gastric cancer without distant metastases, and its lack of impact in these patient groups was not explained by the imbalance of other prognostic factors.
 The findings indicate that micrometastases of gastric cancer are curable by a wide node dissection made in the absence of palpable abnormality.
 They also offer the possibility that an extensive node dissection may yield good stage-specific survival rates, in part because of upstaging of patients.
 The findings should influence the recording of node metastases for evaluation of stage-specific treatment results and for research purposes.
