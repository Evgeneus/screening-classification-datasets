Expression of c-jun during macrophage differentiation of HL-60 cells.
 Cellular transcription factors are important in the regulation of cellular genes.
 Recent studies have indicated that a class of cellular genes known as early response genes are important in the control of cellular growth properties.
 Two of these genes, c-jun and c-fos, play an important role in the control of cellular differentiation.
 Because the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, HL-60, is capable of differentiating to either macrophages or granulocytes, it provides a good model to understand differential gene expression.
 To determine if the modulation of c-jun was important in the differentiation of HL-60 cells to either macrophages or granulocytes, expression of c-jun mRNA was determined by Northern analysis at various times following treatment with a variety of differentiating agents, including 12-tetradeconyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), retinoic acid (RA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25 (OH)2 D3].
 Both TPA and 1,25(OH)2D3, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to macrophages, resulted in marked increases in c-jun mRNA; while RA and DMSO, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to granulocytes, did not greatly alter c-jun mRNA expression.
 HL-60 cell lines resistant to macrophage differentiation after exposure to either 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA did not result in increases in c-jun mRNA.
 These results suggest that elevation of c-jun mRNA in HL-60 cells correlated temporally with differentiation to macrophages.
 Thus, c-jun may be a critical cellular transcription factor involved in macrophage differentiation.
