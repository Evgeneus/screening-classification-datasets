Chondromyxoid fibroma: radiographic appearance in 38 cases and in a review of the literature [published erratum appears in Radiology 1991 Aug;180(2):586]
 Thirty-eight cases of histologically confirmed chondromyxoid fibroma were reviewed and their radiographic features recorded.
 These findings, coupled with a review of the English-language medical literature, suggest that this rare, benign bone tumor has a characteristic but not specific radiographic appearance and may often mimic more common tumors.
 Chondromyxoid fibroma may occur anywhere in the skeleton, but almost half of the cases occur around the knee.
 The possibility of chondromyxoid fibroma should always be considered when a focal bone lesion is evaluated that has geographic bone destruction, a sclerotic rim, lobulated margins, and septation.
 The diagnosis of chondromyxoid fibroma is most likely when the patient is in the 2nd decade of life.
