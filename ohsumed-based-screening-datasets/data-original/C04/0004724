Laryngeal metastasis from colonic adenocarcinoma.
 Metastases to the larynx from distant primaries are very rare.
 Usually the secondary lesion comes from an hypernephroma or malignant melanoma.
 A case of metastatic laryngeal tumour from a colonic adenocarcinoma, occurring in a 59-year-old woman, is presented and the routes for laryngeal spread are discussed.
 The poor survival-rate of these patients justified only conservative surgery.
