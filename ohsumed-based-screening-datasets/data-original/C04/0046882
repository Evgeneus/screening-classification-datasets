Restoration of Na(+)-K+ pump activity and resting membrane potential by myo-inositol supplementation in neuroblastoma cells chronically exposed to glucose or galactose.
 myo-Inositol uptake by culture neuroblastoma cells at a concentration of myo-inositol less than 50 microM was largely Na+ dependent.
 Exposing neuroblastoma cells to media supplemented with increasing concentrations of myo-inositol resulted in an increase in myo-inositol accumulation and intracellular content, but myo-inositol incorporation into phospholipids was not increased.
 The data indicate that myo-inositol exists as separate pools in neuroblastoma cells, and one or more of these pools may contribute to phospholipid synthesis.
 Exposing neuroblastoma cells to an increased concentration of glucose caused a decrease in myo-inositol uptake by two separate mechanisms.
 Acute exposure of the cells to 30 mM glucose caused a myo-inositol concentration-dependent decrease in Na(+)-dependent myo-inositol uptake.
 We propose that the acute inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by glucose is likely due to a competitive type of inhibition.
 Chronic exposure of cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose also caused decreases in myo-inositol uptake and incorporation into inositol phospholipids and intracellular myo-inositol content.
 This decrease in myo-inositol metabolism persisted at a higher concentration of external myo-inositol than the acute inhibition.
 Supplementing media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose with 250 microM myo-inositol restored myo-inositol metabolism and content.
 The inhibition of myo-inositol uptake by cells chronically exposed to increased concentrations of glucose or galactose was due to a noncompetitive type of inhibition that was blocked by the addition of sorbinil.
 Chronic exposure of neuroblastoma cells to media containing 30 mM glucose or 30 mM galactose caused a decrease in Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase transport activity and resting membrane potential.
