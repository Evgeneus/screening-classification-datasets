Carcinoma of the vulva. Clinicopathologic factors involved in inguinal and pelvic lymph node metastasis.
 Eighty-five women with vulvar squamous cell carcinoma were subjected to radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinal and femoral node dissection or to radical vulvectomy with bilateral inguinofemoral and deep pelvic node dissection.
 The association between lymph node status (metastatic or not) and several parameters was analyzed: tumor location, size and clinical stage; tumor thickness, histologic grade and mitotic index; blood vessel, lymphatic and perineural infiltration; and lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates.
 There were no metastases to the pelvic lymph nodes without previous inguinal lymph node involvement.
 Unilateral vulvar carcinomas did not have contralateral metastatic nodes when there was no ipsilateral nodal involvement.
 Lymphatic vessel infiltration showed a statistically significant correlation with inguinal node metastases (P less than .05).
 No correlation was found between lymph node metastasis and tumor size, clitoral invasion, tumor thickness, histologic grade, blood vessel and perineural infiltration, lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltrates, and mitotic index.
