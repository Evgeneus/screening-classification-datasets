Black-white differences in cancer prevention knowledge and behavior.
 Data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey Cancer Control Supplement were used to estimate multivariate logistic regression models of diet change, mammography utilization, stool blood test utilization, and smoking.
 Predictor variables included race, sex, age, income, dietary concerns, and four knowledge-related variables: education and three measures of cancer prevention knowledge.
 When knowledge variables were included in the models, race was not a significant predictor of behavior, with one exception: among women, Blacks were found to smoke less than Whites.
