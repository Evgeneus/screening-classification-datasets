Neuromodulatory effects of atrial natriuretic factor are independent of guanylate cyclase in adrenergic neuronal pheochromocytoma cells.
 This study tests the hypothesis that atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and C-ANF(4-23)-NH2 (C-ANF) augment cGMP generation and inhibit both cAMP generation and depolarization-induced catecholamine release in nerve growth factor treated pheochromocytoma cells by a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive mechanism.
 Synthetic rat ANF(99-126) and the clearance receptor antagonist C-ANF (10(-12)-10(-9) M) inhibited basal and 5 microM vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-induced cAMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner.
 These actions of ANF and C-ANF were blocked by 12-18 h pretreatment with PTX (100 ng/ml), suggesting ANF receptor coupling to adenylate cyclase via an inhibitory guanine nucleotide-binding protein.
 Both ANF (10(-11)-10(-9) M) and C-ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) also inhibited K(+)-induced catecholamine release in a concentration-dependent manner.
 ANF (10(-11)-10(-8) M) increased cGMP generation in a concentration-dependent manner but C-ANF did not.
 The accumulation of cGMP in response to ANF was not altered by treatment with PTX.
 Therefore, PTX dissociated the increased concentrations of cGMP from the ANF-mediated depression of evoked catecholamine release.
 C-ANF also dissociated elevations in cGMP concentrations from an ANF-mediated attenuation of evoked catecholamine release.
 The results of this study indicate that ANF inhibits adrenergic neurotransmission independent of guanylate cyclase.
