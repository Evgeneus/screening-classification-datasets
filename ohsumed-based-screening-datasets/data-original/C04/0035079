Superoxide dismutase in psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell epithelioma: an immunohistochemical study.
 Monoclonal antibodies against human Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Mn-SOD were used to stain frozen sections of normal and abnormal human skin.
 In normal human epidermis, the Cu,Zn-SOD antibody almost exclusively stained the basal cells.
 Mn-SOD antibody weakly stained the whole of the epidermis but more predominantly the basal cell layer.
 In psoriasis, Cu,Zn-SOD antibody mainly stained the basal cells of the lowest parts of the elongated rete ridges.
 Basal cells corresponding to the tip of the dermal papillae were weakly stained.
 Mn-SOD staining was considerably decreased in the psoriatic epidermis.
 In squamous cell carcinoma, staining with both Cu,Zn-SOD and Mn-SOD antibodies was decreased, and single cells positive for Cu,Zn-SOD were scattered throughout the tumour nests.
 In basal cell epithelioma, Cu,Zn-SOD staining was intense and diffusely distributed throughout the tumour nests, while Mn-SOD staining was absent.
