A comparison of the results following oromandibular reconstruction using a radial forearm flap with either radial bone or a reconstruction plate.
 Fifteen cases of oromandibular reconstruction using a radial osteocutaneous flap were compared with 16 in which the mandible was replaced with a reconstruction plate and a forearm flap was used for intraoral lining.
 All cases involved oral cancer; most had been irradiated.
 Nine survived in each group.
 Complications included one infected nonunion in addition to two bone exposures in the bone group, compared with three cases of plate exposure and two bone exposures in the plate group.
 Functional results were similar in both, but osteointegrated implants were possible only in the patients receiving bone.
 Cosmesis seemed somewhat better in the plate group.
 Donor-site problems were common but minor, and long-term forearm function was slightly reduced in both groups.
 Although the sample sizes were small, the reconstruction plate together with a radial forearm flap appeared to provide effective reconstruction following composite resection.
 However, we would not recommend this for the younger patient or in benign disease.
