A phase II study of the combination of carboplatin and ifosfamide in previously untreated metastatic small cell lung carcinoma.
 This Phase II study evaluated the combination of two active agents in small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC): carboplatin and ifosfamide.
 Thirty previously untreated patients (27 men and 3 women) with a median age of 59 years were included in this study.
 Twelve patients had one metastatic site and 18 had two or more metastatic sites.
 The median performance status was 80%.
 The chemotherapy (CT) regimen administered during the course of this study consisted of carboplatin (300 mg/m2) and ifosfamide (4 g/m2) plus mesna every 4 weeks.
 All 30 patients were evaluable: 1 achieved a complete remission (CR) and 18 achieved a partial remission (PR) (objective response rate, 63%).
 The median response time was 3 months and the median survival time was 8 months (range, 1 to 25+ months).
 Bone marrow toxicity was Grade III in three patients and Grade IV in four patients.
 The carboplatin and ifosfamide combination was well tolerated.
 No cross-resistance with the doxorubicin and etoposide regimen was established because 4 of 11 patients responded to this combination (+/- cisplatin) after failing to respond to the ifosfamide and carboplatin regimen.
 The ifosfamide and carboplatin combination may be considered for inclusion in non-cross-resistant alternating CT schedules.
