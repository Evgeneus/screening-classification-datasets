Deep UV photochemistry of chemisorbed monolayers: patterned coplanar molecular assemblies.
 Deep ultraviolet (UV) irradiation is shown to modify organosilane self-assembled monolayer (SAM) films by a photocleavage mechanism, which renders the surface amenable to further SAM modification.
 Patterned UV exposure creates alternating regions of intact SAM film and hydrophilic, reactive sites.
 The exposed regions can undergo a second chemisorption reaction to produce an assembly of SAMs in the same molecular plane with similar substrate attachment chemistry.
 The UV-patterned films are used as a template for selective buildup of fluorophores, metals, and biological cells.
