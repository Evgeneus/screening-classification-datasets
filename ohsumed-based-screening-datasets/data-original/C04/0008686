Parotid duct communicating with a labial pit and ectopic salivary cyst.
 Labial pits are usually described as blind epidermal invaginations of lip mucosa with occasional drainage of minor salivary gland secretions.
 A case of an aberrant parotid duct in communication with both a unilateral, commissural labial pit and an interposed salivary cyst is presented.
 A 7-year-old boy who had experienced lifelong clear drainage from a congenital pit at his right oral commissure developed fever, pain, and a submucosal mass of the right cheek over a 6-week period.
 A preoperative sialogram through the pit demonstrated a communication between the oral commissure fistula, an intervening salivary cyst, and a proximal tract from the cyst to the parotid gland.
 An en bloc resection of the pit, fistula tract, and cyst was performed through a transoral approach.
 The dissection was medial to the buccinator muscle.
 There has been no recurrence of the cyst after 1 year follow-up.
 A description of labial pits and parotid duct anomalies is presented; however, to our knowledge, this combination of anomalies has not been previously described.
