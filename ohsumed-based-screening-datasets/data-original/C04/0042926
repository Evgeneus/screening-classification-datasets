Diagnosing and treating common oral pathologies.
 When the physician is confronted with an oral pathologic condition in a child, the adage "common things happen commonly" should be applied.
 Congenital lesions such as palatal and alveolar cysts occur in almost 50% of newborns.
 Developmental conditions such as Fordyce granules and retrocuspid papillae are found in most children.
 Localized soft-tissue enlargements commonly seen in young children include the parulis, mucocele, papilloma, and inflammatory gingival tumors.
 In addition, soft-tissue pathologies and discomfort associated with herpesvirus infections or recurrent aphthous ulcerations often present as a chief complaint.
 The physician's knowledge and treatment recommendations for common oral pathologies should be an integral component to the overall medical management of infants, children, and adolescents.
