Acute polyhydramnios associated with chorioangioma. A case report.
 A case of acute polyhydramnios occurred at 26 weeks' gestation.
 Prenatal sonography demonstrated a placental chorioangioma.
 Acute polyhydramnios is clinically distinct from nonacute polyhydramnios and carries a high perinatal mortality rate.
 As in our case, fetal death often results from complications of prematurity.
