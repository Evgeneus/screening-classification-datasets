Osteoid osteoma. Diagnosis, localization, and treatment.
 The preoperative insertion of a needle under computed tomographic scan, performed under local anesthesia, is a convenient and important new way to localize the nidus in osteoid osteoma.
 It necessitates less bone removal, which should reduce the postoperative fracture rate.
 It should also help to locate the lesion during surgery.
 Some clinical points and previously unstressed pathologic findings are also discussed.
