Magnetic resonance imaging in the staging of renal cell carcinoma.
 A prospective study has been carried out to examine the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the investigation of renal cell carcinoma in 24 patients.
 In all cases the inferior vena cava (IVC) was well demonstrated with MRI.
 In 14 out of 15 patients where surgical correlation was available, the MRI and operative staging were in agreement.
 Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic (CT) staging were in agreement in 16 out of the 17 patients where both were performed.
 In one case, CT suggested hepatic invasion but this was found not to be present on MRI and at operation.
 Magnetic resonance imaging also provided substantial additional information in three patients, including two cases where MRI demonstrated a patent IVC that appeared occluded on CT (one of which also had vertebral metastases seen on MRI but missed on CT) and one case where CT failed to demonstrate minimal involvement of the IVC.
 Magnetic resonance imaging is an accurate means of staging renal cell carcinoma with clear advantages over CT.
 In no case in this series was inferior vena cavography found to be necessary.
