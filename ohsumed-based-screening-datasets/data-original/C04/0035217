Pancreatic lesions in the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
 Common manifestations of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, an autosomally dominant inherited cancer-prone disorder, include retinal angiomatosis, hemangioblastoma of the central nervous system, renal cysts, renal cancer, pheochromocytoma, and epididymal cystadenoma.
 Multiple cysts and microcystic (serous) cystadenomas of the pancreas have also been reported occasionally in patients afflicted with this syndrome.
 In the large Freiburg study of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome composed of 66 affected individuals, pancreatic lesions were systematically studied.
 Fifty-five living individuals were examined by abdominal ultrasound imaging.
 Abnormal findings were confirmed by computed tomographic scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging.
 For an additional 11 decreased patients autopsy data were available.
 Cystic lesions of the pancreas were found in 10 patients (15%).
 One of these patients presented with multiple pancreatic cysts as the only manifestation of the syndrome.
 In one patient, a malignant islet-cell tumor was found at autopsy.
 Because multiple pancreatic cysts did not cause major clinical symptoms and because follow-up examinations over an average period of 5 years did not show significant progression of the lesions, it is concluded that these patients usually do not require surgical treatment.
 Abdominal ultrasound screening is recommended for patients at risk as a tool to identify potential von Hippel-Lindau syndrome gene carriers with pancreatic manifestations.
 In all patients with multiple pancreatic cysts, the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome should be included in the differential diagnosis.
