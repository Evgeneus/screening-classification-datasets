Mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst from a patient with Muir-Torre syndrome.
 Mucous cell proliferation in a periapical radicular cyst from a patient with a family history of colonic malignancies and multiple sebaceous neoplasms of the skin, so-called Muir-Torre syndrome, is reported.
 Such goblet cell hyperplasia has not been previously reported to be associated with any known syndrome.
 We believe the finding of mucous cell hyperplasia in an odontogenic cyst may not simply be coincidental, but should raise suspicion of paraneoplastic potential and warrant further evaluation for possible occult neoplastic disease.
