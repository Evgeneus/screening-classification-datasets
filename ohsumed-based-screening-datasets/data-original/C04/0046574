Use of combined exogenous gonadotropins and pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian disease [published erratum appears in Fertil Steril 1991 Jun;55(6):1213]
 We previously tested a combined regimen based on the administration of gonadotropin in the early follicular phase followed by pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) until complete follicular maturation in patients suffering from polycystic ovarian disease.
 Despite good clinical results, a high rate of premature luteinization was observed with this approach.
 We therefore evaluated in this study whether starting pulsatile GnRH therapy before gonadotropin administration might reduce premature luteinization.
 Eight women underwent induction of ovulation with both combined therapy and pure exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone alone using a crossover scheme.
 No premature luteinization and a single follicular growth were recorded with the modified combined regimen.
 Clinical results (8/8 versus 3/7 ovulatory cycles; 3/8 versus 1/7 pregnancies) favor the combined approach over gonadotropin alone.
