Chondroblastomalike extraskeletal chondroma.
 An unusual extraskeletal tumor occurring in the right thumb of a 44-year-old man exhibited histologically a chondroblastomalike appearance.
 The tumor was characterized by dense proliferation of chondroblastic cells admixed with a few multinucleated giant cells of osteoclast type.
 The patient had no evidence of local recurrence or metastasis three-and-a-half years after a simple excision.
