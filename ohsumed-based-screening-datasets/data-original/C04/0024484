Renal plasmacytoma: Mayo Clinic experience and review of the literature.
 Extramedullary plasmacytoma arising in the kidney is rare.
 Only 8 cases have been reported.
 Recently, we noted the ninth case, the second case seen at the Mayo Clinic.
 Clinically, the tumor mimics a renal cell carcinoma or a transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis.
