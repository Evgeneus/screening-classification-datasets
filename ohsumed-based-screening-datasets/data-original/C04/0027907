Therapeutic effects of genetically engineered toxin (DAB486IL-2) in patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
 In DAB486IL-2 the receptor-binding domain of native diphtheria toxin is replaced by human IL-2 sequences.
 This recombinant fusion protein is selectively cytotoxic for cells bearing high-affinity IL-2 receptors--eg, leukaemic cells.
 A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who did not respond to gamma interferon and conventional antileukaemic drugs has responded to DAB486IL-2.
