Supratentorial dermoid cysts.
 Supratentorial dermoid cysts are rare lesions.
 In eight cases presented here, the lack of recurrence after subtotal removal of the capsule and the good long-term prognosis are emphasized.
 This finding is in agreement with the literature.
 The frequent relationship of these lesions with the cavernous sinus suggests a vascular genesis in the development of intracranial dermoid cysts.
