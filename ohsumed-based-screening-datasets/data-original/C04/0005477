Concurrent intradural and extradural meningiomas of the cervical spine.
 A case of an extradural spinal meningioma presenting with a separate intradural meningioma at the same cord level is reported.
 Review of the English literature on spinal epidural meningiomas reveals a high incidence of concurrent intradural tumors in patients with epidural meningiomas.
 This leads to the conclusion that the intradural space should be evaluated carefully when an epidural meningioma is encountered.
