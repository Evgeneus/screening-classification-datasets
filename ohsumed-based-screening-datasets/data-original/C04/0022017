Leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and residential proximity to industrial plants.
 The risks of developing leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from living near industrial facilities were evaluated among men from Iowa and Minnesota in a population-based, case-control study.
 We found a statistically significant increase in the risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (RR = 1.4) and a slight, nonsignificant excess for leukemia (RR = 1.2) among individuals who lived .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory.
 Risks were greater for certain histologic types: follicular lymphoma (RR = 1.5), acute lymphocytic leukemia (RR = 5.4), and acute myelocytic leukemia (RR = 2.2).
 For non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (but not for leukemia), the relative risks for those living within .8 km (1/2 mile) of a factory were similar or slightly larger than for those living .8-3.2 km (1/2-2 miles) from a factory.
 Risks did not increase with duration of residence near a factory.
 The elevated risks of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were particularly associated with residing near stone, clay, or glass industry facilities.
 The risk of developing leukemia was greater among persons who resided near chemical and petroleum plants.
 These preliminary findings raise the possibility that general environmental exposure associated with certain industrial activities may elevate the risk of developing leukemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Evaluation of data on proximity to industrial plants from studies in other geographic locations is needed to determine whether our results represent a meaningful association.
