Gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging of the musculoskeletal system.
 Contrast-enhanced MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine has been used in the evaluation of musculoskeletal disorders only in recent years, and for the most part it is still under investigation.
 Review of the literature identified potential uses for this technique: (1) in the spine, for differentiation between scar tissue and recurrent disk herniation and for evaluation of epidural tumors; (2) in musculoskeletal tumors, for differentiation between tumor necrosis and peritumoral edema and for characterization and evaluation of tumors before and after treatment; (3) in the joints for delineation of cartilage and tendon tears, with intraarticular injection, and for differentiation between pannus and joint effusion, with IV injection; and (4) for delineation of infectious processes.
 Further studies are needed to confirm most of these potential indications.
 It is unlikely that gadopentetate dimeglumine-enhanced MR imaging will become a routine part of musculoskeletal MR imaging, and its use will be reserved for specific circumstances.
