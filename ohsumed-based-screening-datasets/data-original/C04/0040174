Large cysts of the pineal gland: report of two cases.
 Two cases of large, nontumorous cysts of the pineal gland are reported, the histopathology of which was confirmed using surgically resected specimens.
 Both patients were middle-aged, and the pineal cysts were found incidentally.
 The histopathological findings in the two cases were strikingly similar to each other and were characterized by the following points: 1) the cyst wall typically consisted of three layers, namely, collagenous fibers, glia-like cells, and normal pineal cells; 2) the cyst wall was relatively thin, approximately 100 to 300 microns in thickness; and 3) deposits of calcification almost always existed on the side of the layer of collagenous fiber.
 Because these findings are clearly different from those previously reported, large benign cysts of the pineal gland, or at least some of them, may constitute a new pathological entity.
 It is important to consider this possible pathological diagnosis when dealing with pineal cysts.
