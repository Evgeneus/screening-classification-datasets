Classic Kaposi's sarcoma: T-lymphocyte subsets, T4/T8 ratio, and NK cell activity.
 Lymphocyte function as expressed by T-lymphocyte subsets and natural killer cell activity was evaluated in a group of Israeli patients with classic Kaposi's sarcoma.
 T-cell subsets were examined in 28 patients, 14 with lesions limited to the lower extremities and 14 with diffuse cutaneous or systemic involvement.
 CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes and CD4/CD8 ratio were in the normal range in all patients, and mean values of the entire group were similar to a control group.
 However, CD8 was in the upper limits of the normal range in some patients with diffuse cutaneous or systemic involvement.
 This factor led to a significantly decreased CD4/CD8 ratio in that group as compared with the group of patients with the disease limited to the lower extremities.
 Mean values of natural killer cell activity in three effector/target cell ratios were significantly decreased in 13 of the patients with Kaposi's sarcoma with lesions limited to the lower extremities and in all of the patients with normal T-cell subsets and CD4/CD8 ratios.
