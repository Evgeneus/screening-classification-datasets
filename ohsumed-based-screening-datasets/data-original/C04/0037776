Prognostic implications of the localization of carcinoma in the head of the pancreas.
 Between 1974 and 1989, 411 patients with pathologically and anatomically proven carcinoma of the head of the pancreas underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
 According to the localization of the tumor, these patients were divided into those with a cranially, centrally (periductally), caudally, or indeterminately localized tumor.
 In cranially localized tumors, extrahepatic metastases and vessel invasion were absent or resectable in 53% and 46%, respectively.
 The tumor was resectable in 41% of cases.
 If a patient with a cranially localized tumor could not be operated curatively for secondary reasons, the prognosis was better than for tumors with another localization.
 If there was unresectable vessel invasion and the tumor was not resectable, the 0% survival rate was reached at 33 months.
 Of the curatively operated patients, 26% were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints.
 Of the centrally or periductally localized tumors, there were no liver metastases in 73%.
 Extrahepatic metastases and vessel invasion were absent or resectable in 57% and 53%, respectively.
 The tumor was resectable in 48% of cases.
 If there was unresectable vessel invasion or the tumor was unresectable, the 0% survival rate was reached after 18 months.
 These tumors have maximal chances at curative resection.
 Of the curatively operated patients, 31% were alive at 36 months after the start of complaints.
 In caudally localized tumors, there were liver metastases in 59%, unresectable other abdominal metastases in 93%, unresectable vessel invasion in 91%, and the tumor was unresectable in 96%.
 In patients with an unresectable vessel invasion or an unresectable tumor, the 0% survival rate was reached after 33 months; 3% of these patients were operated curatively.
 Indeterminately localized tumors had liver metastases in 77%, unresectable extrahepatic metastases in 90%, unresectable vessel invasion in 95%, and the tumor was unresectable in 91%.
 Only one of the 44 patients (2%) could be operated curatively.
