The epidemiology of exposure to electromagnetic fields: an overview of the recent literature.
 Epidemiologic studies of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been reviewed.
 Possible links to incidences of cancer and abnormal fetal development have been suggested by some investigators.
 In general, the results have been inconsistent.
 There are many deficiencies in the studies, and many questions have been raised about the validity of some of the conclusions proposed.
 There is currently no definitive evidence of an association between exposure to EMF and the alleged risks.
 Due to problems and limitations inherent in future studies (misconceptions about exposure levels, uncertainty about field variability, criticisms of surrogate measures), this question is unlikely to ever be answered with certainty.
 Unfortunately, many highly-publicized accounts of speculative and unsubstantiated claims have caused undue concern among the general public.
