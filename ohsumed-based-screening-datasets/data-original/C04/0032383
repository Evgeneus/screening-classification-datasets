DNA ploidy analysis of effectiveness of radiation therapy for cervical carcinoma.
 Cellular DNA content from 30 patients with cervical carcinoma was determined using flow cytometry before and after radiation therapy (RT).
 The authors attempted to correlate changes in DNA content, tumor response to RT, and post-RT pathologic findings.
 Before RT, tumors from eight of 30 patients (26.7%) were diploid or near-diploid; tumors from 22 patients (73.3%) were aneuploid.
 After RT, diploid or near-diploid tumors were found in 23 patients (76.7%), and aneuploid tumors were observed in seven patients (23.3%).
 Aneuploidy disappeared in 15 of the patient tumors, and complete tumor response (CR) was observed in 13 of these 15 patients (86.7%).
 Pathologic examinations were negative in 12 of 15 cases and suspicious in one of 15 cases.
 Of the seven patients whose tumor aneuploidy did not change after RT, CR was observed in only two (28.7%).
 Pathologic examinations were positive in five of seven cases and suspicious in one of seven cases.
 The CR for the 22 patients with pre-RT aneuploid tumors was 15 of 22 (68.2%); the CR for the eight patients with pre-RT diploid tumors was two of eight (25%, P less than 0.01).
 From these data the authors conclude there is a direct correlation between DNA content and radiosensitivity in cervical carcinoma.
 Aneuploid tumors from these patients were more radiosensitive than diploid tumors, and they patients had a better clinical tumor response and improved pathologic findings.
