Five-year survival for cisplatin-based chemotherapy versus single-agent melphalan in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and optimal debulking surgery.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival in previously untreated patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated with single-agent melphalan in which very few patients underwent optimal debulking surgery (less than 2 cm residual) as compared with the patients treated with Cisplatin-based chemotherapy in which most patients underwent optimal debulking surgery.
 Significant increases in 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival were noted as we changed from the melphalan trial, in which only 14% underwent optimal debulking surgery, to PAC-H, in which 57% and the PAC trial in which 90%, respectively, underwent optimal debulking surgery.
 However, for those patients whose tumors were optimally debulked in the three trials, there were no statistically significant differences in median survival, median progression-free survival, 5-year survival, or 5-year progression-free survival in those patients treated with melphalan, PAC-H, or PAC.
 Without optimal debulking surgery, Cisplatin-based multiagent chemotherapy offered a small survival advantage.
 These results are similar to that reported by Gruppo Interregionale Cooperativo Oncologico Ginecologia, in which survival curves were identical for all the subgroups of chemotherapy regimens for those patients with residual disease less than 2 cm at the onset of chemotherapy whether they received (1) cyclophosphamide; (2) cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin; (3) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and Cisplatin; (4) cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, and hexamethylmelamine; (5) Cisplatin and cyclophosphamide; (6) low-dose Cisplatin; (7) high-dose Cisplatin; or (8) carboplatin.
