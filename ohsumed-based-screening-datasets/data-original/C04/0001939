Long-term survival after chest-wall reconstruction with musculocutaneous flaps.
 Reconstruction of chest-wall defects with musculocutaneous flaps permits resection of advanced chest-wall tumors and of tissues severely damaged by radiotherapy in patients who in a previous era were not surgically treatable.
 To determine the long-term outcome from this surgery, the records of 96 patients who had undergone chest-wall resection with musculocutaneous flap reconstruction were reviewed.
 Median survival for the entire group was 20.5 months, but a more accurate prediction of outcome could be obtained by dividing the patients into three groups.
 In group I, patients free of known malignancy and undergoing resection of radionecrotic tissues, median survival was 60.0 months.
 In group II, patients with resectable disease and free of tumor following surgery, median survival was 31.1 months.
 In group III, patients incompletely resected or known to have metastatic disease following surgery, median survival was only 12.5 months.
 Even in group III, however, some individuals achieved prolonged survival and lasting benefits from the surgery, so these data should not be used to exclude patients from undergoing necessary palliative procedures.
