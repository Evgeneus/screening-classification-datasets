SPECT quantitation of iodine-131 concentration in phantoms and human tumors.
 The validity of SPECT measurement of iodine-131 (131I) concentration was tested in vitro in phantoms and in vivo by measuring bladder urine concentrations.
 Phantom studies comparing known and SPECT measured concentrations showed a good correlation for 131I (r = 0.98, s.e.e.
 = 20.94 counts/voxel) for phantoms of 25 to 127 cc and concentrations of 0.13 to 9.5 microCi/cc.
 The in vivo, in vitro correlation of 131I concentrations in the urine was also good (r = 0.98, s.e.e.
 = 0.677 microCi/cc).
 Quantitative SPECT was used to calculate the effective half-life and dosimetry of radioiodine in 12 sites of thyroid carcinoma in seven patients.
 SPECT was also used to determine the dosimetry of [131I]MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) in two patients with carcinoid, two with neuroblastoma, and one with pheochromocytoma.
 The radiation dose for thyroid carcinoma metastases varied between 6.3 and 276.9 rad/mCi.
 The dose from MIBG varied between 13.4 and 57.8 rad/mCi.
 These results indicate the validity of quantitative SPECT for in vivo measurement of 131I and the need to measure the concentration of 131I in individual human tumor sites.
