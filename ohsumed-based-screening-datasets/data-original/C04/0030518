The association of bullous pemphigoid and malignant disease: a case control study.
 In a case control study, the incidence of malignant disease in 84 patients with bullous pemphigoid (BP) was compared with 168 controls.
 The rate of malignant disease (past, concurrent or during follow-up) in BP patients was 17.9% compared to 5.3% in the controls.
 A number of the malignancies occurring in the BP group may be of doubtful significance, being either temporally very remote or partially attributable to treatment.
 The rate of concurrent BP and malignancy (within 8 weeks) was 6.0% suggesting that there is probably a slight excess of malignancy in BP, but insufficient to warrant extensive investigation in pursuit of cancer.
 Comparison of the BP patients with and without cancer identified no clinical or immunopathological subgroups in whom investigations would be indicated.
 Three patients with both BP and malignancy were HLA-DR 13 positive, which may point to an immunogenetic predisposition to both diseases.
