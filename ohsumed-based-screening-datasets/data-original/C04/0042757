Growth of human basal cell carcinomas transplanted to C57/Balb/C bgJ/bgJ nu/nu (beige-nude) mice.
 The purpose of this study was to measure growth parameters of transplanted basal cell carcinoma (BCC) to beige-nude mice during a 4-month observation time.
 Forty male beige-nude mice were transplanted with human BCC with our reported subcutaneous implantation technique.
 Initial volume and wet weight were determined for each tumor.
 The tumors were measured every 2 weeks by calipers with a final volume determined at 120 days, at which time the tumors were harvested, weighed, and processed for routine histology.
 Thirty-two tumor sites were positive for persistent tumor at harvest.
 Tumor volumes declined by an average of 51% and average tumor weight by 33%.
 There were increased numbers of mast cells surrounding the BCC tumor lobules.
 These results indicate that BCC can survive for 120 days in the beige-nude mouse.
