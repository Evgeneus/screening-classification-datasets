Human papillomavirus type-related DNA and c-myc oncogene alterations in colon cancer cell lines.
 Although squamous-cell epithelium is the most frequent target site of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, a similar infection is demonstrated in columnar epithelial cells in this paper.
 The papillomavirus expression in three cell lines was detected in colorectal adenocarcinoma of Chinese patients.
 The HPV-16 and HPV-18 DNA sequences were found in colorectal cancer cell lines, which might suggest the correlation of HPV to the etiology of colorectal cancers.
 In addition, c-myc oncogene was identified by amplification in all three colorectal cancer cell lines, but only normal germ-line fragments were found in control tissue.
 The correlation between HPV and c-myc, and the implications of these findings in colorectal cancers are also discussed.
