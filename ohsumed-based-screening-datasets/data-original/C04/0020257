Technetium-99m (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid: a clinical and scintigraphic study in an animal tumour model.
 Technetium-99m (99mTc) (v) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is a new tumour-imaging agent which has been used to image head and neck squamous carcinoma.
 This study used an established rabbit tumour model to compare palpation versus planar scintigraphy in the detection of superficially transplanted cancers.
 Palpation detected 83% of tumours measuring less than 2 cm compared with 58% for scintigraphy.
 Overall, the sensitivity for palpation was 88% (77% specificity) compared with 50% (63% specificity) for scintigraphy.
