A therapeutic dilemma: suppressive doses of thyroxine significantly reduce bone mineral measurements in both premenopausal and postmenopausal women with thyroid carcinoma.
 We measured lumbar spine, femoral neck, and forearm bone mineral (BMD) in 24 women (14 premenopausal and 10 postmenopausal) who had been treated with total thyroidectomy and 131 Iodine ablation therapy for nonanaplastic thyroid carcinoma and 24 case controls.
 At the time of the study, all patients were free of cancer (negative 131 Iodine whole body scan and serum thyroglobulin levels less than 0.3 micrograms/L) and all were receiving doses of T4 sufficiently high to prevent a rise in a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone concentration after an iv bolus of TRH.
 Femoral neck BMD were significantly reduced in both the premenopausal women (89 +/- 3.8% of case controls, 95% CI, 81 to 98) and postmenopausal women (77 +/- 3.9% of case controls; 95% CI, 68 to 86) receiving T4.
 Lumbar spine BMD and forearm BMD were unaffected in the premenopausal women, but significantly reduced in the postmenopausal women receiving T4 (lumbar spine BMD = 84 +/- 6.2% of case controls; 95% CI, 70 to 98 and forearm BMD = 89 +/- 5.6% of case controls; 95% CI, 76 to 101).
 Serum bone Gla-protein, a marker of bone turnover, was significantly increased in both the premenopausal and the postmenopausal women receiving T4 compared to case controls (P less than 0.001 for the difference between patient groups and controls).
 Whereas the cumulative dose of T4 was highly correlated with the femoral neck BMD in the premenopausal patients (r = 0.528; P less than 0.05); the presence of hypogonadism was the main determinant of the lumbar spine and forearm BMD.
 This data confirms that premenopausal and postmenopausal women receiving suppressive doses of T4 for thyroid carcinoma have diminished bone mineral measurements and are at risk for osteoporosis.
