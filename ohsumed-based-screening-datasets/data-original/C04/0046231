Interferon alpha-2b injections used as an adjuvant therapy to carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant ano-genital condylomata acuminata.
 We retrospectively analyzed our treatment of men with anogenital condylomata acuminata (CA) at Hennepin County Medical Center and the University of Minnesota.
 Between October 1985 and August 1989, 48 patients with CA were treated with laser vaporization, and 27 were treated with laser vaporization followed by a series of intralesional interferon (IFN) alpha-2b injections.
 The patients in the IFN group were more likely to have perianal CA (44% vs 24%), had larger numbers of CA, and were more likely to have had previous treatment, including previous laser vaporization.
 The CA in the laser group were more likely to be on the penis alone (67% vs 45%) and had a longer mean duration.
 The laser-treated group experienced a 38.2% rate of recurrence or reinfection with a mean follow-up period of 13 weeks.
 The laser and IFN group had an 18.5% rate of recurrence or reinfection with the same follow-up.
 We conclude that intralesional injections of alpha-2b interferon following carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant ano-genital condylomata substantially reduce the risk of recurrence or reinfection.
