Postoperative protein metabolism: effect of nursing elderly patients for 24 h after abdominal surgery in a thermoneutral environment.
 We have studied the effect of intraoperative body heat conservation and 24-h thermoneutrality on postoperative whole body protein turnover using stable isotope methodology in a group of elderly patients undergoing colorectal surgery for rectosigmoid adenocarcinoma.
 Two groups of eight patients were studied.
 One group (control, or cold) received routine intraoperative and postoperative care.
 All patients in the second group (warmed) were maintained at normothermia during anaesthesia and surgery; these patients were nursed after surgery in a warm room (ambient temperature 28-30 degrees C) for a period of 24 h.
 General anaesthesia, surgical care and nutritional support were similar in both groups.
 A constant nutritional intake, based on nitrogen 0.1 g kg-1 day-1 and energy 20 kcal kg-1 day-1, was provided orally for 7 days before surgery and i.v.
 after operation for 4 consecutive days.
 Whole body protein breakdown and synthesis, as assessed by stable isotope methodology, increased significantly 2 and 4 days after surgery in both groups (P less than 0.01), but the increase in protein breakdown in the warmed group on day 2 was significantly less than that in the cold group (P less than 0.05).
 The increase in leucine oxidation in the warmed group on the 2nd day after surgery was not significant, and was less than the increase observed in the cold group (P less than 0.05).
 However, by the 4th day, leucine oxidation was enhanced significantly in both groups (P less than 0.01).
