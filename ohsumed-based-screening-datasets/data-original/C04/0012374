Acinic cell carcinoma. Clinicopathologic review.
 The authors reviewed 90 cases of acinic cell carcinoma treated at the Mayo Clinic to assess long-term follow-up and to study features predictive of disease progression.
 Sixty-three patients (55 females and 35 males) were seen for primary treatment; 27 had recurrent disease when first evaluated.
 Histologically, these tumors were composed of serous acinar cells and intercalated duct-type cells.
 Morphologic patterns included solid, microcystic, follicular, and papillary-cystic.
 All patients were followed for at least 10 years or until death.
 Of the primary treatment group, 44% had local recurrence, 19% had metastasis, and 25% died of disease.
 Disease first recurred locally up to 30 years after presentation and resulted in death after as many as 38 years.
 Poor prognostic features include pain or fixation; gross invasion; microscopic features of desmoplasia, atypia, or increased mitotic activity; and excision as initial treatment.
 Neither morphologic pattern nor cell composition was a predictive feature.
