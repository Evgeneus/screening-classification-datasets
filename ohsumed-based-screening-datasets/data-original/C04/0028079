Pulmonary nodule: evaluation with spiral volumetric CT.
 Spiral volumetric computed tomography (CT) was used prospectively in 20 patients with a suspected solitary pulmonary nodule less than 1 cm in diameter on plain chest radiographs.
 Four additional nodules were detected with spiral CT than were detected with conventional CT.
 This technique required a 12-second breath hold; patient cooperation was excellent.
