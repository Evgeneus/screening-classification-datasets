Functioning insulinoma--incidence, recurrence, and long-term survival of patients: a 60-year study.
 For the 60-year period from 1927 through 1986, we assessed the incidence, recurrence, and long-term survival among all Mayo Clinic patients with histologically confirmed functioning insulinoma.
 With use of the complete medical record system at Mayo and the comprehensive epidemiologic data base of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, we found 224 patients in whom an initial pancreatic exploration at Mayo had confirmed the presence of insulinoma.
 The median age (and range) of these patients at surgical diagnosis was 47 (8 to 82) years, and 59% were female patients.
 During the study period, eight cases of insulinoma occurred among residents of Olmsted County; their age and gender distributions were similar to those of the total cohort.
 The incidence of insulinoma among residents of Olmsted County increased during the study period to a stable level during the last 2 decades of 4 cases per 1 million person-years.
 For the total cohort, 7.6% had multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (MEN I), and 5.8% had malignant insulinoma.
 The risk of recurrence was greater among patients with MEN I (21% at 10 and 20 years) than in those without MEN I (5% at 10 years and 7% at 20 years).
 Although survival of the total cohort was not significantly impaired, it was significantly worse than expected for patients with malignant insulinoma (29% versus 88% expected at 10 years postoperatively).
 We conclude that insulinoma is less rare than previously suspected.
 After successful surgical removal, the long-term risk of recurrent insulinoma is relatively high in patients with MEN I; for patients with benign disease, the long-term survival is normal.
