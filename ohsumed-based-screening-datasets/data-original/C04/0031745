Multimodal therapy for the management of localized Ewing's sarcoma of pelvic and sacral bones: a report from the second intergroup study.
 A total of 59 eligible patients with localized Ewing's sarcoma of the pelvic and sacral bones were entered into a multimodal Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS-II) (1978 to 1982) and compared with a historical control series of 68 patients entered into an earlier multimodal Intergroup Ewing's Sarcoma Study (IESS-I) (1973 to 1978).
 High-dose intermittent multiagent chemotherapy (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin [doxorubicin; Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH], and dactinomycin) was given to all patients for 6 weeks before and for 70 weeks following local therapy.
 All patients who had a tumor biopsy or incomplete resection performed received a dose of 55 Gy to the tumor bed.
 With a median follow-up time of 5.5 years, two of 59 patients (3%) had a local recurrence, five patients (8%) had a local recurrence and metastases, and 17 patients (29%) developed metastases only.
 There was significant statistical evidence of an advantage in relapse-free survival (RFS) and survival (S) for patients on IESS-II versus IESS-I, P = .006 and P = .002, respectively.
 At 5 years, the comparison between IESS-II versus IESS-I was 55% versus 23% for RFS and 63% versus 35% for S.
