Primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the ileum in an adult.
 We report a case of primary rhabdomyosarcoma of the ileum occurring in a 45-year-old man.
 The rhabdomyoblastic nature was immunohistochemically confirmed by positivity with anti-myoglobin and anti-striated actin antisera.
 We discuss the differential diagnosis with similar tumors.
 To our knowledge, ileal rhabdomyosarcomas have not been previously reported in adults.
