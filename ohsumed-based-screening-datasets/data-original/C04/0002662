Lateral temporal bone resections.
 Eighteen consecutive patients underwent a lateral temporal bone resection for the treatment of tumors originating in the auricle, the external auditory canal, the periauricular skin, or the parotid and were retrospectively analyzed.
 The different lateral temporal bone resections performed have been categorized into four types.
 The type I resection consists of the removal of the tympanic bone and the external auditory canal lateral to the tympanic membrane.
 The type II resection consists of the removal of the entire tympanic bone, the tympanic membrane, the incus, and the malleus, preserving the facial nerve and the inner ear.
 Type III resections remove, in addition to the those structures removed in type II resections, the distal facial nerve and fallopian canal, the mastoid tip, the styloid process, and the stylomastoid foramen.
 The type IV resection consists of the removal of only the mastoid tip and the inferior portion of the tympanic bone.
 When the techniques of lateral temporal bone resection are used appropriately, adequate surgical treatment of patients with selected advanced and recurrent malignant tumors of the external ear, the periauricular skin, and the parotid is possible with low morbidity and a high probability of local regional control.
