Evidence of a local immune activation in cystic brain tumors.
 The fluid of cystic brain tumors was characterized with regard to the protein content.
 In most malignant tumors, the concentrations of immunoglobulins G and M (IgG and IgM) were higher relative to other proteins in the cyst fluid than in the serum of the same patient.
 A markedly elevated ratio of monomeric to pentameric IgM was detected in the cyst fluid of two patients with glioblastomas.
 The results indicate a local immunoglobulin synthesis in malignant cystic brain tumors.
 It is hypothesized that higher-than-expected concentrations of IgG and IgM in cyst fluid as compared to plasma are a sign of an ongoing immune response triggered by the tumor.
