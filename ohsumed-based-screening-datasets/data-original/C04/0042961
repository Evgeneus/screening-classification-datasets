Osteoid osteoma: CT-guided percutaneous treatment.
 Seven patients with presumed osteoid osteoma were treated with percutaneous destruction or drill resection with computed tomographic (CT) guidance.
 The diagnosis of osteoid osteoma was made on the basis of findings in the clinical history and results at plain radiography, bone scintigraphy, and CT.
 In four patients, histologic confirmation was obtained.
 Hospital stay lasted from 1 to 3 days.
 After 11-38 months of follow-up examinations, all patients were asymptomatic.
 The authors report this simple procedure as an alternative to the more traditional open surgery technique.
