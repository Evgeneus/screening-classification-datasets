Renal angiomyolipoma: report of 24 cases.
 A series of 24 patients with renal angiomyolipoma was reviewed.
 Their ages ranged from 10 to 70 years (average 41).
 Four cases were associated with tuberous sclerosis, 1 with spinal neurilemmoma, 1 with transitional cell carcinoma and another with renal tuberculosis.
 The presenting symptoms in decreasing frequencies were flank pain, mass, haematuria, fever, syncope and respiratory distress.
 Although it has often been said that angiomyolipomas associated with tuberous sclerosis are small and asymptomatic, all 4 such patients in this study had large symptomatic tumours.
 Before the advent of CT scan and ultrasonography, the pre-operative diagnostic rate for cases unassociated with tuberous sclerosis was 10% (1/10).
 With the combined use of these 2 modalities, the diagnostic rate increased to 60% (6/10).
 Most patients in this series were treated with nephrectomy.
 However, equally good outcomes occurred in 2 patients who received partial nephrectomies.
 Pre-operative diagnosis now makes it possible to consider more conservative management.
