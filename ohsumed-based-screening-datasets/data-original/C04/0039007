HBV-DNA-related hepatocellular carcinoma occurring in childhood. Report of three cases.
 In a series of 325 HBV chronically infected children observed over an 18-year period, three developed HCC.
 These three children were born in southern Italy, a region characterized by a high endemic HBV infection rate; each had been infected perinatally, developed an acute hepatitis, and became a chronic carrier.
 Two of the three with cirrhosis were HBsAg positive at the time their HCC was detected.
 The remaining case had seroconverted to HBsAb but HBV-DNA integration could be demonstrated in the absence of cirrhosis; moreover HBV antigens were not expressed in the tissue of this case.
 The interval between HBV infection and HCC appearance in these three cases ranged from six to 11 years.
 A similarity between these three Italian cases and the majority of HCC arising in chronically infected children in the Far East is noted.
