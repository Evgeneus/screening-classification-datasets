Planned delayed nephrectomy after ethanol embolization of renal carcinoma.
 Planned delayed nephrectomy after preoperative ethanol infarction was done in 6 patients with renal carcinoma.
 Three patients had intracaval extension of tumor, 2 had renal vein but no vena caval extension and 1 had no renal vein or vena caval involvement.
 Nephrectomy was delayed 22 to 44 days after embolization.
 In the patients with inferior vena caval extension shrinkage of tumor thrombus after embolization allowed for easier surgical resection.
 Furthermore, delay of nephrectomy after preoperative infarction was of value in improving the clinical status of high risk patients.
