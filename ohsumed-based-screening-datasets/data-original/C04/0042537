IIB osteosarcoma. Current management and survival statistics in the USSR.
 Three hundred and ninety-three patients with IIB osteosarcoma were treated at the author's institution between 1955 and 1986.
 In the first stage of the study, 88 patients were treated with surgery only.
 The five-year disease-free survival rate was 7%.
 In the second stage of the study, the efficacy of preventive chemotherapy after radical surgery was studied in 55 patients.
 The five-year disease-free survival rate was 34.4%.
 In the third stage of the study, the efficacy of combination therapy consisting of preoperative treatment, limb-saving surgery, and preventive chemotherapy was studied in 66 patients.
 The five-year disease-free survival rate was 35.5%.
 The authors examined results in 21 patients with Grade IV responses to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and morphogenic changes after preoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
 The five-year disease-free survival rate was 57.9%.
 In the fourth stage of the study (conducted in 1986), two regimens of preoperative chemotherapy were initiated.
 The first regimen consists of intraarterial platinum infusions to patients with lower extremity bone damage.
 The second regimen consists of high-dose methotrexate infusions.
 The preliminary conclusion is that primary tumor damage is significantly more marked after intraarterial cisplatin infusion.
