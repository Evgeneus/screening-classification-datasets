Metastatic carcinoma in the neck: a clinical, radiological, scintigraphic and pathological study.
 This study was undertaken to compare clinical evaluation of the neck with 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy and computerized tomography (CT) in patients with head and neck carcinoma.
 Twenty-six patients were studied and in all but one the neck was previously untreated.
 A total of 31 neck dissections were performed and the specimens examined histopathologically.
 CT was approximately as accurate (71%) as clinical examination (68%) and more accurate than 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy (48%) in predicting which necks contained metastatic carcinoma.
 Overall, 13% of necks had their staging correctly changed by 99mTc(v) DMSA scintigraphy compared with 10% for CT.
 Although scintigraphy upstaged 13% of clinically N0 necks compared to 6% for CT, it was less sensitive and specific than either clinical examination or CT.
 99mTc(v) DMSA planar scintigraphy has no role to play in the investigation of patients with metastatic carcinoma to include the clinically N0 neck.
