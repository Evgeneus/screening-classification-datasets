Is combined modality therapy appropriate for apparently localized carcinoma of the prostate?
 In a pilot study at the authors' institution, 17 patients with stage C carcinoma of the prostate had preoperative therapy with diethylstilbestrol.
 After 8 to 12 weeks of DES at 3 mg per day, the surgical margins, seminal vesicles, and pelvic lymph nodes were free of tumor in seven patients.
 In one patient, no residual tumor could be found despite an extensive search, and in two other cases, only small foci of atypical cells could be found.
 The authors suggest a trial of the proper role of neoadjuvant hormonal therapy in stages B2 and C prostatic carcinoma.
