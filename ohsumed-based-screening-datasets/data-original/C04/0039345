Routine computed tomographic scans, selective mediastinoscopy, and other factors in evaluation of lung cancer.
 Routine computed tomographic scan is advocated as the best noninvasive method of evaluating mediastinal nodes for cancer spread.
 Positive studies should be confirmed histologically.
 Large size, central location, unfavorable cell type, poor cellular differentiation of the primary cancer, and weight loss also correlate with increased likelihood of mediastinal involvement.
