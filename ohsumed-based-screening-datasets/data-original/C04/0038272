Subpopulations of B cells in germinal centers. III. HJ6, a monoclonal antibody, binds globoside and a subpopulation of germinal center B cells.
 To identify surface Ag uniquely expressed on human germinal center B cells, we produced a mouse mAb, HJ6.
 When tonsillar lymphocytes were examined, HJ6 did not label T cells and labeled only about half of PNA+ B cells that were HK23-.
 HJ6 did not label mononuclear cells from peripheral blood, splenocytes, and any of 29 cell lines including 23 B cell lines.
 This binding pattern of HJ6 was very similar to that of a mAb named 5B5.
 It was shown previously that 5B5 bound a glycolipid named CTH (CD77) and its Ag was expressed on HK23- PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines.
 Despite the similarity, HJ6 differed from 5B5: HJ6 did not stain Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines and stained PNA+ tonsillar lymphocytes in the presence of a large concentration of galactose.
 When its binding to isolated glycolipids was studied, HJ6 was found to bind globoside and Forssman Ag and not to other glycolipids including CTH.
 When its binding to neutral glycolipids extracted from tonsillar lymphocytes was studied, HJ6 bound only globoside; Forssman Ag was not detected in tonsillar lymphocytes.
 Taken together, we conclude that globoside is a B cell Ag expressed on a subpopulation of germinal center B cells.
