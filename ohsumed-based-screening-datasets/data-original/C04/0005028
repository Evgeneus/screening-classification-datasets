Ureterosigmoidostomy: long-term results, risk of carcinoma and etiological factors for carcinogenesis.
 We followed postoperatively 75 patients who underwent ureterosigmoidostomy between 1942 and 1987.
 Of the patients 30 were asked to undergo routine examination, including fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy with biopsy and analysis of a urine-feces slurry for nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamines in comparison to 20 control volunteers.
 After a mean observation of 14 years 7 months (1 to 46 years) 64.5% of the patients had bilaterally normal kidneys without any previous complications, 77.5% of the renal units being normal.
 Sigmoidoscopic biopsy revealed 3 carcinomas at the ureterocolonic junction resulting in an 8.5 to 10.5-fold increased risk of colon carcinoma compared to the general population.
 The excretion of nitrite and N-nitrosamines was increased, and nitrate excretion was decreased compared to healthy control volunteers, suggesting endogenous formation of nitrosamines by bacterially reduced nitrate and endogenous amines.
 The urological long-term results of ureterosigmoidostomy are similar to those of conduits.
 However, the increased incidence of colon carcinoma is not yet proved to be higher than in conduits.
