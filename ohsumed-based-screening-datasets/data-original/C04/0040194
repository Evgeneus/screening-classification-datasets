Clinical application of a patient-controlled apparatus for ventricular administration of morphine in intractable pain: report of 28 cases.
 The authors developed a patient-controlled apparatus (L-224) for ventricular administration of pain-relieving medication and utilized it in the treatment of 28 patients with intractable pain.
 The initial dose of morphine hydrochloride was 1 mg, which afforded pain relief for an average of 170 hours.
 At an average dose of 1.8 mg, the average time of pain relief obtained was 137 hours.
 Therefore, they conclude that L-224 is a satisfactory apparatus for the ventricular administration of pain medication; it is patient controlled, safe, and reliable in clinical application.
