Segmental neurofibromatosis.
 Two patients had localized multiple cutaneous neurofibromas; one had bilateral involvement of the scalp and the other had true segmental neurofibromatosis.
 Other signs of neurofibromatosis were absent.
 Segmental neurofibromatosis may not be related to the generalized types of neurofibromatosis but may be a cutaneous hamartoma.
