Rotationplasty as a reconstructive operation after tumor resection.
 Reconstruction in the skeletally immature patient following resection of osteosarcoma about the knee is a challenging problem.
 Salvaging of the limb with allogeneic or prosthetic replacement results in a shortened limb with functional limitations.
 Arthrodesis yields a stiff and shortened limb.
 The so-called growing prosthesis has a high complication rate and is still unproven.
 However, rotationplasty has been successfully used as a reconstructive technique following resection of these types of tumors in the skeletally immature patient.
 A limb with normal sensation and proprioceptions, adequate range of motion, and without leg-length discrepancies, functional limitations, or painful neuroma is to be expected.
 Although a prosthesis must be worn, these patients are active and participate in unrestricted physical activity.
 Cosmetic acceptance has not been a problem and complications are minimal.
 Thus, rotationplasty requires only a single operation and results in a highly functional limb.
