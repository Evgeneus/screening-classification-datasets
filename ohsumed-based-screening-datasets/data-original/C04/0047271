Antiproliferative effects of cytokines on squamous cell carcinoma.
 A panel of 12 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) cell lines has been used to determine sensitivity of tumor cells to cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), and interferon alfa (IFN-alpha) in vitro.
 Antiproliferative activity of these cytokines on squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck monolayers was measured in a colorimetric MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]-based assay.
 All 12 cell lines tested were sensitive to IFN-gamma, with the 50% inhibitory dose (ID50) ranging from 0.07 +/- 0.001 to 104 +/- 4.6 U/mL.
 The TNF-alpha showed antiproliferative activity on three cell lines at relatively high doses (ID50 from 55 +/- 4.1 to 847.10 +/- 10 U/mL), and IFN-alpha was growth inhibitory in only one line (ID50 = 1211 +/- 46.2 U/mL).
 The combination of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on eight cell lines and an additive effect on two cell lines.
 In two cell lines, the effect of the combination was equal to that of IFN-gamma alone.
 A combination of IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha resulted in cell growth inhibition in six of the seven lines tested, and this effect was synergistic.
 These in vitro studies indicate that combinations of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha or IFN-alpha and TNF-alpha may be more growth inhibitory against squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck and at lower doses than each of these cytokines used singly.
