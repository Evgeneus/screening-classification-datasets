Amplification of the c-erbB oncogene is associated with malignancy in primary tumours of neuroepithelial tissue.
 In various primary brain tumours of neuroepithelial tissue recombinant DNA techniques were used to demonstrate changes of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene, which is homologous to the c-erbB oncogene.
 Twenty-one of 40 grade III/IV tumours, but only 1 of 16 grade I/II tumours were found to contain amplified and/or rearranged c-erbB sequences.
 This highly significant difference suggest that c-erbB amplification, rearrangement, or both, are important steps in malignant transformation in a subset of patients with neuroepithelial tumours.
