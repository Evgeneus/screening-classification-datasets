Continuous infusion 5-fluorouracil plus weekly cisplatin for pancreatic carcinoma. A Mid-Atlantic Oncology Program study.
 Fifty-six previously untreated patients with biopsy-proven, locally advanced or metastatic and measurable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with the combination of a protracted intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and low dose weekly bolus cisplatin administered continuously for 10 weeks followed by a 2-week rest period.
 The objective response rate was 16% with two patients (4%) achieving a complete response (confidence intervals, 8% to 29%).
 The median survival time for all treated patients was 5.8 months; however, 26% of all patients were alive at 1 year.
 Both median survival time and the proportion alive at 1 year exceed that of prior reports involving large patient groups, possibly due to better patient selection.
