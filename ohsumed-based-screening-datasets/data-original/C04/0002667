Parascapular free flaps for head and neck reconstruction.
 We report our experience with single-stage, primary reconstruction of the head and neck in 29 consecutive patients using parascapular free flaps.
 The commonest indications were for craniofacial defects (9), oropharyngeal soft tissue defects (10), and combined mandibular and soft tissue losses (4).
 Ablative surgery was performed for squamous carcinoma (22), melanoma (2), and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (2).
 Seven patients died of recurrent disease during a 3 1/2 year follow-up.
 Seven patients are alive with recurrence.
 Flap complications included total loss (2) due to unsalvageable microvascular thrombosis, wound breakdown with oropharyngeal fistula (2), mandibular osteomyelitis (1), trismus (2), neck contracture (1), and donor site wound dehiscence (1).
 The overall success of this reconstruction was 93%.
 Primary wound healing was the general rule with lower morbidity than with other reconstructive techniques.
 The flap is thin, pliable, and conforms well to three-dimensional defects.
 The lateral border of the scapula can be incorporated on the same vascular pedicle for single-stage mandibular reconstruction.
 No muscle is sacrificed, and the posterior donor defect is an added advantage.
 The parascapular flap is our first choice for reconstruction of major defects in the head and neck.
