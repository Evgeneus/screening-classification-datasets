State III squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. Results of a Swedish study.
 One hundred fifty-three cases of stage III vulvar squamous cell carcinoma were studied.
 The survival rate was significantly higher in the 99 patients given standard treatment than in the 54 given other treatments.
 The principal prognostic factor was the presence of groin metastases.
 In cases without metastases at the time of primary treatment, the five-year survival rate was 89%; in cases with metastases it was 36% When nodal metastases were not suspected (International Federation of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stage N0N1), the survival rate was also higher than when nodal involvement was suspected (N2).
 Stage III should be subdivided according to either postoperative stages or new clinical stages by separating N0N1 cases from N2 cases.
