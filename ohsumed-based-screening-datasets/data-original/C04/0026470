Paediatric haemangiomas: the role of radiotherapy.
 Radiotherapy currently maintains an occasional place in the therapy of complicated haemangiomas of childhood.
 Eight such childhood benign lesions have been so treated at St Bartholomew's Hospital in the last 10 years.
 The case histories are presented before being discussed in the context of other therapies available (no treatment, steroids, embolism and surgery), radiation technique used and radiation dose prescription advised.
