Treatment of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone agent mifepristone.
 The possibility that meningioma growth may be related to female sex hormone levels is suggested by several lines of evidence.
 Meningiomas are twice as common in women as in men, have been observed to wax and wane with pregnancy, and are positively associated with breast cancer.
 A physiological explanation for these phenomena is provided by the finding of steroid hormone receptors in meningiomas.
 However, unlike breast cancer, meningiomas are much more commonly positive for progesterone receptors than for estrogen receptors.
 The authors initiated a study on long-term oral therapy of unresectable meningiomas with the antiprogesterone mifepristone (RU486).
 Fourteen patients received mifepristone in daily doses of 200 mg for periods ranging from 2 to 31+ months (greater than or equal to 6 months in 12 patients).
 Five patients have shown signs of objective response (reduced tumor measurement on computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance image, or improved visual field examination).
 Three have also experienced subjective improvement (improved extraocular muscle function or relief from headache).
 The side effects of long-term mifepristone therapy have been mild.
 Fatigue was noted in 11 of the 14 patients.
 Other side effects included hot flashes in five patients, gynecomastia in three, partial alopecia in two, and cessation of menses in two.
 Long-term therapy with mifepristone is a new therapeutic option that may have efficacy in cases of unresectable benign meningioma.
