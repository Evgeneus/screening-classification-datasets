Adjuvant intraperitoneal chromic phosphate therapy for women with apparent early ovarian carcinoma who have not undergone comprehensive surgical staging.
 Forty-nine women with apparent Stage I and II ovarian carcinoma received intraperitoneal phosphate 32 as the only adjuvant therapy after primary surgery.
 In addition to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, 40 (82%) had analysis of peritoneal cytology, and 35 (71%) underwent omentectomy.
 Random peritoneal biopsies and retroperitoneal lymph node sampling were not done in any of these patients.
 The overall and disease-free survival rates were 86% and 75%, respectively, with no significant differences by stage, histologic grade, histologic type, or low-risk versus high-risk subsets recognized in patients who received comprehensive surgical staging.
 Seven (58%) of 12 patients had lymph node metastasis as the first site of recurrence, including two of three with late recurrences.
 Significant morbidity related to intraperitoneal chromic phosphate (32P) occurred in one (2%) woman.
 These results emphasize the need for comprehensive surgical staging of women with apparent early ovarian carcinoma to aid in the selection of appropriate initial adjuvant therapy.
