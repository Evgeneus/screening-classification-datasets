Esophagogastric neoplasms: palliation with a modified gianturco stent.
 Self-expanding metallic stents of a modified Gianturco design were used for palliative treatment of malignant esophagogastric strictures.
 Over a 10-month period, 10 stents were placed in nine patients.
 All patients with severe dysphagia due to malignant strictures in whom all other treatment options had failed were candidates for these stents.
 Neither extensive length of esophageal involvement nor complete esophageal obstruction was a contraindication.
 All stents were placed with fluoroscopic guidance without any technical failures or procedural morbidity or mortality.
 Mild reflux occurred in three patients in whom the stent tubes straddled the distal esophageal sphincter.
 Five patients were still alive after 1-8 months.
 The remaining four patients died 6-28 weeks after stent placement; all stents were patent at the time of death.
 These stents are easy to insert, safe, and reasonably effective for short-term palliative treatment of esophagogastric neoplasms.
