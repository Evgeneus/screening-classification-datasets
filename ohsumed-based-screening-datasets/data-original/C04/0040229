The concept of uterine preservation with ovarian malignancies.
 A 30-year-old woman with bilateral, recurrent, borderline papillary serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary was treated with bilateral oophorocystectomy and omentectomy with uterine preservation.
 Ten years later, through induction of an artificial endometrial cycle and ovum donation, she conceived twins and delivered two healthy infants.
 Staging exploratory laparotomy at the time of cesarean delivery was negative for malignancy.
 This case illustrates the value of uterine preservation for cases in which classical teaching has indicated hysterectomy with bilateral salpingoophorectomy.
