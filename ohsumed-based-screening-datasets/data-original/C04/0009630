Impaired polymorphonuclear leucocyte function in patients undergoing hepatectomy: adenylate energy charge and superoxide anion production in relation to hepatic mitochondrial redox state.
 Patients undergoing hepatectomy have an increased susceptibility to infection.
 We therefore studied the energy metabolism of the polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN), focusing on energy charge and function, especially superoxide anion (O2-) generation, in relation to the hepatic mitochondrial redox state.
 By labelling the PMN adenine nucleotide pool with radioactive adenine and by superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c, the energy charge and O2- production was measured in 18 patients with hepatoma (non-cirrhotic, seven; cirrhotic, 11) undergoing hepatectomy.
 Their arterial ketone body ratios (KBRs), reflecting the hepatic mitochondrial redox potential, were above 0.7 before operation.
 After surgery, the 18 patients were divided into two groups: group A, KBR greater than 0.7, n = 10; and group B, KBR less than 0.7, n = 8.
 The energy charge and O2- release in group B decreased significantly from preoperative values (P less than 0.001 and P less than 0.01 respectively) and when compared with group A (P less than 0.05 and P less than 0.01 respectively).
 These results suggest that impaired hepatic energy metabolism (KBR less than 0.7) in hepatectomized patients leads to impaired energy charge and O2- production in the PMNs.
