Improved access to lesions of the central skull base by mobilization of the zygoma: experience with 54 cases.
 Improved access to lesions at the medial end of the sphenoid wing or in the interpeduncular cistern after mobilization of the zygoma has been a subject of growing interest in recent years.
 This study describes the operative technique we have adopted and records our experience with 55 operations in 54 patients who underwent the procedure in the past 3 years.
 Seven patients had vascular lesions, 44 had tumors, and 3 had miscellaneous lesions.
 The majority of the tumors were medial meningiomas, and particular note is made of those arising from the cavernous sinus with respect to their resectability.
 Sixteen of these tumors were encountered, and total excision was possible in 11 cases.
 Access to the infratemporal fossa is facilitated, and in 2 cases we were able to excise completely trigeminal neuromas that had extended there.
 The extra maneuver adds little to the overall operating time, and complications relating to it are uncommon, mild in degree, and usually self-limiting.
 We conclude that the operation is extremely valuable in appropriate circumstances.
