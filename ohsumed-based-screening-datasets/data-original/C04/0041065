Nonrandom distribution of N-myc oncogene genotypes in neuroblastoma.
 The distributions of Pvu II and Sph I alleles of the N-myc oncogene (also known as MYCN) were studied in a series of normal individuals and pediatric patients with solid tumors.
 In the case of Pvu II, where the polymorphic site is located 3' of the gene, the frequencies of the allele were 0.27 (11-kilobase fragment) and 0.73 (8-kilobase fragment) in 43 unrelated normal Caucasians.
 The frequencies of the allele were similar in 40 non-N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas, 47 Wilms' tumors, and 31 other pediatric tumors.
 In these cases, the genotypes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
 In 18 N-myc-amplified neuroblastomas, however, the observed genotype frequencies deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P less than .005).
 Similar observations were made with an Sph I restriction fragment length polymorphism where the polymorphic site is located in intron 2.
 The differences between amplified and nonamplified neuroblastomas suggest a possible involvement of sequences at or near N-myc in the progression of tumors where the N-myc gene is amplified.
