Locally recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the prostate after radical prostatectomy.
 Endometrioid carcinoma of the prostate is considered a variant of classical prostatic ductal carcinoma.
 Endometrioid carcinoma variant often has the unique clinical presentation of gross hematuria.
 The propensity of this tumor to spread within the urothelium makes local failure of curative therapy commonplace.
 We present 2 representative cases with a review of followup surveillance procedures and treatment options for the local recurrence once identified.
