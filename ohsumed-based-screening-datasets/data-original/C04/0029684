Parathyroid adenoma in a cancer center patient population.
 The association of parathyroid adenoma and antecedent events or relationships was examined retrospectively in 103 patients with parathyroid adenoma drawn from a cancer institute patient population.
 Patients were divided into two study groups by the referral pattern-intramural or community.
 The major contrast between the two groups was that the intramural patients had cancer diagnoses.
 The factors of advanced age, female gender, and prior regional irradiation appeared to be associated with the development of parathyroid adenoma.
 An interrelationship of incidental cancer and parathyroid adenoma, however, was not supported.
 Breast and differential thyroid cancers were most frequently associated with parathyroid adenoma, but age, gender, and irradiation were bias influences.
