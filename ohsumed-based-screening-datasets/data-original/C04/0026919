Phosphate diabetes associated with bone metastases of oat cell lung cancer.
 Although the link between phosphate diabetes and neoplasm or benign mesenchymal tumors has been well documented, the nature of the phosphaturia factor remains unknown.
 We describe two cases of phosphate diabetes associated with bronchogenic cancer.
 In these case reports, we suggest that fibroblasts or osteoblasts synthesize a phosphate eliminating substance.
