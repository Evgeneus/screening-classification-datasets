Polycystic ovary syndrome: abnormalities and management with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs.
 Ovulation induction with pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone achieves high ovulatory and pregnancy rates in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism while limiting the occurrence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy.
 However, this form of therapy is apparently less effective in polycystic ovary syndrome.
 The administration of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog for 4 to 8 weeks before the initiation of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction can temporarily correct endocrine abnormalities of polycystic ovary syndrome, such as excessive luteinizing hormone and androgen secretion, and improve ovulatory and pregnancy rates in these patients.
 For optimal results, this pretreatment should probably be repeated before each pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone ovulation induction cycle.
 Obesity is associated with a lower success rate, and spontaneous abortion remains a prominent complication in polycystic ovary syndrome even after gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog suppression.
 With this regimen the risks of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy are virtually abolished.
 Thus, pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone appears to be highly effective and safe for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome also, provided that this treatment is preceded by pituitary-ovarian suppression with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog.
