Angiosarcoma at the site of a Dacron vascular prosthesis: a case report and literature review.
 Four of 32 reported sarcomas related to the aorta have arisen around previously placed aortic vascular prostheses suggesting that the graft may have been an etiologic factor.
 Our recent experience with such an angiosarcoma arising around a Dacron aortic graft prompted a review of the lesion to identify risk factors, diagnostic approaches, and treatment options.
 The diagnosis of these sarcomas is seldom made before operation.
 Animal studies have implicated plastic polymers including Dacron as carcinogenic materials capable of inducing sarcoma in 7% to 50% of exposures.
 Because of the rarity of these tumors and the thousands of vascular implants used over the past 30 years, it is unlikely that this degree of risk can be extrapolated to humans.
 However, a tumor should be included in the differential diagnosis of any mass or thromboembolic event associated with a vascular prosthesis.
