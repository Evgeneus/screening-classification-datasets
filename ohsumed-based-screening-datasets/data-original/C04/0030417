J. Maxwell Chamberlain Memorial Paper. Role of staging in prognosis and management of thymoma.
 Eighty-five patients operated on for thymoma from 1972 to 1989 were evaluated, 32 with myasthenia gravis and 53 without.
 Masaoka staging revealed stage I disease in 45 (53%), stage II in 23 (27%), stage III in 14 (16%), and stage IVa in 3 (4%).
 There was no operative mortality.
 Actuarial survival at 10 years was 63.7% for all patients: 78.3% for those in stage I, 74.7% for those in stage II, and 20.8% for those in stage III.
 There was no recurrence in patients in stage I.
 Mediastinal recurrence developed in 4 patients in stage II considered to have noninvasive disease by the surgeon.
 It is recommended that all patients be followed up for a minimum of 10 years and that all patients in stages II and III receive postoperative radiotherapy.
 The presence of myasthenia gravis is no longer considered as an adverse factor in survival.
