Ampullary tumor caused by metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 In this paper we report the case of a renal cell carcinoma (RCC) metastatic to the ampullary region.
 The patient presented with severe anemia due to blood loss from the ampullary tumor 11 years after nephrectomy for the primary renal cancer.
 The diagnosis was established by means of endoscopy and biopsy.
