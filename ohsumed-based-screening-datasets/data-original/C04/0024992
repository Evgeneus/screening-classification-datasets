Conformational structure of a monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody to the monoclonal anti-adenocarcinoma-associated carbohydrate antibody YH206.
 The mAb AI206 (IgG1) is an anti-Id antibody of mAb YH206 (IgM) to adenocarcinoma-associated carbohydrate Ag and inhibits the reaction of mAb YH206 to YH206 Ag at low concentrations.
 By Western blot analysis, mAb AI206 only reacted with unreduced mAb YH206, whereas it did not react with reduced mAb YH206.
 Furthermore, mAb AI206 reacted with IgM subunit (180 kDa), F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb YH206.
 Thus, mAb AI206 recognized the structure of F(ab) of mAb YH206.
 The mAb YH206 reacted with unreduced mAb AI206, F(ab')2 (110 kDa), and F(ab) (50 kDa) of pepsin-treated unreduced mAb AI206.
 It is presumed that mAb YH206 and mAb AI206 recognize each other in an unreduced condition but not a reduced condition.
 The recognition of such a conformational Id on F(ab) is important.
 Because mAb YH206 recognized the carbohydrate on YH206 Ag as well as the peptide on mAb AI206, the conformation on F(ab) of mAb AI206 may mimic the carbohydrate structure on YH206 Ag.
 In fact, YH206 antibody activity was induced in syngeneic mouse serum immunized with mAb AI206.
 These observations suggest that the internal image of YH206 carbohydrate Ag is preserved within the conformational Id on F(ab) of mAb AI206.
