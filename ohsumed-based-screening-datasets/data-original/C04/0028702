Clinical parameters predictive of malignancy of thyroid follicular neoplasms.
 Needle aspiration biopsy is commonly employed in the evaluation of thyroid nodules.
 Unfortunately, the cytologic finding of a "follicular neoplasm" does not distinguish between a thyroid adenoma and a follicular cancer.
 The purpose of this study was to identify clinical parameters that characterize patients with an increased risk of having a thyroid follicular cancer who preoperatively have a "follicular neoplasm" identified by needle aspiration biopsy.
 A total of 395 patients initially treated at Vancouver General Hospital and the British Columbia Cancer Agency between the years of 1965 and 1985 were identified and their data were entered into a computer database.
 Patients with thyroid adenomas were compared to patients with follicular cancer using the chi-square test and Student's t-test.
 Statistically significant parameters that distinguished patients at risk of having a thyroid cancer (p less than 0.05) included age greater than 50 years, nodule size greater than 3 cm, and a history of neck irradiation.
 Sex, family history of goiter or neoplasm, alcohol and tobacco use, and use of exogenous estrogen were not significant parameters.
 Patients can be identified preoperatively to be at an increased risk of having a follicular cancer and accordingly appropriate surgical resection can be planned.
