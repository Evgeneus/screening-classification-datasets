Intracranial tumor in infants: characteristics, management, and outcome of a contemporary series.
 Since 1980, 22 patients less than 2 years of age have been treated for intracranial tumors at our institution.
 The most common presentation was elevated intracranial pressure associated with ventriculomegaly (73%).
 The diagnosis was made by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging and confirmed surgically in every case.
 In 68% of cases, the tumor involved midline structures in the central nervous system.
 Tumors were infratentorial in 29% of patients less than 1 year of age and in 60% of those more than 1 year of age.
 Most tumors were either primitive neuroectodermal tumors (41%, 7 of 9 located in midline posterior fossa structures) or astrocytomas (27%, 5 of 6 located in the hypothalamus, chiasm, or optic nerve).
 Twenty patients had gross or subtotal tumor resection.
 Surgical mortality and neurological morbidity were 10% and 5%, respectively.
 Of 5 patients who underwent a second operation for tumor recurrence, 3 demonstrated a change in the pathological features of the tumor from those of the original diagnosis.
 Of 10 surgical survivors with malignant tumors, 8 received chemotherapy and 5 radiation therapy.
 Radiation was not administered before 1 year of age.
 The overall 1-year survival was 70%, and 2-year survival was 58%.
 Two-year survival for benign and malignant tumors was not significantly different.
 We think that the interdisciplinary efforts directed toward the treatment of these tumors has improved survival and that all children should be offered entry to a research protocol and aggressive treatment.
