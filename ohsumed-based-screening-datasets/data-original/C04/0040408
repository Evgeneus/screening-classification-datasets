Hemangioma of the nasal vault: MR and CT features.
 Six patients with a history of epistaxis (five patients) or nasal obstruction (one patient) were found to have a capillary hemangioma of the nasal vault that involved one or more nasal turbinates.
 Four patients underwent computed tomographic (CT) examination; two of these also underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
 Four others underwent only MR imaging.
 At CT and MR, all of the lesions were well circumscribed and intensely enhancing, with contralateral deviation of the nasal septum.
 Remodeling of the surrounding bone was present in three patients.
 On T1-weighted MR images, the masses were intermediate in signal intensity.
 Varying degrees of T2 shortening were shown on T2-weighted MR images, with an appearance that suggested the presence of blood products surrounding an inner matrix of higher-signal-intensity tumor.
 Intense enhancement at CT and MR assisted differentiation of tumor from retained sinonasal secretions.
 In two patients, external carotid arteriography revealed small foci of pooling contrast material; in one of these patients, arteriovenous shunting was also present.
 Pathologic examination in all patients demonstrated capillary hemangiomas with varying degrees of fibrosis and hemosiderin deposition.
