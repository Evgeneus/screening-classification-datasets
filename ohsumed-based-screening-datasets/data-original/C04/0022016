Mortality among aerial pesticide applicators and flight instructors: a reprint [corrected and republished article originally printed in Arch Environ Health 1990 Sep-Oct;45(5):295-302]
 A cohort mortality study was conducted of male aerial pesticide applicators and flight instructors identified from computerized Federal Aviation Administration medical examination records from 1965-1979.
 Vital status of 9,677 applicators and 9,727 instructors was determined through January 1, 1980, and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated.
 The overall SMR was 127 for applicators (699 deaths) and 93 for instructors (454 deaths).
 Fatalities from nonmotor vehicle accidents, mostly aircraft crashes, were in notable excess (SMR = 1,168 among applicators, 630 among instructors), whereas deaths from most chronic diseases, including all cancer, was below expectation (e.g., for arteriosclerotic heart disease, SMR = 52 among applicators and 50 among instructors).
 The ability of the study to assess cancer risk among applicators was limited by a relatively brief follow-up period.
 However, 8 applicators (SMR = 171), but only 1 flight instructor (SMR = 24), died of leukemia, and small, nonsignificant risk elevations for some other cancer sites among applicators were observed and warrant continued follow-up.
