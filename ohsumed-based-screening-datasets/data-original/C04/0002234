Is urethral sparing at cystectomy a safe procedure?
 Urethrectomy is performed with cystectomy when the neoplasm is multifocal, at the bladder neck, or associated with carcinoma in situ (CIS).
 The records of the most recent 20 patients treated by radical cystectomy at our institution were reviewed.
 In 50 percent of the cases, the extent of disease within the bladder was found to have been underestimated to the point that a urethral sparing operation (i.e., to maintain urinary continence with an intestinal segment and an intact urethra) might have been dangerous.
