Human central nervous system primitive neuroectodermal tumor expressing nerve growth factor receptors: CHP707m.
 A primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) presented as a cerebral hemispheric mass in a 33-year-old man.
 Bone marrow metastases were discovered 11 months later.
 A cell line (CHP707m) was derived from these metastases.
 In culture, the cells showed features of neuronal differentiation, forming short neurites and synthesizing low-molecular-weight neurofilament protein.
 Northern blotting showed the tumor cells express nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor messenger RNA, and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting demonstrated NGF receptors on the cell surface.
 Western blotting showed CHP707m NGF receptors are truncated.
 The receptors are functional; they bind iodine 125-labeled mouse NGF with an affinity of 1.6 x 10(-9) M, and short-term treatment with NGF induces expression by the tumor cells of the proto-oncogene, c-fos.
 Although CHP707m is the first central nervous system PNET cell line proven to express NGF receptors, immunohistological survey of tissue sections prepared from human central nervous system PNETs showed that 13 of 35 contained NGF receptor-positive tumor cells.
 Thus, more than one-third of such tumors might be responsive to the effects of NGF.
