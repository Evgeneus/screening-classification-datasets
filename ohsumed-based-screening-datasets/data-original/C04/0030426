Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion.
 Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall involvement continues to present a major clinical challenge.
 We have treated 52 patients since 1973, excluding those with superior sulcus tumors.
 There were 37 male and 15 female patients with an average age of 62.9 years.
 Chest pain was an initial symptom in 37%.
 All patients had negative mediastinoscopy results.
 Squamous cell carcinoma was present in 53% and adenocarcinoma in 35%.
 The median number of ribs resected was two (range, one to six), and only 2 patients required chest wall reconstruction.
 Pathologic staging was T3 N0 M0 in 83% and T3 N1 M0 in 17%.
 Operative mortality was 3.8%.
 Absolute 5-year survival was 26.3%.
 Patients who had N1 disease had a 5-year survival of only 11%.
 Radiation therapy was employed in 46% for positive nodes or close margins.
 Bronchogenic carcinoma with chest wall invasion remains potentially curable if N2 nodes are not involved.
 The role of radiation therapy has not been clearly defined.
 Morbidity and mortality should be minimal.
