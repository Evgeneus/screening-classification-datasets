Differences in the leucine aminopeptidase activity in extracts from human prostatic carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 Extracts of tissue showed that prostatic carcinomas contain less leucine aminopeptidase activity than benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 This is true when activity is expressed as specific activity (P = 0.0033), specific activity/% epithelium (P = 0.0007), activity/wet weight of tissue (P = 0.0028), or activity/wet weight of tissue/% epithelium (P = 0.0005).
 Almost all histochemically demonstrable activity is located in the epithelium.
 Enzymatic activities in extracts and in histochemical preparations showed similar differences between carcinoma and benign prostatic hyperplasia and were related (R = -0.38, P = 0.0400) to Gleason's grades.
 The transurethrally resected prostate cancers studied contained no well-differentiated tumors and a high proportion of poorly differentiated tumors.
 Histochemical activity is absent in most prostatic carcinomas and decreased in others.
 This observation is particularly interesting in view of the growing knowledge of tumor suppressor genes.
