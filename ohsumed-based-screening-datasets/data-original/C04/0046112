Cultured human bladder tumors for pharmacodynamic studies.
 Human bladder tumor fragments were cultured on collagen gel.
 In this system, the three dimensional architecture, cell-to-stroma and cell-to-cell interactions, and tumor heterogeneity were maintained.
 Cell viability and labeling index (LI) were determined by exposure to 3H-thymidine and autoradiography.
 Of the samples from 20 patients with transitional cell carcinoma, 14 (70%) were successfully cultured and had a mean LI of 32%.
 In addition, one specimen from a patient with squamous cell carcinoma was cultured and had a LI of 61%.
 Cultured samples were tested for chemosensitivity using a two hour exposure of mitomycin C in concentrations ranging from one to 50 micrograms./ml.
 A dose-dependent relationship was demonstrated; LI decreased as mitomycin C concentrations increased.
 The methodology described provides an alternative to suspension or monolayer techniques of culturing human bladder tumors for pharmacological studies.
