Reconstruction of the lower lip and chin with the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap.
 Four cases of total lip and chin reconstruction are presented.
 In three, the composite radial forearm-palmaris longus free flap was used for reconstruction.
 In the fourth case, the palmaris longus was separated from the flap but still used as a lower lip sling.
 In all cases, the entire lower lip and the soft tissue of the chin were reconstructed in one stage.
 All patients healed primarily, and the three who underwent radiotherapy tolerated it without complications.
 Lip seal and speech were good, and there was no problem with drooling.
 Postoperative results emphasize the importance of respecting the aesthetic unit of the lower lip and chin.
