Gastric dysrhythmias following pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy. Possible mechanism for early delayed gastric emptying.
 Transient delayed gastric emptying is reported as a frequent complication following pancreas-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy (PPW).
 We placed serosal electrodes on the stomach of a patient undergoing PPW.
 Myoelectric recordings were obtained postoperatively and correlated with simultaneous radionuclide liquid gastric emptying studies.
 The patient developed early postoperative gastric atony, associated with frequent gastric dysrhythmias.
 These dysrhythmias may have been exacerbated by a perihepatic abscess.
 The gastric dysrhythmias correlated with alterations in liquid gastric emptying.
 Gastric dysrhythmias may be a mechanism for gastric dysfunction in the early postoperative period.
