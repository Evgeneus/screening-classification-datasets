Reconstructive and rehabilitative aspects of head and neck cancer in the elderly.
 Age should not be considered a contraindication to adequate head and neck oncologic surgery.
 Reconstructive efforts should be by the most direct means to attain restoration of form and function in one stage.
 The next significant breakthroughs in the battle against cancer may well come on the cellular or molecular level.
 We endorse the plea of Endicott for increased education and research directed at the problem of head and neck cancer and rehabilitation as they relate to the geriatric patient.
