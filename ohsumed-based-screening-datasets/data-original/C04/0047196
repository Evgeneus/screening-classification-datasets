Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet in China, Finland, and the United States.
 Mortality, cardiovascular risk factors, and diet were compared in Tianjin province, People's Republic of China; in North Karelia Province, Finland; and in the United States as a whole.
 People in Tianjin received 7 percent of their energy intake from saturated fats, whereas people in the United States received 13 percent and those in North Karelia received 20.

 The smoking prevalence among men was highest in Tianjin (66 percent), followed by the United States (42 percent) and Finland (36 percent).
 The differences among mortality rates for the three locales were less pronounced among women than among men.
 Age-standardized total mortality for women was highest for Tianjin and lowest in North Karelia.
 The reverse was true for men.
 Age-standardized total mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin and highest in North Karelia.
 Age-standardized ischemic heart disease mortality for men was lowest in Tianjin (99 per 100,000) and highest in North Karelia (730 per 100,000).
 For women, the corresponding figures were 83 per 100,000 in Tianjin and 164 per 100,000 in North Karelia.
