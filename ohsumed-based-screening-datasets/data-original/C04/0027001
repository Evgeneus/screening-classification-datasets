Squamous cell carcinoma of the umbilicus associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
 A variety of malignancies, including hematologic malignancies, Kaposi's sarcoma, as well as adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinoma have been reported in association with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
 Tumors of the umbilical area are unusual and can represent lesions of urachal origin.
 These may require extensive resection and are associated with a poor prognosis.
 We describe here a case of a young woman with AIDS who developed a squamous cell carcinoma of the umbilicus which suggests more than a casual relationship between these two conditions.
