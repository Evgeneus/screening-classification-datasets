Epidermoid cysts of the brain stem. Report of three cases.
 The authors report the cases of three patients with epidermoid cysts which insinuated themselves into the brain stem.
 In all three patients, the tumor occupied the pons, although in one it was predominantly located in the medulla.
 The cyst contents and nonadherent tumor capsule were removed in all three patients, but no attempt was made to remove tumor densely adherent to the brain stem.
 One patient's cyst was removed in one operation, but maximal resection in the other two required two operations.
 After surgery, sixth nerve function completely returned in one patient; another patient had a stable pontine gaze palsy but developed new facial weakness; and the third patient had stable cranial nerve deficits with a diminished hemiparesis.
 The last patient developed a pseudomeningocele and communicating hydrocephalus, and required a lumboperitoneal shunt.
 In all three patients, computerized tomography scans demonstrated hypodense tumors not enhanced by contrast material.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on two patients; in both, the tumors showed increased signal intensity relative to brain on T1-weighted images and decreased signal intensity relative to brain on T2-weighted studies.
 Magnetic resonance imaging, the most accurate modality for localizing these lesions and determining their extent, was also invaluable for postoperative monitoring and follow-up evaluation.
 Safe and adequate resection includes decompression of cyst contents and removal of nonadherent portions of the cyst capsule.
 Cyst wall adherent to the brain stem, however, should not be removed.
