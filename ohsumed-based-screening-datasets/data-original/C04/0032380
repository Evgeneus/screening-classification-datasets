No correlation between response and survival in patients with multiple myeloma treated with vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone.
 A vincristine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone (VMCP) multi-drug regimen was used in 85 previously untreated patients with multiple myeloma (MM) (symptomatic Durie Stages II and III) until they became refractory.
 The prognostic significance of various pretreatment characteristics was evaluated in terms of therapeutic response (according to Southwest Oncology Group [SWOG] and Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force [TF] criteria) and survival.
 Therapeutic responses, obtained in 31.2% (SWOG) and 68.7% (TF) of patients, had a significant inverse correlation with myeloma cell mass, serum calcium, and bone status.
 Median survival time of Stage II and Stage III patients was 39 and 34 months, respectively.
 Serum B2 microglobulin greater than or equal to 6 micrograms/ml was the only variable correlating unfavorably with survival duration after multi-variate analysis (increased risk = 2.79), although therapeutic response as a time-dependent variable had no effect on survival.
 These data suggest no correlation between response and survival, partially because of inadequate response assessment criteria and partially because no existing treatment is curative (although current therapeutic approaches may prevent death from complications).
