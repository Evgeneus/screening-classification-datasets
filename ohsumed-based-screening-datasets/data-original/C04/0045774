Phase I-II study of advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with recombinant human interferon gamma.
 The association of immunodeficiency with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has generated the concept of supplying immunologically active agents as a means of treating these cancers.
 One of the most active immunologic messengers is interferon gamma, which has been observed in our laboratories to also have a direct cytotoxic effect on cultures of squamous cell carcinoma derived from the head and neck.
 To test the feasibility of treating patients with advanced but resectable head and neck cancer with this agent, we designed a phase I-II trial of recombinant human interferon gamma using a 24-hour infusion repeated weekly for four times.
 In this study, both tumor and immunologic parameters were studied before and after treatment.
 Eight patients were entered into the study with the highest recombinant human interferon gamma dose attempted being 0.25 mg/m2 per 24 hours.
 Minimal side effects were observed.
 Three patients had clinically measurable responses, four had stabilization of disease, and one had progression while receiving treatment.
 Histopathologic results of treatment were similar to in vitro observations.
 Necrosis, as well as differentiation of tumor cells, was observed.
 In some tumors there was a marked decrease in cellularity without a change in tumor volume due to increased extracellular keratin deposition.
 Our study indicates that evaluation of adoptive immunotherapy trials in head and neck cancer needs to include parameters other than simple tumor regression as an end point, otherwise therapeutically important lymphokine-induced changes may be missed.
 Further evaluation of recombinant human interferon gamma and agents that induce human interferon gamma are warranted.
