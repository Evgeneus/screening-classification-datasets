Extensive Bowen's disease of the penile shaft treated with fresh tissue Mohs micrographic surgery in two separate operations.
 Bowen's disease or squamous cell carcinoma in situ is uncommon on the penile shaft.
 While surgical excision is the treatment of choice, the Mohs micrographic surgical approach ensures microscopically controlled tumor-free margins with preservation of normal tissue.
 While small- or medium-sized penile excisions heal very well by second intention, large areas of involvement are often grafted to prevent debilitating contractures.
 We report a case of near circumferential penile Bowen's disease treated by two separate operations that healed by second intention with very good cosmetic and functional results.
