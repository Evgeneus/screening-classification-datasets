Stomatococcus mucilaginosus catheter-related infection in an adolescent with osteosarcoma.
 Ours is apparently the first reported pediatric case of Stomatococcus mucilaginosus bacteremia.
 It is the second reported case of S mucilaginosus catheter-associated infection, but the first case successfully treated without removing the central venous catheter.
 This unusual organism should be added to the list of opportunistic pathogens that can be isolated from immunocompromised pediatric patients.
