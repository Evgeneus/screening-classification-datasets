Cecal diverticulitis presented as a cecal tumor.
 Seven patients diagnosed as having acute appendicitis were operated on and a cecal wall mass due to cecal diverticulitis was found.
 In two patients the mass could not be separated from the cecal wall and right colectomy was performed.
 In five patients, in whom the mass could be separated from the cecum, conservative operations (three diverticulectomies and two wedge resections) were performed, thus avoiding needless, more extensive surgery.
