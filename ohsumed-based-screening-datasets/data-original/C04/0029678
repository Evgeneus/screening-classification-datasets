Technical considerations for prophylactic mastectomy in patients at high risk for breast cancer.
 A study of 5 patients and 10 mastectomy specimens was performed to identify the extent of surgery necessary to completely remove all breast tissue in patients having prophylactic mastectomies.
 A standard total mastectomy performed for breast cancer was shown to frequently leave breast tissue within the superficial pectoralis major muscle and the lower skin flap.
 Frozen section analysis of margins was found to be essential to clear the axillary extension of the breast and lower skin flap in particular.
 The value of more extensive surgery to remove all glandular elements of the breast in the high-risk patient remains to be demonstrated.
