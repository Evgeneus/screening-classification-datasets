Intraocular tumor from disseminated histoplasmosis [published erratum appears in South Med J 1991 Aug;84(8):952]
 We identified and treated a solid, growing fungal tumor mass in a patient with disseminated histoplasmosis.
 Although the most commonly reported intraocular lesions from disseminated histoplasmosis are areas of inactive chorioretinal scars or areas of localized subretinal neovascular membrane formation, a focus of active fungal growth needs to be ruled out in all such cases.
 When a solid tumor mass is identified, the most effective way of preserving vision is with systemic antifungal therapy.
