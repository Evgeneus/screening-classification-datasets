Noninvasive grading of musculoskeletal tumors using PET.
 Twenty-five patients with mass lesions involving the musculoskeletal system were studied with positron emission tomography (PET) in order to determine if a relationship exists between histologic grade and tumor uptake of [fluorine-18]2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG).
 There were 6 benign lesions and 19 malignant lesions of various grades.
 A high correlation (Rho = 0.83) was found between the normalized uptake of tracer and the NCl grade.
 The high-grade malignancies had significantly greater (p = 0.0091) uptake of FDG than the combination of benign lesions and low-grade malignancies.
 All lesions with a normalized uptake value of 1.6 or greater were high-grade, while all lesions less than 1.6 represented either benign tumors or low grade malignancies.
 This strong relationship between FDG uptake and grade among neoplasms from a wide variety of cell types within a single organ system suggests that the technique may be useful in predicting grade even when the cell type is unknown.
