Acquisition of protease resistance by prion proteins in scrapie-infected cells does not require asparagine-linked glycosylation.
 The scrapie and cellular isoforms of the prion protein (PrPSc and PrPC) differ strikingly in a number of their biochemical and metabolic properties.
 The structural features underlying these differences are unknown, but they are thought to result from a posttranslational process.
 Both PrP isoforms contain complex type oligosaccharides, raising the possibility that differences in the asparagine-linked glycosylation account for the properties that distinguish PrPC and PrPSc.
 ScN2a and ScHaB cells in culture produce several PrP molecules with relative molecular masses of 26-35 kDa and proteinase K-resistant cores of 19-29 kDa.
 When the cells were treated with tunicamycin, this heterogeneity was eliminated and a single PrP species of 26 kDa was observed.
 Several hours after its synthesis, a fraction of this protein became insoluble in detergents and acquired a proteinase K-resistant core, thus displaying two of the biochemical hallmarks of PrPSc.
 Synthesis in the presence of tunicamycin restricted the proteinase K-resistant cores of PrP to a single species of 19 kDa.
 No proteinase K-resistant PrP was found in uninfected cells.
 Expression of a mutated PrP gene lacking both asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in ScN2a cells resulted in the synthesis of 19-kDa proteinase K-resistant PrP molecules.
 We conclude that asparagine-linked glycosylation is not essential for the synthesis of proteinase K-resistant PrP and that structural differences unrelated to asparagine-linked oligosaccharides must exist between PrPC and PrPSc.
 Whether unglycosylated PrPSc molecules are associated with scrapie prion infectivity remains to be established.
