Endoscopic removal of gastric lipoma: diagnostic value of endoscopic ultrasonography.
 A 47-yr-old male with gastric lipoma is presented.
 X-ray and endoscopic examinations revealed a submucosal tumor on the posterior wall of the gastric antrum.
 Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated the hyperechoic mass in the submucosa without continuity to the muscularis propria, by which the lesion was diagnosed as lipoma.
 The lesion was successfully removed by endoscopic polypectomy without complications.
 The cross-sections of the removed specimens were quite consistent with the ultrasonographic findings.
 Endoscopic ultrasonography is valuable in assessing the exact extent of the tumor and in determining whether or not endoscopic polypectomy is called for.
