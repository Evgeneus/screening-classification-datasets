Ki-1+ anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of T-cell origin in an HIV-infected patient.
 Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) are part of the spectrum of disease associated with HIV infection.
 However, there are only occasional reports of NHL of T-cell origin in HIV-infected patients.
 A previously asymptomatic HIV-infected man, who was seronegative for human T-lymphotropic virus type I antibodies, developed a high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma of anaplastic large-cell type which was Ki-1 + (CD30 +), HLA-DR+, epithelial membrane antigen +, CD25 +, CD71 +, CD2 + and CD5 +.
 Pan-B markers CD19 and CD22 and histiocytic marker CD68 were negative.
 At diagnosis the patient had 0.3 x 10(9)/l T-helper lymphocytes.
 The response to chemotherapy was dramatic and the patient is alive and disease-free 18 months after treatment.
 A review of previously described peripheral T-cell lymphomas in HIV-positive individuals is performed, and we conclude that the spectrum of neoplasms in such cases is probably broader than originally thought.
