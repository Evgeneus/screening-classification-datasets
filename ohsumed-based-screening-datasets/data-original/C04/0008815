True hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, 46,XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy.
 The first case (to the authors' knowledge) is reported of a true hermaphrodite with bilateral ovotestes, bilateral gonadoblastomas and dysgerminomas, a 46, XX/46,XY karyotype, and a successful pregnancy.
 The true hermaphroditism was diagnosed during infancy.
 The patient was subsequently found to have a gonadoblastoma and a microscopic dysgerminoma in the gonad diagnosed as an ovotestis and excised during infancy.
 The successful pregnancy occurred when the patient was 29 years old.
 A year later a large gonadal tumor affecting the remaining gonad was excised.
 The gonad was found to be an ovotestis, and the tumor was a dysgerminoma arising from a gonadoblastoma.
 This case further emphasizes the malignant potential of the Y chromosome in patients with abnormal gonads.
