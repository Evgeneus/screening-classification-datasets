Serum inhibin levels in polycystic ovary syndrome: effect of insulin resistance and insulin secretion.
 Insulin resistance is common in women with the polycystic ovary syndrome.
 We investigated the relationship between insulin resistance and the serum inhibin concentration in a group of 19 women with polycystic ovary syndrome and eight control subjects at different phases of the menstrual cycle.
 Insulin resistance was measured by the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, and inhibin was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay.
 Insulin sensitivity (mean +/- SE) was significantly reduced in the polycystic ovary syndrome group compared with controls: reduced insulin sensitivity 46.7 +/- 5.0 min-1/(nmol/mL), normally insulin-sensitive 106.6 +/- 11.7 min-1/(nmol/mL) (P less than .01).
 The women with polycystic ovary syndrome had inhibin levels (126 +/- 15.2 microLEq/mL) comparable to those found during the early follicular phase of the control group (117 +/- 22.1 microLEq/mL), but significantly lower than late follicular phase (259 +/- 25.6 microLEq/mL) or luteal phase (448 +/- 91.8 microLEq/mL) levels in the control group.
 No association was found between the degree of insulin resistance and the inhibin concentration, which remained unaltered over a 3-hour period despite maximal stimulation of endogenous insulin secretion.
 The inhibin concentrations in polycystic ovary syndrome may reflect impaired follicular maturation.
 Inhibin secretion is not acutely affected by insulin secretion in normal or in hyperandrogenic women.
