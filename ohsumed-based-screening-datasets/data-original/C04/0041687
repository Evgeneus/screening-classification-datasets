Sun protection in childhood.
 There is compelling evidence that childhood is a particularly vulnerable time for the photocarcinogenic effects of sun exposure on the skin.
 Studies indicate that excessive sun exposure during the first 10-20 years of life greatly increases the risk of skin cancer.
 Nonmelanoma skin cancer (basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma) has been associated with cumulative sun exposure, whereas melanoma has been associated with short, intense sun exposure or blistering sunburn.
 Under normal circumstances, children receive three times the annual sun exposure of adults; most of one's lifetime sun exposure occurs in childhood.
 Depletion of the earth's protective ozone layer adds to the photodamage problem.
 It is clear that sun protection is most vital in the early years.
 Those with fair skin are at highest risk.
 Photoprotective measures including sunscreen, clothing, and sun avoidance in childhood may significantly reduce the occurrence of melanoma and other skin cancer in later life.
 Regular use of sunscreen with a sun protection factor of 15 during the first 18 years of life could reduce the lifetime incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer by 78%.
 Pediatricians can play a major role in educating parents and children.
