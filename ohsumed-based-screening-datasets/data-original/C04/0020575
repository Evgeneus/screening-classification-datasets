Effect of the somatostatin analogue octreotide acetate on hemostasis in humans.
 Octreotide acetate is a somatostatin analogue that has been shown to ameliorate the side effects of excessive secretion of hormone from benign and malignant tumors.
 The ability of this drug to inhibit the growth of malignant cells and to control gastrointestinal hemorrhage will prompt additional clinical trials.
 Because some of these patients may have thrombocytopenia, platelet dysfunction, or a coagulopathy, we studied tests of platelet function and blood coagulation in 15 patients before and after 14 days of therapy with octreotide acetate at a dosage of 500 micrograms three times daily.
 We found no substantial change in the results of these tests, and no patient experienced bleeding or thrombosis.
 These results suggest that octreotide acetate does not adversely affect platelet function or the coagulation system in humans.
