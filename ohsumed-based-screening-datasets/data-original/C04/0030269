Leptomeningeal dissemination of optic pathway gliomas in three children.
 We treated three children with optic pathway gliomas who had progressive disease associated with metastatic spread to the leptomeninges.
 One patient had radiographic resolution of leptomeningeal disease after treatment with intravenous carmustine and oral mercaptopurine but died of progressive pulmonary fibrosis.
 The second patient was treated with intravenous thiotepa, and the leptomeningeal disease remained stable.
 The third patient was treated with intravenous vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and etoposide and had a significant size reduction of the leptomeningeal lesion.
 Although leptomeningeal dissemination is a seemingly rare event, it is important that all children with optic pathway gliomas be considered for this possibility, particularly after the onset of new, atypical neurologic symptoms.
