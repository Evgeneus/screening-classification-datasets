Role of estrogens and epidermal growth factor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 Estrogen (E) and epidermal growth factors (EGF) receptors were assayed in the liver of nine patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 Total E and nuclear E receptors were decreased significantly in neoplastic tissue as compared to the levels found in surrounding nonneoplastic tissue.
 The EGF receptor was decreased also in neoplastic tissue.
 On the basis of binding data, a decrease in the number but not in affinity of both the E and EGF receptors was found.
