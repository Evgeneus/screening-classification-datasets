Lesions that manifest as medial cheek and nasolabial fold masses.
 Seventeen cases were collected in which the patient presented with a medial cheek or nasolabial fold mass.
 Most of these lesions were uncommon, and some were rare.
 The most reliable differentiating finding was the type of associated bone involvement.
 The malignancies had bone erosion and as a group could be distinguished from the other masses.
 Computed tomographic attenuation and magnetic resonance imaging signal intensities were nonspecific and did not allow a definitive diagnosis to be made.
 The types of pathologic conditions and their sectional imaging findings are reviewed.
