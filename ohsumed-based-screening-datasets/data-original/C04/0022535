DNA analysis of neoplasia: an introduction for the family physician.
 Pathologic evaluation of a neoplastic process has traditionally consisted of microscopic examination of a stained section of tissue.
 Although this method is generally reliable when performed by an experienced pathologist, the morphologic features of a lesion may not consistently predict biologic behavior.
 The DNA content of tumors can be studied with a flow cytometer to help determine the prognosis and risk of tumor recurrence.
 DNA analysis of a neoplasm may provide the clinician with important prognostic information and, at some future date, may help direct chemotherapy or other treatment protocols.
