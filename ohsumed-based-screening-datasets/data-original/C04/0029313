Pineal teratoma and its relationship to intracerebral development: case report.
 A teratoma of the pineal region in a 20-year-old Australian Aborigine is presented in which an unusual location of the straight sinus and tentorium cerebelli suggests that the tumor arose before 4 months of gestation.
 In addition, this case provides some insight into the development of the falx cerebri, which might arise from the midline fusion of the left and right tentoria cerebelli caused by the dorsal development of the telencephalon.
