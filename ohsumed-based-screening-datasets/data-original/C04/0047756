Improvement of spontaneous pregnancy rate after stopping gonadotropin therapy for anovulatory infertility.
 In a prospective study, 140 patients with infertility because of ovulatory factors (group A) were followed up for 6 months after failure to achieve pregnancy using human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) therapy.
 They included cases of oligomenorrhea, polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), and hypogonadotropic amenorrhea.
 They were treated with hMG alone or in combination with clomiphene citrate or gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist analog.
 The control group (B) included 83 infertile patients because of similar ovulatory factors.
 They were followed up for 6 months not preceded by ovulation induction.
 The overall pregnancy rate (PR) in group A (20.7%) was significantly higher than group B (7.2%).
 The PR was significantly higher in oligomenorrhea and PCOD patients when compared with the control group.
 There was no significant difference in the hypogonadotropic group.
