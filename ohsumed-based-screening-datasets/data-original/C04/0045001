Assessment of factors influencing the outcome of radiotherapy for bladder cancer.
 The results of treatment of 709 patients with carcinoma of the bladder are reported.
 Inclusion of the pelvic lymph nodes in the treatment volume failed to lead to any improvement in survival.
 The factors influencing survival were stage, tumour histology and differentiation.
 The presence of tumour at follow-up cystoscopy at 3 months was of great prognostic significance.
