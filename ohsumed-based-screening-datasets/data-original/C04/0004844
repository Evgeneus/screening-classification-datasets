Epithelial cyst of the fourth ventricle. Case report.
 A case of epithelial cyst in the fourth ventricle of a 4-year-old child is described.
 A single epithelial layer with a clear basement membrane lining the cyst wall was observed.
 There were no prominent histological findings to suggest a pathogenesis for this cyst based on immunohistochemical or ultrastructural studies; however, the cyst fluid contained significant amounts of carcinoembryonic antigen.
 It is considered that the epithelial layer lining the cyst wall was possibly of endodermal origin.
