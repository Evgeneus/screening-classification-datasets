Brush cytology in the diagnosis of colonic neoplasms.
 During a three-year period (1986-1988), 234 colonic brush specimens were received in the authors' laboratory.
 Nine samples (4%) were deemed unsatisfactory for evaluation because of inadequate cellularity and/or poor fixation.
 In 11 cases concomitant or follow-up histologic specimens were not available.
 The remaining 214 specimens included 82 malignant neoplasms, 88 neoplastic polyps (adenomas), and 44 nonneoplastic lesions.
 Sixty-seven (82%) of malignant neoplasms were correctly diagnosed by brush cytology.
 Three cases of adenoma with severe dysplasia or in situ carcinoma were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by cytology.
 No false-positive diagnoses were made of nonneoplastic lesions.
 Brush cytology was found to be a more sensitive technique in the diagnosis of colon cancer than endoscopic biopsy (82% and 74% sensitivity, respectively).
 The combination of the two techniques increased the sensitivity to 90% and improved the overall accuracy of the test.
 Seventy-one (82%) of the colonic adenomas were correctly diagnosed by cytology.
 Brush cytology is a convenient, safe, and accurate technique which should be used concurrently with endoscopic biopsy or polypectomy.
