Stage IIB osteogenic sarcoma.
 Two hundred seventy-one consecutive patients treated from 1976 through 1986 were reviewed to estimate long-term survival.
 Disease-free survival for the entire cohort was 77% at five years and 74% at ten years.
 Humeral lesions had the best probability of survival (84% at ten years), followed by tibial lesions (81%) and femoral lesions (67%).
 Histologic response to preoperative chemotherapy was the strongest predictor of outcome.
 Those with little response had a survival estimate of 54% at ten years as compared to 68% for partial responders and approximately 90% for complete responders.
 Local recurrence was seen in 6.6% and was associated with an adverse effect on survival.
 Only two of the 18 patients with local recurrence have been rendered long-term disease-free survivors.
