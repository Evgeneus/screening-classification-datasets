Lobulated intradermal nevus. Report of three cases.
 We report the cases of three patients with lobulated intradermal nevi.
 Biopsy specimens showed similar findings, that is, fatty infiltration within nests of nevus cells, neuroid differentiation of nevus cells, and dermal fibrosis.
 Our cases probably represent an unusual form of regressing melanocytic nevus.
