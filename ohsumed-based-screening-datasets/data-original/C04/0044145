Chronic mitoinhibition during promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis.
 We have reported previously that orotic acid (OA), a precursor for pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis, is able to promote carcinogenic process in both liver and duodenum of rats.
 The present study investigates the possible role of mitoinhibitory effects of OA as being responsible for its promotional effects.
 Male Fischer 344 rats were given a semisynthetic basal diet (BD) or a diet containing 1% OA for four weeks coupled with 2/3 partial hepatectomy (PH), and all animals were then continued on BD for an additional four weeks.
 This protocol is known to exert a promoting effect on the initiated rat liver.
 Livers were perfused, and the labeling index (LI) of isolated cultured hepatocytes was monitored.
 Hepatocytes isolated from livers of rats fed a BD or 1% OA exhibited in vitro an LI of 39 +/- 2 and 24 +/- 1%, respectively.
 The lowered in vitro LI was seen even upon exposure to epidermal growth factor (EGF) (67 +/- 2% in OA-treated livers compared to 91 +/- 2% in hepatocytes from control rat liver).
 A similar four-week exposure to OA coupled with PH decreased hepatic DNA synthesis induced by a choline-deficient diet in vivo by about 50%.
 These results indicate that OA is able to decrease the response of normal hepatocytes to growth factors and suggest a possible mechanism of chronic differential mitoinhibition as a basis for promotion induced by OA.
