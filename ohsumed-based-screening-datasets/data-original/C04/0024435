Improving palliation in pancreatic cancer: intraoperative celiac plexus block for pain relief.
 Most patients with pancreatic carcinoma are not curable.
 Surgical palliation of obstructive jaundice and gastric outlet obstruction leaves many patients with severe pain from pancreatic carcinoma.
 Anesthesiologists have drawn increasing attention to the successful use of postoperative percutaneous celiac plexus block for the treatment of pancreatic pain.
 Ironically, little attention has been paid to celiac plexus block during laparotomy.
 We reviewed the cases of 12 patients with pancreatic carcinoma and severe abdominal pain who were treated surgically.
 All patients had operative celiac plexus block with absolute alcohol at the time of exploratory laparotomy for biliary bypass, gastroenterostomy, or tumor biopsy.
 Complete postoperative pain relief was obtained in 10 of the 12 patients; two had only partial relief.
 No operative complications were related to celiac plexus block; one patient died postoperatively of pneumonia.
 Average postoperative hospital stay was 13 days and average postoperative survival was 3 1/2 months.
 Most patients had excellent pain relief for at least 2 months or until death.
 Because most patients treated surgically for pancreatic carcinoma are receiving only palliation with biliary bypass or gastroenterostomy, surgeons should pay increased attention to pain relief.
 Operative celiac plexus block is easy, safe, and highly effective in relieving the agonizing pain of pancreatic carcinoma.
