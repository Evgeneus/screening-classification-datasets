Atypical myxoma.
 We report the case of a 38-year-old woman with a large thin-walled cystic mass (6 x 5 x 4.5 cm) filled with arterial blood in the right atrium.
 The cystic mass with blood content was clearly delineated by transesophageal cross-sectional echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging of the heart.
 At operation, a silver-whitish, smooth surfaced cystic mass was found attached to the free wall of the right atrium between the superior vena cava and the right atrial appendage with a broad base.
 Microscopically, the wall of the cyst was composed of stellate mesenchymal cells embedded within a myxoid matrix which was proved by alcian blue stain.
 To our knowledge, this type of cardiac myxoma has not been previously reported.
