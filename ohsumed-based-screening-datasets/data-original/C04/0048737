Etidronate for hypercalcemia of malignancy and osteoporosis.
 The biphosphonates are becoming well established as effective agents for the treatment of metabolic bone diseases.
 Etidronate disodium is the only biphosphonate approved by the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration.
 Accepted indications for etidronate therapy are symptomatic Paget's disease, heterotopic ossification and hypercalcemia of malignancy.
 An unapproved, but apparently successful use is treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
 Both oral and intravenous preparations are available.
 Newer biphosphonates, which may be more efficacious and less toxic than etidronate, are being studied.
