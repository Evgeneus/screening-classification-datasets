Transforming growth factor-alpha, epidermal growth factor receptor, and proliferating potential in benign and malignant gliomas.
 Surgical specimens from six benign and 16 malignant human gliomas were investigated immunohistochemically to correlate the degree of malignancy, the distribution of transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, and the potential for cell proliferation using monoclonal antibodies to TGF-alpha, EGF receptor, and Ki-67.
 Fourteen (88%) of the malignant gliomas and one (17%) of the benign gliomas were found to be positive for TGF-alpha, and 14 (88%) of the malignant gliomas and two (33%) of the benign gliomas expressed EGF receptor.
 The proliferation index with Ki-67 was 18.8% +/- 8.1% (mean +/- standard deviation) in malignant gliomas and 1.9% +/- 1.8% in benign gliomas.
 In general, cells positive for EGF receptor and Ki-67 were randomly distributed throughout the tumor tissue, and cells positive for TGF-alpha tended to be clustered without obvious relationship to areas of necrosis or blood vessels.
 In some tumors, cells positive for TGF-alpha, EGF receptor, and Ki-67 were associated in a focal distribution.
 The more frequent expression of TGF-alpha and EGF receptor in the highly proliferative malignant gliomas is compatible with a role for TGF-alpha and EGF receptor in the induction or stimulation of malignant gliomas.
