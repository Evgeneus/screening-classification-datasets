'Medial maxillectomy' for lateral nasal wall neoplasms.
 Lateral rhinotomy and "medial maxillectomy," an en bloc resection of the medial maxillary sinus, ethmoid sinus with the lamina papyracea, medial orbital floor, and lacrimal fossa-duct, have been advocated for lateral nasal wall neoplasma.
 Experience with 35 (of 41) patients followed up at least 30 months (median, 57 months) postoperatively is reported.
 There was a 9% recurrence for benign tumors and 15% for malignant neoplasms, the latter only in the patients with nonmelanoma malignant neoplasms not receiving postoperative radiotherapy.
 The most frequent complications were cavity crusting, epicanthal scarring, and epiphora.
