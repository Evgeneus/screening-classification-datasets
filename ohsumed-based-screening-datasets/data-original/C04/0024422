T1-T2 carcinoma of the glottis: relative hypofractionation.
 Radiation therapy, the preferred primary treatment for early squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis, offers high local control rates with voice preservation; however, the optimal treatment schedule is subject to debate.
 Local control, with and without surgical salvage, and associated long-term effects and complications were retrospectively analyzed in 90 patients treated with definitive radiation therapy for T1-T2 squamous cell carcinoma of the glottis.
 Patients received three weekly fractions of 333 cGy to a total dose of 60 Gy in 6 weeks.
 Median follow-up was 51.5 months.
 With radiation therapy alone, local control was 92% for T1 disease and 88% for T2; with surgical salvage, the control rate was 99%.
 Long-term effects included moderate hoarseness (16% of patients) and moderate or severe laryngeal edema (10% of patients).
 In seven patients who underwent salvage surgery, the complication rate was 29%.
 Despite excellent local control, this regimen may produce more long-term effects and complications than conventional fractionation.
