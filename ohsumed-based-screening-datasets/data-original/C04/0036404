Staging carcinoma: its value in cancer of the larynx.
 Three thousand four hundred and forty-five cases of cancer of the larynx were examined and 3,235 assigned to their TNM group.
 While good correlation with prognosis could be seen, the value of the detailed subsite (as opposed to the main laryngeal regions) was limited to defining T1a and T1b and aiding that of T2.
 T status gives some indication of prognosis, but the N status is of almost overriding importance.
