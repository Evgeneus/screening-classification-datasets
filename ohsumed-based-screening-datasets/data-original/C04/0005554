Management of macular puckers associated with retinal angiomas.
 Monocular visual loss in four patients was caused by epiretinal macular membranes associated with peripheral retinal capillary angiomas or angioma-like lesions.
 Three patients had solitary vascular lesions and one had two discrete vascular lesions.
 All patients were in good health, with no evidence of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome.
 In three patients, spontaneous peeling of the macular membranes and visual improvement occurred 2 to 6 months after obliteration of the angioma-like lesions with cryotherapy (two patients), or cryotherapy combined with argon laser (one patient).
 The fourth patient underwent a vitrectomy 8 months after the macular pucker had failed to respond to treatment of the vascular lesion.
