Free alpha subunit of the pituitary glycoprotein hormones. Measurement in serum and tissue of patients with pituitary tumors.
 A solid-phase radioimmunoassay was developed that measures the free alpha subunits of pituitary glycoprotein hormones (alpha PGpHs) and has negligible cross-reactivity with the intact hormones (less than 0.014% for thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH], less than 0.1% for human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], 0.8% for luteinizing hormone [LH], and 2.0% for follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH]).
 The assay is standardized with the alpha subunit of hCG but also reacts well with the alpha subunits of the other glycoprotein hormones (84% for alpha TSH, 77% for alpha FSH, and 64% for alpha LH).
 Concentrations as low as 0.3 micrograms/L can be reliably measured, and the 97.5% reference range in 27 healthy adults, including postmenopausal females, is less than or equal to 1.2 micrograms/L.
 Elevated preoperative alpha PGpH concentrations were found in 45 (9.4%) of 479 sera from patients with pituitary adenoma and 3 (4.5%) of 66 patients with nonadenomatous sellar lesions.
 Postoperative alpha PGpH levels were lower in 30 of 39 adenoma patients and 2 of 3 nonadenoma patients.
 In five (1%) of the patients with pituitary adenomas, alpha PGpH was the only elevated serum hormone marker.
 Serum values of alpha PGpH correlate weakly with alpha subunit immunocytochemical staining--95% of those with negative staining have normal alpha PGpH values, but only 18% of those with positive staining have elevated alpha PGpH values.
