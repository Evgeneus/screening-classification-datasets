Intraoperative pleural lavage cytology in lung cancer patients.
 Cytology of intraoperative pleural lavage was examined in 164 lung cancer patients who underwent pulmonary resections.
 None of the patients had any pleural effusion or dissemination.
 Cytology was performed three times: (1) at thoracotomy, (2) immediately after resection, and (3) after washing the pleural cavity with 5,000 mL of physiological saline solution just before closure of the chest wall.
 Twenty-three patients (14%) had more than one positive cytological finding.
 The frequency of positive cytological findings was significantly correlated with pathological T classification, pleural status, and pathological stage.
 The positive lavage group had a significantly higher recurrence rate than the negative lavage group in patients with stage I or stage II cancer.
 Four patients in the positive lavage group (17.4%) had recurrence in pleura or pericardium whereas only 1 patient in the negative lavage group (0.7%) had a recurrence in pericardium.
 The positive cytological finding of pleural lavage has more important meaning as a prognostic factor in stage I and stage II and indicates a greater possibility of recurrence in pleura or pericardium, but further examinations to evaluate the viability of detected malignant cells are required so that the positive cytological findings of pleural lavage can be regarded as subclinical pleural dissemination.
