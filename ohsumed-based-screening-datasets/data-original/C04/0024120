View from beneath: pathology in focus. ENT presentation of Ollier's disease.
 Cartilaginous tumours occurring in the head and neck are usually regarded and seen as solitary lesions.
 However, we present an unique case where the cartilaginous tumour in the ENT region was the presenting feature of Ollier's disease (multiple enchondromatosis).
 It is recommended that further investigations be carried out in patients with cartilaginous tumours presenting in the head and neck to exclude the possible presence of this unusual and interesting syndrome.
