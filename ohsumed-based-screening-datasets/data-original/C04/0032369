Solitary myeloma of the talus bone.
 Solitary myeloma can present as either extramedullary plasmacytoma or solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB).
 More than half of reported cases of SPB are localized to the spine.
 The rest include appendage long bones of the skeleton, pelvis, and skull.
 The first case of SPB (to the authors' knowledge) is reported involving the talus bone of the foot.
 Although approximately 50% of SPB patients progress to multiple myeloma in the first 3 years after diagnosis, aggressive local therapy is indicated because the median survival of patients with SPB is better than that for multiple myeloma.
