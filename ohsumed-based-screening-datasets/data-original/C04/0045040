Ovarian cyst aspiration and the outcome of in vitro fertilization.
 This study was designed to ascertain whether any benefit would be derived from aspirating ovarian cysts identified before ovarian stimulation in patients undergoing in vitro fertilization.
 Thirty-seven patients who had ovarian cysts were categorized into two groups: group A (n = 14) with baseline ovarian cysts and group B (n = 23) with ovarian cysts that developed during pituitary suppression with the gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog.
 Each group was prospectively randomized into two subgroups depending on whether the ovarian cysts were aspirated or not.
 In group A, there was a significantly greater number of follicles and oocytes in the ovaries in which cysts were aspirated.
 However, there was no significant difference in the total number of follicles, oocytes retrieved and fertilized, or in the final outcome.
 In group B, there was no significant difference in folliculogenesis between the aspirated and nonaspirated subgroups.
 These observations suggest that the presence of a baseline ovarian cyst may reduce folliculogenesis but do not support routine cyst aspiration if the patient has two functional ovaries.
