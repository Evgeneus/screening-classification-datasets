Combined (team) approach to hemangioma management: arteriography with superselective embolization plus YAG laser/sapphire-tip resection.
 Thirteen patients have been treated over a 2-year period utilizing a team approach between the radiology and surgical services.
 Initial diagnostic evaluation is directed at determining the size and anatomic extent of the hemangioma; clinical assessment of coagulation and hemodynamic status is also performed.
 Arteriography with superselective embolization precedes the surgical procedure, usually by 24 hours.
 The YAG laser with contact sapphire-tip scalpels is then utilized for resection and reconstruction of the hemangioma.
 Total removal of hemangioma was achieved in 9 of 13 patients, and partial or subtotal removal was achieved in the remainder.
 Blood loss and complications were minimal.
