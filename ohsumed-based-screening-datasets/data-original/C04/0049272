Regulation of jun-B expression by a cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent mechanism in human myeloid cells.
 The present studies have examined the regulation of the jun-B early response gene by cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent signaling pathways.
 The 2.0-kb jun-B transcript was at low but detectable levels in uninduced human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells.
 In contrast, treatment with 1 mmol/L8-bromo-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, an inhibitor of cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase, was associated with increases in jun-B transcripts that were maximal by 1 hour and then decreased to near pretreatment levels by 6 hours.
 Similar findings were obtained with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT-cAMP) and N6,2'-0-dibutyryladenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (dBt-cAMP).
 jun-B transcripts were also increased with other agents that increase intracellular cAMP levels, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and forskolin.
 Moreover, inhibition of cAMP-dependent protein kinase by the isoquinolinesulfonamide H-8 blocked 8-Br-cAMP-induced increases in jun-B expression.
 The results of nuclear run-on assays demonstrate that treatment of HL-60 cells with PGE2, forskolin, 8-Br-cAMP, and dBt-cAMP is associated with increases in the rate of jun-B transcription.
 The present findings also demonstrate that the related jun-D gene is similarly regulated by a cAMP-dependent pathway.
 Taken together, these findings suggest that stimulation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase is involved in the induction of jun gene expression in myeloid leukemia cells.
