Improved results with the addition of interferon alfa-2b to dacarbazine in the treatment of patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.
 Sixty-four patients with histologically confirmed metastatic malignant melanoma were entered on a prospectively controlled randomized trial.
 Patients received dacarbazine (DTIC) alone or DTIC plus interferon (IFN) alfa-2b.
 Patients were reasonably balanced with respect to age, sex, performance status (PS), site of metastases, and number of metastatic sites.
 Objective response (complete plus partial remission [CR + PR]) was documented in six patients on DTIC and in 16 patients on DTIC plus IFN alfa-2b.
 Median time to treatment failure (TTF) and median survival are significantly better on the combination arm, with some long-term CRs observed.
 More toxicity was encountered in the combination arm, which was acceptable except in three patients where treatment was discontinued because of IFN toxicity.
