Role of postoperative radiation therapy in stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer.
 One hundred forty-six patients with pathological stage IIIa non-small cell lung cancer were retrospectively analyzed to determine whether postoperative radiation therapy improves survival and reduces locoregional recurrences.
 The survival rate of the overall group at 1, 3, and 5 years was 56%, 24%, and 17%, respectively.
 Regarding the type of resection and histology, we did not observe statistically significant differences.
 Patients with N0 and N1 disease were grouped and compared with the N2 group, and survival at 3 and 5 years was 41% and 27%, respectively, for the T3 N0-1 group and 17% and 15%, respectively, for the T3 N2 group (p less than 0.001 and p = 0.05, respectively).
 Eighty-six patients received postoperative irradiation (45 to 50 Gy) and 60 did not.
 We have not observed any improvement in survival with postoperative radiation therapy, except in those patients with N2 disease.
 Median survival time was 6 months for patients without irradiation and 15 months for those with irradiation (p = 0.071).
 According to locoregional recurrences, a slight benefit with postoperative radiation therapy was observed.
