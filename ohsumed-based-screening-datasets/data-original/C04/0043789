Curative potential of primary whole-abdomen irradiation in ovarian carcinoma.
 Ovarian carcinoma remains a leading cause of cancer mortality in American women.
 The identification of active chemotherapy drugs and regimens has resulted in much less frequent use of radiation therapy at a time when technical and conceptual advances have been made.
 Unfortunately, the shift from radiotherapy to chemotherapy has not produced a discernible improvement in patient survival.
 Retrospective and prospective data suggest that whole-abdomen irradiation offers curative potential in patients with nonbulky residual disease after surgical cytoreduction.
 Its use should therefore be reconsidered as a primary adjuvant therapy in properly selected patients.
