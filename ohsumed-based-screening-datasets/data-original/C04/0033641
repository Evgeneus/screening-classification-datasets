Binding sites for P and/or type 1-piliated Escherichia coli in human ureter.
 Adherence sites for uropathogenic Escherichia coli in the excised human ureter were studied by using scanning electron microscopy.
 P-piliated E.
 coli adhered to younger epithelial cells which had microvilli on their surfaces, but did not to mature epithelial cells which had microfolds on their surfaces.
 This adherence was D-mannose resistant and alpha-D-Galactopyranosyl-(1----4)- beta-D-Galactopyranoside sensitive.
 Type-1 piliated E.
 coli adhered to both types of epithelial cells, but it was prevented by D-mannose.
 Entrapment of adherent type 1-piliated E.
 coli was observed only on the epithelial cells with microfolds.
 This model system allowed quantitative estimates of bacterial adherence to the luminal surface of the human ureteral mucosa in vitro, and demonstrated different manners of adherence of P and type 1-piliated E.
 coli.
