Spinal cord hemangioblastoma with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 A case of subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by a cervical hemangioblastoma is presented.
 The clinical picture was indistinguishable from that of a subarachnoid hemorrhage from an intracranial lesion.
 The diagnosis was established by angiography and water-soluble contrast myelography followed by cervical computed tomographic scan.
 At surgery, the tumor was completely removed, and no neurological deficit was observed after the operation.
