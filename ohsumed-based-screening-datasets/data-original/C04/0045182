Treatment of pulmonary endometriosis with a long-acting GnRH agonist.
 We report the case of a patient who was successfully treated with a long-acting GnRH agonist for pulmonary endometriosis.
 This 28-year-old woman had symptomatic pleural endometriosis, documented by biopsies, as well as symptomatic pelvic endometriosis.
 Two surgical procedures, consisting of excision of pleural endometriotic tissue and partial pleurectomies, failed to relieve her chest symptoms.
 Little relief was achieved with pseudopregnancy treatment.
 Satisfactory symptomatic improvement was obtained with danazol, but this medication had to be discontinued because of severe side effects.
 Trial of a GnRH agonist, leuprolide acetate, achieved complete remission of her chest symptoms; in addition, the patient became pregnant immediately after cessation of therapy.
 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist therapy may be an important therapeutic alternative for women with pulmonary endometriosis who cannot tolerate danazol treatment and in whom surgical therapy fails to relieve the chest symptoms.
