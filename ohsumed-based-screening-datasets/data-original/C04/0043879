Tumor proliferative fraction in solid malignant neoplasms. A comparative study of Ki-67 immunostaining and flow cytometric determinations.
 Tumor proliferative fraction (TPF) has been shown to correlate with prognosis in some malignancies.
 A method for its determination that is practical, accurate, and reproducible is still being sought.
 In this comparative study of techniques, TPF values were determined in mirror-image samples of 126 consecutive solid malignant neoplasms using flow cytometry and immunostaining with Ki-67, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an unknown nuclear antigen expressed during the entire cell proliferation cycle but not in resting cells.
 The mean TPF values for all cases were 19.5 +/- 15.6% (percentage of tumor cells stained) by Ki-67 (range, 1-86%) and 15.7 +/- 9.6% (S + G2M) by flow cytometry (range, 3-60%), which correlated significantly at r = 0.53 and P = 0.005.
 The correlation was less strong in tumors with low S-phase values (less than or equal to 10%, r = 0.28) than in tumors with intermediate and high S-phase values (r = 0.66).
 Ki-67 staining percentages did not correlate with patient age, sex, or tissue origin of the tumor.
 Ki-67 staining appears comparable to flow cytometry determination of TPF in solid malignancies with intermediate and high S-phase values.
 In tumors with low S-phase values, Ki-67 immunostaining shows higher TPF values, which perhaps reflect an increase in the proportion of G1-phase cells or dilutional effect of nonneoplastic cells in the tumors with low proliferative fraction.
