Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase expression in foetal skin, inflammatory dermatoses and cutaneous neoplasia.
 Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) is an enzyme expressed by some epithelial neoplasms but not normal interfollicular epidermis.
 In order to examine the relationship between malignant change and de-differentiation we studied histochemically the expression of GGT in human foetal skin, various inflammatory dermatoses and epidermal neoplasms.
 In foetal skin GGT was detectable after 7 weeks' gestation, reached a maximum at 11 weeks and was undetectable by 24 weeks.
 It was expressed strongly by squamous cell carcinoma and focally in Bowen's disease and actinic keratoses.
 There was no GGT expression in basal cell carcinoma or most benign skin tumours, but keratoacanthomas were weakly positive.
 Keratinocytes in the vicinity of malignant melanocytes also expressed GGT.
 This study suggests that GGT expression, while not a simple marker of malignancy, may represent reversion to a less differentiated or 'foetal' phenotype.
