Subcutaneous sarcoma. A population-based study of 129 patients.
 We reviewed 129 patients with subcutaneous sarcoma diagnosed from 1964 to the end of 1985 in a population-based series of sarcoma cases from southern Sweden.
 The annual incidence was 0.4 per 100,000, comprising 32% of all soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities or the trunk wall.
 Compared to deep-seated sarcomas, subcutaneous tumours were half the size at diagnosis, more common in the lower leg and foot, more often malignant fibrous histiocytoma, and of a lower grade of malignancy.
 None of the low-grade and only 7% of the high-grade tumours recurred locally after wide local excision without radiotherapy.
 The cumulative five-year survival for all 129 patients was 80%.
 Multivariate analysis identified only high grade of malignancy and the size of the tumour (greater than 5 cm) as independent prognostic factors.
 We conclude that systemic or local adjuvant therapy is not generally indicated for subcutaneous sarcoma because of the good prognosis and low local recurrence rate after wide excision.
