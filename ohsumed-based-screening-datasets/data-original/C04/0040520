Characterization of in vitro chemosensitivity of perioperative human ovarian malignancies by adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay.
 We report the in vitro chemosensitivity of primary and recurrent human ovarian tumor samples analyzed by adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay.
 We defined sensitivity as a greater than or equal to 70% decrease in intracellular adenosine triphosphate versus control at 20% of the reported peak plasma concentration per agent tested.
 Twenty of 21 assays (95.24%) were completed successfully.
 Single-agent and combined dose-response patterns consisting of decreasing viability with increasing drug concentration were observed consistently.
 Thirteen primary tumors were assayed, with 15.4% sensitive to cisplatin, 7.7% sensitive to 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide and 53.8% sensitive to their combination.
 Seven recurrent tumors were assayed, with 14.3% sensitive to cisplatin, 28.6% sensitive to 5-fluorouracil, and 42.9% sensitive to their combination.
 Dose-response characteristics and in vitro sensitivity rates reported in this article are consistent with reports of patient response in the literature.
 We conclude that adenosine triphosphate chemosensitivity assay is an efficient and reliable instrument for the in vitro chemosensitivity assessment of human tumors and warrants further clinical investigation.
