Oncogene rearrangements in chronic B-cell leukemia.
 Forty-four B-chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL) were studied by Southern blot analysis using probes for the Ig genes and bcl-1, bcl-2 (major, minor and 5' breakpoint region), bcl-3, c-myc, and retinoblastoma (Rb) loci.
 Eight cases had three or more rearranged JH bands, indicating oligoclonality, clonal evolution, or chromosomal translocation.
 One case had a rearrangement of the bcl-1 locus and three of the bcl-2 locus.
 In the first case, comigration of the rearranged bcl-1 and JH sequences indicated a t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, which, in contrast to previously described cases, seems to be completely reciprocal.
 One case with a bcl-2 rearrangement showed comigration of the bcl-2 major breakpoint region and a rearranged JH band.
 This indicates a t(14;18) (q32;q21).
 The two other cases showed rearrangements of the bcl-2 5' breakpoint region without apparent comigration.
 No rearrangements were detected of c-myc and bcl-3, located at chromosome 19, nor was a deletion of Rb found.
 All but three cases had CD5 expression.
 The exceptions included the t(11;14) and the t(14;18) cases.
 Our results confirm recent data on rearrangements at the 5' site of bcl-2 in CLL.
 Additionally, they corroborate the presumption that CD5-negative chronic B-cell leukemias should be considered apart from classical CLL.
