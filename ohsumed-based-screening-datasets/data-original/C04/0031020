Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung and congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.
 A case of bronchioloalveolar carcinoma of the lung is described in a 19-year-old man who had had a lobectomy in infancy, for removal of a congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation.
 It is suggested that congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation may predispose a patient to development of epithelial malignancies of the lung, whereas mesenchymal hamartomas usually are associated with nonepithelial neoplasms.
