The silence: the asbestos industry and early occupational cancer research--a case study.
 To gain insight into corporate activities regarding the identification of occupational carcinogens earlier in this century, the actions of one industry, the asbestos industry, were reviewed.
 This industry, in concert with many of its insurers, systematically developed and then suppressed information on the carcinogenicity of asbestos.
 The development of warnings for those exposed to the asbestos was delayed.
 As a result, millions of workers were exposed to the carcinogen and hundreds of thousands died.
 These events are placed into the context of similar activities in other industries during this time.
