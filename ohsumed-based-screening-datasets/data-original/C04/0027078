Eccrine acrospiroma (clear cell hidradenoma) of the eyelid. Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural features.
 A 46-year-old man underwent excision of a left lower eyelid mass that had enlarged over a 2-month period.
 Pathologic examination showed the mass to be an eccrine acrospiroma, a benign adnexal tumor that rarely arises in the eyelid.
 Light microscopic and ultrastructural examination showed two types of cells to comprise the tumor: eosinophilic cells with intracytoplasmic tonofilaments, and clear cells with intracytoplasmic glycogen granules.
 Immunohistochemical stains were positive for cytokeratins AE 1,3, epithelial membrane antigen, carcinoembryonic antigen, and muscle specific actin in tumor cells.
