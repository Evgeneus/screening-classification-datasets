A direct correlation of the resolution of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema with acetazolamide therapy.
 We report the case of a patient with pseudophakic cystoid macular edema whose visual acuity improved promptly with oral administration of 500 mg of acetazolamide extended-release capsules BID for two weeks.
 However, vision worsened again within two weeks of discontinuation of the treatment.
 On resumption of acetazolamide therapy for three weeks, and its slow withdrawal during the following three weeks, the macular edema eventually resolved, and vision returned to normal.
 Our observation provides a direct correlation of the resolution of pseudophakic cystoid macular edema with acetazolamide therapy and shows the importance of tapering the doses of this regimen.
