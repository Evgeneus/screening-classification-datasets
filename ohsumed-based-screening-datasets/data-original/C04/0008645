Capillary haemangioma presenting as a lung pseudocyst.
 A girl who developed a lung cyst at 24 hours of age during gentle ventilation for respiratory distress syndrome is reported.
 Instead of resolving as expected of a pseudocyst it continued to expand.
 Resection at 1 year of age showed a cyst entirely surrounded by capillary haemangioma.
 Aspiration of this cyst would have been dangerous.
