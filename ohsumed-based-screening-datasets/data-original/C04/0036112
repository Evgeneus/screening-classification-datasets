Temporal bone findings in a family with branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR).
 A family group with confirmed branchio-oto-renal (BOR) syndrome was investigated in this study.
 Computerized tomography of the temporal bones has demonstrated that the malformations of the inner ear consist of hypoplastic structural changes within the cochlea with reduced vertical diameters, and absent or hypoplastic semicircular canals and normal endolymphatic ducts.
 It is concluded that in the present cases, the Mondini malformation of the cochlea is not associated with the BOR syndrome.
