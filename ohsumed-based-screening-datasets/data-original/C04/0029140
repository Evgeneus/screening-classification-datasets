Serum gastrin increases with increasing dietary calcium but not with increasing dietary fat or fiber in Fischer-344 rats.
 We studied the effects of dietary calcium, fat and fiber on serum gastrin in Fischer-344 rats in a full factorial experiment as part of a larger study of diet and colon cancer risk factors.
 Nine- to 10-wk-old male rats were fed standard or experimental diets for 4 wk.
 Wheat bran was the sole source of fiber.
 Wheat bran levels were 0, 2.5, 10 and 20%; fat levels were 1, 5 and 10%; calcium levels were 0.18, 0.52 and 1.04% of diet weight.
 On d 29 serum was collected and stored at -80 degrees C until analyzed.
 There was a significant (P less than 0.0001) dose-dependent increase in serum gastrin from 102 to 173 ng/L, with increasing calcium.
 No other significant changes in serum gastrin were noted with the dietary changes.
 A long-term change in the level of serum gastrin, caused by dietary modification, will influence the trophic effect that gastrin has on colonic mucosa as well as on colon carcinomas.
 We speculate that calcium supplementation, although slowing colonic proliferation, might have an undesirable effect on the growth of early undetected colonic tumors.
