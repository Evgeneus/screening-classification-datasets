Changing patterns in presentation and management of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in Northern Ireland, 1970-1988 
 The clinical features, diagnostic methods, management and survival in 16 cases of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome encountered in Northern Ireland between the years 1970 and 1988 are described.
 While the majority of patients in the first decade of the study period had surgical treatment, those presenting in the latter period have been managed with medical therapy in the form of H2-receptor antagonists or omeprazole.
 The increasing use of these agents seems to be altering the severe clinical features of this condition, reducing the indications for surgery and maintaining patients, with or without evidence of metastatic disease, in clinical remission.
