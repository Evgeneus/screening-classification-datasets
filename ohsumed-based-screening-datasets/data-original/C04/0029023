The effect of endoscopic laser therapy on survival in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Further experience.
 Although endoscopic laser therapy is effective for symptom palliation in esophageal cancer, few studies have investigated its effect on survival.
 We previously reported a 300% improvement in survival in 10 patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus after endoscopic Nd:YAG laser energy.
 We now report a study to determine if the survival advantage persisted after treating an additional 26 patients.
 Thirty-six patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the esophagus treated with endoscopic laser therapy were compared to 20 controls identified by our hospital Tumor Registry.
 There was no difference between the groups with respect to age, sex, race, location of tumor, or clinical stage.
 More control patients (25%) had previously undergone surgery than laser patients (0%) (p less than 0.05).
 Survival analysis demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (p less than 0.05), with an improvement in median survival from 5.7 to 9.7 months (p less than 0.05).
 One-year survival was 38% in laser patients, compared to 20% in control patients.
 Our experience continues to demonstrate that endoscopic laser therapy is effective in prolonging life as well as palliating the symptoms of patients with squamous-cell esophageal carcinoma.
