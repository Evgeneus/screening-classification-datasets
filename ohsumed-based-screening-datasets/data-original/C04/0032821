Structure-function relationships of the mouse inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor.
 The homotetrameric complex of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (InsP3) receptors displays a Ca2+ release activity in response to InsP3 molecules.
 Structure-function relationships of the mouse cerebellar InsP3 receptor have been studied by analyses of a series of internal deletion or C-terminal truncation mutant proteins expressed in NG108-15 cells.
 Within the large cytoplasmic portion of the InsP3 receptor, approximately 650 N-terminal amino acids are highly conserved between mouse and Drosophila, and this region has the critical sequences for InsP3 binding that probably form the three-dimensionally restricted binding site.
 The N-terminal region of each InsP3 receptor subunit also binds one InsP3 molecule.
 Cross-linking experiments have revealed that InsP3 receptors are intermolecularly associated at the transmembrane domains and/or the successive C termini.
 The interaction between the receptor subunit and InsP3 may cause a conformational change in the tetrameric complex, resulting in the opening of Ca2+ channels.
