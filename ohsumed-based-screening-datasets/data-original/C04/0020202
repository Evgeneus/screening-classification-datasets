Stage IV neuroblastoma in infants. Long-term survival.
 Before the advent of multiagent chemotherapy, the prognosis for patients with Stage IV neuroblastoma of all ages was dismal.
 More recently, marked improvement in infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma has been reported.
 Twenty-four infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma have been treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/The Children's Hospital, and the Joint Center For Radiation Therapy, Boston, Massachusetts, between 1970 and 1988.
 Twenty-three of these patients were treated with multiagent chemotherapy and one with a single drug.
 In the initial report, ten of 11 patients were alive without evidence of disease after intensive therapy.
 In this report the authors update their initial series of patients and include 13 additional patients who subsequently presented to our institutions with Stage IV neuroblastoma younger than 1 year of age.
 The 5-year actuarial event-free survival for the 24 patients is 75%.
 No patient without bone metastases died from neuroblastoma, and 12 of 16 patients with bone metastases remained disease free.
 These results confirm that infants with Stage IV neuroblastoma have a very good prognosis when treated with intensive multiagent chemotherapy.
