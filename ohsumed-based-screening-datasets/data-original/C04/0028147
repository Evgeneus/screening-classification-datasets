Syringomyelia secondary to congenital intraspinal lipoma.
 Preoperative evaluation using serial magnetic resonance imaging was performed on an infant with lumbosacral lipoma.
 Syrinx formation arising just above the lipoma was observed in conjunction with rapid growth of the lipoma.
 Definite shrinkage of syringomyelia was obtained after radical excision of the lipoma.
 The syrinx formation was possibly caused by compression from the extramedullary lipoma.
