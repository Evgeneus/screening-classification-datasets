Androgen responses to acutely increased endogenous insulin levels in hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women.
 We examined androgen responses in hyperandrogenic (polycystic ovarian disease [PCOD]) and normal women after an acute endogenous insulin elevation.
 Standard intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTTs), modified to include a tolbutamide injection 20 minutes after IVGTTs, were performed.
 Polycystic ovarian disease patients were studied in the untreated state, after 6 weeks of ovarian androgen suppression with leuprolide acetate, after a 6-week rest period, and after 6 weeks of antiandrogen therapy with spironolactone.
 Normal menstruating women were studied during the early follicular, midcycle, and luteal phases of a single cycle.
 An acute rise in insulin did not alter serum testosterone or androstenedione levels in PCOD or normal women.
 A significant rise in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate after modified IVGTTs was found in both hyperandrogenic and normal cycling women.
 Although these results are not supportive of the theory that insulin acts on the ovary to stimulate androgen production, they may be because of the short time course of insulin elevation that occurs during an IVGTT.
