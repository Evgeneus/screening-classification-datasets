Transureteroureterostomy and terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy in advanced pelvic malignancies.
 Transureteroureterostomy was combined with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy, without complications, in 8 patients with advanced pelvic malignancy and a poor prognosis.
 Urinary diversion was palliative in all patients and followed pelvic exenteration in 4, debulking of pelvic tumor in 2 and radical cystectomy in 1, while 1 had inoperable bladder cancer.
 All patients had at least unilateral hydroureteronephrosis preoperatively.
 In each case a postoperative excretory urogram revealed significant improvement of the hydroureteronephrosis and the serum creatinine improved or stabilized.
 No patient had ureteral stomal stenosis or retraction.
 Mean survival was 5 months, with the longest survival being 1 year.
 Transureteroureterostomy in conjunction with terminal loop cutaneous ureterostomy is an effective technique of urinary diversion in selected patients with a poor prognosis and advanced pelvic malignancy, decreasing operative time while avoiding the morbidity associated with a ureterointestinal operation or nephrostomy.
