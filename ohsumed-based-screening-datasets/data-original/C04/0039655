Low nm23 protein expression in infiltrating ductal breast carcinomas correlates with reduced patient survival.
 Protein levels corresponding to nm23 were determined in normal and neoplastic breast tissues by immunoperoxidase staining.
 Nm23 protein levels were highest in normal breast epithelium, and lower in intraductal carcinomas.
 Based on nm23 staining, 39 infiltrating ductal carcinomas were separated into two groups: tumors with homogeneously high nm23 protein content, and tumors with low staining in either a homogeneous or heterogeneous pattern.
 Patients with low nm23 staining tumors, determined by three pathologists independently, had reduced survival times (alpha = 0.034, alpha = 0.012, alpha = 0.052 by the log rank test).
 Nm23 expression approached significance as an independent predictor of survival in Cox's proportional hazards model.
 The data provide the first correlation of low nm23 protein expression and reduced breast carcinoma patient survival.
