Breast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity.
 Breast cancer metastatic to the eye is a common entity occurring in up to 30% of women with metastatic disease.
 The prevalence of this lesion is not appreciated because of the dominant clinical picture of metastases occurring in other organs.
 The diagnosis should be suspected in any women with a history of breast cancer and any visual symptoms, particularly metamorphopsia and scotomata.
 A thorough ophthalmologic evaluation, aided by ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance scanning, usually confirms the diagnosis.
 Early treatment with radiation therapy can alleviate symptoms and control local disease.
 The recognition and treatment of this disorder is important in maximizing the quality of life in patients with metastatic breast cancer, especially because newer treatment regimens prolong survival and thereby increase the chances for ocular metastasis.
