Methylmercury blocks N- and L-type Ca++ channels in nerve growth factor-differentiated pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells.
 Effects of methylmercury (MeHg) on whole-cell Ba++ currents in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were examined.
 Based on biophysical characteristics and sensitivity to omega-conotoxin GVIA and dihydropyridine agonists and antagonists, voltage-activated Ba++ currents (IBa) in PC12 cells were mediated by N- and L-type Ca++ channels.
 Addition of MeHg (10 microM) to the extracellular solution caused a rapid and complete block of current carried by 20 mM Ba++.
 The rate of block of IBa by MeHg increased in a concentration-dependent manner between 1 and 20 microM.
 Increasing the frequency of stimulation from 0.1 to 0.4 Hz facilitated block of IBa by MeHg.
 A 2-min application of 10 microM MeHg in the absence of stimulation also reduced IBa by approximately 80%.
 Thus, block of IBa by MeHg is not state-dependent.
 Additionally, MeHg blocked IBa when the membrane holding potential was -40, -70 and -90 mV, indicating that both N- and L-type Ca++ channels are blocked by MeHg.
 Block of IBa by MeHg was voltage-dependent at a membrane holding potential of -40 mV, but not at holding potentials of -70 and -90 mV.
 Decreasing the extracellular concentration of Ba++ ([Ba++]e) from 20 mM to 10 mM increased the magnitude of block by MeHg from 45.6 to 77.3%.
 Increasing [Ba++]e to 30 mM caused no further antagonism of block.
 Block of IBa by MeHg was not reversed by washing with MeHg-free solution.
 The ionic permeability of PC12 cell Ca++ channels was Ca++ = Sr++ greater than Ba++.
 In the presence of MeHg, all three divalent cations were equally permeant.
