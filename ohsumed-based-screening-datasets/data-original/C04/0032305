Risk factors in relation to postoperative complications and mortality after total gastrectomy in aged patients.
 To clarify the risk factors contributing to postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing total gastrectomy, 84 patients with primary gastric cancer were evaluated.
 Twenty-seven patients were older than 65 years of age; they had much more preoperative cardiac (P = 0.00003), respiratory (P = 0.0008), and multiorgan impairment (P = 0.009) than did the control group (age less than 65 yrs).
 Although overall morbidities (44.4% vs.
 19.2%; P = 0.01) and overall septic complication rates (33.3% vs.
 12.2%; P = 0.02) were higher in aged patients, no significant differences between the two groups were found in the incidence of major surgical complications (18.5% in aged patients vs.
 10.5% in control groups; P = NS), serious septic (sepsis score greater than 10) complications (18.5% vs.
 7.0%; P = NS) and hospital mortalities (11.1% vs.
 3.5%; P = NS).
 In older patients the occurrence of multiorgan impairment and malnutrition was significantly related to postoperative complication rates.
 These results suggest that the degree of organ impairment rather than age is predictive of postoperative difficulty and should be used in assessing preoperative risk.
