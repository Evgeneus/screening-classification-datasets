Superficial bladder cancer in patients under 40 years of age. Efficacy of topical prophylaxis.
 In patients under the age of 40 years with primary superficial bladder cancer the efficacy of adjuvant topical treatment was the same as in elderly patients (recurrences 23%, progression rate 8%).
 Patients should therefore be treated on the basis of stage and grade of the tumour regardless of their age.
