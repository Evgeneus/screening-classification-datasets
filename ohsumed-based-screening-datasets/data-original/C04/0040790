Lewis blood group antigens (a and b) in human breast tissues. Loss of Lewis-b in breast cancer cells and correlation with tumor grade.
 The Lewis blood group antigens (Lewis-a [Lea] and Lewis-b [Leb]) and their precursors are present on various normal human epithelial cell surfaces.
 The authors examined 35 benign and malignant human breast lesions using mouse monoclonal antibodies to synthetic Lea and Leb carbohydrate antigens.
 Normal breast lobular and ductal epithelium and benign breast lesions showed Leb staining but only occasional Lea staining.
 In invasive ductal carcinomas of breast, of all grades, a loss of Leb antigen staining was found in 80% of the breast cancer cases.
 This reduced Leb antigen expression increased with the grade of malignancy.
 Therefore, the loss of Leb blood group antigens on breast cancer cell surfaces may suggest altered fucosylation patterns in malignant cells and reflect the degree of malignancy and/or invasiveness.
