Stereotactic radiosurgery for squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx.
 Stereotactic radiosurgery using the gamma unit represents a unique neurosurgical treatment method for the management of selected intracranial vascular malformations and tumors.
 During a closed-skull single-session procedure that focuses 201 individual beams of gamma irradiation, a high-radiation dose is delivered to the lesion, with a steep dose fall-off peripherally.
 In order to maintain accuracy of delivery, the target must remain fixed in space; hence the skull is engaged by rigid external fixation during treatment.
 In this report, we document the first extracranial lesion treated with radiosurgery, a recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of Rosenmuller's fossa, and discuss the possible role of radiosurgery in carefully selected head and neck malignancies.
