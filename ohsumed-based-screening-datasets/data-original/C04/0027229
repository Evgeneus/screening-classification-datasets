Sexually transmitted papilloma viral infection in the male. VII. Is cancer of penis sexually transmitted?
 Four cases are reported of squamous cell carcinoma of the genital tract in males.
 The close association of HPV 16/18 with in situ squamous carcinoma affecting the penis is demonstrated.
 The first documented case of a primary penile squamous cell carcinoma with metastatic deposits yielding positive HPV 16/18 isolates as shown by in situ DNA hybridization again demonstrates a close association of this virus to malignancy in humans.
 The clinical implications of these findings strongly suggest that squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is a sexually transmitted disease.
 A thorough examination of both sexual partners is necessary when Bowenoid papulosis or penile carcinoma is present, since the female partner is at high risk for cervical neoplasia.
