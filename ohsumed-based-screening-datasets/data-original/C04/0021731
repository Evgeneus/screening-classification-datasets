Reconstitution of high-affinity opioid agonist binding in brain membranes.
 In synaptosomal membranes from rat brain cortex, the mu selective agonist [3H]dihydromorphine in the absence of sodium, and the nonselective antagonist [3H]naltrexone in the presence of sodium, bound to two populations of opioid receptor sites with Kd values of 0.69 and 8.7 nM for dihydromorphine, and 0.34 and 5.5 nM for naltrexone.
 The addition of 5 microM guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[gamma S]) strongly reduced high-affinity agonist but not antagonist binding.
 Exposure of the membranes to high pH reduced the number of GTP[gamma-35S] binding sites by 90% and low Km, opioid-sensitive GTPase activity by 95%.
 In these membranes, high-affinity agonist binding was abolished and modulation of residual binding by GTP[gamma S] was diminished.
 High-affinity (Kd, 0.72 nM), guanine nucleotide-sensitive agonist binding was reconstituted by polyethylene glycol-induced fusion of the alkali-treated membranes with (opioid receptor devoid) C6 glioma cell membranes.
 Also restored was opioid agonist-stimulated, naltrexone-inhibited GTPase activity.
 In contrast, antagonist binding in the fused membranes was unaltered.
 Alkali treatment of the glioma cell membranes prior to fusion inhibited most of the low Km GTPase activity and prevented the reconstitution of agonist binding.
 The results show that high-affinity opioid agonist binding reflects the ligand-occupied receptor-guanine nucleotide binding protein complex.
