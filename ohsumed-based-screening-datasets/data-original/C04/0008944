Lipolytic factors associated with murine and human cancer cachexia.
 We have identified a lipolytic factor in extracts of a cachexia-inducing murine carcinoma (MAC16) that shows characteristics of an acidic peptide and appears to be composed of three fractions of apparent molecular weights corresponding to 3 kd, 1.5 kd, and 0.7 kd, as determined by exclusion chromatography.
 Material with identical chromatographic and molecular weight characteristics was also present in the serum of patients with clinical cancer cachexia but absent from normal serum, even under conditions of starvation.
 The MAC16 lipid factor, when injected into animals bearing the non-cachexia-inducing tumor MAC13, was capable of inducing weight loss without a significant reduction in food intake.
 Similar lipolytic material, although in lower concentration, was also found in the MAC13 tumor extracts.
 These findings suggest that cachexia may arise from the enhanced expression of a lipolytic factor associated with tumor cells.
