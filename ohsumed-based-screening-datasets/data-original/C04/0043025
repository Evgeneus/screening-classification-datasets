Role of lymphangiography in staging testicular seminoma.
 Bipedal lymphangiography (LAG) and abdominal/pelvic computerized tomography (CT) are both useful in evaluating retroperitoneal lymph nodes in early-stage testicular seminoma.
 Fifty-four patients who had both radiologic studies performed between 1982 and 1986 were identified, and their films were reviewed.
 Four patients had evidence of retroperitoneal lymph node metastases on both CT and LAG.
 Of the 50 patients who had normal findings on CT scan, 39 (78%) had a normal LAG and 11 (22%) had a positive LAG.
 All 11 patients had architectural abnormalities within normal-sized nodes.
 No patient had positive findings on CT with negative LAG.
 In addition to aiding in staging, LAG is very useful in designing radiation treatment portals.
 Therefore, we believe that LAG can continue to play an important role in the accurate staging and treatment of patients with testicular seminoma.
