The efficacy of chlorhexidine gel in reduction of Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species in patients treated with radiation therapy.
 Xerostomia may develop in patients with cancer who receive radiotherapy that includes the salivary glands in the field.
 These patients are at high risk of rampant dental caries.
 Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus species have been associated with dental caries.
 Quantitative counts of these organisms demonstrated high caries risk due to streptococci in 66% and due to lactobacilli in 100% of patients studied.
 Use of chlorhexidine rinse was shown to reduce S.
 mutans counts 1.1 logs and lactobacilli 1.1 logs.
 The use of chlorhexidine gel resulted in a reduction of S.
 mutans 1.2 logs and lactobacilli 2.2 logs.
 In the subjects using the rinse, caries risk due to streptococci was reduced to low levels in 44% and due to lactobacilli in only one subject, with reduction to moderate risk in one third and no change in risk in the remaining patients.
 The use of chlorhexidine gel was found to reduce the caries risk associated with streptococci to low levels in all patients, and the risk associated with lactobacilli to low and moderate risk in two thirds of patients.
