Symptomatic pineal cyst: case report.
 Pineal cysts are being described with increasing frequency since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging.

 We present a case of pineal cyst causing aqueductal obstruction with symptomatic hydrocephalus and resultant headache and syncope, which was treated by surgical resection.
 A review of the relevant literature and discussion follow.
