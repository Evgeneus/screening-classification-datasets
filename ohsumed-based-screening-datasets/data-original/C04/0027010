Soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall. Results of surgical resection.
 Primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall are uncommon, and data concerning treatment and results are sparse.
 Most studies have categorized these tumors as truncal sarcomas and inferred a poor prognosis.
 To assess the results of surgical treatment, we reviewed our 40-year experience.
 Methods: Records of 189 patients admitted to our institution from 1948 to 1988 were reviewed.
 Pathologic material was available for review in the 149 cases (79%) that comprise this report.
 Survival was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, with comparisons by log-rank analysis and significance defined as p less than 0.05.
 Results: Ages ranged from 3 weeks to 86 years (median, 38 years); the ratio of male to female patients was 2:1.
 The initial complaint was mass or pain in 97% of the cases.
 Ninety sarcomas (60%) were high grade and 59 (40%) were low grade.
 Histologic types were as follows: desmoid tumor (n = 32, 21%); liposarcoma (n = 23, 15%); rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 18, 12%); fibrosarcoma (n = 17, 11%); embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 14, 9%); malignant peripheral nerve tumor (n = 13, 9%); malignant fibrous histiocytoma (n = 11, 7%); spindle cell sarcoma (n = 4, 3%); tenosynovial sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); hemangiopericytoma (n = 3, 3%); alveolar soft part sarcoma (n = 3, 3%); and other types (n = 12, 9%).
 Resection was the primary treatment in 140 cases (94%).
 Local recurrence developed in 27%.
 Metastases occurred in 52 (35%) of the cases (metachronous in 42, synchronous in 10) and were more common in patients with high-grade disease (46/90, 51%) than in those with low-grade disease (6/59, 10%).
 Overall 5-year survival was 66%.
 Five-year survival rate for those with high-grade sarcomas (49%) was significantly lower than that for low-grade sarcomas (90%, p less than 0.0001).
 Tumor size and age of patient were not prognostic.
 Conclusions: Survival of patients with primary soft tissue sarcomas of the chest wall after resection is similar to that of patients with sarcomas of the extremities.
 Resection alone provides acceptable survival (90% at 5 years) for those with low-grade sarcomas, but adjuvant treatment should be considered for those with high-grade sarcomas.
