Effect of hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo on adenine and pyridine nucleotide pools in human peripheral lymphocytes.
 Hyperthermia has been shown in vitro and in vivo to potentiate the effects of ionizing irradiation.
 Previous studies found that hyperthermia alters the metabolism of adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymers required for recovery from DNA damage and that poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activity is very sensitive to cellular nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels.
 Thus, the effect of 41.8 degrees C hyperthermia in vitro and in vivo on NAD and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels was studied in human peripheral lymphocytes.
 In vitro studies showed significant decreases in oxidized NAD (NAD+) and ATP levels after heating that simulated a clinical whole-body hyperthermia (WBH) treatment.
 This nucleotide depletion could not be attributed to nucleotide leakage or increased enzymatic NAD+ consumption.
 As the reduction of NAD observed was sufficient to decrease poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase activity by 50%, the studies were extended to clinica cases.
 Cellular NAD+ and ATP were measured in previously stored lymphocytes obtained from four patients before and after WBH; a statistically significant decrease in NAD+ was observed after WBH which quantitatively agreed with the in vitro results.
 Based on these results a prospective study was done in three patients; NAD+ was extracted immediately on sample collection, and the kinetics of WBH-induced NAD depletion were studied.
 These data, which agree quantitatively with the laboratory results, are presented.
