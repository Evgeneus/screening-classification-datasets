Molecular characterization of a supratypic cross-reactive idiotype associated with IgM autoantibodies.
 Neoplastic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphomas (SLL) frequently express surface Ig reactive with the mouse mAb, Lc1.
 Raised against a human monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid factor activity, Lc1 detects a major cross-reactive Id (CRI) present on the H chain of many monoclonal IgM autoantibodies.
 In contrast to other major autoantibody-CRI investigated to date, we note that the Lc1-CRI is expressed by subpopulation of cells in the germinal centers, as well as in the mantle zones, of secondary human B cell follicles.
 To examine the molecular basis for Lc1 expression, we used the polymerase chain reaction to isolate the functionally rearranged Ig VH genes of monoclonal Lc1-reactive B cell populations from six unrelated patients with CLL or SLL.
 Although the neoplastic B cells from most patients with CLL or SLL express the CD5 surface differentiation Ag, the lymphoma cells from one patient with SLL were CD5-negative.
 We find that the Lc1-reactive cells from each cell population have Ig rearrangements involving a VH gene of the VH4 subgroup.
 However, the VH4 genes rearranged in different Lc1-reactive tumor populations may originate from at least two disparate germ-line VH4 genes.
 Also, in contrast to the CD5-positive tumor populations, we find evidence for intraclonal diversity in the functionally rearranged VH4 genes of the CD5-negative SLL.
 Collectively, this study discerns a degeneracy in the VH4 genes that can encode the Lc1 CRI, indicating the term "supratypic cross-reactive idiotype" may best describe the specificity of the Lc1 mAb.
 Also, this study suggests that expression of CD5 may delineate categories of B cell SLL that differ in their relative rates of constitutive Ig V gene somatic mutation.
