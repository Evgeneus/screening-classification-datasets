Activation of a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily by peroxisome proliferators 
 We have cloned a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors.
 The receptor homologue is activated by a diverse class of rodent hepatocarcinogens that causes proliferation of peroxisomes.
 Identification of a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor should help elucidate the mechanism of the hypolipidaemic effect of these hepatocarcinogens and aid evaluation of their potential carcinogenic risk to man.
