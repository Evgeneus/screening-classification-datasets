Malignant fibrous histiocytoma of the gastrointestinal tract in a patient with neurofibromatosis.
 Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of the gastrointestinal tract is extremely rare.
 A case of MFH of the colon associated with neurofibromatosis is presented.
 MFH is a high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma of fibroblast cell origin with a strong propensity for metastasis and recurrence.
 Immunochemical markers help to differentiate MFH from other sarcomas.
 The most successful treatment of MFH is surgical extirpation.
 Adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not been definitively shown to be of value.
