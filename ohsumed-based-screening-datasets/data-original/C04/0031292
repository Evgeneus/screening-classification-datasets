Immunohistochemical study of thyroid peroxidase in normal, hyperplastic, and neoplastic human thyroid tissues.
 An immunohistochemical study using two monoclonal antibodies (MoAb 30 and MoAb 47) against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) was performed on surgical specimens of human thyroid carcinoma (n = 65), adenoma (n = 70) and Graves' disease (n = 10).
 Normal adjacent thyroid tissue was used as positive control.
 Monoclonal antibody 30 reacted significantly with all adenoma and most carcinoma, whereas MoAb 47 reacted with 66 adenoma but only two carcinoma.
 Of the four adenomas that did not react with MoAb 47, three were of the fetal type.
 Both carcinoma reacting with MoAb 47 were of the well-differentiated follicular type.
 These findings further confirm the hypothesis that thyroid carcinoma is associated with changes in the quantity and antigenic properties of TPO.
 Although the alterations in antigenic behavior revealed by MoAb 47 are not 100% specific, they may allow more accurate diagnosis of malignancy in thyroid tumors.
