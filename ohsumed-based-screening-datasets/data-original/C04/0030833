Plasma chromogranin A + B, neuropeptide Y and catecholamines in pheochromocytoma patients.
 Plasma levels of chromogranin A + B, neuropeptide Y and catecholamines were analysed before, during and after surgery in seven patients with pheochromocytoma.
 The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic sensitivity of these plasma amines and peptides, and to investigate their peroperative fluctuations.
 Chromogranin A + B in plasma was increased preoperatively in all patients, showed no significant increase during surgery, and normalized postoperatively.
 Neuropeptide Y, which alone can induce hypertension, was present in high levels in plasma from three patients preoperatively, increased further in four patients during surgery, and was postoperatively low in all patients.
 Fractionated plasma catecholamines were increased in five patients before surgery, increased in all patients during tumour dissection, and normalized postoperatively.
 It may be concluded that plasma chromogranin A + B exhibited as high a sensitivity for pheochromocytoma as fractionated urinary catecholamines in the patients studied.
