Recurring catamenial pneumothorax treated with a Gn-RH analogue.
 We report a case of recurring catamenial pneumothorax with concurrent pelvic endometriosis.
 Thoracoscopy revealed a blue-like lesion on top of the dome of the right hemidiaphragm.
 Microscopic examination of biopsy specimens showed endometriosis.
 The patient was treated with a Gn-RH analogue and remains well without further evidence of pneumothorax after six months.
