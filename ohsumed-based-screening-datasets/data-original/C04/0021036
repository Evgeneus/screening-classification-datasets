The growing teratoma syndrome.
 Thirteen patients with metastatic non-seminomatous germ cell tumours and enlarging metastases consisting of teratoma differentiated only were identified.
 Patients were managed with surgical resection soon after the growing lesions were documented.
 Surgical morbidity was minimal and 12 patients are alive (10 are disease-free) at a median follow-up of 28 months.
