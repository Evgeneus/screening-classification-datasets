Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. Clinicopathologic study of 18 cases.
 The clinical and pathologic features of primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin in 18 elderly patients are reported.
 The carcinomas arose in the dermis and subcutaneous tissues, particularly on the head and the upper extremities.
 One tumor occurred in an irradiated area.
 Using Gould's clinicopathologic classification, we have found four trabecular types, eleven intermediate cell types, and two small cell types.
 One tumor could not be classified.
 Other noteworthy pathologic features were association with invasive squamous cell carcinoma, lentiginous melanocytic hyperplasia, and presence of intratumoral melanocytes.
 Immunoreactivity for cytokeratins (56 kD), neurofilaments, neuron-specific enolase, and epithelial membrane antigen was observed.
 The paranuclear globular staining pattern of cytokeratins and neurofilaments was conspicuous.
 The ultrastructural features revealed paranuclear intermediate filament aggregates (fibrous bodies), neurosecretory granules, and cell junctions.
 In two metastatic tumors, high levels of catecholamines were found.
 The trabecular types were characterized by localized disease and a good prognosis.
 The patients with the small cell types died of distant metastases.
 Postoperative radiotherapy seemed to reduce the rate of local recurrences.
