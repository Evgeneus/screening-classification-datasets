Overexpression of HER-2/neu in endometrial cancer is associated with advanced stage disease.
 Prior studies have shown that overexpression of HER-2/neu occurs in one third of breast and ovarian cancers and that overexpression is associated with poor prognosis.
 We used a monoclonal antibody to assess immunohistochemically the level of HER-2/neu expression in normal and malignant endometrium.
 In 24 normal endometrial samples light to moderate (1+ to 2+) staining for HER-2/neu was seen in the glands, and there was no variation in intensity of staining during the menstrual cycle.
 Among 95 endometrial adenocarcinomas, nine (9%) were found to have heavier staining for HER-2/neu than was seen in normal endometrium (3+).
 High expression of HER-2/neu was found in 27% of patients with metastatic disease compared with 4% of patients with disease confined to the uterus (p less than 0.005).
 High HER-2/neu expression also was associated with absence of estrogen receptor (p less than 0.005) and with increased mortality from cancer.
 Further studies are needed to determine the significance of HER-2/neu overexpression in endometrial cancer.
