The development of neutralizing antibodies in a patient receiving subcutaneous recombinant and natural interleukin-2.
 Systemic administration of interleukin-2 (IL-2) in humans may induce antibodies specific to IL-2.
 The case is reported of a patient with metastatic rectal carcinoma who was treated with long-term subcutaneous IL-2 and a combination of subcutaneous IL-2 and interferon-alpha 2b (IFN-alpha 2b).
 This patient developed nonneutralizing and neutralizing anti-IL-2 antibodies recognizing both the recombinant and natural cytokine.
 Detectable serum levels of neutralizing antibodies were accompanied by the inhibition of immune responsiveness to systemic IL-2 in vivo.
