Nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities in primary uveal melanoma.
 We report on 14 cases of clonal chromosomal anomalies in patients with primary uveal melanoma.
 An increased dosage of chromosome 8 or of parts of the long arm of chromosome 8 (8q) were detected in eight patients (57%).
 The smallest multiplied area of 8q appeared to be the region 8q2.1----qter.
 Monosomy of chromosome 3 was seen in six patients (43%), five of which were associated with anomalies of chromosome 8.
 Increased dosage of parts of chromosome 8q and loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 3, or the combination of both, seemed to be nonrandom for uveal melanoma and may distinguish it genetically from cutaneous malignant melanoma.
 Anomalies of chromosome 6, mostly resulting in additional material of 6p or a deletion of 6q, were found in six patients (43%).
 These anomalies, which seem to be common features of cutaneous malignant melanoma, were considered secondary rather than primary changes in uveal melanoma, since they were present only in subclones in most cases.
 Loss of the Y chromosome, restricted to tumor cells, was detected in four male patients, and loss of one X chromosome was detected in a female patient.
