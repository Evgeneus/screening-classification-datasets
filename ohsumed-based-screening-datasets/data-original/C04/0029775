Tracheostomal stenosis after immediate tracheoesophageal puncture.
 The incidence of tracheostomal stenosis in a group of patients after total laryngectomy with or without pharyngectomy plus immediate tracheoesophageal or tracheogastric puncture was compared with that of a control group without puncture.
 The stenosis rate of the puncture group was significantly higher than that of the control group (19% vs 6%).
 The other probable etiologic factors for stomal stricture were similar in both groups.
 Analysis of the risk factors in the puncture group suggested a higher tendency of stenosis in females (43% vs 16%) and in patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy (29% vs 14%), although the difference failed to reach statistical significance.
