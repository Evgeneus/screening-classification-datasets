Different lectin-binding patterns in primary breast cancers and their metastases.
 The expression of glycoconjugates in primary tumors and their metastases in 18 consecutive cases of metastasized breast cancer was studied by use of lectin histochemistry.
 Paraffin sections were stained with a panel of seven fluorochrome-labeled lectins with defined sugar specificities.
 The study revealed variation in the lectin binding patterns of individual cancers.
 In the primary tumors the lectin reactivity was diversified, whereas in their respective metastases it was rather homogeneous.
 This finding indicates that there is intratumoral heterogeneity in the primary cancers, whereas the selected subclones of malignant cells with restricted glycoconjugate expression seem to give rise to metastases.
