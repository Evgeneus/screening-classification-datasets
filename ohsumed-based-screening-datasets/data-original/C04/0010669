Magnetic resonance imaging of facial nerve neuromas.
 Facial nerve neuromas are uncommon tumors often confused with other tumors of the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle.
 Radiologically, it may be impossible to differentiate an intracanalicular facial nerve neuroma from an acoustic neuroma.
 We present three case reports of facial nerve neuromas arising within the internal auditory canal to show the important magnetic resonance imaging features of these tumors.
 One tumor extended into the cerebellopontine angle, middle cranial fossa, and middle ear.
 Another filled the internal auditory canal and extended through the cerebellopontine angle to the brain stem.
 The third occurred in a patient who had neurofibromatosis as well as numerous other intracranial tumors.
 We feel that gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging provides the most useful information in the preoperative assessment of this disorder.
