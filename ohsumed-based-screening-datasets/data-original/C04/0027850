Cytokine-induced enhancement of ICAM-1 expression results in increased vulnerability of tumor cells to monocyte-mediated lysis.
 Pretreatment of the human melanoma cell line, A375, and the human colon carcinoma cell line, HT-29, with certain cytokines was found to increase the vulnerability of these cells to monocyte-mediated killing.
 This activity was found to correlate with increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on the tumor cells and was blocked by anti-ICAM-1 antibodies.
 Both IFN-gamma and TNF induced large increases in the ICAM-1 expression on both cell lines and increased the susceptibility of the tumor cells to monocyte-mediated killing.
 IFN-alpha and IL-1 beta, however, induced only small increases in ICAM-1 expression and enhanced the lysis of the A375 cells but not the HT-29 cells by monocytes.
 These differences may be the result of a higher basal expression of ICAM-1 found on the A375 cells when compared with the HT-29 cells.
 These data indicate that regulation of ICAM-1 expression on tumor cells can alter the vulnerability of these cells to lysis by monocytes.
