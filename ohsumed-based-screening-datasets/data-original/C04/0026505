Biliary bile acid profiles in familial adenomatous polyposis.
 Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis have an excess risk for adenomas and cancers of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.
 In the upper intestine these lesions occur mainly around the ampulla of Vater and they parallel mucosal exposure to bile.
 In view of this finding and of evidence that bile acids play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis, biliary bile acid profiles were determined in 29 patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (12 before colectomy, 17 after colectomy) and in 28 patients without familial adenomatous polyposis (all with colons in situ).
 Patients with familial adenomatous polyposis had a higher total biliary bile acid concentration than the others.
 The bile of patients with polyposis had a greater proportion of chenodeoxycholic acid and a lower proportion of deoxycholic acid than did the bile of patients without polyposis.
 The ratio of chenodeoxycholic acid and its metabolite lithocholic acid to cholic acid and its metabolite deoxycholic acid, which is related to subsequent bile acid profiles in the colon, was higher in patients with polyposis.
 Because bile acids influence cellular proliferation, these findings may be of importance with respect to intestinal adenoma and cancer growth.
