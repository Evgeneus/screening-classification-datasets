Epidermoid tumors of the 4th ventricle: report of seven cases.
 Epidermoid tumors occur very rarely in the 4th ventricle.
 We discuss the history, clinical course, and the surgical results for seven patients.
 One patient had a remittal of symptoms, probably due to the emergence of the tumor from the 4th ventricle into the cisterna magna.
 Total removal of the capsule was possible only in the youngest patient.
 At present, four patients (mean follow-up, 6 years) enjoy good general and neurological health.
