Cranial nerve involvement and base of the skull erosion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
 In a prospective study of 262 consecutive patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), using computed tomography (CT) as their baseline evaluation, erosion of the base of the skull and intracranial extension into the middle cranial fossa were found in 31.3% and 12.2% of patients, respectively.
 Thirty-four of these patients had cranial nerve involvement at presentation; 30 of them had involvement of one or more of the third to sixth cranial nerves.
 Most cases of intracranial extension of tumor were accompanied by erosion of the base of the skull, but the reverse was not true.
 All patients with cranial nerve palsy involving the third to sixth cranial nerves had associated erosion of the ipsilateral base of the skull.
 The CT evaluation of patients with cranial nerve involvement who are believed to harbor NPC should include thin cuts of the base of the skull for detection of subtle bone erosion.
 This may be the only clue to the presence of a small NPC.
 The prognostic significance of cranial nerve involvement, base of the skull erosion, and intracranial extension of the tumor on the survival of the group of 84 patients who had T4 tumors was evaluated with regression analysis using the Cox model.
 Only cranial nerve involvement was found to be a significant factor influencing survival.
