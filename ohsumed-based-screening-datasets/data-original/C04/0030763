An educational device for Mohs micrographic surgery. A three-dimensional model of basal cell carcinoma.
 Mohs micrographic surgery for skin cancer (fresh-tissue technique) involves the processing of tissue in a complex fashion.
 The advantages of this method relate to the asymmetric three-dimensional growth of basal cell carcinoma (BCC).
 A device is described here based on published knowledge about the growth of BCC.
 The model demonstrates the precise way in which Mohs surgery varies from other surgical approaches to yield higher cure rates in specific circumstances.
 This device may be helpful in educating residents and medical students about Mohs surgery and in preparing patients for this procedure.
