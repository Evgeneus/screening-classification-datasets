Metastatic carcinoma of prostate 23 years after radical prostatectomy.
 Carcinoma of the prostate may present with metastatic disease many years after treatment.
 We present a patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, "cured" by radical perineal prostatectomy in 1962, with the first signs of metastases presenting in 1985.
 This emphasizes the importance of long-term follow-up of patients with prostate carcinoma.
