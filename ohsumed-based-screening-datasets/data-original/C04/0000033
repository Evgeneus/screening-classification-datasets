Multiple intracranial mucoceles associated with phaeohyphomycosis of the paranasal sinuses.
 The purpose of this article is to alert clinicians to a new pathogenic fungus of the paranasal sinuses called Exserohilum rostratum.
 Exserohilum species are one of the etiologic agents of phaeohyphomycosis, a constellation of entities caused by dematiaceous fungi.
 This class of fungal sinus infection has emerged only in the past decade; it occurs primarily in immunocompetent individuals and produces a tenacious, progressive pansinusitis.
 To our knowledge, this study describes the first case of multiple intracranial mucoceles secondary to E rostratum.
 The diagnostic workup includes computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging followed by direct microscopic examination of tissue biopsy specimens.
 A craniotomy followed by a bilateral external ethmoidectomy was necessary for complete extirpation of the infected mucoceles.
 Aggressive surgical management of this mycotic infection is described.
