Different metastasis patterns of a human melanoma cell line in nude mice and rats: influence of microenvironment.
 The metastatic capacity of intravenously injected human FEMX-I melanoma cells in athymic nude mice and rats was compared.
 Young rats given 1 x 10(6) ascites tumor cells all died of lung tumors with a life span of 50 +/- 10 days (mean +/- SD).
 In contrast, in accordance with previous findings, only extrapulmonary metastases developed in mice.
 This host-dependent difference in metastasis pattern permitted studies on the role of factors that may influence the organ specificity of metastases.
 The tissue distribution of 125I-labeled FEMX-I cells did not differ in the two nude species during the first 12 hours after cell injection.
 The plating efficiency of FEMX-I cells in soft agar was increased by the addition of conditioned medium prepared from rat lungs, resulting also in a significant increase in colony size.
 In contrast, conditioned medium prepared from mouse lungs reduced the clonogenic capacity of the FEMX-I cells in a dose-dependent manner.
 Conditioned media prepared from rat and mouse liver, kidney, and spleen tissues either inhibited or had no effect on colony formation.
 The results suggest that the unexpected differential metastatic patterns observed in vivo may reflect differences in the presence of growth-modulating paracrine factors in the host lungs.
