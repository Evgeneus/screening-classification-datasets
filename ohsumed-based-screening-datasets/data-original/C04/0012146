Tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma: echocardiographic characterization.
 We report a tricuspid valve papillary fibroelastoma initially detected by transthoracic two-dimensional echocardiography and subsequently characterized by transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography.
 The mass was excised during open heart operation, and the diagnosis was verified grossly and histopathologically.
 Transesophageal echocardiography usually provides images far superior to those from transthoracic echocardiography and may be a useful adjunct for intraoperative localization of intracardiac tumors for excision.
