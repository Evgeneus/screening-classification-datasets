Impact of enucleation for choroidal melanoma on the performance of vision-dependent activities.
 We report a functional outcome assessment of 71 patients who underwent enucleation for choroidal melanoma.
 Each was interviewed to evaluate his her self-reported ability to perform four vision-dependent activities--working, driving, reading, and television viewing--before enucleation and when interviewed.
 The interval between enucleation and the interview varied between 2 and 25 years.
 Eighty-seven percent (62/71) reported no change in their ability to perform these important vision-dependent tasks.
 At 15 years after enucleation, 90% (18/20) retained the ability to drive and 96% (25/26) retained the ability to read.
 These results are reassuring for those with choroidal melanoma who are faced with enucleation, because most of these patients seem likely to continue at a level of visual function comparable with their preenucleation status.
