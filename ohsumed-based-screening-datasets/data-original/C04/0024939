Reconstitution of an active surface CD2 by DNA transfer in CD2-CD3+ Jurkat cells facilitates CD3-T cell receptor-mediated IL-2 production.
 To investigate the requirements for CD2 expression in the activation of T lymphocytes via the CD3-TCR complex, we produced and characterized a series of CD2-variants of the IL-2 producing Jurkat leukemia cell line, J32 (surface phenotype, CD2+, CD3+, CD28+).
 These mutants were derived by radiation and immunoselection, and were cloned under limiting dilution conditions.
 A total of 3 out of 30 of these mutants selectively lost the expression of both CD2 surface molecules and CD2 mRNA, and retained the expression of the CD3-TCR complex and the CD28 molecule.
 A mitogenic combination of anti-CD2 antibodies (9.6 + 9-1) failed to stimulate activation of these variants as measured by mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ and by IL-2 production.
 The CD2- mutants stimulated with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR mAb revealed an 8- to 32-fold decrease in IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation as compared with the parental cells.
 No alteration of CD3-TCR-induced mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ was observed in the CD2- mutants.
 Reconstitution of CD2 expression by gene transfer in two J32 CD2- mutants restored IL-2 production and IL-2 mRNA accumulation in responses to both anti-CD2 and anti-CD3-TCR mAb.
 These results are the first direct demonstration of the requirement for CD2 molecules in optimizing IL-2 response in human T cells stimulated via CD3-TCR complex.
