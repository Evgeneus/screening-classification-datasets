Malignant hepatic tumors: P-31 MR spectroscopy with one-dimensional chemical shift imaging.
 To determine the clinical feasibility and applicability of phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy and to assess its potential for characterization of human hepatic tissue, one-dimensional chemical shift imaging (CSI) was performed in 37 patients with various malignant hepatic neoplasms (30 metastases from a variety of primary tumors and seven hepatocellular carcinomas) and seven healthy volunteers.
 Tumors were grouped according to the percentage of the analyzed section that was occupied by tumor: less than 50% (group A) or more than 50% (group B).
 In group B, all phosphomonoester/beta-adenosine triphosphate ratios were significantly higher than normal (P less than .001).
 Hepatocellular carcinomas and metastases from various primary neoplasms could not be differentiated on the basis of spectral characteristics and metabolite ratios.
 Limitations of one-dimensional surface coil CSI prevented separation of spectra of small tumors and tumors deep within the liver parenchyma from spectra of normal liver parenchyma.
