Isolated calcaneal metastasis in a patient with endometrial adenocarcinoma.
 A 55-year-old woman with a history of Stage IA endometrial adenocarcinoma, previously treated with surgery and intracavitary radiation therapy, had an isolated calcaneal metastasis.
 Normal radiographs led to a delay in the diagnosis of her relapse.
 An ankle computed tomographic scan finally identified a mass, and the surgical biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis.
 This is the first reported case of an isolated calcaneal metastasis in endometrial adenocarcinoma to the authors' knowledge.
