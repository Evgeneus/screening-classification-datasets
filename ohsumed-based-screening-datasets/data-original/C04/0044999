Receptors for tumor necrosis factor on neoplastic B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia are expressed in vitro but not in vivo.
 Recombinant tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is a cytokine that induces proliferation of neoplastic B cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
 To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in regulating TNF responsiveness, we have examined TNF receptor expression on neoplastic B-CLL cells.
 We have demonstrated that freshly isolated neoplastic B cells from patients with CLL did not express TNF receptors.
 After 1 day of incubation in culture medium, TNF receptors were detectable in the range of 540 to 1,500/cell.
 Kinetic experiments revealed that receptor expression was half-maximal after 3 hours of culturing and required de novo protein synthesis.
 The Scatchard plots of TNF-alpha binding indicated a single set of high-affinity TNF receptors with a dissociation constant of 70 pmol/L.
 TNF receptor expression in vitro was found in all examined cases.
 All cytokines tested, with the exception of IL-2, did not influence the expression of TNF receptors.
 The TNF receptor expression is enhanced in B-CLL cells cultured in the presence of interleukin-2 when compared with the receptor expression of cells cultured in medium alone.
 Our data suggest that neoplastic B-CLL cells in patients with stable disease do not express TNF receptors in vivo and that an unknown mechanism suppressing TNF receptor expression in vivo may play a role in growth regulation of neoplastic B cells.
