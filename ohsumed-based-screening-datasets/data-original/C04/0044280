Cutaneous metastasis from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland.
 Cutaneous metastases from carcinoma of the thyroid gland are rare.
 We present the clinical, histologic, and immunohistochemical features of a solitary metastasis from papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.
 Our results indicate that this tumor can produce epithelial mucin and, therefore, must be differentiated from other metastatic carcinomas and from primary apocrine tumors of the skin.
 Positive staining for thyroglobulin confirmed the diagnosis in this case.
