Invasive squamous cell carcinoma in a patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis.
 A patient with epidermodysplasia verruciformis died of intracranial invasion by squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
 A biopsy of clinically normal skin had revealed perineural invasion by malignant keratinocytes.
 Because SCCs arising in patients with epidermodysplasia verruciformis may be biologically aggressive, it is best to excise them with careful control of the surgical tissue margins.
