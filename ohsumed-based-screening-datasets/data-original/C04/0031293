Immunohistochemical studies of blood group-related antigens in human superficial esophageal carcinomas.
 A total of 63 surgically resected esophageal carcinomas (including 49 superficial esophageal carcinomas) and histologically normal tissue adjacent to the superficial carcinoma (nontumorous epithelium) were examined immunohistochemically for the blood group antigens (BGA) A, B, H, Lewisa, Lewisb, Lewisx, and Lewisy.
 Deletion of an expected A, B or H antigen occurred in 12 (24.5%) of the 49 superficial carcinomas and three (21.4%) of the 14 advanced carcinomas.
 Incompatible expression of an unexpected A or B antigens occurred in only one case (1.6%) in the carcinoma.
 In the clinicopathologic study, there was a significant correlation between immunoreactivity of Lewisa and depth of cancer invasion (chi-square test, P less than 0.05).
 In the superficial carcinoma, there were significant correlations between immunoreactivity of Lewisx and lymph node status (chi-square test, P less than 0.05), immunoreactivity of Lewisy and prognosis (Z test, P less than 0.05), and incompatible expression of Lewisb for tumor against nontumorous epithelium and histologic variation (chi-square test, P less than 0.01).
 The functional significance of alternations in BGA expression that may be associated with oncogenesis is not clear.
 However, immunohistochemical determination of BGA may be a more advantageous marker to predict the patient's clinical course in superficial esophageal carcinoma.
