A modified technique for obliteration of large bony defects after cystectomy.
 Thirteen cysts treated by enucleation followed by collapsing an osteoperiosteal flap to eliminate dead space are presented.
 Four of the cysts were dentigerous and nine were radicular.
 The bony defects ranged in size from 3 to 7 cm in greatest dimension.
 Healing by primary intention occurred in all cases.
 This method has been found to be successful in the obliteration of large bony defects after cystectomy.
