Induction of delayed hypersensitivity to human tumor cells with a human monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody.
 There is considerable interest in the development of anti-idiotypic antibodies as vaccines in a number of diseases, including cancer.
 We have developed a human anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (105AD7) which binds at or very near to the binding site of mouse antitumor monoclonal antibody 791T/36.
 The 791T/36 antibody binds to a tumor-associated antigen (gp72) expressed on a number of human tumors, including colorectal and ovarian carcinomas and osteogenic sarcoma.
 This study shows that, in rats and mice, 105AD7 induces delayed-type hypersensitivity to human tumor cells bearing the gp72 antigen.
 Local transfer of delayed hypersensitivity was also demonstrated using lymphocytes from mice primed with 105AD7.
 These findings show that the human monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibody 105AD7 is likely to induce cellular immune responses to tumors in cancer patients.
