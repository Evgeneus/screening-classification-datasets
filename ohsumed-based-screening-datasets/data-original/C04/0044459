Pararectus retroperitoneal radical nephrectomy.
 We describe a new pararectus retroperitoneal approach to the kidney, which allows easy identification and occlusion of the renal vessels before mobilization of the kidney.
 This approach potentially reduces morbidity, hospital stay and cost.
 The technique has been used in 4 cases of radical nephrectomy for tumor and in 1 for pyonephrosis.
