Secondary erythrocytosis due to a cerebellar hemangioblastoma: demonstration of erythropoietin mRNA in the tumor.
 Cerebellar hemangioblastoma is a rare cause of secondary erythrocytosis.
 Although the erythrocytosis is a result of erythropoietin (Ep) stimulation, direct evidence of Ep synthesis by the tumor has been lacking.
 In an erythrocytotic patient with a cerebellar hemangioblastoma we found elevated levels of Ep in the tumor cyst fluid and for the first time demonstrated Ep mRNA in the tumor by Northern blotting.
 This finding confirms cerebellar hemangioblastoma as a site of ectopic Ep production.
