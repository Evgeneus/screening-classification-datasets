Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with t(4;11) translocation after osteogenic sarcoma.
 The authors report a case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(4;11) (q21;q23) occurring 9 months after treatment of osteogenic sarcoma.
 Cell surface marker and molecular analyses suggest early B lineage involvement.
 This is the first report, to the knowledge of the authors, of t(4;11) ALL arising after an osteogenic sarcoma.
 The observations of the authors support the possibility of a causal relationship between exposure to carcinogens and the occurrence of leukemia with t(4;11).
