Pheochromocytoma with pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs: a paraneoplastic syndrome with possible relation to interleukin-6 production.
 Pheochromocytoma can cause several paraneoplastic syndromes.
 We report a patient with pheochromocytoma who exhibited pyrexia and marked inflammatory signs along with an elevated serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level.
 All of these abnormalities disappeared and serum IL-6 became undetectable by removal of the tumor.
 In addition, immunohistochemical analysis revealed the presence of IL-6 in the tumor cells.
 It is suggested that pyrexia and the elevation of acute phase proteins can be a paraneoplastic syndrome with pheochromocytoma, and that the elaboration of IL-6 from pheochromocytoma may play an important role in the development of the syndrome.
