Interleukin-2 immunotherapy followed by resection of residual renal cell carcinoma.
 We administered 10 (E5) units per kg.
 interleukin-2, 3 times daily, with or without lymphokine-activated killer cells, to 10 patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
 All patients had metastases to the lung, and 3 of 5 patients who had previously undergone nephrectomy had metastases to the renal fossa.
 Of the 9 patients who completed at least 1 course of therapy 3 had complete regression of disease outside the abdomen, including 2 who were rendered disease-free after subsequent cytoreductive surgery (nephrectomy in 1 and resection of the renal fossa recurrence in 1).
 Viable tumor comprised less than 1% of each surgical specimen.
 Our results support the view that initial treatment with interleukin-2 immunotherapy, followed by abdominal cytoreductive surgery if the peripheral metastases have regressed, may be preferable to the practice of performing abdominal cytoreductive surgery before administering interleukin-2 immunotherapy for patients with widely metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
