Primary intratemporal tumours of the facial nerve: diagnosis and treatment.
 Benign primary tumours of the facial nerve are uncommon.
 A slowly progressive facial palsy should be considered the result of a nerve tumour until proven otherwise.
 Improvements in diagnostic imaging techniques of the temporal bone have increased the possibility of a correct pre-operative diagnosis but facial nerve tumours remain a frequently ignored or misdiagnosed entity as a consequence of their subtle and protean clinical manifestations.
 A series of 12 cases of primary facial nerve tumours is presented.
 The clinical features, diagnostic modalities and treatment are discussed in relation to a review of the literature.
