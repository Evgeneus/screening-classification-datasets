Myxoma of the external auditory meatus.
 A case of myxoma of the external auditory meatus is described.
 The patient presented with a recurring tumour which had not been correctly diagnosed although the growth had been removed ten times over a period of two years.
 The tumour was skin covered, contained gelatinous material and was attached to the tympanic membrane and anterior canal wall.
 Following recognition of the tumour as myxoma, removal was performed with sufficiently wide margins and there has been no recurrence during follow-up for one year.
