Fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal adenomas.
 An association between fecal carriage of Streptococcus bovis and colorectal carcinoma has been reported.
 A relationship between S.
 bovis and colorectal adenomas has also been suggested.
 In the present study, the relationship between S.
 bovis and adenomas was investigated.
 Two of 18 current adenoma patients (11%) were found to have S.
 bovis in their stool compared with 12 of 84 controls (14%).
 Six of 38 patients who had ever had a diagnosis of adenoma (16%) had S.
 bovis compared with 8 of 64 controls (13%).
 These results rule out a strong association between fecal carriage of S.
 bovis and adenomas; however, because of the relatively small sample size, a weak to moderate association cannot be excluded.
