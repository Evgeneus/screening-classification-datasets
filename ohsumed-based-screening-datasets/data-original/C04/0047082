Breast sonography.
 Sonographic equipment for breast imaging has continued to improve, and the role of breast sonography has evolved to that of an indispensable adjunct to mammography.
 Breast sonography is not useful for screening for breast cancer in any age group.
 Its main use is for the differentiation of cystic vs solid palpable and mammographically visible masses.
 If strict sonographic criteria are used for a simple cyst, the diagnostic accuracy approaches 100%.
 Sonographic diagnosis of a simple cyst precludes the need for further workup, including aspiration, biopsy, or followup.
 This article emphasizes the technical aspects of breast sonography, especially those factors that alter the diagnostic information on the images.
 These factors can be especially problematic in differentiating cysts and solid masses, the most common diagnostic use of breast sonography.
 Selection of equipment depends largely on the requirements of a specific practice.
 Optimally, the sonographic equipment is located close to where mammography is performed, and the sonographic and mammographic findings are interpreted together.
