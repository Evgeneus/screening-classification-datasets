The treatment of atypical lipoma with liposuction.
 Large lipomas may best be treated with liposuction.
 Once a lipoma enlarges to 4 cm or more, liposuction has several advantages over conventional surgery.
 A well-demarcated lipoma 15 cm in diameter and deep to muscle was treated by liposuction.
 Biopsy showed an atypical lipoma.
 Because the entire tumor was removed by liposuction, we feel that the prognosis is excellent.
 The cosmesis and morbidity results were far superior to those anticipated with conventional excisional surgery.
 Small superficial lipomas may be treated by suction lipectomy and the surrounding area can be contoured symmetrically at the same time, whereas large ones can be liposuctioned completely without extensive surgical extirpation and morbidity.
 Because such big lesions may represent atypical lipomas or liposarcomas, care must be taken to remove the entire tumor.
