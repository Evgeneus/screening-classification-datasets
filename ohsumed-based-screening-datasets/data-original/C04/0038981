Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography in the diagnosis and surgical management of right atrial myxoma.
 An asymptomatic patient was discovered to have a large right atrial myxoma by transthoracic echocardiography.
 Preoperative considerations included the possibility of satellite lesions, left atrial origin, and a question of tricuspid valve involvement.
 Subsequent operative transesophageal echocardiography demonstrated single-stalk attachment in the right atrial septal wall and no satellite lesions.
 Doppler and color flow examination immediately following tumor removal aided in the decision not to perform tricuspid annuloplasty as there was no significant tricuspid regurgitation.
 The combined use of transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography with Doppler and color flow imaging aids in the preoperative and intraoperative diagnosis and surgical management of right atrial tumors.
