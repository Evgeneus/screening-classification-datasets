Synchronous Hodgkin's disease and myelofibrosis terminating with granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia.
 Our patient had stage IIIAI Hodgkin's disease with synchronous myelofibrosis and myeloid metaplasia.
 A slowly progressive myeloproliferative disease developed over 9 1/2 years and terminated in a painful osteolytic bone disease, spinal extradural granulocytic sarcoma and acute megakaryocytic leukemia.
 It is likely that this was a result of the myeloproliferative disease rather than a late complication from combination chemotherapy.
 Our case demonstrates the importance of a curative approach to Hodgkin's disease even in the face of a coexistent disease with a long or unknown natural history.
