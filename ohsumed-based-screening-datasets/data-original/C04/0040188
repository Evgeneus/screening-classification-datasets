Extramedullary hematopoiesis in cerebellar hemangioblastoma.
 Extramedullary hematopoiesis and paraneoplastic erythrocytosis are uncommon in cerebellar hemangioblastoma, and their concomitant occurrence has not been reported.
 In a study of 26 cases of hemangioblastoma, we found extramedullary hematopoiesis in 4 tumors; one was associated with erythrocytosis.
 The significance of this association and the possible histogenetic origin of extramedullary hematopoiesis in cerebellar hemangioblastoma are discussed.
