Characterization of fibronectin attachment by a human transitional cell carcinoma line, T24.
 The ability of transitional cell carcinoma cells to adhere to and invade the extracellular matrix is important in invasion and metastasis.
 The glycoprotein fibronectin is associated with laminin and Type IV collagen in the bladder basement membrane.
 We characterized the interaction between T-24 cells, a cell line derived from an invasive transitional cell tumor, and fibronectin.
 The cells use the alpha 5 beta 1 heterodimeric integrin receptor complex to mediate adherence via the classical (RGDS) fibronectin binding site.
 The importance of the alpha 5 beta 1 receptor to T-24 function is unknown and under investigation.
