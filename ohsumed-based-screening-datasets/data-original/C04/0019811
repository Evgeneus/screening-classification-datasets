Gleason's histologic grading as clinical prognostic marker in patients with advanced prostatic carcinoma.
 We have found that the Gleason's histologic grading system is a good clinical marker to predict long-term response and prognosis in symptomatic Stage D-2 adenocarcinoma of the prostate.
 In this retrospective study, 56 cases were reviewed and correlated with bone scan, acid phosphatase, and symptomatology following bilateral orchiectomy.
