Argon laser therapy for perianal Bowen's disease: a case report.
 Bowen's disease (intraepithelial squamous cell carcinoma) may occasionally occur in anal canal or perianal region.
 Surgical excision in this area may result in significant complications and a recurrence rate of 9-19%.
 A case of successful treatment of anal and perianal Bowen's disease using argon laser therapy is presented.
 No acute or chronic complications resulted from laser therapy.
 Twenty-eight months after the initial diagnosis the patient is disease free.
 Laser therapy also provides the potential for repeated treatment of recurrent lesions without significant patient discomfort or inconvenience.
 Argon laser therapy should be considered as a therapeutic option in the treatment of Bowen's disease.
