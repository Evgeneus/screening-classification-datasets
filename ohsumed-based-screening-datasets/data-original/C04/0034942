Adenocarcinoma: an unusual presentation.
 A young pregnant woman had facial swelling in the upper nasal region.
 This was initially considered to be lymphedema in view of a history of past severe facial acne.
 A biopsy was done when the lesion progressed; the specimen showed adenocarcinoma.
 This responded well to radiotherapy, the favorable response being maintained for more than 24 months.
