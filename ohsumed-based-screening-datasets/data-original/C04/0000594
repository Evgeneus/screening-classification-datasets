Resolution of inferior vena cava syndrome after embolization of a hepatic adenoma.
 A 77-year-old man presented with severe pruritus and massive lower body edema.
 Computerized axial tomography of the abdomen showed a large hepatic mass compressing the inferior vena cava, and a liver biopsy specimen showed hepatic adenoma.
 Embolization of vessels feeding the hepatic tumor resulted in complete resolution of pruritus and ascites, and clinical remission has persisted for 1 year following partial obliteration of tumor vasculature.
 Angiographic ablation of tumor blood supply represents a nonoperative means for inducing clinical remission in patients with symptomatic hepatic adenoma who are at high surgical risk.
