Insulin-like growth factor-I receptors in nonfunctioning thyroid nodules.
 We have recently demonstrated the production of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) as well as the presence of type I IGF receptors in human thyroid cells in primary culture.
 The role of IGF-I in the control of thyroid cell growth has been well established.
 In order to investigate the involvement of IGF-I in abnormal thyroid growth, the density of IGF-I receptors in solitary, cold, micro- and macro-follicular thyroid adenomas, and in extranodular histological normal tissue was studied.
 Forty-three euthyroid patients with isolated cold nodules were selected for the study.
 In 30 patients the presence of IGF-I receptors was evaluated by using quantitative immunohistochemistry; in 10 patients by using radioligand binding studies, and in 3 patients by using affinity labeling.
 Cross-linking and binding studies clearly demonstrated the presence of a homogeneous class of binding sites for type I IGF receptors.
 Furthermore, radioligand studies did not show any significant differences in receptor density between the 2 types of thyroidal tissues.
 Conversely, the computerized analysis of 900 fields of nodular and normal thyroid tissues immunostained with the monoclonal antibody alpha-IR3, strongly indicated that higher concentrations of IGF-I receptors were present in the epithelial cells of non-functioning thyroid nodules than in the adjacent extranodular thyroid tissues.
 These studies strongly suggest that the same type I IGF receptor is present in thyroid follicular adenomas as in histological normal thyroid tissue removed from the same patient.
 The higher concentration of IGF-I receptors as documented by immunostaining in the adenomas suggests that IGF-I may contribute to the abnormal growth of the neoplasms.
