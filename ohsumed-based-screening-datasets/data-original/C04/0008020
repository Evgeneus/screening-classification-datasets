Screening colonoscopy in asymptomatic average-risk persons with negative fecal occult blood tests.
 Colonoscopy was performed on 210 asymptomatic average-risk persons, aged 50-75 years, who had negative fecal occult blood test results.
 Colonoscopy was complete to the cecum in 209 subjects.
 Fifty-three subjects (25%) had adenomas and two had cancer.
 All of the adenomas greater than or equal to 1 cm in size and both cancers occurred in subjects aged greater than or equal to 60 years.
 Fifty-one percent of subjects with adenomas and one with cancer had no neoplasms distal to the sigmoid-descending colon junction.
 One subject had a major postpolypectomy hemorrhage that stopped spontaneously.
 Screening colonoscopy, therefore, has a high yield for detection of neoplasms in asymptomatic average-risk persons aged greater than or equal to 60 years with negative fecal occult blood test results.
 The yield is low in persons aged 50-54 years and intermediate in persons aged 55-59 years.
