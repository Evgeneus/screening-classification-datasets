Radiation therapy of laryngeal cancer: a twenty year experience.
 This paper reviews a 20 year experience of radiation treatment of 286 laryngeal cancers and presents results with a minimum five year follow-up.
 All cases presented had glottic or supraglottic squamous cell carcinomas with no clinical evidence of nodal metastasis.
 A policy of primary radiotherapy with surgery for salvage of treatment failures, produced control of primary disease and prevention of metastases superior to most other regimes documented in the literature.
