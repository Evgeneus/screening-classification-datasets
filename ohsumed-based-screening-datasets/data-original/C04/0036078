Comparison of long-term survival of 1986 consecutive patients with breast cancer treated at the National Cancer Institute of Milano, Italy (1971 to 1972 and 1977 to 1978).
 Long-term survival of 1986 consecutive patients with infiltrating duct carcinoma of the breast treated at the National Cancer Institute of Milano (Italy) in two periods of time (1971 to 1972 and 1977 to 1978) was comparatively evaluated to verify if the evolving concepts in the management of breast cancer had an impact on survival.
 The authors found that 10-year survival of our patients increased from 59.4% of the first period of time to 65% of the second (P = 0.005).
 Both node-negative (N-) and node-positive (N+) patients had an improvement of survival rates at 10 years of the same magnitude: 6.8% and 5.9% respectively.
 Taking into consideration both the maximum diameter of the primary tumor and the status of axillary nodes it was found that in (1) both N- and N+ patients with a primary tumor of no more than 2 cm in greatest diameter, the improvement of survival was not statistically significant; and (2) both N- and N+ patients with a primary greater than 2 cm in maximum diameter had a better chance of survival in the second time period.
