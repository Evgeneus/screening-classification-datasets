Scanning electron microscopic study of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
 The study has been carried out on biopsies taken from four patients affected by squamous cell carcinoma and four patients affected by undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT).
 Three healthy volunteers have served as controls.
 All the specimens have been studied by SEM.
 The neoplastic conditions cause obvious alterations both in the mucosal surface and in the morphology of the cellular apex.
