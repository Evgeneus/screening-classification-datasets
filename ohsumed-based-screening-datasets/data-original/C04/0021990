Partial laryngectomy after irradiation failure.
 Forty-three patients who had partial laryngectomies after radiotherapy were evaluated.
 Forty-two had failed irradiation for laryngeal carcinoma.
 Nine had supraglottic procedures, 3 endoscopic, and 31 vertical partial.
 Twelve (28%) required subsequent completion laryngectomy.
 Major complications included laryngeal stenosis in 1, incompetent laryngeal sphincters in 2, mucocutaneous fistulas in 3, and delayed deglutition in 3.
 Six patients had positive permanent section margins.
 In 5 of those, intraoperative frozen sections had been taken and were negative.
 Recurrent or persistent disease was eventually demonstrated in all patients with positive margins.
 The 2-year determinant disease-free survival rate for stage I and II disease was 85%.
 Three-year disease-free survival was 50% for stage III and IV disease.
 Partial laryngectomies, including supraglottic, can be done after irradiation failure with a high expectation of cure and acceptable morbidity.
 Immediate additional operation should be considered in patients with positive margins.
