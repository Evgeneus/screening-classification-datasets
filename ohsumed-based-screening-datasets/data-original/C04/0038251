Adrenal pheochromocytoma presenting with persistent abdominal and flank pain.
 Pheochromocytoma is classically associated with paroxysms of headache and hypertension.
 Its presentation, however, may be more varied and subtle.
 We present a case of an adolescent female who complained of right upper quadrant and flank pain.
 A right adrenal pheochromocytoma was diagnosed and subsequently removed.
 The pertinent literature is discussed.
