Amplification by the polymerase chain reaction of hypervariable regions of the human genome for evaluation of chimerism after bone marrow transplantation.
 We combined the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with oligonucleotide hybridization as a novel and sensitive technique to evaluate posttransplant chimerism.
 Specific oligonucleotides for hybridization were synthesized homologous to tandemly repetitive core sequences of regions with a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs).
 Polymorphisms at such loci result from allelic differences in the number of repeats.
 Primers flanking the repeat region of each of the corresponding VNTRs were used for amplification.
 Recipient and donor pretransplant DNA and recipient posttransplant DNA were amplified.
 The resultant fragments were analyzed after gel electrophoresis either by hybridization in-gel or after Southern transfer.
 To confirm our findings, we also performed standard assays of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs).
 Evaluation of 13 selected cases indicated mixed chimerism (4), complete chimerism (5), recurrence of leukemia (2), and endogenous repopulation of hematopoiesis (2) after marrow transplantation.
 Sensitivity of the method was determined by mixing various proportions of recipient and donor DNA; the limit of detection of the minor component in a mixture was 0.1%.
 PCR data correlated with RFLP data in all cases except two in which PCR proved more sensitive than RFLP.
 PCR amplification of VNTRs combined with oligonucleotide hybridization is a novel technique for documenting posttransplant chimerism and has advantages over RFLP analysis: high sensitivity, use of small amounts of DNA (250 ng), ease of preparation of DNA, elimination of need for restriction enzymes, and the ability to complete studies in 2 days.
