Reviewing the unicystic ameloblastoma: report of two cases.
 Classification of ameloblastoma into solid, multicystic, unicystic, and peripheral types based on clinical appearance and effects has gained recent recognition.

 It is almost exclusively encountered asymptomatically in the posterior mandible.
 The following report of two cases discusses the pathophysiology, demographics, histology, and prognosis of the unicystic ameloblastoma.
