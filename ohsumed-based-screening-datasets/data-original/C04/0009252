When is polypectomy sufficient treatment for colorectal cancer in a polyp?
 Eighty-seven patients with a carcinoma in a polyp were reviewed over a 12-year period.
 Ten histologic criteria were analyzed for an association with the presence of residual carcinoma.
 Four factors were identified as having prognostic value: size greater than 1.5 cm, sessility, cancer of at least 50% of the adenoma volume, and invasive carcinoma.
 Polypectomy alone is adequate treatment unless the carcinoma invades deeper to the muscularis mucosa and is associated with one or more of these characteristics.
