Relationship between acute myelomonoblastic leukemia and infection due to human immunodeficiency virus.
 Infection due to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been complicated by the development of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia in five patients whose cases have previously been reported; other manifestations, including preleukemia, myelofibrosis, and myeloid hyperplasia, have also been reported in patients infected with HIV.
 We report the sixth case of an HIV-infected patient who developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia; HIV infection was documented by tests for serum antibodies (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting), by a markedly elevated p24 antigen level in plasma, and by cultures of CSF and peripheral blood that were positive for HIV.
 Furthermore, myelomonoblasts that were cultured without the addition of growth factors displayed evidence of HIV replication through the presence of p24 antigen and reverse transcriptase activity, both of which lasted for 4 weeks in the supernatant fluid of the cell cultures.
 This case report provides the first data indicating that HIV may infect myelomonoblasts in vivo and represents the sixth reported case of an association between HIV infection and pure acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
