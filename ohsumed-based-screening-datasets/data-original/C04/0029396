Decreased adherence of interleukin 6-treated breast carcinoma cells can lead to separation from neighbors after mitosis.
 Interleukin 6 (IL-6) has been shown to inhibit the proliferation, but increase the motility, of wild-type ZR-75-1 human ductal breast carcinoma cells, a line of cells that resemble closely the malignant cells cultured from the ascitic effusion.
 IL-6-treated cells lose their epithelial character, become stellate or fusiform in shape, and migrate away from neighbors.
 In the wild-type ZR-75-1 cells, IL-6 causes cell-cell separation in preformed colonies as well as postmitotically.
 We have now investigated the action of IL-6 in clone B ZR-75-1 cells, which are morphologically distinct from wild-type ZR-75-1 cells.
 In the more polygonal rather than cuboidal clone B cells, IL-6 did not cause early inhibition of DNA synthesis and it caused little cell-cell separation in preformed colonies.
 However, IL-6 treatment markedly prolonged the interval between mitosis and readherence of daughter cells to their neighbors and the substratum.
 Supernatants from IL-6-treated cultures contained detached viable cells in increased numbers.
 Intermitotic intervals were prolonged in IL-6-treated cultures.
 IL-6-treated dividing breast carcinoma cells are characterized by an increased probability of separation from neighbors and the substratum.
