Tumor necrosis factor-beta in the serum of adult T-cell leukemia with hypercalcemia.
 Serum tumor necrosis factor-beta (TNF-beta) from patients with adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) was studied by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) developed in our laboratory using biotinylated monoclonal anti-TNF-beta and recombinant TNF-beta.
 Seven of eight patients with hypercalcemia showed elevation of serum TNF-beta.
 On the other hand, TNF-beta could not be detected by the ELISA in 28 patients without hypercalcemia.
 The lower detection limit in this assay was 100 pg/mL, corresponding to 500 pg/mL by the conventional method.
 In two patients serum TNF-beta level decreased after treatment in association with the level of serum calcium.
 Furthermore, immuno-staining using anti-TNF-beta and avidin-biotin complex showed the presence of cytoplasmic TNF-beta in not only human T-cell leukemia virus type I infected cell lines, but also freshly isolated cells from ATL patients with hypercalcemia.
 The actual biologic activity of TNF-beta in serum was confirmed by a conventional bioassay in a patient with hypercalcemia, and its cytotoxic activity was inhibited by the addition of anti-TNF-beta antibody in the assay.
 These results suggested that serum TNF-beta might be one of the factors contributing to the hypercalcemia, at least in patients with ATL.
