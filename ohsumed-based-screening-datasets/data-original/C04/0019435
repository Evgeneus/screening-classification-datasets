Phase II trial of piritrexim in metastatic melanoma using intermittent, low-dose administration.
 A phase II trial of piritrexim (2,4-diamino-6[2,5-dimethoxybenzyl]-5-methyl pyrido-[2,3d] pyrimidine, 301U74; PTX) was conducted for patients with metastatic malignant melanoma using an intermittent, low-dose oral administration schedule.
 PTX was administered at a starting dose of 25 mg orally three times per day for 5 days weekly for 3 weeks followed by 1 week of rest.
 Thirty-one patients were entered onto the study.
 Among 31 patients assessable for response, there were two complete responses (CRs) and five partial responses (PRs) for a response rate (CR plus PR) of 23% (95% confidence limit, 10% to 42%).
 Five responses occurred in soft tissue lesions, and two responses occurred in lung lesions.
 The initial dose schedule was well tolerated.
 The dose-limiting toxicity was myelosuppression.
 PTX administered in this schedule appears to be active against malignant melanoma.
 Further clinical trials to confirm these results are underway.
