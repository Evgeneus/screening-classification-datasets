Blood transfusion and survival after laryngectomy for laryngeal carcinoma.
 Survival of patients with surgically treated malignancy may be adversely affected by blood transfusion.
 Immune suppression due to transfusion has been implicated but remains unproven.
 We conducted a study of 240 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx undergoing laryngectomy to assess the effect of per-operative blood transfusion on survival.
