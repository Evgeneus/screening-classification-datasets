Iridium-192 brachytherapy in the treatment of cancer of the prostate.
 Aggressive radiotherapy was used in 170 patients with advanced localized carcinoma of the prostate.
 After pelvic lymphadenectomy, 192Ir brachytherapy was used to deliver 3500 cGy to the prostate within 2 days.
 External-beam therapy (4500 cGy) was then given to a total of 8000 cGy.
 Random biopsies 18 months afterward were negative for residual cancer in 62 of 83 patients (75%), and 37 of 45 patients (82%) with pathologically proved localized disease remain without evidence of disease.
 Morbidity was significantly reduced in the most recent 70 patients by improvements in technique.
 The authors believe such therapy should be considered for patients with advanced stage B2 or C disease in particular.
