Predominant T cell receptor V gene usage in patients with abnormal clones of B cells.
 We have examined alpha/beta V gene segment usage of peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively, from patients with multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, by using T cell receptor (TCR) for antigen monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs).
 In 7 of 16 patients we found an increase in the usage of various TCR V gene segments.
 The expansion was confined to either the CD4+ or the CD8+ T-cell subset, except for one patient where an abnormal pattern was observed both within the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets.
 In one patient 47%, and in another patient 30% of the CD8+ lymphocytes reacted with alpha V12.1 and beta V6.7 antibodies, respectively.
 In two other patients 29% and 40% of the CD4+ lymphocytes reacted with beta V6.7 and beta V8.1 antibodies, respectively.
 We conclude that T cells with a predominant V gene usage is a frequent feature in patients with abnormal clonal B cells of malignant or benign types.
 T- and B-cell populations are normally clonally linked in regulatory circuits.
 An abnormal proliferation of B cells might therefore induce, or be regulated by, an expansion of clonal T cells, as suggested by the present results.
