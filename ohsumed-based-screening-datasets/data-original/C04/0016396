Repetitive conservative surgery for recurrence of endometriosis.
 We evaluated the recovery of fertility and the relief of pain symptoms in a long-term follow-up of 42 women undergoing repetitive conservative surgery for recurrent endometriosis.
 The mean age of the patients was 31.1 +/- 4.3 years.
 At the time of their second operation the disease was stage IV in 14 women, stage III in 25, and stage I in three.
 After reoperation, the patients were followed for a mean period of 41.8 +/- 30.3 months.
 Pain symptoms returned in eight women, dysmenorrhea and deep dyspareunia in eight, and pelvic pain in seven.
 Eight of the 28 women (28.6%) who attempted to conceive achieved a total of 13 pregnancies.
 The corrected pregnancy rate was 35%, and the cumulative rate at 27 months was 30.7%.
 A third operation was necessary in six women after a mean period of 35 months.
 Conservative surgery is an effective therapeutic option for infertile patients with recurrent endometriosis.
