Screening in ovarian cancer.
 Ovarian cancer will affect 20,000 American women this year and some 13,500 will die of the disease.
 Most patients will have stage III or IV disease at the time of diagnosis.
 Because ovarian cancer may be initially without symptoms, attempts have been made to develop screening tests that would lead to an early diagnosis.
 Two tests, serum CA 125 and pelvic ultrasonography, have been suggested by some to be accurate enough to be included in yearly screening for ovarian cancer.
 Although further testing of these techniques is encouraged, data to date do not justify yearly screening with CA 125 or pelvic ultrasonography in all women.
