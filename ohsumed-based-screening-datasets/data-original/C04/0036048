Results of treatment with high intensity, brief duration chemotherapy in poor prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 A novel chemotherapeutic approach was designed for the treatment of intermediate and high-grade histology non-Hodgkin's lymphoma using augmented (but subtransplantation) doses of chemotherapy administered at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting.
 For the initial evaluation of this regimen, poor prognosis patients were treated with a projected long-term survival rate of less than 25% in response to standard therapy.
 Between March 1982 and May 1988, 56 previously untreated patients were entered into this study; all patients had either high-grade histology (20 patients) or predominantly large cell lymphoma (36 patients).
 Median age was 41.5 years (range, 18 to 69 years).
 Poor prognosis features included: Stage IV, 71%; poor performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scale, 2 to 4), 55%; multiple extranodal sites of disease, 52%; elevated lactic dehydrogenase (greater than 300 IU/l), 43%; and bulky (greater than 10 cm) tumor masses, 30%.
 Thirty-three of 56 patients (59%) were in Shipp's Category 3.
 During the 6-year study, the chemotherapy regimen was modified in an attempt to improve efficacy and reduce toxicity.
 However, most patients received a 2-month course of therapy as follows: cyclophosphamide 1500 mg/m2 intravenously (IV) on days 1, 2, and 29; etoposide 400 mg/m2 IV on days 1, 2, and 3 and 100 mg/m2 on days 29, 30, 31; doxorubicin 45 mg/m2 IV on days 29, 30; vincristine 1.4 mg/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; bleomycin 10 units/m2 IV on days 8, 22, 36, and 50; methotrexate 200 mg/m2 IV on days 15 and 43 followed 24 hours later by leucovorin 15 mg/m2 IV every 6 hours for six doses; and prednisone 60 mg/m2 orally on days 1 to 7 and 29 to 35.
 The complete response (CR) rate was 77% (95% confidence interval, 64% to 86%).
 There were ten relapses, only one of which occurred after 18 months of follow-up.
 Overall event-free survival (EFS) was 52% (95% confidence interval, 36% to 68%), with a median follow-up of 36 months.
 Eleven of 13 patients with small noncleaved lymphoma had CR; actuarial EFS in this subgroup was 61%.
 Myelosuppression occurred in all patients, with severe leukopenia (less than 1000/microliters) lasting a median of 12 days (range, 3 to 29 days); toxic deaths occurred in five patients (9%; 95% confidence interval, 4% to 19%).
 This intensive approach improved the response and survival of very poor risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patients.
