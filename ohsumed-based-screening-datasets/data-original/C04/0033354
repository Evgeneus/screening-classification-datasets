Down-regulation of messenger ribonucleic acid and protein levels for estrogen receptors by phorbol ester and calcium in MCF-7 cells.
 Treatment of MCF-7 cells, a human mammary carcinoma cell line, with phorbol ester [12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)] or calcium ionophore (A23187) was associated with striking effects on levels of estrogen receptor (ER) mRNA, specific binding of 17 beta-[3H]estradiol [( 3H]E2), and immunoreactive ER.
 TPA (10(-7) M) caused a time-dependent reduction of ER mRNA which was below the level of detection after 9 h.
 Similar effects of TPA appeared at levels of specific binding of [3H]E2 as well as immunoreactive ER.
 In contrast, TPA induced an increase in mRNA for beta-actin.
 Incubation of MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations of TPA (10(-11)-10(-7) M) was associated with biphasic effects on ER mRNA and proteins.
 Levels of immunoreactive progesterone receptors (PR) were induced by E2 (10(-9) M) in a time-dependent manner.
 In the presence of TPA (10(-7) M), where ER levels were suppressed, no induction of PR was observed.
 Removal of TPA (10(-7) M) after 10 h (ER mRNA) or 22 h (ER proteins) of treatment was associated with a continued suppression of both mRNA and protein levels during the entire incubation period (48 h).
 Treatment with A23187 (2 x 10(-7) M) also caused a time-dependent down-regulation of levels of ER mRNA and proteins.
 These effects occurred somewhat more slowly than those of TPA.
 Levels of beta-actin mRNA were not changed by this treatment.
 These results indicate that changes in estrogen sensitivity are mediated by calcium-dependent protein kinases in human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells.
