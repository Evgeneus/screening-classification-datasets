Telangiectatic osteosarcoma.
 Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is a rare variant of osteosarcoma.
 In the original report from the authors' institution, a poor prognosis was noted.
 The authors have updated their experience with this entity.
 The prognosis for patients with telangiectatic osteosarcoma has improved remarkably.
 The prognosis in the present series seems to be the same as that for conventional osteosarcoma.
 Adjuvant chemotherapy seems to help in salvaging patients with metastatic disease.
 However, in this small series, survival of patients without metastasis is apparently not influenced by whether they received chemotherapy.
