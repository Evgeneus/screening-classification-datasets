Selective amplification of periportal transitional cells precedes formation of hepatocellular carcinoma in SV40 large tag transgenic mice.
 In a major urinary protein (MUP)-promoter/simian virus 40 (SV40)Tag transgenic mouse line (MT-D2) the liver-directed, androgen-regulated transgene expression leads to synchronized pathology resulting in a stepwise progression to multiple hepatocellular carcinomas.
 SV40Tag-activated replication gives rise to two different preneoplastic alterations in hepatocytes, which are characterized in detail: 1) dysplasia and finally cell death in the original hepatocyte population and 2) amplification of periportal transitional hepatocytes leading to multifocal hyperplasia and hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Multifocal hyperplasia, most probably the equivalent of SV40Tag-immortalization, grows confluent and leads to hepatomegaly.
 SV40Tag-independent, secondary events are necessary for the tumor development from confluent hyperplasia.
 This allows further investigation of the steps involved in malignant transformation and progression during hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo.
