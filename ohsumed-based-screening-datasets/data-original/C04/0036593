Carcinoma of the pancreas: a personal experience with 100 cases.
 One hundred patients with pancreatic cancer were evaluated between March 1981 and December 1989.
 This study showed that 61 were not candidates for definitive surgery because of nonoperability (28 patients) or nonresectability (33 patients).
 An additional 25 patients had cancers that were unresectable because of metastases (13 patients) or local spread of disease (12 patients) discovered at laparotomy.
 Fourteen patients had resectable cancers.
 Ten were treated by total pancreatectomy, three by distal pancreatectomy and one by pancreatoduodenectomy (Whipple).
 There were two operative mortalities.
 The median patient survival time was 20.5 months.
 Two patients survived 5 years.
 Five patients are alive at 3, 14, 18, and 47 months.
 Palliative surgical procedures performed in 18 patients included 10 biliary bypasses, 9 gastrojejunostomies, and 6 T-tube placements.
 This was associated with an operative mortality rate of 11%.
 The median survival time was 5 months.
 Other palliative measures included endoscopic placement of biliary and pancreatic stents (47 patients, 2.7% mortality rate), endoluminal radiation therapy, interstitial radiation therapy and external beam radiation therapy.
 The median survival time of patients so treated was 4.5 months.
