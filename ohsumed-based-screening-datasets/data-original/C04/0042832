Tumor cell adhesion to endothelial cells: endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 as an inducible adhesive receptor specific for colon carcinoma cells.
 Activation of endothelial cells by the two inflammatory mediators interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor strongly increases tumor cell adhesion.
 We describe antibody inhibition studies showing that the endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), a cell-surface glycoprotein selectively expressed by cytokine-activated endothelial cells and responsible for neutrophil adhesion, is the major, if not the only, mediator of colon carcinoma cell adhesion to activated endothelial cells.
 Among the different tumor cell lines tested, seven colon carcinoma cell lines were sensitive to ELAM-1 antibodies.
 Adhesion of melanoma, osteosarcoma, and lung, cervix, or kidney carcinoma cell lines to IL-1-treated endothelial cells was not affected by the ELAM-1 antibody.
 This result suggests that ELAM-1 is selectively recognized by colon carcinoma cells and that adhesion of tumor cells to activated endothelial cells could be mediated by different and specific mechanisms.
