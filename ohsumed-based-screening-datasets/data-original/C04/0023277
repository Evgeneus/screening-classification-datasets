Carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts.
 Thirty-seven patients with carcinoma of the extrahepatic bile ducts (EHBD), diagnosed over 14 years from 1974 to 1987, were studied retrospectively.
 The most common presenting complaint was jaundice, followed by abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and weight loss.
 The majority of EHBD carcinomas were located at the middle third of the bile duct (43.2%), followed by upper third bile duct (37.8%), and lower third bile duct (18.9%).
 The resectability of the surgically managed group was 44.4%.
 The most common histologic type was adenocarcinoma.
 The 30-day postoperative mortality was 30.6%.
 The mean overall survival of the patients with EHBD carcinoma was 11.2 months.
 Patients with distal third tumors had the best prognosis with a mean overall survival of 16.0 months.
 The mean overall survival of patients with upper-third and middle-third tumors were 10.9 months and 9.4 months.
 A high index of suspicion of the disease as well as earlier, aggressive surgery may improve patient survival.
