Intracranial fibromatosis.
 Fibromatoses are uncommon infiltrative lesions affecting musculoaponeurotic structures, most often of the limbs and trunk.
 Lesions involving the cranial cavity are rare and require the same aggressive surgical management as elsewhere in the body.
 This case illustrates their clinical and neuroradiological features and underscores the necessity for aggressive resection to avoid recurrence.
 The literature is reviewed.
