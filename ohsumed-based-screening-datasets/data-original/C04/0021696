Occurrence of uveal melanoma in contact with a chorioretinal cryocoagulation scar.
 A case of a uveal melanoma arising in an eye previously treated with cryocoagulation for a horseshoe retinal tear is described.
 In the anterior border of the tumor, a notch, clearly fitting the curve of the chorioretinal scar was observed.
 Possible mechanisms which may be responsible for the local arrest of the tumor extension are discussed.
