Class II-restricted presentation of an endogenously derived immunodominant T-cell determinant of hen egg lysozyme.
 An in vitro model was used to investigate the potential for different structural forms of endogenous antigen to be processed and presented by major histocompatibility complex class II molecules.
 For this purpose the class II-restricted presentation of an immunodominant epitope of hen egg lysozyme [HEL-(46-61)] was studied in class II-positive B-lymphoma cells (M12.C3) transfected with genes encoding HEL molecules either (i) secreted in high (hi) or low (lo) amounts as soluble antigen [sHEL(hi/lo)], (ii) localized within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)/salvage compartment (ER-HEL), or (iii) anchored on the cell surface as an integral membrane protein (mHEL).
 The corresponding sHEL, ER-HEL, and mHEL gene products were expressed as predicted except that HEL determinants accumulated in the culture supernatant as well as on the cell membrane of mHEL-transfected cells.
 Class II-positive cells endogenously expressing all three forms of HEL antigen constitutively presented the immunodominant HEL-(46-61) determinant with differential efficiency (mHEL, sHEL greater than ERHEL) to a class II-restricted T hybridoma.
 A second T hybridoma recognized endogenous HEL-(46-61) determinants constitutively presented on sHEL(hi) and mHEL transfectants but not on sHEL(lo) or ERHEL transfectants.
 The formation of HEL-(46-61)/I-Ak complexes in the ERHEL and sHEL(lo) transfectants was therefore limiting.
 Mixing experiments with different antigen-presenting cells indicated that the HEL-(46-61) determinant was derived from endogenous antigen rather than by reuptake of shed or secreted HEL determinants.
 We conclude that MHC class II molecules can present some antigenic determinants derived from endogenous proteins that are sequestered in the ER/salvage compartment as well as distally transported in the form of secretory or membrane antigens.
