Clinical predictors for buserelin acetate treatment of uterine fibroids: a prospective study of 40 women.
 Buserelin acetate, a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist, is known to be effective in the shrinkage of uterine fibroids.
 A prospective trial was undertaken (1) to compare the efficacy of intranasal (IN) and subcutaneous (SC) administration of buserelin acetate and (2) to assess if tumor regression correlated with fibroid size and/or patient age.
 Forty patients were randomly allocated to receive 6 months of either IN buserelin acetate (n = 21) or SC buserelin acetate (n = 19).
 Four patients did not complete the study and were excluded from statistical analysis.
 Fibroid regression occurred in all 36 patients.
 Overall regression to 66% or less of the initial fibroid volume occurred in 70% of subjects.
 There was no significant difference in fibroid shrinkage between the two administration routes.
 A significant positive correlation was found between initial fibroid size and subsequent fibroid regression, with larger tumors being more likely to shrink than smaller fibroids.
 No correlation was found between the patient's age and the extent of fibroid regression.
