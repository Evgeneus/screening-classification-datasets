The change in patterns of relapse in medulloblastoma.
 The authors reviewed 89 patients treated for cerebellar medulloblastoma between 1970 and 1989 to determine the impact of changing treatment (high-dose posterior fossa radiation therapy and chemotherapy) on the pattern of failure in medulloblastoma.
 Between 1970 and 1983, 50 patients (median follow-up, 110 months) were treated with surgery and postoperative craniospinal irradiation (CSI).
 Nineteen of the 50 (38%) recurred in the central nervous system (CNS).
 Isolated systemic (bone) metastases occurred in six.
 The median time to the development of bone metastases was 12 months.
 Since 1984, 39 patients (median follow-up, 27 months) were treated with preradiation chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin and vincristine for 9 weeks before initiation of CSI.
 Nine of the 39 (23%) patients recurred in the CNS.
 There were no systemic failures in this cohort.
 The actuarial 5-year disease-free survival was 55 +/- 7% for the earlier cohort and 72 +/- 8% for the later cohort (P equals 0.3).
 Posterior fossa recurrence was associated with radiation therapy to this area.
 The cumulative incidence of posterior fossa relapse was 50 +/- 13% in patients who received less than 5300 cGy and 18 +/- 7% in those who received 5300 cGy or more (P equals 0.005).
 All six bone relapses were in patients treated with CSI alone and 5300 cGy or more to the posterior fossa for a 5-year cumulative incidence of bone metastases of 18 +/- 7% compared with 0% for patients treated with 5300 cGy or more and chemotherapy (P equals 0.03).
 The authors concluded that high-dose radiation therapy has altered the pattern of relapse with an increase in systemic recurrence after radiation therapy alone that is now equivalent to the risk of recurrence in the posterior fossa.
 Chemotherapy may be indicated in an attempt to decrease this high risk of systemic metastases.
