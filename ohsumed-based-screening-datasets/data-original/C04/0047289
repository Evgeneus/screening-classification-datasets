Marked differences in immunocytological localization of [3H]estradiol-binding protein in rat pancreatic acinar tumor cells compared to normal acinar cells.
 [3H]Estradiol can bind to a specific protein in normal rat pancreatic acinar cells.
 Electron microscopic immunocytochemical analysis has shown this protein to be localized primarily in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.
 Rat exocrine pancreatic tumor cell lines, whether grown in tissue culture (AR42J) or as a tumor mass after sc injection into rats (DSL-2), lacked detectable amounts of this [3H]estradiol-binding protein (EBP), as determined by the dextran-coated charcoal assay.
 Furthermore, primary exocrine pancreatic neoplasms induced with the carcinogen azaserine contained little or no detectable [3H]estradiol-binding activity.
 However, electron immunocytochemical studies of transformed cells indicated the presence of material that cross-reacted with antibodies prepared against the [3H]EBP.
 The immunopositive reaction in transformed cells was localized almost exclusively in lipid granules.
 Such lipid organelles in normal acinar cells, although present less frequently than in transformed cells, have never been observed to contain EBP-like immunopositive material.
 Presumably, the aberrant localization of EBP in these acinar tumor cells results in loss of function of this protein, which in normal pancreatic acinar cells appears to exert a modulating influence on zymogen granule formation and the process of secretion.
