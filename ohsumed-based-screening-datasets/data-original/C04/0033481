Interleukin 4 suppresses the spontaneous growth of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia cells.
 We studied the effects of IL-4 on the spontaneous proliferation of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL) cells in vitro.
 IL-4 (100 U/ml) suppressed the spontaneous DNA synthesis by approximately 50% in 5 of 8 cases examined.
 IL-4 (100 U/ml) also inhibited the spontaneous colony formation by CMMoL cells in a methylcellulose culture by 50-97% in all of the 10 cases in which spontaneous colonies were formed.
 This IL-4-mediated suppression of the growth of CMMoL cells was completely abolished by the addition of anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibodies.
 The spontaneous CMMoL colonies were substantially suppressed by the addition of either anti-IL-6 or anti-granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) antibodies to the colony assay system: the addition of both anti-IL-6 and anti-GM-CSF antibodies resulted in greater than 80% inhibition of the colony formation by CMMoL cells.
 On the other hand, none of anti-IL-1-beta, anti-granulocyte-CSF, anti-macrophage-CSF, or anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha antibodies affected the CMMoL colony formation.
 In the supernatants from 24-h cultures of CMMoL cells, high levels of IL-6 and GM-CSF were demonstrated in 9 of 9 and 2 of 9 cases examined, respectively.
 IL-4 (100 U/ml) almost completely inhibited the secretion of IL-6 and GM-CSF by CMMoL cells.
 These observations suggest that IL-4 suppresses the spontaneous proliferation of CMMoL cells by inhibiting their production of IL-6 and/or GM-CSF, both of which could act in vitro as an autocrine growth factor for CMMoL cells.
