Photodynamic killing of human squamous cell carcinoma cells using a monoclonal antibody-photosensitizer conjugate.
 We have developed procedures in which the photosensitizer benzoporphyrin derivative monoacid ring A (BPD) can be covalently linked to carrier molecules of modified polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to produce water-soluble PVA-BPD conjugates with a molecular mass in the range of 30 kd.
 These carriers can subsequently be covalently linked to monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) using heterobifunctional linking agents.
 We describe here such a conjugate in which the MoAb (5E8) has specificity for a glycoprotein detected on human squamous cell carcinomas of the lung.
 We provide evidence that the conjugates produced were covalently linked and retained both their photosensitizing and antigen-binding activities.
 We show further that the MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate, in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum, exhibited highly enhanced phototoxic killing of the target cell line (A549) over that exhibited by free BPD or a control MoAb-PVA-BPD conjugate.
 These results demonstrate, therefore, both the selectivity and specificity of this MoAb conjugate.
