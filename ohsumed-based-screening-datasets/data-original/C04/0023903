Depressed adenoma of the stomach, revisited. Histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical profiles.
 For 52 patients with depressed adenomas of the stomach, histopathologic studies were done on 56 tumors and for 43 of them, histochemical and immunohistochemical features were examined.
 In addition, nondepressed adenomas (n = 57) and the depressed type of early gastric adenocarcinomas of the well-differentiated variety (n = 44) were studied as the controls.
 Depressed adenomas in the majority (73%) involved the entire thickness of the mucous membrane of the stomach with tubules of atypical epithelium, presenting a severe grade in many of the cases (41%).
 Paneth's cells were found in cases of a depressed adenoma, in significantly higher percentages (61%) than in those with a nondepressed adenoma (P less than 0.01).
 The frequency of cases with argyrophil cells was also higher in depressed adenoma (63%) than in nondepressed adenoma (36%) or in cases of early gastric carcinoma (32%).
 Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 were noticed in tumor cells, immunohistochemically in 28% of the cases with depressed adenoma, the frequency being intermediate between cases of a benign nondepressed adenoma (6% for both CEA and CA 19-9) and cases of early gastric carcinoma (71% for CEA and 66% for CA 19-9).
 No difference was noticed in lectin reactivity and mucin content between depressed and nondepressed adenomas, whereas tumor cells in the early depressed carcinoma had a higher lectin reactivity and less mucin content than those seen in the adenomas.
 It would thus appear that depressed adenoma is a benign neoplastic lesion; however, the malignant potential of this lesion is somewhat higher than the nondepressed counterpart, as indicated by the immunoreactivity to tumor markers and follow-up results reported by colleagues previously.
