Clinical significance of soluble CD30 antigen in the sera of patients with untreated Hodgkin's disease.
 The soluble form of the CD30 antigen (sCD30), an 88-kd glycoprotein that is released by Hodgkin's-derived cell lines in vitro, can be detected in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma, adult (HTLV-1+) T-cell leukemia, rare cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and acute infectious mononucleosis (anti-EBV-IgM+).
 In a prospective study of 90 consecutive untreated patients with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease who were treated according to the protocols of the German Hodgkin Study group, 22% had detectable levels of sCD30 in their serum.
 sCD30 was only detected in patients with B symptoms (20 of 44 or 45%), and maximum sCD30 levels (88 U/mL) were found in stage IVB.
 Of 87 patients evaluable for response, sCD30+ patients had significantly lower rates of complete remission (9 of 20 or 45% v 60 of 67 or 90%; P less than .001) and higher rates of progressive disease (9 of 20 or 45% v 6 of 67 or 9%; P less than .001) than CD30+ patients.
 Similarly, freedom from treatment failure curves were significantly worse for CD30+ patients (P = .0003).
 sCD30 disappeared after successful treatment, but increased in patients with progressive disease.
 It was never detected in patients in complete remission or in healthy controls.
 We conclude that sCD30 is a valuable marker for disease activity and has prognostic significance in Hodgkin's disease.
