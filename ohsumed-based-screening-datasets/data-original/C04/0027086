Retinoblastoma in older children.
 A review of 400 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who presented to the Ocular Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital showed that 34 (8.5%) patients were older than 5 years of age at the time of initial diagnosis.
 The tumor was active in 26 (76%) cases and inactive (retinoma) in 8 (24%).
 An evaluation of the 26 patients with active retinoblastoma showed several unique features.
 At the time of diagnosis, their median age was 6 years and the oldest was 18 years.
 In 20 (77%) cases, the patient volunteered symptoms that prompted the eye examination; the presenting symptoms included leukocoria (9 cases), decreased vision (9 cases), strabismus (4 cases), pain (1 case), floaters (1 case), and no symptoms (2 cases).
 All of the 26 patients (100%) had unilateral sporadic retinoblastoma.
 Misdiagnosis before referral was common in these older children with active retinoblastoma.
 Five patients (19%) had prior vitrectomy for presumed vitreous hemorrhage or endophthalmitis while the retinoblastoma was unsuspected clinically, one patient (4%) had cryotherapy for presumed Coats disease, and one (4%) was observed for 7 months for presumed vitreous hemorrhage.
 The clinician should seriously consider the possibility of retinoblastoma in children who present with signs of unexplained vitreous hemorrhage or endophthalmitis, even if they are older than 5 years of age.
