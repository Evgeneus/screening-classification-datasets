Primary intracerebral sarcoma in childhood: case report with electron-microscope study.
 A case of a primary intracerebral sarcoma is described in a 5-year-old girl.
 Histology and immunohistochemistry excluded the diagnosis of a leiomyosarcoma, a malignant haemangiopericytoma or a fibrosarcoma; electron-microscopical findings indicated that the origin of the sarcoma was in the pia mater.
