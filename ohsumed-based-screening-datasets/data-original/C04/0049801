Tumor induction in a rat model for ureterosigmoidostomy without evidence of nitrosamine formation.
 Twenty rats were randomized into a vesicosigmoidostomy and an unoperated control group.
 In both groups the 24 hour excretion of secondary amines, nitrate, nitrite and nitrosamines was measured before and after gavage of proline and nitrate, piperazine and nitrate, N-nitrosoproline, mono-N-nitrosopiperazine.
 The urinary nitrosamine concentrations were not significantly different between both groups neither before nor after application of the several substances.
 Thirty rats were randomized into two vesicosigmoidostomy groups with and without antibiotic coverage and an unoperated control group.
 After ligation of distal rectum and mesosigmoid the rectosigmoids were removed.
 No significant concentrations of volatile nitrosamines could be measured in the rectosigmoid contents of the three groups.
 One hundred and twenty rats randomized into three groups following vesicosigmoidostomy received the potential nitrosamine antidotes sodium-2-mercaptoethane sulfonate or sodiumpentosan-polysulfate or acted as controls.
 12/118 (10.2%) developed adenomas and 25/118 (21.2%) adenocarcinomas at the vesico-colonic anastomosis with no significant differences between the three groups concerning tumor incidence or mortality.
 The results show that colon carcinomas occur in a rat model for ureterosigmoidostomy without evidence for thus induced nitrosamine formation.
 This and the missing effect of nitrosamine antidotes suggest that other factors than nitrosation must be responsible for colon carcinogenesis following urinary diversion via intestine.
