Aspiration cytology of breast.
 Most primary malignant epithelial neoplasms and many benign lesions of the breast possess such characteristic cytologic features that they can be diagnosed with certainty by needle aspiration.
 Because inadequate sampling may result in a false-negative cytology diagnosis, the time-tested rule is that a negative cytologic diagnosis is not definitive unless it is fully supported by negative clinical and mammographic findings.
