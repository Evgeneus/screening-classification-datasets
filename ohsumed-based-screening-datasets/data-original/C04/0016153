Non-Hodgkins lymphoma of the head and neck: experience in the Grampian area.
 The records of 44 cases of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL) presenting to the ear, nose and throat department in the Grampian area from 1980-1988 were examined in relation to site of occurrence, histology, age at presentation, clinical stage, treatment and survival.
 The median age was 67 years and there was a preponderance of high grade histology, especially in disease affecting the tonsil.
 Most deaths occurred in the first year; patients with high grade disease and those in stages three and four had a significantly poorer survival during the first year.
 The site of disease had no influence on survival.
