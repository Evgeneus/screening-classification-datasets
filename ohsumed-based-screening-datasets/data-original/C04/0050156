Tunneled central venous catheter sepsis: risk factors in a pediatric hospital.
 All tunnelled central venous catheters (TCVC) placed at the Alberta Children's Hospital in Calgary, Alberta, between November 1984 and July 1987, were retrospectively reviewed to study the association of catheter infection with a number of factors including age, diagnosis, catheter use, and areas caring for children.
 One hundred children received 130 silastic catheters placed for a total of 17,861 days.
 Each catheter survived a median of 100 days.
 Thirty-one episodes of catheter sepsis were identified (one episode for each 576 days of catheter use).
 Children under 2 years of age had more than two times the risk of catheter infection (p less than 0.01).
 Children with malabsorption had a greater risk (45.7%) than did those with infection (25.0%) or cancer (15.5%).
 The use of catheters for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or for multiple purposes markedly increased the risk of catheter infection.
 The risk of infection of TCVC appears to be great in the young child, in particular, in those requiring TPN or multiple intravenous infusions.
 Use of TCVC in these children should be avoided if possible.
