A case report of malignant pleural mesothelioma with long-term disease control after chemotherapy.
 Long duration of responses to chemotherapy in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is rare.
 The authors report a patient with inoperable MPM who achieved complete remission with combination chemotherapy of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin.
 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin C (FM) induced another remission after recurrence of the tumor.
 Retreatment with FM after chemotherapy had been stopped for 20 months yielded another continuing response.
 The overall tumor-control time is more than 4 years.
 Literature reviews and the authors' results suggest that MPM may be a chemosensitive tumor in some patients.
 Additional evaluations of CAP, FM, and methotrexate combination regimens in this disease should be considered.
