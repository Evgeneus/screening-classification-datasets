Meckel cave lesions: percutaneous fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology.
 The authors describe the novel combination of two traditional methods to facilitate diagnosis of Meckel cave lesions, which may otherwise require craniotomy to obtain adequate tissue samples.
 Fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology was performed on tissue obtained with a percutaneous approach via the foramen ovale with use of fluoroscopic guidance and intravenous analgesia during an outpatient procedure.
 This new application of fine-needle-aspiration biopsy cytology results in decreased patient morbidity and significant cost reduction.
