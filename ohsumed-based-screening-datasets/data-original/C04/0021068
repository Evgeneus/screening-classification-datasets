A multifaced DNA ploidy analysis to determine ovarian carcinoma aggressiveness.
 A microfluorometric DNA study was conducted on isolated cells from 64 fragments of ovarian epithelial tumors.
 Data analysis considered the DNA content of the main stemline and the prevalence of cells in the different compartments of the DNA ploidy histogram in relation to the mitotic activity index and the histologic architecture.
 Main stemlines were found remarkably stable in different parts of the same tumor.
 Peridiploid (1.8c to 2.2c) stemlines were found both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated tumors.
 However, low aneuploid (2.2c to 3.0c) stemlines were mostly found in nonsolid tumors and high ploidy (3.2 to 5.04 c) stemlines were prevalent in solid tumors.
 A comparative analysis between DNA ploidy parameters and mitotic activity was useful to evaluate the expanding modalities of neoplastic cell populations.
 This analysis revealed that several tumors accumulate an excessive amount of heteroploid cells and others an excessive amount of G2 cells.
 Yet, most neoplastic cell populations vary from slow to rapidly growing patterns without relevant abnormalities in their ploidy graphic profiles.
 No relationship was found between stemline ploidy and histologic architecture compared with expanding modalities.
 These findings indicate that multifaced criteria combining features such as main ploidy, graphic profile, mitotic rate, and histologic architecture measured on one or more microsamples of the same tumor may help to objectively estimate the aggressiveness reached by the neoplastic cells at the time of clinical presentation.
