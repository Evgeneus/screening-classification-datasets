Pheochromocytoma in a long-term hemodialysis patient.
 A right adrenal tumor was found incidentally by renal echography in a 25-year-old man, who had been on hemodialysis for 4 years.
 Inquiry and clinical examination suggested pheochromocytoma, which was confirmed by plasma catecholamine measurements.
 Subsequent adrenalectomy was uneventful.
 Although hypertension, headache, and diaphoresis are common symptoms in a dialyzed patient, pheochromocytoma has to be eliminated in the presence of this clinical triad.
