Childhood haemangiomas of the head and neck.
 Haemangiomas of the head and neck in children may be of several histological types, the clinical course depending on the group to which the haemangioma belongs.
 Treatment may be required if the haemangioma interferes with the airway, as in the subglottic group, or if the lesion becomes ulcerated with subsequent haemorrhage, as in capillary cavernous haemangiomas.
 Most haemangiomas require no immediate treatment as they involute spontaneously, though parental reassurance will be of paramount importance.
 Those lesions which persist may be amenable to treatment at a later date, the laser probably offering the best long-term results in terms of cosmesis as in the case of port-wine stains.
 Superselective embolization is becoming the treatment of choice for arterial haemangiomas.
 This paper is designed to clarify the histological and clinical features of these tumours and their management in view of considerable confusion in the literature encountered in our study.
