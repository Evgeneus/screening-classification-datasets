Origin of so-called mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node. An immunohistochemical study.
 To determine the origin of a mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node, immunohistochemical studies that used various antibodies, including the antibody against mesothelial cells, were performed on a mesothelioma of the atrioventricular node in a case.
 The lining cells of the tubules that composed the tumor were negative when tested with anti-mesothelial cell antibodies.
 Carcinoembryonic antigen was negative, but the secretory component was positive.
 Serotonin and calcitonin were positive in a few cells.
 We concluded that a mesothelial origin was unlikely, and it was suggested that the tumor was of an entodermal origin.
