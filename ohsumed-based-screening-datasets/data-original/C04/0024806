Changing the American diet. Impact on cancer prevention policy recommendations and program implications for the American Cancer Society [editorial]
 In 1984, the American Cancer Society (ACS) determined that a substantial proportion of new cancer cases could be avoided if seven dietary guidelines were followed.
 Education programs were developed for the general public, young people, and the mass media.
 In 1989, a Working Group of the Society reviewed the guidelines and found them to be valid, the only change being to combine two of them.
 This paper summarizes recent dietary recommendations of other health authorities, describes progress in meeting ACS dietary recommendations, analyzes the barriers to and opportunities for dietary improvement, and proposes new leadership opportunities for the Society.
 Concern is expressed that the current guidelines lack the clarity and specificity needed for public education, and that they are inconsistent with recent dietary recommendations of other authorities such as the US Department of Health and Human Services and the National Academy of Sciences.
 Revisions to the ACS Dietary Recommendations and implications for ACS programs are proposed.
