Depression and chronic fatigue in cancer patients.
 Fatigue is a very common symptom among cancer patients.
 It is crucial to diagnose those patients for whom the fatigue is a symptom of depression, and to treat them appropriately.
 The key to providing complete and satisfying care is to identify and address the psychologic, social, and medical vulnerabilities of each cancer patient.
 No one is in a better position to accomplish that than the primary physician.
