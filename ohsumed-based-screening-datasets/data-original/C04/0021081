Status of sex steroid hormone receptors in large bowel cancer.
 To determine the potential role of sex steroid hormones in the development of colorectal tumors in humans, specific androgen (AR), estrogen (ER), and progesterone (PGR) receptors were investigated in normal mucosa (NM) and in tumor (T) paired biopsy specimens from 94 patients.
 Androgen receptors were detected in 98% and 96% of NM and T samples, ER in 91% and 83% of NM and T biopsy samples, whereas PGR were detected only in 14% and 10% of NM and T specimens, respectively.
 These incidences are independent of the sex and age of the patients.
 They are not related to tumor localization, histologic grade, or stages of Dukes' classification.
 Scatchard analysis of labeled ligand binding indicated the existence of one single class of high affinity binding sites; the calculated dissociation constant (Kd) was 1.7 +/- 0.6 10(-9) molar concentration (M) for 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 0.6 +/- 0.3 10(-9) M for estradiol (E2).
 These values were identical in NM and T tissue for both AR and ER.
 The binding capacity for DHT was 148 +/- 67 and 93 +/- 43 fmol/mg of cytosol protein in NM and T tissues, respectively (P less than 0.05).
 The ER content was lower and similar in NM and T biopsy specimens: 19 +/- 9 and 18 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein, respectively.
 The PGR content was 10 +/- 4 in NM versus 17.5 +/- 6 fmol/mg protein in T specimens.
 It is observed that the elevated AR in normal mucosa is not related to any known function for androgens in the digestive tract.
 The receptor pattern observed in tumors does not support the hypothesis previously raised in the case of chemically induced colonic tumors in rodents.
