Abdominal desmoids: CT findings in 25 patients.
 Desmoids are histologically benign but locally aggressive fibrous tumors.
 Although overall they are rare lesions, they are a common manifestation of Gardner syndrome.
 We retrospectively reviewed clinical records and CT scans of 25 patients with abdominal desmoids.
 The number, location, and CT characteristics of the lesions were recorded for each patient.
 Tumors were solitary in 72% of patients and multiple in 28%.
 Fifty percent were located in the abdominal wall, 41% in the mesentery, and 9% in the retroperitoneum.
 More than two thirds of the lesions had well-defined borders, with the remainder displaying an infiltrative outer margin.
 The majority of tumors had attenuation values equal to (47%) or greater than (41%) the attenuation of muscle on contrast-enhanced CT scans.
 Complications attributable to the desmoid were commonly detectable on CT (hydronephrosis occurred in 36% and small-bowel obstruction in 20%).
 Our results detail the spectrum of CT findings and complications caused by abdominal desmoids.
