Inhibition of pyroglutamyl peptidase II synthesis by phorbol ester in the Y-79 retinoblastoma cell.
 Pyroglutamyl peptidase II (EC 3.4.19.-), a highly specific membrane-bound TRH-degrading enzyme, is inactivated in Y-79 human retinoblastoma cells by exposure to 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) in a biphasic manner.
 We have previously demonstrated a rapid decrease in pyroglutamyl peptidase II activity to 10% of the control level within 15 min, which returns to 70% of the control level by 1 h.
 This decrease results from enzyme phosphorylation by TPA-activated protein kinase-C.
 We now report a second phase of inactivation after longer exposure of cells to TPA.
 After 1 h, enzymatic activity slowly and progressively declined.
 By 7 h, only 15% of control activity remained.
 Cotreatment of cells with H-7, a protein kinase-C inhibitor, prevented this second phase of inactivation.
 Immunoblot experiments demonstrated a reduction in the amount of pyroglutamyl peptidase II in Y-79 membranes after long term exposure to TPA.
 Y-79 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine, and pyroglutamyl peptidase II was immunoprecipitated.
 A decreased incorporation of [35S]methionine paralleled the decrease in enzyme activity.
 These studies demonstrate that the second phase of inactivation after exposure to TPA is due to an inhibition of enzyme synthesis.
