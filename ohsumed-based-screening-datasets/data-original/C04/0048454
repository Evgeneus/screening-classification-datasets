Kinetic modeling of in vivo--nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data: 5-fluorouracil in liver and liver tumors.
 Kinetic modeling has been applied to the time course of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal intensities of 5-fluorouracil and the sum of its catabolites, alpha-fluoro-beta-ureido propanoic acid and alpha-fluoro-beta-alanine, as monitored in liver tumors of seven patients with cancer after brief intraarterial infusion of 5-fluorouracil.
 Because these data represent only relative tissue concentrations, only ratios of clearance and volume parameters can be estimated (e.g., clearance/central volume of distribution or central volume of distribution/steady-state volume of distribution).
 On the other hand, parameters that do not refer to volumes, such as half-lives or maximal velocity of metabolic conversion of a nonlinear model, can be estimated in absolute terms.
 A nonlinear three-compartment model gave satisfactory fits with all of the individual data sets.
 Kinetics of 5-fluorouracil and catabolites were similar in five patients with metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas but differed from those of two patients with cholangiocarcinoma and metastases of an anaplastic carcinoma of unknown origin, respectively.
