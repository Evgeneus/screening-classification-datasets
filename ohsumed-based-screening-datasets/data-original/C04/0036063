Prognostic factors in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.
 In a retrospective study of 119 patients, followed for 1 to 30 years after treatment of a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, the authors searched for possible prognostic factors of the risk of recurrence.
 Microcarcinomas, anaplastic tumors and Hurthle cell carcinomas were excluded from the study.
 In a univariate analysis, age (greater than 45 years), sex (male), loss of histologic differentiation, size (greater than 3 cm), presence of carcinomatous lymphangitis, extrathyroid extension, and presence of metastasis at diagnosis were associated with a higher recurrence rate; type of growth and multifocality were not significant.
 In a multivariate analysis (logistic regression), age, size, and carcinomatous lymphangitis were significant predictors for women, whereas metastasis at diagnosis and cystic growth were significant for men.
