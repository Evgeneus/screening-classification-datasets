Solitary minute hepatocellular carcinoma. A study of 14 patients.
 Fourteen patients with clinical Stage I hepatocellular carcinoma (T1N0M0) were studied.
 All patients were asymptomatic, and their conditions were detected by alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) serosurvey and/or ultrasonography (US) either in the natural population in the early years of the study or in the high-risk population in the later years of the study.
 Cirrhosis was present in all patients.
 Radical resection was performed in all patients.
 There were no operative deaths or hospital deaths in this series.
 The 5-year survival rate after resection was 100%.
 There were seven long-term survivors in this series (14.2 years (alive), 11.3 years (alive), 8.8 years (alive), 8.8 years, 7.9 years, 7.6 years (alive), and 7.2 years after resection).
 The authors discuss aspects concerning early diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
