Reconstructions after resections of tumors involving the proximal femur.
 Advances in prosthesis design, the use of allografts, and a systematic approach to the staging and surgical treatment of musculoskeletal tumors have made limb salvage possible in the proximal femoral region.
 With the use of effective adjuvant therapy, limb salvage is now an option for the majority of patients presenting with locally invasive neoplasms in this area.
 The increase in functional outcome is sufficient to warrant serious consideration of limb salvage over the corresponding amputation.
 Preoperative planning is discussed along with surgical techniques.
