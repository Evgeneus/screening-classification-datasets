Immunoreactive transforming growth factor alpha is commonly present in colorectal neoplasia.
 Surgical specimens from 19 patients with invasive colorectal cancers and 12 specimens of normal mucosa from the same patients were examined immunohistochemically for the production of the immunoreactive (IR-) transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha and IR-epidermal growth factor (EGF) with an anti-TGF-alpha monoclonal antibody (MAb) OAL-MTG01 and anti-EGF MAb KEM-10.
 Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected in 16 (84.2%) of 19 colorectal cancers.
 In contrast, there was no IR-TGF-alpha in the gland cells of normal mucosa.
 Immunoreactive EGF was detected in 7 (36.8%) of 19 colorectal cancers and 1 (8.3%) of 12 cases of normal mucosa.
 The production of both IR-TGF-alpha and IR-EGF in colorectal cancer did not differ by histologic type and Dukes' stage.
 Immunoreactive TGF-alpha was detected at significantly higher incidence than IR-EGF in colorectal cancer.
 These results indicate that IR-TGF-alpha should prove valuable as a possible tumor marker in colorectal cancers, and it may be very useful in understanding the biology of colorectal cancer.
