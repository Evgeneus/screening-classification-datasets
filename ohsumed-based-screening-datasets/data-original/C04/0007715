Metastatic ciliary body carcinoid tumor.
 A 50-year-old man with a history of systemic carcinoid had decreased right eye vision and a darkly pigmented cilio-choroidal mass.
 Results of ultrasonographic and fluorescein angiographic examinations were consistent with a malignant melanoma.
 Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the lesion identified it as a carcinoid metastasis.
 The patient refused both radiation and enucleation; complete excision with a cyclochoroidectomy was performed.
 Histopathologic examination showed a carcinoid neoplasm covered by marked hyperplasia of the retinal pigment epithelium that produced the pigmented appearance of the lesion.
