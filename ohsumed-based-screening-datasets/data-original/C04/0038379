A myocutaneous flap for closure of upper arm amputations for uncontrolled axillary tumors.
 Tumor spread or recurrence in the axilla is usually treated with nodal dissections.
 At times disease recurrence is uncontrolled, causing significant morbidity including pain, bleeding, lymphedema, and neurologic symptoms.
 Previously, forequarter amputation has been the treatment for this problem, resulting in a significant cosmetic and functional deficit.
 This report describes a novel myocutaneous flap that can be used to cover soft tissue defects after major disarticulations of the upper extremity.
 The deltoid myocutaneous flap has been used to successfully treat three patients with uncontrolled tumors in the axilla and preserve the shoulder structures to lessen the functional deficit.
