In vivo use of a radioiodinated somatostatin analogue: dynamics, metabolism, and binding to somatostatin receptor-positive tumors in man 
 Somatostatin analogues, labeled with gamma-emitting radionuclides, are of potential value in the localization of somatostatin receptor-positive tumors with gamma camera imaging.
 We investigated the application in man of a radioiodinated analogue of somatostatin, 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide, which has similar biologic characteristics as the native peptide.
 The radiopharmaceutical is cleared rapidly from the circulation (up to 85% of the dose after 10 min) mainly by the liver.
 Liver radioactivity is rapidly excreted into the biliary system.
 Until 3 hr after injection, radioactivity in the circulation is mainly in the form of 123I-Tyr-3-octreotide.
 Thereafter, plasma samples contain increasing proportions of free iodide.
 Similarly, during the first hours after injection, radioactivity in the urine exists mainly in the form of the unchanged peptide.
 Thereafter, a progressive increase in radioiodide excretion is observed, indicating degradation of the radiopharmaceutical in vivo.
 Fecal excretion of radioactivity amounts to only a few percent of the dose.
 The calculated median effective dose equivalent is comparable with values for applications of other 123I-radiopharmaceuticals (0.019 mSv/MBq).
