Asymmetrical ocular pursuit with posterior fossa tumors.
 We report two patients with posterior fossa neoplasms who demonstrated asymmetrically impaired horizontal ocular pursuit documented with electrooculography.
 One patient had impaired pursuit contralateral to a pontomedullary lesion, whereas the second patient had impaired pursuit ipsilateral to a pontocerebellar lesion.
 These patients demonstrate that posterior fossa lesions may impair ocular pursuit either contralaterally or ipsilaterally unlike cerebral hemispheric lesions, which impair ocular pursuit ipsilaterally or bilaterally.
