Expression of a cell adhesion protein (VLA beta) in normal and diseased skin.
 Biopsies from normal skin (n = 17) and various cutaneous disorders (n = 83) were examined immunohistologically for reactivity with an antibody (CD29) against the common beta chain of the VLA integrin family.
 In normal skin, CD29 recognized a number of cell types, i.e.
 endothelial cells, fibroblasts, T lymphocytes and basal keratinocytes.
 Similar cells were positive in diseased skin, but the expression of VLA beta was upregulated on keratinocytes.
 The phenotype of the VLA beta-positive T cells was examined in more detail by staining with anti-T-cell antibodies, i.e.
 CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RO (UCHL1) and CD45R (2H4).
 These studies showed that most of the T cells in normal skin, benign cutaneous conditions and early cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) expressed a similar phenotype and resembled antigen committed 'memory' (helper/inducer) cells (CD4+, CD29+, CD45RO+, CD45R-).
 In advanced CTCL, expression of these antigens was more variable, and many of these infiltrates showed aberrant (or unusual) expression of CD29, CD45RO, CD45R and other T-cell antigens.
 It is concluded that several cells involved in cutaneous immune reactions express a molecule (VLA beta) which acts as a receptor for extracellular matrix components.
 This molecule is important for the attachment of cells to connective tissue constituents and may act to facilitate the migration of lymphocytes (and other cells) during immune reactions in normal and diseased cutaneous conditions.
 Advanced CTCL differ from the early lesions and it is possible that there is a progressive accumulation of increasingly malignant (or transformed) cells in these conditions.
