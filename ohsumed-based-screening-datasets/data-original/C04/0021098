Is local recurrence of minor importance for metastases in soft tissue sarcoma?
 The authors analyzed the relationship between treatment, local recurrence, and metastases in a population-based series of 375 patients with soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and the trunk wall.
 Treatment was inadequate (marginal excision alone) in 107 patients, local recurrence occurred in 112, and 128 patients developed metastases.
 Local recurrence was 3.5 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate and 2.5 times more common in patients with metastases than in those without.
 However, metastases were only 1.2 times more common after inadequate treatment than after adequate.
 Of the 128 patients who developed metastases, 63 had local recurrence and 65 had not.
 In these two subgroups the timing of metastases and the distribution of clinicopathologic factors--age, sex, tumor size, localization, depth, histotype, and malignancy grade--were similar.
 These findings indicate that local recurrence is of minor importance for development of metastases in soft tissue sarcoma.
 The increased local recurrence rate in metastatic tumors may be an expression of the aggressiveness of the primary tumor; highly malignant tumors combine a potential both for local and distant spread.
