The GTPase superfamily: a conserved switch for diverse cell functions.
 Proteins that bind and hydrolyse GTP are being discovered at a rapidly increasing rate.
 Each of these many GTPases acts as a molecular switch whose 'on' and 'off' states are triggered by binding and hydrolysis of GTP.
 Conserved structure and mechanism in myriad versions of the switch--in bacteria, yeast, flies and vertebrates--suggest that all derive from a single primordial protein, repeatedly modified in the course of evolution to perform a dazzling variety of functions.
