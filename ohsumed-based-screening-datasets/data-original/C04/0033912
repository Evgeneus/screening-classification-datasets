Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.
 Fifty-five patients were evaluated and treated for gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors at our institution from 1968 through 1988.
 Thirty patients had primary tumors smaller than 1 cm and were treated surgically or endoscopically by local excision, whereas 25 underwent resection with regional lymphadenectomy for larger primaries.
 At the time of initial treatment 17 patients demonstrated metastasis.
 Although 13 of these patients had primary tumors larger than 2 cm, in four patients with ileal carcinoids, the primary measured 0.8 to 1.5 cm.
 Serosal involvement was present in nine of 17 patients with metastasis.
 With a follow-up range of 3 months to 20 years, six patients have died with metastatic carcinoid tumor, two patients died without evidence of disease, 12 patients are alive with metastasis, and 35 patients are alive, free of disease.
 In this series three determinants for risk of metastasis in GI carcinoid tumors were evident: primary size, serosal penetration, and primary site in the small intestine.
 In patients with any of these risk factors, resection with regional lymphadenectomy is recommended.
