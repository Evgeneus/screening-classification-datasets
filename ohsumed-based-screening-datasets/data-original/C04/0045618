Inverted papillomas and associated squamous cell carcinomas.
 Inverted papillomas of the nose and paranasal sinuses are found to be associated with squamous cell carcinomas in a small percentage of cases.
 The records of forty-six patients treated for inverted papillomas in these areas over a 10-year period were reviewed.
 Eleven patients (24%) were found to have squamous cell carcinoma, and one carcinoma in situ, in relationship to the inverted papillomas.
 This is a much higher percentage than generally reported.
 Four of these patients were found to have inverted papillomas coincidentally in surgical specimens resected for squamous cell carcinoma.
 Patients with squamous cell carcinoma were found to be in older age groups, were more likely to manifest epistaxis than the more common unilateral nasal obstructive symptoms, and had less time between the onset of symptoms and presentation than those with inverted papillomas alone.
 The clinical presentation, treatment, and outcome of inverted papillomas and squamous cell carcinomas in association with inverted papillomas are discussed.
