The human costs of cancer and the response of the National Cancer Program.
 The three foundations of the National Cancer Program are basic research, clinical trials (in prevention and treatment), and cancer centers.
 These foundations have supported a great deal of progress against cancer over the past 20 years.
 Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain, and continued progress will depend on the speed with which research advances can be translated into practical realities.
 Poverty is a risk factor for cancer incidence and mortality.
 Thus, a lack of access to the technologies generated by the National Cancer Program can be a force for bringing about differential burdens of cancer in underserved populations.
