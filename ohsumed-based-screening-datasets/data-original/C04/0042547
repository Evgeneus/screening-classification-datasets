The use of bone allografts for limb salvage in high-grade extremity osteosarcoma.
 Limb preservation is increasingly being employed in the local treatment of high-grade extremity osteosarcoma.
 Bone allografts used to reconstruct the bony defects following tumor resection offer many advantages, including joint reconstruction and incorporation of the graft to the host bone in these relatively young patients.
 The results of 53 patients 30 years of age or younger were assessed to determine functional outcome.
 Fresh-frozen allografts were employed as osteoarticular grafts, allograft-arthrodeses, allograft-prosthesis composites, or intercalary grafts.
 Follow-up intervals averaged 25 months (range, two to 63 months).
 Life-table analysis showed that the probability of a satisfactory functional result was 73% if local tumor recurrences were excluded.
 Complications included 16 infections, six fractures, 12 nonunions, and six unstable joints.
 There were five local recurrences.
 Eighteen grafts ultimately failed, and in six patients, this resulted in an above-knee amputation.
 An additional five received a second graft.
 The functional "end results" of the 38 patients with two or more years of follow-up examinations were 70% satisfactory in those without a local recurrence.
 There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcome or local or distant relapse in those patients receiving preoperative chemotherapy.
 The authors conclude that allografts can be used for limb reconstruction in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma who receive aggressive adjuvant chemotherapy.
 The functional results are comparable to other methods of reconstruction, and once incorporated by the host, offer the advantage of longevity, compared with metallic implants.
