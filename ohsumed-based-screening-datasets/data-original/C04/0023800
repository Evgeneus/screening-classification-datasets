Doppler ultrasonography of malignant melanomas of the uvea.
 Doppler shifts were detected using duplex and color Doppler scanning in 41 of 42 patients with malignant melanomas of the uvea.
 Mean maximum tumor systolic velocity was 18.8 +/- 7.6 cm/s.
 Time-averaged maximum velocity in the tumor vessels was 12.3 +/- 5.3 cm/s.
 Maximum tumor velocity increased in four of eight tumors and was unchanged or had diminished in the other four 2 to 3 days after ruthenium plaque irradiation.
 Doppler shifts were undetectable in three tumors, markedly reduced in three tumors, and unchanged in one tumor 1 to 4 months after treatment.
 We detected minimal non-pulse-synchronized Doppler shifts in one of three tumors, and no shifts in the remaining two tumors 1 1/2 to 4 years after therapy.
 Color duplex scanning allowed a rapid overview of tumor vasculature and facilitated study of individual vessels.
