Postresection autopsy findings in patients with cancer of the main hepatic duct junction.
 Extensive resection of the bile ducts combined with hepatic resection is the procedure of choice for carcinoma of the main hepatic duct junction.
 Currently this procedure is done without great risk, and increasing long-term survival is now the issue.
 For this purpose, it is necessary to elucidate the biologic properties of the cancer to take reasonable measures.
 Autopsy findings of patients who died of recurrence may offer a reliable guide.
 Autopsy findings were studied in 14 patients: eight who had undergone curative resection and six who had received noncurative resection.
 Cancer recurred at the liver hilum with invasion into adjacent organs.
 Peritoneal dissemination and lymph node metastases were infrequent.
 These were common findings in both curative and noncurative resection groups.
 Cancer cells in the connective tissue of the hepatoduodenal ligament may play a major role in recurrence.
