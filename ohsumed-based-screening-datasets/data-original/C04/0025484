Antibodies against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes: presence in alcoholic, non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects.
 Several studies have recently shown the presence of antibodies against acetaldehyde-modifications in the sera of alcoholic patients.
 To assess the specificity of this immune response, plasma immunoreactivity with proteins modified in vitro by acetaldehyde was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 97 alcoholic patients with varying degrees of alcoholic liver disease, in 35 patients with non-alcoholic liver diseases and in 33 control subjects who were social drinkers.
 All three groups showed some response against acetaldehyde-modified epitopes.
 The highest plasma reactivities were found in alcoholics, especially those with steatosis and alcoholic hepatitis.
 Plasma from patients with non-alcoholic liver disease and control subjects also reacted with the acetaldehyde conjugates, but to a lesser extent than plasma from alcoholics.
 The reliability of these antibodies as markers of either alcohol abuse or alcoholic liver disease therefore appears to be low.
 However, further studies using more precisely modified proteins or elucidation of the classes of immunoglobulin involved in the immune response against the modified proteins may give clearer differences between the three groups.
