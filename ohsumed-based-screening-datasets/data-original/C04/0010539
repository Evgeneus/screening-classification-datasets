Recombinant IFN-alpha in lymphomas.
 The effectiveness of interferon (IFN) therapy in malignant lymphoma is analyzed in this review.
 Although various treatment regimens including IFN at various dose levels have so far not proved to have curative potential, a substantial palliative effect has been noted in hairy-cell leukemia and in some non-Hodgkin lymphomas of low-grade malignancy.
 Early stages of lymphoma disease are more responsive to IFN therapy, and this holds true also for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, in which IFN treatment is usually not effective in progressed disease after chemotherapy.
 Concepts of early-phase treatment and of remission maintenance by using IFN therapy are discussed on the basis of the data from several studies.
