Human papillomavirus type 16 associated with oral squamous carcinoma in a cardiac transplant recipient.
 Human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) has been associated with a variety of squamous carcinomas, particularly those involving the anogenital tract.
 The authors report the development of an oropharyngeal carcinoma in a 43-year-old man approximately 20 months after cardiac transplantation while he was on a maintenance regimen of cyclosporine A and prednisone.
 The carcinoma was resistant to treatment, and he died of complications related to metastatic disease 3 years posttransplantation.
 Molecular biologic studies using nonisotopic-labeled viral DNA probes were done.
 In situ hybridization demonstrated the presence of HPV 16 DNA in the tumor cells.
 DNA dot blot analysis confirmed the presence of multiple copies of HPV 16 DNA within the tumor cells and their absence from adjacent normal-appearing tissue.
 Southern blot analysis suggested that the HPV 16 DNA was integrated into the tumor cell genome.
 With increasing recognition of the carcinogenicity of HPV type 16 infection, a role for this virus in the development of squamous cell malignancies in immunosuppressed organ transplant recipients is likely to be noted with increasing frequency.
