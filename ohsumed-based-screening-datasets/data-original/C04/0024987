Effects of cytokine combinations on acute phase protein production in two human hepatoma cell lines.
 We evaluated the effects of binary combinations of four cytokines on production of the positive acute phase proteins alpha-1 antichymotrypsin, haptoglobin and fibrinogen, and the negative acute phase proteins albumin and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in two human hepatoma cell lines.
 The effects of the cytokine combinations on the five proteins varied; each protein exhibited a unique and specific pattern of response to the cytokine combinations.
 In Hep G2 cells, antichymotrypsin was induced by all four cytokines, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-alpha, and transforming growth factor beta 1 alone, and their effects in binary combinations could be attributed to additive or minimally synergistic interactions.
 Fibrinogen was induced only by IL-6 and this induction was inhibited by IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha or transforming growth factor beta 1.
 Haptoglobin was also induced only by IL-6, but TNF-alpha was the only cytokine that inhibited this induction at all concentrations of IL-6.
 Each of the four cytokines alone down regulated production of AFP and albumin.
 However, binary combinations of the four cytokines were simply additive, for the most part, in inhibiting AFP production, whereas the inhibitory effects of combinations of cytokines on albumin production differed significantly from simple additive effects.
 These observations, taken together with studies of effects of cytokine combinations on other acute phase proteins, indicate that the various acute phase proteins respond differently to different combinations of cytokines and that the potential exists for highly specific regulation of synthesis of individual plasma proteins by cytokine interactions.
 These findings imply that the acute phase response in vivo represents the integrated sum of multiple, separately regulated changes in gene expression.
