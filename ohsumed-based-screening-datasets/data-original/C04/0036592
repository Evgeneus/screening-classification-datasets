The role of intraluminal radiotherapy and concurrent 5-fluorouracil infusion in the management of carcinoma esophagus: a pilot study.
 Fifty patients with carcinoma of the esophagus were entered in a randomized pilot study to test the efficacy of intraluminal radiotherapy (ILRT) and concurrent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) infusion.
 The median age was 65 years, with 80% having middle third lesions; in 62%, the lesions were longer than 5 cm.
 After external beam therapy of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, patients were randomized to receive chemotherapy.
 Significant improvement in dysphagia was recorded in 76% patients with complete response in 47 cases ranging from 6 to 27 months.
 The overall survival at 2 years was 15% with ILRT alone versus 22% with ILRT plus 5-FU infusion.
