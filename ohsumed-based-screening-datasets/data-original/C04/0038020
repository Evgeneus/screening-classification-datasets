Human interleukin-7 induces proliferation of neoplastic cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute leukemias.
 The biologic effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) and the expression of specific IL-7 membrane receptors on isolated neoplastic cells from previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia as well as acute leukemias were investigated in vitro.
 Leukemic cells were incubated for up to 6 days with various concentrations of IL-7 (0.01 to 2,000 U/mL).
 Neoplastic cells of the T- or B-phenotype from chronic as well as from acute leukemias proliferated in a dose-dependent manner.
 Cells from acute myeloid leukemias also proliferated in response to IL-7.
 An optimal proliferative effect was achieved between 96 and 120 hours with 200 U/mL IL-7.
 Combinations of IL-7 with IL-2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha showed an additive effect on [3H]TdR incorporation.
 IL-7 binding assays gave a value of approximately 33 to 180 high-affinity (kd approximately 20 pmol/L) binding sites/cell and approximately 241 to 3,280 low-affinity (kd approximately 600 pmol/L) binding sites/cell.
 Receptor expression correlated with the proliferation in response to IL-7.
 These data indicate that IL-7 can induce proliferation of relatively mature tumor cells, and that this effect is not restricted to the lymphoid lineage.
