IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--the Australian experience.
 Current management of osteosarcoma at the authors' institution involves intraarterial induction chemotherapy using intermittent cycles of cisplatin and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), surgical resection with limb-sparing wherever possible, and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (high-dose methotrexate with retrieval and doxorubicin).
 Twenty cases treated in this way between May 1983 and May 1989 are reviewed.
 There were 18 Stage IIB osteosarcomas and two Stage IIB malignant fibrous histiocytomas.
 Chemotherapeutic effect was evaluated in the resected tumors.
 There was little correlation between the clinical response to the induction chemotherapy and cell necrosis present in the resected tumor mass.
 Wide resection margins were achieved in 17 cases, a minimal margin in two, and a contaminated margin in one.
 Radiotherapy was used in these three cases where resection margin was in doubt.
 There were two local recurrences in these three cases.
 Four patients have died of their disease, and there was one treatment-related death.
 Overall probability of survival in this group of 20 patients has been expressed by the Kaplan-Meier method as 58%.
