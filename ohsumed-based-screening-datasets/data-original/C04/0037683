Adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer.
 Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women.
 Screening mammography can detect cancer in its early stages, when it is potentially curable.
 Adjuvant chemotherapy is of major benefit in node-positive patients.
 It is also beneficial in certain node-negative patients with a high risk of breast cancer recurrence; these patients should be identified and offered adjuvant therapy or enrolled in a clinical trial.
