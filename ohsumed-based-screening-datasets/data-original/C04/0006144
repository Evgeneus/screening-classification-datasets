Radiation therapy of early (stages I and II-A) seminoma of testis after initial orchiectomy.
 With initial orchiectomy and radiation therapy, the prognosis of the patients with early (Stages I and II-A) testicular seminoma is nearing almost 100 percent.
 Thirty-two patients with Stage I and 13 patients with Stage II-A seminoma of the testis were treated with initial orchiectomy.
 This was followed by estimation biochemical markers and radiologic investigations.
 All the patients with Stage I disease received radiotherapy to the ipsilateral pelvic and para-aortic nodes.
 The patients with Stage II-A disease also received radiation therapy to the supradiaphragmatic regions.
 The disease-free survival in both groups of patients was found to be 100 percent.
