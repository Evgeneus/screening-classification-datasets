Naevocytic naevi with vascular-like spaces.
 Fourteen cases of naevocytic naevi with anastomising lacunae suggestive of vascular spaces are reported.
 The cells lining these lacunae were consistent with naevus cells, being positive for vimentin and S100 protein and negative for factor VIII-related antigen and Ulex europaeus I.
 The cells were not surrounded by laminin or type IV collagen.
 We suggest the formation of these vascular-like spaces may be due to defective production or increased degradation of components of the basement membrane with a consequent lack of cohesion.
