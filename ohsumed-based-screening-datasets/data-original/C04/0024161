Innovative approach in the diagnosis of gliomatosis cerebri using carbon-11-L-methionine positron emission tomography.
 A case of gliomatosis cerebri was studied with positron emission tomography (PET).
 Carbon-11-L-methionine (11C-Met) accumulated in the diffusely infiltrative tumorous area more widely and accurately than the lesion detected by conventional x-ray computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
 Autopsy findings three months after the time of the PET study showed good anatomical correspondence between the extent of densely aggregated tumor cells and the region with high uptake of 11C-Met.
 PET may offer an innovative approach in the delineation of gliomatosis cerebri, which has not been clearly recognized by CT or MR.
