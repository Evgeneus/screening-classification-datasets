Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung.
 Historically lymphoepithelioma was a term used to describe an undifferentiated mucosal carcinoma with a lymphocytic component arising only from the nasopharynx, although recently, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma has been found to occur as a primary tumor of the lung.
 Thus far, five patients have been documented as having this rare anatomical presentation.
 The patient that is being presented is the latest case of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma of the lung and will be compared clinically and histologically with the other four cases.
 The case is presented in order to discuss optimal methods of diagnoses and treatment for this condition.
