Thymic carcinoid.
 Carcinoid of the thymus is a rare neoplasm.
 Differentiation from thymoma is important because they have entirely different prognosis.
 A patient in whom a 19 x 18 x 12 cm carcinoid tumor of the thymus was surgically removed is presented.
 The tumor metastasized to peritracheal and internal mammary nodes, and invaded the SVC, pleura, lung, and pericardium.
 This is apparently the largest reported tumor of its kind.
 Prior to induction of anesthesia cardiopulmonary bypass and rigid bronchoscopy were readily available.
 Awake intubation was utilized.
 Even though long-term prognosis is poor, an aggressive surgical approach and adjuvant radiotherapy may achieve extended survival with excellent quality of life.
 Central aspects of the disease as well as pivotal therapeutic points are discussed.
