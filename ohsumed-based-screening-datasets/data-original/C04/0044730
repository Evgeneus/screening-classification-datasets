Staged sequential flap reconstruction for large lower lip defects.
 A method for the reconstruction of total or nearly total defects of the lower lip is described that utilizes a staged sequence of flaps that are familiar to most plastic surgeons.
 The recommended sequence is an extended Karapandzic flap to reestablish the oral sphincter, then two sequential Abbe flaps from the upper lip to restore balance and augment the central lower lip, and finally a commissureplasty using a sliding myomucosal flap in conjunction with final revision of the scars.
 Intervals of 3 weeks separate the surgical procedures.
 Using this strategy, essentially normal lip function and a relatively normal appearance have been obtained in four patients with large lip defects.
