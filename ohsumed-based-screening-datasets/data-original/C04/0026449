Bilateral eyelid myxomas in Carney's complex.
 A 21-year-old man with a history of an excised soft tissue mass of the groin and spotty cutaneous pigmentation underwent excision of nodules of the right lower and left upper eyelids.
 The patient subsequently had a cutaneous mass of the left ear removed.
 All excised lesions were classified as myxomas.
 A diagnosis of multiple myxoma, spotty pigmentation, and endocrine overactivity (Carney's) complex was made.
