Cerebrovascular malformation causing sudden death. Analysis of three cases and review of the literature.
 Three unusual cases of sudden death resulting from cerebrovascular malformation (CVM) are presented.
 CVMs are highly variable in location and morphology, and may be difficult to detect.
 Two of the patients discussed here had CVMs that involved the circle of Willis directly, and produced rapidly fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage at the base of the brain; both of these subjects were in their late 30s.
 One had a history of epilepsy; the other had been completely asymptomatic prior to the catastrophic event.
 The third was an asymptomatic 6 year old with a cerebellar CVM, who survived long enough for inconclusive neurosurgical intervention.
 In all three cases, the diagnosis was not made prior to autopsy; in one case, the circumstances of death were initially misleading.
 The relevant literature is reviewed and discussed, with emphasis on differential diagnosis, anatomic examination, and background investigation.
