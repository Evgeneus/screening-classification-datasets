Absence of synergistic effects of CNS treatments on neuropsychologic test performance among children.
 Three hypotheses are proposed to account for neurobehavioral impairments following treatment with cranial radiation therapy (CRT) and intrathecal (IT) chemotherapy: CNS treatments exert a synergistic effect (A x B), an additive effect (A + B), or a single-agent effect (A or B).
 Eighty-five long-term survivors of non-CNS cancers aged 6 to 16 years were classified into groups on the basis of CNS treatments: CRT-IT (n = 25), CRT-No IT (n = 11), No CRT-IT (n = 24), and No CRT-No IT (n = 25).
 Study I findings did not provide support for synergistic mechanisms; nonorthogonal analysis of variance showed interaction effects (CRT x IT) restricted to tactile-perceptual speed.
 However, main effects were significant for a single agent (CRT) across a wide range of measures.
 General intelligence, academic achievement, verbal knowledge and reasoning, and perceptual-motor abilities were found to be significantly lower among CRT-treated groups.
 Study II findings provided additional support for the role of CRT; Pearson correlations within the CRT-No IT group indicated significant negative associations between CRT dose estimates for cortical regions and perceptual-motor abilities.
