IIB osteosarcoma. Current management, local control, and survival statistics--Sao Paulo, Brazil.
 Ninety-two patients with IIB osteosarcoma of the extremities were treated with intraarterial (IA) cisplatinum (CDDP) followed by surgery [amputation (61.6%) or resection with endoprosthesis (38.4%)].
 Postoperative chemotherapy alternating adriamycin and CDDP was used.
 The total three-year survival was 62.1%, and the disease-free survival was 41.1%.
 The pathologic evaluation of the degree of tumor necrosis in response to the IA CDDP showed that in 53.2%, the necrosis was over 90%.
 The multivariate analysis of prognostic factors has shown that the highest survival was among females with tumors smaller than 15 cm.
 Patients with lesions equal to or larger than 15 cm were three times as likely to die of the disease.
 A second, more aggressive study is now underway, in which high dose methotrexate (HDMTX) is preoperatively combined with adriamycin and CDDP.
 Following operation, ifosfamide is added to the cases with a smaller degree of tumor necrosis, while the other group of patients will continue with HDMTX, in addition to CDDP and adriamycin (these last two drugs are used in both arms).
 Until now, complete remission has been achieved in 82% and 86%, respectively, with a follow-up examination varying from four to 26 months (average, 14 months).
 This is of extreme importance, because the majority of the authors' patients have tumors at initial evaluation larger than 10 cm in diameter.
