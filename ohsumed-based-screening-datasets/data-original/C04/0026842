Production of interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 by human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines.
 Cultured human keratinocytes and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cell lines were analyzed for the presence of ribonucleic acid (RNA) transcripts for the cytokines interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 and for these proteins.
 This study demonstrates that both cytokines are synthesized and secreted by both normal keratinocytes and SCC lines.
 The rate of secretion of these cytokines can be augmented in response to a variety of stimuli including tumor necrosis factor-alpha, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, transforming growth factor-beta and the combination of lipopolysaccharide and phorbol myristate acetate.
 Interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 have been reported to influence the proliferation of cultured human fibroblasts.
 However, these cytokines had no significant effect on the proliferation of human keratinocytes or the SCC lines tested.
 Although it seems unlikely that interleukin-1 or interleukin-6 could directly influence keratinocyte proliferation in vivo, the capacity of these cells to synthesize and release these cytokines supports earlier observations that keratinocytes may play an important role in augmenting an immune or inflammatory response.
