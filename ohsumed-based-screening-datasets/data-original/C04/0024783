Progesterone receptor in hepatocellular carcinoma. Correlation with androgen and estrogen receptors.
 Progesterone receptors (PgR), estrogen receptors (ER), and androgen receptors (AR) were assayed consecutively for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that was surgically removed from 19 men and three women.
 The methods of receptor assay were the enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for PgR and the dextran-coated charcoal (DCC) technique for ER and AR.
 The patients ranged in age from 32 to 77 years (average, 60.3 years).
 No patients had received any specific anti-cancer therapy before tissue collection.
 All patients but one had underlying liver disease: cirrhosis in 13 and chronic hepatitis in eight.
 The positive rate of each receptor was 18% for PgR, 48% for ER, and 82% for AR.
 The titer was highest for AR, intermediate for ER, and lowest for PgR.
 The titers of PgR in four PgR-positive patients ranged from only 1.1 to 3.0 fmol/mg of protein.
 There was no relationship between PgR, ER, and AR in terms of positivity and titer.
 Also, other clinical and histopathologic data did not influence the positivity or concentration of these three sex hormone receptors.
 It can be concluded that no or little PgR exists in the cytosol of untreated HCC.
