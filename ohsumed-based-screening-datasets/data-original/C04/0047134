Expression of the c-myc protein is down-regulated at the terminal stages during in vitro differentiation of B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells.
 The translocated c-myc oncogene in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) and murine plasmacytoma (MPC) has been proposed to be expressed at a stage of differentiation at which the gene is normally silent, resulting in a continuous proliferation and an inhibited terminal differentiation.
 To determine whether c-myc is differently expressed at the various stages of the differentiation pathway, we used B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, representing resting B lymphocytes, inducible to proliferation and/or differentiation in vitro.
 The c-myc protein, and Ig lambda-light chain and PCA-1 antigen as markers of B-cell maturation, were analyzed in single, morphologically defined cells by immunocytochemical double-staining.
 The proliferation of individual cells was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by analysis of Ki-67 antigen expression.
 The results show that the level of c-myc expression correlates to the stage of differentiation and to the proliferative activity.
 Uninduced resting cells did not express c-myc.
 The c-myc protein was observed in the highest amount at the proliferative B-lymphoblast stage of maturation and was reduced in plasmablasts and undetectable in plasma cells.
 The results suggest that maturation of B cells into nonproliferative, terminally differentiated plasma cells is associated with a downregulated c-myc expression and thus support the view that the deregulated c-myc gene in BL and MPC is expressed at an inappropriate stage of maturation and thereby inhibits terminal differentiation.
