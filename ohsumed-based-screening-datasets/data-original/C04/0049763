Endocrine therapy for desmoid tumors.
 Two female patients with desmoid tumors (aggressive fibromatosis) showed tumor regression after endocrine therapy.
 In one patient, tumor response to tamoxifen has been maintained over several years of treatment.
 In the second patient, who had inoperable mesenteric fibromatosis, the tumor progressed on tamoxifen but regressed after treatment with Zoladex (goserelin acetate, ICI, Melbourne, Australia) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA).
 To the authors' knowledge this is the first report of the use of Zoladex in the treatment of desmoid tumors.
 This review of the literature reveals that the biology of this disease is related to the endogenous hormonal environment and that estrogen receptors have been documented in desmoid tumors.
 Thirty-five cases are identified where endocrine agents have been employed, with a response rate of 51%.
 Furthermore, tumors may respond to second-line hormonal therapy after failing to respond to initial endocrine treatment.
 Endocrine treatments have also been used in other disorders of fibroblastic origin.
 The authors recommend that endocrine treatment be employed in inoperable desmoid tumors or where there has been postsurgical recurrence.
 In addition, the role for endocrine therapy in other soft tissue neoplasms should be determined.
