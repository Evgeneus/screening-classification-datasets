The clinical spectrum of hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases.
 Malignancy-related hypocalcaemia has received less attention in the literature than the opposite perturbation, hypercalcaemia.
 Only, scarce and contradictory data exist about hypocalcaemia associated with bone metastases (BMH).
 We have reviewed the clinical records of 155 patients with bone metastases of solid tumours, 122 of which were followed during the whole course of the disease until death.
 The frequency of hypocalcaemia ranged from 5 to 13%, depending on the formula used to correct calcium values for protein concentration.
 BMH was almost exclusively limited to patients with osteoblastic metastases.
 The frequency of BMH among patients with prostate carcinoma was 13-27%, depending on the formula used.
 Only two of 60 patients with lytic bone lesions presented hypocalcaemia, and in both cases it was rather mild.
 The development of hypocalcaemia did not seem to imply a worse prognosis, at least in patients with carcinoma of the prostate.
 Thus, the prevalence of BMH appears to be higher than is usually considered.
 Adequate attention should be given to this disorder because of the potentially deleterious effects on several organ systems.
