Brain tumor resection aided with markers placed using stereotaxis guided by magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography.
 In the operative resection of brain tumors, defining and locating edges of deep-seated tumors or those with indistinct color and consistency can be difficult.
 This report presents a simple yet precise, alternative method, using the basic Brown-Roberts-Wells or Cosman-Roberts-Wells stereotactic frame, for placement of visual markers to aid in tumor resections.
 The method can also be extended to the Leksell system.
 Using routine computed tomographic scanning or magnetic resonance imaging after stereotactic frame application, multiple points along tumor edges were used as target points.
 In the operating room, standard techniques were used for the skin incision, removal of the bone flap, and opening the dura.
 At each target point, after opening the dura and using stereotactic coordinates and equipment, a microbiopsy forceps was used to place "micropatties" (each with a string tail) or small catheters with pledgets or catheter tips located at tumor edges.
 After removing the arc, the tumor resection was accomplished in a conventional nonstereotactic manner by simply following string tails or catheters to the tumor.
 Gross tumor edges were determined from positions of actual patties or catheter tips.
 These simple but accurate techniques offer the possibility of tumor resections under stereotactic guidance with equipment readily available to most neurosurgeons.
 The fidelity of marker placement is also maintained in relation to tumor edges despite shifts in the tumor and/or brain as cystic areas are drained or large amounts of the tumor are resected.
