Vitreous changes and macular edema in central retinal vein occlusion.
 The condition of the posterior vitreous was determined in 56 eyes with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).
 Using a life-table analysis, it was studied in 56 eyes.
 The incidence of posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in the CRVO eyes at the first vitreous examination did not differ significantly from that in 64 age-matched control eyes.
 However, the incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes increased from 39.3% at the first vitreous examination to 58.5% after 6 months, and to 69.6% 1 year from the examination.
 The incidence of PVD in CRVO eyes during follow-up was statistically higher than that of the controls (P = .009).
 The incidence of PVD after the first vitreous examination was significantly higher in eyes with hemorrhagic retinopathy than in eyes with venous stasis retinopathy (P = .04).
 In the 34 eyes with macular edema, the edema lasted significantly longer in those with vitreomacular attachment (VMA) at the first examination than in those without VMA at this time (P = .02).
 VMA may play an important role in the pathogenesis and chronicity of macular edema in CRVO.
