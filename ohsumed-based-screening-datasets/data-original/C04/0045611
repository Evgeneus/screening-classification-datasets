Facial translocation: a new approach to the cranial base.
 Nasopharynx, clivus, and cavernous sinus are difficult regions of the cranial base in which to perform oncologic surgery.
 We have developed an approach to this area by using facial soft tissue translocation and craniofacial osteotomies.
 Surgical field obtained at the skull base can extend from the contralateral eustachian tube to ipsilateral geniculate ganglion.
 It includes the nasopharynx, clivus, sphenoid, and cavernous sinus, as well as the entire infratemporal fossa and superior orbital fissure.
 Our experience with this technique in 12 patients is reported.
 All patients healed primarily.
