Primary mucoid adenocarcinoma of the larynx.
 Mucous glands carcinomas of the larynx are rare, with most being represented by 'non-specific' adenocarcinoma and adenoid cystic carcinoma.
 Here we report a unique case of mucoid adenocarcinoma of the larynx occurring in a 46-year-old woman.
 Despite the presence of regional lymph node metastasis, she remained well four years after surgery.
