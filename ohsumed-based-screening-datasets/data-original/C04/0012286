The changing face of dermatology out-patient referrals in the south-east of Scotland.
 A study of out-patient dermatological services (NHS and private) in the south-east of Scotland was carried out by medical staff in the Department of Dermatology in Edinburgh during the month of November 1988.
 The aim was to assess changes in referral patterns and workload compared with the findings of an identical investigation undertaken in November 1981.
 Of particular interest were the possible effects of recent publicity campaigns aimed at increasing public awareness about skin cancer.
 The medical complement of the dermatology department had changed minimally since 1981 and the population increase in the south-east of Scotland over the same period was 1.5%.
 During November 1988 1592 new patients and 2037 review patients were seen.
 This represented an increase of 29.2% and 28.3%, respectively, since 1981.
 The most striking changes in diagnostic groups were a 173% rise in new cases presenting with benign tumours (excluding viral warts) and a 106% increase in new patients with malignant tumours.
 Viral warts and eczema were, as in 1981, the second and third most common diagnostic categories amongst new patients.
 There was a 98% increase in the number of surgical procedures performed on new patients compared with 1981.
 We conclude that the substantial increase in numbers of both benign and malignant tumours and the consequent doubling in surgical treatments was due to increased public awareness and concern about skin cancer.
