Giant enterocystoma within an infant's tongue.
 A rare developmental cyst within the tongue and submandibular triangle of a male infant containing heterotopic gastric and intestinal epithelium (enterocystoma) is described and its derivation discussed.
 This cyst was of such a size as to cause feeding difficulties and partial airway obstruction during sleep.
 Following C.T.
 scanning, total obstruction necessitated an emergency tracheostomy.
 Successful enucleation via a median labiomandibulotomy was performed without further complication and two years later there is no sign of recurrence.
