Visual outcome in pseudophakic eyes with clinical cystoid macular edema.
 Thirty-nine eyes with clinical cystoid macular edema (CME) following extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens (IOL) implantation were reviewed retrospectively.
 Chronic CME, defined as clinically symptomatic CME persisting more than 6 months, developed in 14 of the 39 eyes (36%): in 5 of the 7 (71%) eyes in which vitreous loss occurred and anterior chamber IOLs were implanted; and in 9 of 32 (28%) eyes in which no complications occurred and posterior chamber IOLs were implanted.
 The mean duration between diagnosis and last follow-up visit was 34 months.
 Only 4 of the 14 eyes (29%) with chronic CME achieved a visual acuity better than 20/40.
 Vitreous loss did not affect long-term visual prognosis.
