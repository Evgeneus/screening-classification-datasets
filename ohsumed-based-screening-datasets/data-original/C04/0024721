Allogeneic marrow transplantation in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase: a randomized trial of two irradiation regimens.
 A randomized trial was performed to compare two regimens of total body irradiation in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia treated by allogeneic marrow transplantation while in the chronic phase.
 All patients received cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg followed by total body irradiation and marrow from HLA-identical siblings.
 Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used for prophylaxis against acute graft-versus-host disease.
 Fifty-seven patients were randomized to receive 2.0 Gy fractions of irradiation daily for 6 days and 59 were randomized to receive 2.25 Gy fractions daily for 7 days.
 The probabilities of relapse at 4 years were 0.25 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.00 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .008).
 The actuarial probabilities of survival and relapse-free survival at 4 years were 0.60 and 0.58 among the patients who received 12.0 Gy compared with 0.66 and 0.66 for those who received 15.75 Gy.
 The 4-year probabilities of transplant-related mortality were 0.24 and 0.34 respectively (P = .13) while the probability of moderate to severe acute graft-versus-host disease was 0.33 for the 12.0 Gy group and 0.44 for the 15.75 Gy group (P = .15).
 The lower relapse probability in the patients receiving the higher dose of total body irradiation did not result in improved survival because mortality from causes other than relapse was increased.
