Detection of breast cancer.
 Routine screening has been shown to reduce the mortality from breast cancer in asymptomatic women.
 All women should be instructed in breast self-examination, and should begin a program of screening mammography and breast physical examination on an annual basis beginning at the age of 40.
 Most early breast cancers can be adequately treated without ablative surgery.
