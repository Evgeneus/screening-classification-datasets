Oncogene expression in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and invasive cancer of cervix.
 Expression of the oncogenes Ha-RAS, c-MYC, and ERB-2 was investigated with an automated image analysis system in 12 specimens of normal cervix, 10 of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1, 24 of CIN 3, and 10 of invasive cancer of the cervix.
 There was amplification of all three oncogenes in CIN 3 and invasive cancer compared with normal cervix and CIN 1.
 The difference was most pronounced with an antibody to the RAS p21 protein, with no overlap between CIN 3 and the normal range.
 This method might be useful in screening for cervical neoplasia, and for the determination of which CIN lesions require treatment.
