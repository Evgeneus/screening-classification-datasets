Carcinoma of the esophagus: CT vs MR imaging in determining resectability.
 MR imaging and CT were performed prospectively in 35 patients with esophageal carcinoma to determine the resectability of the primary tumors, because at our institution patients with resectable tumors have surgery regardless of the presence of distant metastases.
 Tumors with evidence of aortic or tracheobronchial invasion on MR or CT were considered to be unresectable.
 Tracheobronchial invasion was diagnosed when the tumor extended into the lumen of the airway, and aortic invasion was diagnosed when the triangular fat space between the esophagus, aorta, and spine adjacent to the primary tumor was obliterated.
 Two patients were excluded because of suboptimal MR images produced by motion artifacts.
 Pathologic proof was obtained from either surgery or autopsy in 31 patients.
 Of these, six patients (19%) had proved unresectable tumors (three aortic invasion and three tracheobronchial invasion).
 In all six cases, these features were correctly detected with both MR and CT.
 One patient had false-positive findings on MR and CT.
 An indeterminate diagnosis was obtained with MR in three patients and with CT in four patients.
 These incorrect or indeterminate results were all related to the diagnosis of aortic invasion.
 No patient had a false-negative result.
 When indeterminate diagnoses were considered false-positive, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for resectability were 100%, 84%, and 87%, respectively, for MR and 100%, 80%, and 84%, respectively, for CT.
 We conclude that MR and CT have nearly the same accuracy in predicting resectability of tumors in patients with esophageal carcinoma.
