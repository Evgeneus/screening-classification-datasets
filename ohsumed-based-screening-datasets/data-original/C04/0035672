Small hepatocellular carcinoma treated with percutaneous ethanol injection: MR imaging findings.
 Fifty-seven magnetic resonance (MR) imaging examinations were obtained at 0.5 T in 19 patients before and after percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) for 23 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lesions less than 3.5 cm in diameter.
 Seventeen patients also underwent MR imaging 6 months after completion of therapy.
 In 11 patients, computed tomography was performed before and after treatment.
 After PEI, fine-needle biopsy specimens were obtained in all cases.
 Before treatment, HCC lesions had low signal intensity on T1-weighted images in 13 cases, had the same signal intensity as normal liver parenchyma in six, and had high signal intensity in four; all 23 tumors had high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
 After treatment and at 6-month follow-up, all 21 lesions that contained no malignant cells at fine-needle biopsy had high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and had low signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
 The remaining two HCC lesions in which tumor necrosis was not achieved with PEI displayed a different MR pattern, since the residual neoplastic tissue showed no change in signal intensity on either T1- or T2-weighted images.
 The authors conclude that MR imaging may be useful for evaluating the effectiveness of PEI in achieving tumor regression.
