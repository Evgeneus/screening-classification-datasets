Acute phosphate depletion dissociates hormonal stimulated second messengers in osteoblast-like cells.
 The acute effect (24 h) of either phosphate depletion or phosphate surfeit on hormonal stimulated signal transduction systems was studied in the osteoblastic cell line UMR-106.
 Elevation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]in), induced by different calciotropic hormones (PTH, prostaglandin E2, endothelin) was blunted by acute phosphate depletion, whereas at high inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentrations the rise in [Ca2+]in was augmented.
 Basal [Ca2+]in was not altered by either Pi depletion or Pi excess.
 The effect of acute phosphate depletion on hormonal mediated [Ca2+]in rise was not observed in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ suggesting that under these conditions, the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, is not affected.
 Also, nonhormonal calcium entry pathways such as depolarization-activated calcium channels or protein kinase C-activated Ca2+ channels were not affected by acute phosphate depletion.
 cAMP accumulation in the cells, either through receptor or nonreceptor-mediated mechanisms, increased under low Pi conditions and decreased as Pi concentration in the culture media was progressively increased from 0 to 2 mM during 24 h of incubation.
 Changes in Pi concentration had no effect on basal cAMP generation by the cells.
 The facilitative effect of acute Pi depletion on agonist-induced cAMP accumulation could be demonstrated in both the presence and absence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (0.2 mM).
 PTH receptor binding assessed with [Nle8 Nle18 Tyr34] bovine PTH (1-34) NH2 was not altered by phosphate depletion.
 We conclude that exposure of osteoblasts to different Pi environments modulates the second messenger responses to hormones in a reciprocal fashion so that acute phosphate depletion down-regulates [Ca2+]in signals while augmenting cAMP generation and vice versa.
 Inasmuch as bone resorption processes can be modulated by Ca2+ and cAMP the data presented herein suggest that the altered bone resorptive response to calciotropic hormones (e.g.
 PTH), under surfeit or deficit of phosphate, is mediated by changes in [Ca2+]in and cAMP.
