Resting energy expenditure in patients with newly detected gastric and colorectal cancers.
 Resting energy expenditure (REE) was measured in 104 patients with newly detected gastric or colorectal (GCR) cancer and was compared with two groups of control subjects without cancer: healthy subjects (H control subjects) and patients with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal tract (GI patients).
 REE in GCR-cancer patients was not significantly different from REE in GI patients or H control subjects.
 Comparison of measured REE with predicted REE obtained from prediction equations may erroneously suggest that increased REE is a contributing factor in the development of cancer cachexia.
 No significant differences in REE were found when patients with liver metastases were compared with patients without metastases.
 There were no differences in REE between gastric and colorectal cancer patients.
 The decrease in energy expenditure, which normally occurs during starvation and weight loss in healthy men and women, could not be demonstrated in weight-losing, GCR-cancer patients.
 In conclusion, elevation of REE contributes little to the pathogenesis of cancer cachexia in GCR-cancer patients.
