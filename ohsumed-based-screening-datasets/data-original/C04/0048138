Inappropriate use of transillumination for breast cancer screening--Wisconsin, 1990.
 The overall effectiveness of early breast cancer detection efforts requires the appropriate use and maintenance of dedicated radiographic mammography systems.
 However, the effectiveness of early detection efforts can be compromised if proven technology is improperly used and/or maintained or if ineffective technology is successfully marketed as an equivalent or superior alternative to mammography.
 This report summarizes state and federal responses to the inappropriate use of a nonradiographic imaging technique in a breast cancer screening service advertised and used in Wisconsin in 1990.
