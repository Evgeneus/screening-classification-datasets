Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma in hepatolithiasis: A frequently overlooked disease.
 Five cases of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma were found among 101 cases of hepatolithiasis.
 There was no definite sign of cholangiocarcinoma in ERCP and image studies of four cases.
 The possibility of the existence of occult cholangiocarcinoma should be kept in mind, especially when unusual presentations, such as body weight loss, anemia, palpable abdominal mass, and intractable pain, appear.
 An intraoperative frozen-section examination should be considered under the following circumstances: (1) whitish nodular mass over liver, (2) mucinous substance within bile duct, and (3) enlarged, firm lymph nodes clustered along the hepatic arteries and/or celiac arteries.
