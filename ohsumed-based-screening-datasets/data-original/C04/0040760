Node negative breast cancer: the prognostic value of DNA ploidy for long-term survival.
 The DNA content of breast tumours from 170 patients who presented between 1978 and 1980 was measured by flow cytometry.
 The relationship between tumour ploidy and disease outcome was assessed and its association with other prognostic factors evaluated.
 Compared with those with diploid tumours, patients with aneuploid tumours had significantly earlier relapse and shorter survival (P less than 0.0001).
 Tumour ploidy was strongly related to grade (P less than 0.001), but there was no significant association between DNA ploidy and c-erb-B-2 expression, lymph node status or tumour size.
 In lymph node negative and c-erb-B-2 negative patients, aneuploid tumours were associated with a poorer prognosis (P less than 0.001) than diploid tumours.
 Multivariate analysis showed that tumour ploidy gave independent information on disease free and overall survival.
 Tumour ploidy may be used as an independent prognostic variable in patients with breast cancer and it may be helpful in defining patients within the node negative or c-erb-B-2 negative groups likely to have a poor outcome who might benefit from adjuvant treatment.
