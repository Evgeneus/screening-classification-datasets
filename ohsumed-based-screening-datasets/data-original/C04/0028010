The IPR inventory: development and psychometric characteristics.
 The purpose of this study was to develop, validate, and norm a measure of dimensions of interpersonal relationships that are salient to nursing: social support, reciprocity, and conflict.
 The selection of these concepts was guided by social exchange and equity theories.
 In the first phase of the study, 44 respondents were interviewed to provide narrative data from which to develop items so that items would be grounded in lived experience.
 Content validity of items was judged by a panel of 11 experts.
 The revised 39-item instrument was tested in successive steps with a total of 340 students, patients, and community residents for reliability and validity, including internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, factor analysis, and three forms of validity assessment (theory testing, contrasted groups, and multitrait-multimethod comparison).
 The three subscales of social support, reciprocity, and conflict demonstrated repeated internal consistency and test-retest reliability.
 Strong evidence of construct validity was demonstrated for the social support and the conflict subscales; validity of the reciprocity subscale was equivocal.
