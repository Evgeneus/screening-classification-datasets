A frameless, armless navigational system for computer-assisted neurosurgery. Technical note.
 A computer-assisted neurosurgical navigational system has been developed which displays intraoperative manipulation on the preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance (MR) images.
 The system consists of a three-dimensional digitizer, a personal computer, and an image-processing unit.
 Utilizing recently developed magnetic field modulation technology, the three-dimensional digitizer determines the spatial position and orientation angles of the resin probe, triangle-shaped pointer, or suction tube with a small attached magnetic field sensor.
 Four fiducial markers on the scalp were used to translate the spatial data of the probe onto the preoperative CT scans or MR images of the patient.
 With this frameless, armless navigational system, CT or MR-imaging stereotaxy can be applied to conventional open neurosurgery without limiting the operative field or interfering with the surgical procedures.
