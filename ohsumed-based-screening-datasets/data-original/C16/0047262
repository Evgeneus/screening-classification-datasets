Comparative in vitro activity of a new quinolone, fleroxacin, against respiratory pathogens from patients with cystic fibrosis.
 We evaluated fleroxacin, a newer fluoroquinolone, against isolates from sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis.
 These isolates included rough and mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Escherichia coli.
 Selected isolates were tested by the broth microdilution method to examine the influence of various pHs, inoculum sizes, and biological fluids (serum or sputum from patients with cystic fibrosis).
 Fleroxacin MICs for 50 and 90% of isolates of P.
 aeruginosa were 2.0 and 4 micrograms/ml, those for P.
 cepacia were 2 and 16 micrograms/ml, those for S.
 aureus were 0.5 and 1 microgram/ml, those for H.
 influenzae were 0.06 and 0.06 micrograms/ml, and those for E.
 coli were 0.01 and 0.03 micrograms/ml, respectively.
 Fleroxacin activity against mucoid P.
 aeruginosa was similar to the activities of enoxacin and ofloxacin but eightfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin.
 It was twofold more active than norfloxacin and enoxacin but was twofold less active than ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and nafcillin against S.
 aureus.
 Fleroxacin inhibitory activity against P.
 cepacia was two- to fourfold lower than that of ciprofloxacin but eightfold greater than those of the other quinolones tested.
 Alterations in pH, diluent, and inoculum size did not significantly affect fleroxacin activity.
 These results, combined with available pharmacokinetic and tissue distribution data, support the need for clinical evaluation of fleroxacin in pulmonary infections in patients with cystic fibrosis.
