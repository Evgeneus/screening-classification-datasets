Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum with systemic manifestations.
 We have reviewed the typical clinical manifestations of pseudoxanthoma elasticum and presented the case of a patient with involvement of the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system.
 We suggest that patients with periumbilical lesions that might indicate pseudoxanthoma elasticum have, at minimum, a full physical examination with emphasis on the cardiovascular system and a complete ophthalmologic evaluation.
