Telencephalic dysgenesis associated with presumptive maternal carbon monoxide intoxication in the first trimester of pregnancy.
 We report the association of telencephalic dysgeneses (expected to occur around week 6 of gestation) with presumptive maternal carbon monoxide intoxication.
 This case supports the hypothesis that carbon monoxide intoxication at critical periods of human brain development may lead not only to decreased brain size and hypoxic-ischemic lesions, but also to dysgeneses.
