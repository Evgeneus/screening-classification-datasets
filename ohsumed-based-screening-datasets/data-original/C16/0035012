Importance of the placenta and cord in the defense of neurologically impaired infant claims.
 Verdicts in favor of the defense were delivered in all 12 cases tried to a conclusion in which the placenta and/or cord was available for examination and was found to be abnormal or diseased and in which testimony was provided by a placental pathologist.
 The St Paul (Minn) Fire and Marine Insurance Company recommends that placenta/cord specimens be retained in cases where the mother is at high risk, the fetus/newborn has certain high-risk characteristics, and/or the placenta appears to be grossly abnormal.
 If a claim is made against the health care providers, the specimens can subsequently be examined by a placental specialist for possible trial testimony.
 The placenta may well be the key to a solid defense for these cases in the courtroom.
