Asymptomatic cor triatriatum incidentally revealed by computed tomography.
 We report a case of asymptomatic cor triatriatum in a 75-year-old man in whom the anomaly was incidentally revealed by computed tomography (CT).
 To our knowledge, this patient is the oldest case reported and the only such case in which the anomaly was demonstrated by CT.
