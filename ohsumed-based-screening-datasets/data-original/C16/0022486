Cosmetic treatment of shagreen patches in selected patients with tuberous sclerosis.
 Patients with mild forms of tuberous sclerosis may request cosmetic treatment of skin hamartomas.
 Treatment may consist of planning of an elevated shagreen patch with a Reese dermatome and/or laser treatment of facial angiofibromas.
 These precise patients, i.e., patients with a forme fruste of tuberous sclerosis, are more likely to have pulmonary involvement than patients with the usual complete disease form.
 A chest x-ray should be obtained in these patients to rule out pulmonary involvement.
 Half the patients with pulmonary involvement of tuberous sclerosis die an avoidable death from spontaneous pneumothoraces.
 Positive-pressure ventilation during anesthesia in these patients should be avoided or monitored closely.
