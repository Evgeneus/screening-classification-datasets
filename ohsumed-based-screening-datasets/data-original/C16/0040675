Etretinate and visual function: a 1-year follow-up study.
 Concern has been expressed in the literature that the drug etretinate may be potentially retinotoxic.
 Four patients are reported who have received long-term treatment with etretinate and who have undergone detailed evaluation for the development of visual dysfunction over a 1-year period.
 Despite prolonged treatment and high total doses no evidence of ocular toxicity attributable to the drug was found in any of the patients.
