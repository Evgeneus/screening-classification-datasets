Enhanced unscheduled DNA synthesis in UV-irradiated human skin explants treated with T4N5 liposomes.
 Epidermal keratinocytes cultured from explants of skin cancer patients, including biopsies from xeroderma pigmentosum patients, were ultraviolet light-irradiated and DNA repair synthesis was measured.
 Repair capacity was much lower in xeroderma pigmentosum patients than in normal patients.
 The extent of DNA repair replication did not decline with the age of the normal patient.
 Treatment with T4N5 liposomes containing a DNA repair enzyme enhanced repair synthesis in both normal and xeroderma pigmentosum keratinocytes in an irradiation- and liposome-dose dependent manner.
 These results provide no evidence that aging people or skin cancer patients are predisposed to cutaneous malignancy by a DNA repair deficiency, but do demonstrate that T4N5 liposomes enhance DNA repair in the keratinocytes of the susceptible xeroderma pigmentosum and skin cancer population.
