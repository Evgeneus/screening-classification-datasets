Expanding applicability of transplantation after multiple prior palliative procedures. The Paediatric Heart Transplant Group.
 The number of heart transplantations performed over the past 3 years has plateaued.
 However, the number of pediatric transplantations continues to slowly increase.
 Unlike adult heart transplantation, for which cardiomyopathy remains the most frequent indication, structural congenital heart disease is the primary indication in children.
 This report reviews our experience with orthotopic heart transplantation in the presence of structural congenital heart disease with and without prior palliative repair.
 The diagnoses included transposition of the great arteries, common atrium, left superior vena cava with and without a bridging innominate vein, dextrocardia, and univentricular configurations.
 The palliative repairs included Blalock-Taussig shunt, bilateral Glenn shunt, Fontan repair, and Mustard and Rastelli procedure.
 There were no early deaths.
 Two rejection-related late deaths have occurred at 8 months and at 3 years postoperatively.
 Extended use of donor tissue and modifications to surgical technique allowed for successful orthotopic heart transplantation in these patients who had structural congenital heart disease with and without prior surgical palliation.
