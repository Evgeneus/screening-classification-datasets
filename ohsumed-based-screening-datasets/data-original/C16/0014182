GB3 monoclonal antibody for the diagnosis of junctional epidermolysis bullosa: results of a multicenter study.
 GB3 monoclonal antibody detects a normal basement membrane component (GB3 antigen) that is variably expressed in junctional epidermolysis bullosa.
 To assess the accuracy of GB3 in the diagnosis of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, we have reviewed its use in 250 cases of the major types of epidermolysis bullosa.
 In the majority of cases of the simplex and dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, GB3 antigen is normally expressed.
 In the Herlitz variant of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, GB3 antigen expression is consistently abnormal, but in the non-Herlitz and indeterminate forms of junctional epidermolysis bullosa, 40% of cases express GB3 antigen normally.
 We propose that GB3 monoclonal antibody is useful in the accurate identification of patients with Herlitz junctional epidermolysis bullosa and may prove equal to electron microscopy for the diagnosis of this disease.
 For the non-Herlitz variants, it should not be used as an alternative to electron microscopy but may be of special value in the determination of prognosis.
