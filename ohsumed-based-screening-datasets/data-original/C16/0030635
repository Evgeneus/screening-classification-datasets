Developmental pathogenesis of defects associated with prenatal cocaine exposure: fetal vascular disruption.
 Prenatal exposure to cocaine is associated with a spectrum of defects that are secondary to interruption of blood flow to developing or previously developed structures.
 The defects include prenatal onset growth deficiency, prematurity, abruptio placentae, intercranial hemorrhage, nonduodenal intestinal atresia, limb reduction defects, urinary tract anomalies, and neurodevelopmental problems limited at present to the neonatal period.
