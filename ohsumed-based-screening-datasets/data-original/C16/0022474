Management of the chest-wall deformity in male patients with Poland's syndrome.
 The chest-wall deformity associated with Poland's syndrome was reconstructed in eight male patients 16 to 38 years old (average age 20 years).
 Follow-up ranged from 1 to 10 years.
 Two patients had custom silicone implants placed subcutaneously.
 In one of these patients, the edge of the implant could be seen.
 Three patients had transfer of an ipsilateral pedicled latissimus dorsi muscle flap with intact thoracodorsal nerve.
 All these patients had noticeable atrophy of the flap, and one underwent subsequent implantation of a custom silicone implant beneath the flap.
 Three other patients had a custom silicone implant covered immediately by a latissimus dorsi muscle flap.
 All four patients who had a combination of silicone implant and latissimus dorsi muscle flap had satisfactory correction of their deformity.
