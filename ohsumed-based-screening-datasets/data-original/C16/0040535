Ultrasonographic screening for the Down syndrome fetus.
 The usefulness of ultrasonography in detecting fetuses with Down syndrome in the second trimester has been the subject of considerable debate during the past 3 years.
 Conflicting reports have led to increasing confusion about the subject in the medical community and among the public.
 A review of the existing literature indicates that structural malformations that are chiefly cardiac are present in half of Down syndrome fetuses but are not consistently found during routine second-trimester ultrasonography.
 Although excess posterior nuchal skin-fold thickness is frequently present in infants with Down syndrome, it is also not consistently identified during second-trimester ultrasonographic examinations.
 Studies evaluating the efficacy of screening programs that are based on femur length shortening associated with Down syndrome have revealed markedly discrepant intercenter results.
 Although variations in methods may account for some of the observed variability, the magnitude of femoral shortening in Down syndrome suggests that this measurement may be only marginally useful.
 In summary, antenatal ultrasonography will allow for the detection of only those fetuses with Down syndrome who have multiple characteristic phenotypic features or anomalies.
 Moreover, current second-trimester ultrasonography does not appear to be either sensitive enough specific enough to be used as a unique Down syndrome screening modality; however, it may be a useful adjunct to maternal age and serum biochemical markers in the assignment of risk for Down syndrome.
