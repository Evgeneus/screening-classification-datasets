Full-field electroretinograms in patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome.
 We examined five patients who had carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome with full-field electroretinograms.
 Only two of the patients showed fundus changes typical for retinitis pigmentosa, whereas abnormal electroretinograms were seen in all patients.
 There was no recordable rod response; however, a delay in the cone b-wave implicit time was noted.
 All patients had nyctalopia.
 These observations suggest that patients with the carbohydrate-deficient glycoprotein syndrome have a progressive tapetoretinal degenerative disorder of the retinitis pigmentosa type with defined alterations in the electroretinogram.
