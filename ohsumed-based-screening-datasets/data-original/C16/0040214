Massive fetomaternal hemorrhage treated by fetal intravascular transfusion.
 Two cases of massive fetomaternal hemorrhage are presented.
 Both women noted a decrease in fetal movement and were advised to come to the hospital for fetal heart rate monitoring.
 Sinusoidal fetal heart rate patterns were observed and Kleihauer-Betke testing was positive for fetomaternal hemorrhage.
 The fetuses were preterm and therefore funipuncture was done, which confirmed profound anemia in both.
 Fetal intravascular transfusion was performed.
 Shortly after conclusion of the transfusion, prolonged bradycardia occurred in both fetuses and delivery was accomplished by cesarean.
 Both infants survived.
