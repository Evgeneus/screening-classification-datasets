The ventilatory response to endogenous CO2 in preterm infants.
 The measurement of the ventilatory response to inhaled CO2 is unphysiologic because the CO2 that normally stimulates breathing is endogenous (tissue or venous CO2).
 We took advantage of the spontaneous changes in alveolar PCO2 and ventilation occurring in preterm infants during periodic breathing to calculate the ventilatory response to endogenous CO2.
 This response was obtained in 20 infants and compared with those obtained using the more conventional methods of steady-state inhalation of CO2 (12 infants) and rebreathing of CO2 (11 infants); it was also compared with a transient change in alveolar CO2 obtained by inhalation of 7% CO2 in air for 10 s (CO2 "bolus"; 11 infants).
 All groups of infants had similar birth weight and gestational ages.
 To calculate the response to endogenous CO2, delta PACO2 was measured as the difference between lowest and highest PaCO2 and delta VE was the difference between the corresponding instantaneous ventilation.
 To adjust for circulation time, values for PACO2 were made lowest for the last breath before apnea and highest for the first breath after apnea.
 The coefficient of variation of the method was 8%.
 The slope of the ventilatory response to endogenous CO2 was 0.067 +/- 0.009 (mean +/- SE) L.min-1.kg-1.mm Hg PACO2(-1), a value greater than that using steady-state and rebreathing methods (0.038 +/- 0.004 and 0.040 +/- 0.006 L.min-1.kg-1.mm Hg PACO2(-1), respectively), but similar to that of infants inhaling a CO2 "bolus" (0.051 +/- 0.009 L.min-1.kg-1.mm Hg PACO2(-1)).
