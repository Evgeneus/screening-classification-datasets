Cloacal exstrophy: radiologic findings in 13 patients.
 Cloacal exstrophy is a complex, multisystem malformation that has not received much attention in the radiologic literature.
 The clinical histories and imaging studies of 13 cases of cloacal exstrophy proved surgically or at autopsy were reviewed.
 Radiologic observations were based on skeletal plain films (13), contrast-enhanced examinations of the genitourinary system (12), abdominopelvic sonograms (nine), gastrointestinal studies (seven), CT scans of the pelvis and CNS (seven), MR images of the pelvis and CNS (six), renal nuclear medicine scans (three), myelography (three), and three-dimensional scans of the pelvis (two).
 Genitourinary and gastrointestinal abnormalities identified in our 13 patients included bladder malformations (13), hindgut anomalies (13), undescended testes (five), malrotation (five), duplicated mullerian structures (four), and renal ectopia (four).
 Skeletal abnormalities included symphysis pubis diastasis (13), posterior element dysraphism (12), vertebral segmentation anomalies (12), clubfeet (six), and hip dislocations (five).
 CNS anomalies included meningocele (nine) and Chiari malformation (one).
 Immediate surgical closure of the defect with maximal bowel preservation and diverting colostomy offers optimal chances for survival.
 Appropriate preoperative gastrointestinal and genitourinary evaluation is essential.
