Left preureteral vena cava (retrocaval or circumcaval ureter) associated with partial situs inversus.
 We present a rare case of left preureteral vena cava associated with partial situs inversus.
 A 68-year-old woman was referred to our clinic for further study of left hydronephrosis on computerized tomography.
 The abdominal viscera were in mirror image and the heart was levocardia.
 The middle portion of the left ureter was dorsal to the left inferior vena cava.
 The left ureter was reanastomosed ventral to the inferior vena cava.
 To our knowledge, coexistence of preureteral vena cava and partial situs inversus has not been reported previously in the literature.
