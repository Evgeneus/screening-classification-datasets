Laparoscopic tubal sterilization under local anesthesia in women with cyanotic heart disease.
 Laparoscopic tubal sterilization under local anesthesia with intravenous sedation has been shown to be a safe procedure.
 However, the use of laparoscopy in patients with cyanotic cardiovascular disease is controversial and is generally contraindicated.
 Five women were referred with uncorrectable cyanotic heart disease and pulmonary hypertension.
 The mean preoperative arterial oxygen pressure was 56.2 +/- 5 mmHg (N = 5).
 After cardiology and cardiovascular anesthesia consultation and clearance, the patients underwent laparoscopic sterilization with Silastic rings under local anesthesia using direct trocar entry.
 Continuous hemodynamic monitoring and pulse oximetry were employed.
 The patients were kept in the intensive care unit or the hospital for 24 hours for monitoring, and all did well.
 This hospital for 24 hours for monitoring, and all did well.
 This small retrospective series demonstrates that laparoscopic sterilization under local anesthesia is a sterilization technique that may be suitable and safe for such patients when appropriate monitoring is performed.
 Tubal sterilization may be the contraceptive method of choice in women with heart disease when pregnancy is contraindicated.
