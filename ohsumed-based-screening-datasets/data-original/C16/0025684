Spontaneous near disappearance of bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas.
 Although coronary artery fistula is a relatively rare anomaly, it sometimes develops with advancing age, requiring surgical removal.
 We report a unique case of a patient whose bilateral coronary artery-pulmonary artery fistulas nearly disappeared in the course of four years.
 This case is interesting in view of recognizing one of the natural courses of this entity.
