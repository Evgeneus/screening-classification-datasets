Risks associated with an elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein level.
 Among 58,187 women tested, 1002 had a maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein measuring greater than or equal to 2.5 multiples of the median after correction for race, weight, and insulin-dependent diabetes.
 They were stratified into three groups: group 1, 2.5 to 2.9; group 2, 3.0 to 5.0; group 3, greater than or equal to 5.0 multiples of the median.
 The initial risk of a serious abnormality detected by ultrasonography or amniocentesis was 17% (5%, 12% and 65% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively).
 After correction for twins and dates, this risk became 23% (7%, 18%, and 71% in groups, 1, 2, and 3, respectively).
 Among the women with high maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein levels, 556 (77%) had normal ultrasonographic and amniocentesis studies, and the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome ws 27% (19%, 29%, and 70% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively).
 There was a statistically significant increase in late fetal and perinatal death, prematurity and growth retardation, oligohydramnios, abruptio placentae, preeclampsia, and congenital abnormalities.
 The overall risk for abnormality or adverse outcome was 24% in group 1, 41% in group 2, and 91% in group 3.
