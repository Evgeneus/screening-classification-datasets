Clinicopathologic review of twelve children with nephropathy, Wilms tumor, and genital abnormalities (Drash syndrome).
 The clinicopathologic and radiologic features of 12 children with complete and incomplete forms of Drash syndrome are reported.
 Their common denominator was a nephropathy.
 Four had the full triad, consisting of nephropathy, Wilms tumor, and genital abnormalities; five had nephropathy and genital abnormalities, and three had nephropathy and Wilms tumor.
 Of the 11 children who had proteinuria, eight had the nephrotic syndrome.
 Of the 10 whose condition progressed to end-stage renal failure, seven were less than 3 years of age.
 The histologic features of Wilms tumor were favorable in all seven children, and the tumor was bilateral in three.
 Of the nine patients who had genital abnormalities, eight had 46,XY karyotype and either ambiguous genitalia (six patients) or normal female phenotype (two).
 One other patient had a normal 46,XX female karyotype and phenotype but had both mullerian and wolffian structures and a streak ovary.
 Nine patients had a distinct pelvicaliceal abnormality not previously reported as a feature of this syndrome.
 Other congenital abnormalities were aniridia, mental retardation, deafness, nystagmus, and cleft palate.
 This syndrome must be considered in any infant with unexplained nephropathy, particularly in young phenotypic female infants and in those children with ambiguous genitalia or Wilms tumor with an early presentation.
