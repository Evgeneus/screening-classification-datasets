Cholesterol localization in ultrathin frozen sections in Schnyder's corneal crystalline dystrophy.
 We examined a 57-year-old woman who had bilateral corneal crystalline deposits associated with xanthelasma.
 The patient's son had bilateral stromal haze.
 Plasma cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I and B levels were normal.
 Histopathologic examination disclosed lipid deposits, particularly in the superficial stroma and Bowman's layer.
 These deposits stained with oil red O and filipin, a fluorescent probe that specifically detects unesterified cholesterol.
 Cryoultramicrotomy disclosed more specific ultrastructural localization of unesterified cholesterol with an array of crystals resembling multiple plates in extracellular corneal tissue.
