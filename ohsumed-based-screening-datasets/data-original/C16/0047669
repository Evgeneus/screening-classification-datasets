Cardiac tamponade and hydrothorax as complications of central venous parenteral nutrition in infants.
 The recent use of soft catheters made of silastic polymeric silicone or polyurethane has decreased the incidence of perforation of great veins or right-sided heart chambers but has not eliminated it as had been hoped.
 Two premature infants who presented with cardiac tamponade more than 24 hr after the insertion of a 23-gauge silastic catheter for total parenteral nutrition (TPN) administration are described.
 In one infant, bilateral hydrothorax preceded the occurrence of cardiac tamponade.
 Osmotic injury to great vessels and/or myocardium seems to be the common mechanism but which these complications of intraluminal catheters are produced.
 Review of the pediatric literature revealed a proportion of low birth weight infants among the reported cases.
 Despite a prohibitively high mortality rate, early recognition can prevent a fatal outcome.
