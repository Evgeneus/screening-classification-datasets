Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery. Surgical alternatives depending of the age of the patient.
 Four cases of anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery, three of which were operated upon in our Centre, are presented.
 An aortocoronary bypass with reversed autologous saphenous vein was carried out in both of the children; and in the adult, the anomalous ostium was closed from the interior of the pulmonary artery.
 After 84, 72, and 4 months of evolution, respectively, they were found to be asymptomatic, the mitral insufficiency had disappeared and the venous graft remained patent.
 In this paper, the clinical form of presentation, diagnostic possibilities and surgical treatment are analysed.
