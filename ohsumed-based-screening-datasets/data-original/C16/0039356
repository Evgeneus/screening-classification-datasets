Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: more potential transplant recipients than suitable donors 
 Neonatal cardiac transplantation offers the prospect of survival for babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome--but only if suitable donors are available.
 In a retrospective survey in the Northern health region of England and Wales, the likely need for neonatal cardiac transplantation far outweighed the potential availability of donors.
 Over 8 years (1983-90) hypoplastic left heart syndrome was identified in 38 newborn babies and in 9 fetuses in utero.
 Of 41 live births (including 3 diagnosed prenatally) 31 would have been candidates for a cardiac transplant, but only 4 suitable donors could be identified (3 with anencephaly born alive during the same period and 1 who died between 1979 and 1986 after a head injury).
 Analysis of all infant deaths in 1987-89 revealed only 3 potential donors from 426 deaths in the 3 years.
 Although more widespread antenatal diagnosis may lead to fewer liveborn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, these findings indicate that an alternative source of donors needs to be identified before neonatal cardiac transplantation can be widely used in the treatment of this disorder.
