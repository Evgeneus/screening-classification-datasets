Preoperative and postoperative evaluations by means of three-dimensional computed tomography in cases of Chiari osteotomy.
 Three-dimensional computed tomography was employed to investigate the changes of pelvic and hip morphology in nine adult cases of congenital hip dysplasia.
 Six cases were treated with Chiari pelvic osteotomy and were reexamined postoperatively using the same technique.
 This new method clearly showed a number of important anatomic features that were not easy to detect with conventional roentgenography.
 Information provided by three-dimensional computed tomography imaging is useful in selecting the appropriate type of surgical treatment and in evaluating the results of Chiari pelvic osteotomy.
