Unusual opening of coronary sinus in atrioventricular septal defects.
 The coronary sinus is an important landmark for the position of the atrial component of the atrioventricular conduction axis and, thus, assumes special relevance to the surgeon in the operating room.
 We describe here 2 patients with atrioventricular septal defect characterized by an unusual termination of the coronary sinus within the left atrium.
 We discuss the potential importance of this finding to the disposition and surgical avoidance of the conduction tissues.
