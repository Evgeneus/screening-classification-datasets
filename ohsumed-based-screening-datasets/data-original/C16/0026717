Aerosolized surfactant treatment of preterm lambs.
 To evaluate the potential for aerosolized surfactant treatments of surfactant deficiency, twin lamb fetuses were delivered at 130-132 days gestational age and received nebulized natural surfactant (Neb NS), nebulized Survanta (Neb Surv), tracheally instilled natural surfactant (Inst NS), or nebulized saline (Neb Saline).
 Neb NS and Neb Surv groups had significant increases in ventilatory efficiency index and dynamic compliance values (P less than 0.05).
 Both groups also had pressure-volume curves that were comparable to the Inst NS group.
 The Neb Saline control group had deterioration of the ventilation efficiency index and dynamic compliance values over time as well as pressure-volume curves that demonstrated smaller lung volumes compared with all three surfactant-treated groups (P less than 0.01).
 Delivery of aerosolized surfactant to the lung was only approximately 2 mg lipid/kg for the nebulized groups, a dose one-twentieth of that previously noted to be effective in instillation protocols.
 Distribution histograms of the aerosolized surfactant-treated groups differed from the instilled animals as there was more deposition in the right upper lobes and tracheae in the nebulized groups compared with the instilled group (P less than 0.05).
 Pulmonary blood flow was not altered by aerosolized surfactant treatment.
 Administration of aerosolized surfactant to preterm lambs improved lung function at a very low surfactant dose.
