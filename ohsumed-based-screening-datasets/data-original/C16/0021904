Pulmonary artery morphology and hemodynamics in pulmonic valve atresia with ventricular septal defect before and after repair.
 Cardiac catheterization and angiography were performed in 22 patients with pulmonic valve atresia and ventricular septal defect to evaluate pulmonary morphology and hemodynamics before and after repair.
 In 12 of the 22, pulmonic valve atresia and ventricular septal defect were associated with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries, which were ligated in most.
 Mean postoperative pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) ranged from 9 to 92 mm Hg (mean 28 +/- 19) and pulmonary vascular resistance ranged from 1.1 to 35.2 U.m2 (mean 6.4 +/- 8.0).
 These data correlated (r = 0.89, p less than 0.001).
 The number of pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries was 22 to 42 (mean 38 +/- 6).
 Univariate analysis revealed that the mean postoperative PAP correlated with the number of pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries (r = -0.81, p less than 0.001), with mean postoperative PAP (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001), with the postoperative pulmonary artery area index of the right and left pulmonary arteries at prebranching (r = -0.76, p less than 0.001), and with the sum of the pulmonary artery areas after branching (r = -0.69, p less than 0.005).
 Pulmonary vascular resistance correlated with the number of pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries (r = -0.85, p less than 0.001), with the mean preoperative PAP (r = 0.79, p less than 0.001), with the sum of the pulmonary artery areas after branching (r = -0.73, p less than 0.001), and with the postoperative pulmonary artery area index (r = -0.70, p less than 0.001).
 The incidence of pulmonary vascular resistance being less than 3 U.m2 was significantly higher in patients with greater than 36 pulmonary artery subsegments connected to the central pulmonary arteries and with a preoperative pulmonary artery area index greater than 0.5 (88%) (p less than 0.01).
