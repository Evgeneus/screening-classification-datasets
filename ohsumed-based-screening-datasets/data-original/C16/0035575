Maternal left ventricular dimension in pregnancies complicated by fetal growth retardation.
 Previous studies using two-dimensional chest radiographs have found a significant correlation between prematurity, fetal growth retardation, and the size of the maternal heart.
 Accordingly, we evaluated maternal left ventricular size and function by M-mode echocardiography near the end of gestation in 42 women with suspected fetal growth retardation and in 79 women whose pregnancies were normal.
 No significant differences were found between the two groups, implying that maternal left ventricular size and function is adequate in pregnancies complicated by "idiopathic" fetal growth retardation.
