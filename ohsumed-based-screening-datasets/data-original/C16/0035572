A randomized comparison of umbilical vein and intravenous oxytocin during the puerperium.
 Oxytocin was administered in a randomized fashion via either the umbilical or maternal intravenous route.
 Women who received intraumbilical oxytocin had significantly greater calculated blood loss compared with those who received peripheral administration (P = .01).
 This greater blood loss was confirmed by a decrease in hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations after delivery.
 There was no difference between the groups in the length of the third stage of labor.
 The incidence of fetomaternal transfusion was higher in the intraumbilical group (P = .07).
 We conclude that intraumbilical oxytocin is no more beneficial than peripheral administration.
