Neonatal asphyxia: vulnerability of basal ganglia, thalamus, and brainstem.
 Two infants who suffered acute intrapartum asphyxia resulting in severe neonatal encephalopathy are described.
 Although computed tomography revealed no abnormalities, magnetic resonance imaging documented unequivocal lesions in the thalamus, basal ganglia, parasagittal cortex, brainstem tectum, and midline cerebellum in one patient and in the basal ganglia and parasagittal cortex in the other.
 Thus, magnetic resonance imaging was more sensitive than computed tomography in detecting acute brain damage after neonatal asphyxia and may become an important tool in improving our understanding of the relationship between adverse perinatal events, neonatal encephalopathy, and neurologic morbidity.
