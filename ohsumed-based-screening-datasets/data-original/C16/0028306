Retinochoroidal coloboma and subretinal neovascularization.
 Subretinal neovascularization associated with retinochoroidal coloboma is rare.
 To the authors' knowledge, only three cases have been reported.
 We report a new case of isolated subretinal neovascularization and coloboma in a 26-year-old woman without other causes of choroidal neovascularization.
 Only the disruption of the normal retinal anatomy could explain the development of this subretinal neovascularization.
