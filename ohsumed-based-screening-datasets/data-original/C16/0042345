Intrapulmonary agenesis of venous system and bronchopulmonary arterial anastomosis.
 Agenesis of the intrapulmonary and extrapulmonary veins of the right lung was found by angiography and histological examination in a three year old boy.
 Blood supplied by the intersegmental arteries drained via the pulmonary arteries of the right lung into main and left pulmonary arteries.
 This caused a shunt between the aorta and pulmonary artery.
 Agenesis of the pulmonary venous system as a cause of left to right shunt has not been reported before.
