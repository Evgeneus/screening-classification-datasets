True hermaphroditism: sonographic demonstration of ovotestes.
 A 15-year-old boy with normal external genitalia presented with severe bilateral gynecomastia, intermittent painful scrotal swelling, and a recent history of scrotal trauma.
 Ultrasound (US) revealed testicles of normal size with diffusely heterogeneous echotexture due to scattered cysts.
 Ovotestes were found at surgery and pathologic examination.
 Bilateral partial gonadectomies were performed.
 Four months later he had testicular pain and swelling.
 US revealed bilateral multiseptate cystic masses.
 After repeat surgery, he is now free of symptoms.
 The diagnosis of true hermaphroditism and ovotestis should be considered in a phenotypic male adolescent with gynecomastia when testicular parenchyma is heterogeneous at US because of multiple scattered cysts.
