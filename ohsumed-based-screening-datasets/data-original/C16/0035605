Calcium and cAMP activate different chloride channels in the apical membrane of normal and cystic fibrosis epithelia.
 The genetic disease cystic fibrosis (CF) causes decreased Cl- transport in several epithelia.
 cAMP-dependent regulation of apical membrane Cl- channels is defective in CF airway epithelia; as a result, CF epithelia fail to secrete Cl-.
 In contrast, Ca(2+)-stimulated Cl- secretion is intact in CF airway epithelia and thus has the potential to bypass the CF Cl- secretory defect.
 For a Cl- channel to govern Cl- secretion, it must be located in the apical membrane.
 To specifically investigate apical membrane Cl- channels, we studied cells grown on permeable filter supports and measured Cl- currents across the apical membrane.
 We found that Ca2+ and cAMP activate different Cl- channels in the apical membrane.
 (i) Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels were present in the apical membrane of airway but not in intestinal epithelia.
 (ii) cAMP- but not Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels were defective in CF airway epithelia.
 (iii) Ca(2+)- but not cAMP-activated Cl- channels were blocked by 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonate.
 (iv) Ca(2+)- and cAMP-activated apical channels had different anion permeabilities.
 (v) An increase in both second messengers produced an additive increase in Cl- current.
 These results also explain the puzzling observation that Ca(2+)-stimulated Cl- secretion is defective in CF intestine: the Ca(2+)-activated Cl- channels that could circumvent the Cl- secretory defect in CF airway are missing from the apical membrane of intestinal epithelia.
