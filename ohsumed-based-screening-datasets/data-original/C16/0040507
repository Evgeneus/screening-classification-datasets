Genetic support groups in the delivery of comprehensive genetic services.
 This research sought information about the services provided by genetic support groups, their members' experiences in obtaining genetic and related services, and members' recommendations for improving services.
 Results from a survey of 43 directors of genetic support groups showed that these organizations not only provide their members with a wide range of informational and supportive services but also address the need for education of both the public and health professionals about genetic disorders.
 A second survey of 931 members of genetic support groups found that, although they obtained genetic information from a variety of professional and informal sources, many of them experienced barriers to obtaining sufficient genetic information.
 Respondents called for professionals to improve their interpersonal skills in working with clients and to assist families in obtaining a wider variety of services.
 On the basis of these findings, a service model and priorities are proposed to bring together genetic specialists, community professionals, and genetic support groups for the delivery of comprehensive services to individuals and families with genetic disorders.
