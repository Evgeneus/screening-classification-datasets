Perspectives on the pathophysiology of fetal alcohol syndrome.
 Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a major known cause of fetal malformations and mental retardation.
 Prevention/intervention of FAS can only be achieved with identification of the mechanisms by which alcohol induces birth defects.
 The purpose of this paper is to discuss the data on possible mechanisms of FAS, and to give a number of suggestions for future research areas.
