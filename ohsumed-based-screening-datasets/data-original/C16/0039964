A novel method to maintain ductus arteriosus patency.
 Survival of patients with certain ductal-dependent congenital heart diseases depends on continued patency of the ductus arteriosus or the surgical creation of an aortopulmonary shunt.
 The latter may be difficult in the presence of hypoplastic pulmonary arteries.
 Long-term prostaglandin therapy may be used to maintain ductal patency but is not without limitation and side effects.
 This experimental study describes a novel approach to maintain ductal patency with a stainless steel stent.
 Six newborn lambs less than or equal to 48-h old had a ductal stent placed during right heart catheterization.
 Two lambs less than 36-h old had a stent delivered by the arterial route.
 The stent was delivered and released at the target with relative ease and no incidence of embolization.
 Continued ductal patency up to 3 months was demonstrated by repeat cardiac catheterization and angiography, two-dimensional color Doppler echocardiography and postmortem examination.
 The experimental model provides a left to right shunt model in which the size may be increased as the animal grows.
 More important, a ductal stent could be used to maintain ductal blood flow in neonates and infants with ductal-dependent cardiac malformations, thereby avoiding a thoracotomy.
