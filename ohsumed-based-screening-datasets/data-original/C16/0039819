Congenital atresia of left main coronary artery: proposed mechanism for severe disabling angina in a patient with non-atherosclerotic single right coronary artery--a case report.
 A patient with progressive disabling angina was found to have a single right coronary artery with atresia of the left main coronary artery, and absence of any obstructive coronary disease.
 The patient required aortocoronary by-pass surgical reconstruction of a left main coronary artery to control her angina.
 Possible mechanisms for the development of her anginal pain are briefly discussed.
