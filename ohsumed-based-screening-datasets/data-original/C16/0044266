Malignant schwannoma associated with xeroderma pigmentosum in a patient belonging to complementation group D.
 A 43-year-old man with xeroderma pigmentosum, XP97TO, was allocated to complementation group D.
 He had had moderate photosensitivity at age 1 year and freckles by age 6 but no neurologic abnormalities.
 Nevertheless, his fibroblasts in culture had the XP-D phenotype.
 They showed a sevenfold hypersensitivity to killing by 254 nm ultraviolet radiation and a diminished level (29%) of unscheduled DNA synthesis.
 Phototesting revealed delayed maximum erythema at 72 hours after UVB exposure and a lowered minimal erythema dose.
 Lentigo maligna developed on the patient's face, and a rapidly growing malignant schwannoma was found on the left trigeminal nerve.
 This may be the first case of a peripheral nervous tissue neoplasm in xeroderma pigmentosum.
