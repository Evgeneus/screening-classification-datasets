Endocrine pancreatic function in growth-retarded fetuses.
 Maternal-fetal glucose gradient and fetal plasma glucose, insulin, and glucagon were measured in 63 fetuses: 34 controls and 29 with growth retardation (nine with and 20 without end-diastolic frequencies in the umbilical artery).
 Maternal-fetal glucose gradient and fetal glucagon levels were higher in the growth-retarded group than in controls (P less than .001), whereas fetal insulin and glucose concentrations were lower (P less than .001).
 Although maternal-fetal glucose gradient, fetal glucose, and insulin concentrations were similar among the growth-retarded fetuses, fetuses without end-diastolic frequencies in the umbilical artery had higher fetal glucagon levels (P = .01) than those with end-diastolic frequencies.
 In growth-retarded fetuses, the increase in fetal glucagon might reflect a compensatory response to hypoglycemia and appears to be a better index of fetal compromise than is glucose or insulin.
