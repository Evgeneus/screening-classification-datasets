Neonatal small bowel atresia, stenosis and segmental dilatation.
 In 8 years, 44 neonates were treated for small bowel atresia, stenosis or segmental dilatation by one surgical team.
 There was a single lesion in 30 infants and 14 had two or more sites of intestinal obstruction.
 Associated gastrointestinal abnormalities were found in 23 (52 per cent) patients.
 Resection of the atresia(s) and primary anastomosis were performed in 34 infants and staged procedures were carried out in ten patients with complicated lesions.
 Patients undergoing staged procedures had a higher complication rate than those having primary repair (six out of ten and 11 out of 34 respectively).
 The overall initial survival rate was 93 per cent, rising to 100 per cent in those without associated anomalies or prenatal complications, but more than a quarter (27 per cent) of survivors have long-term disabilities.
