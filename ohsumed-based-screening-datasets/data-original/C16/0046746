Aortic root blood flow increases after pancuronium in neonates with hyaline membrane disease.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of muscle paralysis on aortic root blood flow in preterm infants with hyaline membrane disease.
 DESIGN: Each patient served as his/her own control in a prospectively controlled trial.
 SETTING: Neonatal ICU in a university hospital.
 PATIENTS: Ten ventilator-dependent preterm infants weighing 800 to 2820 g, 0 to 8 days of age, with hyaline membrane disease and seven control patients.
 INTERVENTIONS: Noninvasive measurement of aortic root blood flow by Doppler echocardiography 30 min before and 60 min after respiratory paralysis with 0.1 to 0.5 mg/kg of iv pancuronium, or following ventilator changes in control subjects.
 RESULTS: Mean aortic root blood flow increased significantly (p less than .001), from 212 to 276 mL/min.kg, accompanied by significant increases in stroke volume and heart rate.
 CONCLUSIONS: Pancuronium bromide may have a direct beneficial effect on the circulation of preterm infants with hyaline membrane disease.
