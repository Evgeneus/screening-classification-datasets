Interpretative views on Hispanics' perinatal problems of low birth weight and prenatal care.
 From a public health perspective, there is a need to recognize that Hispanics, and in particular Mexican Americans, are a very heterogeneous group.
 They represent all shades of acculturation, education, income, and citizenship status.
 As this minority group continues to increase in numbers, pertinent information about their perinatal health problems in the context of their sociocultural characteristics will be required.
 This review examines critically the recent literature related to low birth weight and prenatal care and suggests alternative ways to address these perinatal health issues.
 Low birth weight is examined in the context of the problem of intrauterine growth retardation and the potential mechanisms and consequences of different types of growth limitation in utero which have not been studied in this population.
 The use of prenatal care by Mexican American women and its association with birth weight is examined as an indication of maternal behavior or as a health care intervention.
 The implications for public health policy are discussed in relation to the identification, interpretation, and evaluation of these perinatal health issues in this minority population.
