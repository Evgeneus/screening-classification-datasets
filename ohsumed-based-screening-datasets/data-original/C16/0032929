High-energy orbital dislocations: the possibility of traumatic hypertelorbitism.
 In a 4-year period from 1983 to 1987, 7160 patients with blunt injuries were admitted to the Maryland Institute of Emergency Medical Services Systems Shock Trauma Center.
 Facial injuries occurred in 10 percent of this population.
 High-energy fractures (characterized by computed tomography) were seen in approximately 10 percent of these patients.
 In this high-energy group, five cases of high-energy orbital dislocations, some representing examples of traumatic hypertelorbitism, were observed.
 They represent 1.5 percent of the 342 midface fractures observed and 4.8 percent of the naso-orbital ethmoid fractures observed (105 patients).
 One additional patient is described who was seen at the UCLA Medical Center for late repair of the condition.
 High-energy impacts of the upper midface created fractures of both orbits, zygomas, and nasoethmoidal regions permitting lateral transposition, enlargement, and divergence of the orbits.
 Interorbital, intercanthal, and interpupillary distances were increased, criteria that confirm the diagnosis of hypertelorbitism.
 Fifty percent of the patients were bilaterally blind, and one patient sustained unilateral blindness.
