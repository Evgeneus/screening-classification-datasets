Anaesthesia for Proteus syndrome.
 A 14-year-old boy with Proteus syndrome presented for orthopaedic surgery to his legs.
 No report in the literature exists on anaesthesia for this condition.
 Our patients posed airway problems that were managed by tracheal intubation under sedation using a fibreoptic bronchoscope.
 Anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone and maintained with nitrous oxide and isoflurane in oxygen.
 His lungs were ventilated mechanically throughout surgery, which was uneventful.
