Ketamine, midazolam and vecuronium infusion. Anaesthesia for Down's syndrome and congenital heart disease.
 A ketamine, midazolam and vecuronium infusion was used for total intravenous anesthesia in a patient with Down's syndrome, a ventricular septal defect and pulmonary hypertension.
 A mixture of ketamine 200 mg, midazolam 5 mg and vecuronium 12 mg in 50 ml of normal saline was infused at 0.5 ml/kg/hour.
 This simple technique and ventilation with 100% oxygen maintained tissue oxygenation and cardiovascular stability.
