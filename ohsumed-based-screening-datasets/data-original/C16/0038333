Cystic adrenal masses in the neonate associated with hemihypertrophy and the relation to the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.
 We report 2 cases of unilateral, multilocular, cystic adrenal masses in neonates.
 Both patients demonstrated somatic hemihypertrophy, which is considered to have the same implications as the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome in terms of tumor risk.
 Pathological examination showed multiple, adrenal cysts without evidence of tumor or routine adrenal hemorrhage.
 This finding appears to represent a previously unreported association between the spectrum of hemihypertrophy/Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and benign cystic adrenal disease.
