The Fontan procedure: a historical review.
 Complete bypass of the right ventricle was first performed successfully and subsequently reported by Fontan and Baudet for patients with tricuspid atresia.
 By eliminating congenital and surgical shunts, ventricular volume overload and pulmonary hypertension were avoided.
 A logical extension of its predecessor, the partial right heart bypass procedure introduced by Glenn, the Fontan operation has great application for patients with various forms of univentricular heart.
 It is one of the historic advances in the surgical treatment of congenital heart disease.
