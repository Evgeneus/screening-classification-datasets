cAMP-inducible chloride conductance in mouse fibroblast lines stably expressing the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator.
 A cAMP-inducible chloride permeability has been detected in mouse fibroblast (L cell) lines upon stable integration of a full-length cDNA encoding the human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR).
 As indicated by a Cl(-)-indicator dye, the Cl- permeability of the plasma membrane increases by 10- to 30-fold within 2 min after treatment of the cells with forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase.
 The properties of the conductance are similar to those described in secretory epithelial cells; the whole-cell current-voltage relationship is linear and there is no evidence of voltage-dependent inactivation or activation.
 In contrast, this cAMP-dependent Cl- flux is undetectable in the untransfected cells or cells harboring defective cDNA constructs, including one with a phenylalanine deletion at amino acid position 508 (delta F508), the most common mutation causing cystic fibrosis.
 These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the CFTR is a cAMP-dependent Cl- channel.
 The availability of a heterologous (nonepithelial) cell type expressing the CFTR offers an excellent system to understand the basic mechanisms underlying this CFTR-associated ion permeability and to study the structure and function of the CFTR.
