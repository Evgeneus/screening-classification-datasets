Hypoplastic left heart syndrome: hemodynamic and angiographic assessment after initial reconstructive surgery and relevance to modified Fontan procedure 
 After undergoing initial reconstructive surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome performed between August 1985 and March 1989, 59 patients (age range 3 to 27 months, mean 13.8 +/- 4.5) underwent elective cardiac catheterization in anticipation of a modified Fontan procedure.
 Five important hemodynamic and anatomic features considered to be components of successful reconstructive surgery were specifically addressed.
 1) Interatrial communication: Only two patients had a measured pressure difference of greater than 4 mm Hg across the atrial septum.
 2) Tricuspid valve function: Angiography demonstrated significant tricuspid valve regurgitation in only five patients (moderate in two and severe in three).
 3) Aortic arch: Pressure tracings from the right ventricle to the descending aorta revealed a gradient greater than 25 mm Hg in only two patients.
 4) Pulmonary vasculature: Ten patients had a calculated pulmonary vascular resistance greater than 4 U.m2; 51 (86%) of the 59 patients had no evidence of distortion (stenosis or hypoplasia) of either the left or the right pulmonary artery.
 5) Right ventricular function: Five patients had an end-diastolic pressure in the right ventricle greater than 12 mm Hg and two patients had qualitative assessment of decreased ventricular function.
 Comparison of catheterization data between survivors and nonsurvivors of the subsequent modified Fontan procedure showed that only significant tricuspid regurgitation is a possible predictor of poor outcome.
 After first stage reconstructive surgery for hypoplastic left heart syndrome, most survivors have favorable anatomy and hemodynamics at follow-up cardiac catheterization for a subsequent Fontan procedure.
