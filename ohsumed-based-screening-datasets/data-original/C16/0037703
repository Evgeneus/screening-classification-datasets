Absent left main coronary artery: angiographic findings in 83 patients with separate ostia of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries at the left aortic sinus.
 Among 20,332 adult patients who underwent consecutive cardiac catheterization and coronary arteriography, 83 (0.4%) were angiographically identified as having an absent left main coronary artery.
 The angiographic characteristics of this coronary anomaly include: (1) the presence of two well-separated coronary ostia at the left aortic sinus resulting in separate origin of the left anterior descending and circumflex arteries; (2) an increased incidence of left coronary dominance; (3) a higher (6%) than usual (0.5% to 1.5%) incidence of myocardial bridging; (4) lack of a high incidence of congenital heart anomalies; and (5) an incidence of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease similar to that of patients whose left main artery is intact.
 In 39% of the patients difficulties in selectively cannulating the separate ostium of the circumflex artery and adequately opacifying this vessel resulted in a need to change the diagnostic catheter size.
 Recognition of this coronary anomaly is needed to ensure accurate angiographic interpretation and is important for patients undergoing cardiac surgery to selectively perfuse these separate vessels during cardiopulmonary bypass.
