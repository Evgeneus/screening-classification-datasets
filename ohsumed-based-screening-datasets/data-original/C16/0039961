Surgical management of severe aortic outflow obstruction in lesions other than the hypoplastic left heart syndrome: use of a pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis.
 Between December 1985 and April 1990, 50 infants with a variety of congenital cardiac lesions other than the hypoplastic left heart syndrome underwent surgical relief of aortic outflow obstruction by creation of a pulmonary artery to aorta anastomosis.
 The patients were grouped anatomically by ventriculoarterial alignment.
 Nineteen had normally aligned great arteries (group I); 25 had transposition of the great arteries, all with a univentricular heart of left ventricular morphology (group II); and 6 had a double-outlet right ventricle (group III).
 All patients had either aortic stenosis with atresia, subaortic stenosis or a restrictive ventricular septal defect.
 Sixteen had normal arch anatomy; 34 had arch anomalies consisting of arch hypoplasia (n = 17), coarctation (n = 11), interruption of the arch (n = 4) and complex arch anomalies (n = 2).
 Surgery was performed at a median age of 10 days (range 2 to 184).
 Of the 50 infants, 33 survived.
 No significant difference in early survival (30 days) was noted among the groups of varying ventriculoarterial alignment (68% group I, 72% group II, 83% group III) (p greater than 0.05).
 Overall actuarial survival was 63% at 18 months.
 Analysis of actuarial survival by arch anatomy, although not statistically significant, revealed a trend toward better survival at 18 months postoperatively in infants with normal arch anatomy (81%) than in infants with arch anomalies (54%).
 Of the 33 survivors, 26 have proceeded to the next surgical stage, including the Fontan procedure in 8, superior cavopulmonary anastomosis in 13 and biventricular repair in 5.
