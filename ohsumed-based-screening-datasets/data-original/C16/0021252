Cystic fibrosis, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and active cutaneous vasodilation.
 The transmitter substance for the active cutaneous vasodilation that accompanies sweating during hyperthermia in humans is unknown.
 Hokfelt et al.
 (Nature Lond.
 284: 515-521, 180) hypothesized that it is vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) that is cotransmitted with acetylcholine.
 Heinz-Erian et al.
 (Science Wash.
 DC 229: 1407-1408, 1985) reported that VIP innervation is sparse in the skin of persons with cystic fibrosis (CF).
 A corresponding attenuation of active vasodilation in these subjects would be evidence that VIP is involved in this effector mechanism of human thermor-regulation.
 Immunocytochemical analysis of skin biopsies from four men with CF confirmed that VIP innervation was sparse.
 We also analyzed immunoreactivity for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; normal), substance P (normal), and neuropeptide Y (low).
 VIP-immunoreactive Merkel cells were abnormal.
 Despite sparse VIP-immunoreactive innervation, our CF subjects' cutaneous vascular responses to hyperthermia were normal.
 Because VIP was not completely absent, this evidence is insufficient to rule out VIP as the vasodilator transmitter.
 However, the CGRP and substance P innervation we observed could mean that release of one or both of these peptides was the mechanism of the fully developed active cutaneous vasodilation.
