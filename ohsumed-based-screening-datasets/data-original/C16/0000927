Comparative roles of intraoperative epicardial and early postoperative transthoracic echocardiography in the assessment of surgical repair of congenital heart defects 
 In 94 consecutive patients undergoing surgical repair of congenital heart defects the results of intraoperative (after cardiopulmonary bypass) epicardial two-dimensional and Doppler color flow imaging were compared with those of sequential transthoracic echocardiography performed within 24 h of surgery and again before hospital discharge to define the precise role of intraoperative imaging.
 In 6 of 7 patients with a residual defect requiring immediate surgical revision, intraoperative imaging correctly identified the defect; spectral Doppler imaging underestimated or did not identify a residual outflow tract gradient in 17 patients.
 Left atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation after repair of complete AV septal defect was underestimated in three patients.
 Although intraoperative documentation of good ventricular function was usually associated with a good outcome, in three patients poor systemic ventricular function after cardiopulmonary bypass was not associated with early mortality.
 A minor degree of shunting around the patch was a common finding on epicardial and early postoperative imaging and persisted at the time of hospital discharge in 17 of 46 patients who had undergone patch closure of a ventricular septal defect as part of the surgical procedure.
 Additional trabecular septal defects were missed on color flow imaging after cardiopulmonary bypass in three patients, one of whom required subsequent reoperation.
 Although intraoperative two-dimensional and color flow imaging permitted the recognition of the majority of residual defects requiring immediate revision, residual outflow obstruction or AV valve regurgitation was usually underestimated.
