Increased plasma cholecystokinin levels and small gall bladders in adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
 1.
 In patients with cystic fibrosis, abnormalities in plasma cholecystokinin level and gall-bladder emptying may contribute to the development of maldigestion and gall-stones.
 2.
 Therefore, we have measured plasma cholecystokinin levels and gall-bladder volumes before and after ingestion of a standard breakfast in eight adult patients with cystic fibrosis and in eight normal control subjects.
 3.
 In the patients with cystic fibrosis basal (2.8 +/- 0.4 pmol/l; P less than 0.05, t-test) and maximum post-prandial (5.7 +/- 0.5 pmol/l; P less than 0.05, t-test) plasma cholecystokinin levels were significantly higher than those in the control subjects (1.9 +/- 0.1 pmol/l, and 4.5 +/- 0.2 pmol/l, respectively).
 On the other hand, integrated plasma cholecystokinin secretion in response to the meal was similar (t-test, P = 0.4 versus control subjects).
 The increased plasma cholecystokinin levels in the patients with cystic fibrosis were accompanied by reduced gallbladder volumes in both the basal (7.8 +/- 2.1 cm3 versus 20.9 +/- 2.3 cm3 in control subjects; P less than 0.005, t-test) and the post-prandial state (2.2 +/- 1.0 cm3 versus 4.8 +/- 0.8 cm3 in control subjects; P = 0.06, t-test).
 Gall-bladder emptying in the patients with cystic fibrosis was well preserved (70 +/- 7% versus 78 +/- 9% in control subjects; P = 0.4, t-test).
 4.
 In comparison with normal control subjects, patients with cystic fibrosis have an increased basal plasma cholecystokinin level and a reduced gall-bladder volume, whereas post-prandial gall-bladder emptying and plasma cholecystokinin secretion are not significantly different.
