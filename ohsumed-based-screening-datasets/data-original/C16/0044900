Bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis using vertical vein for right isomerism, pulmonary atresia, and TAPVR.
 An 8-year-old girl who was diagnosed as having right atrial isomerism, pulmonary atresia, butterfly-shaped juxtaductal pulmonary arterial stenosis, total anomalous pulmonary venous return of the supracardiac type, regurgitant common atrioventricular valve, and univentricular heart of the right ventricular type underwent bilateral, bidirectional cavopulmonary anastomosis using a vertical vein and anastomosis between the common pulmonary venous trunk and atrium.
