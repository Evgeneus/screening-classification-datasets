ECMO in premature infants. Review of factors associated with mortality.
 During the first few years of clinical research on neonatal extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), 16 premature infants of less than 35 weeks gestational age were treated by the authors (RHB), and only four (25%) survived.
 Intracranial hemorrhage was common, prompting the authors to recommend that ECMO not be used in premature infants with respiratory failure.
 Since diagnostic methods, indications, and techniques of extracorporeal support have improved considerably, the records of these previous cases were reviewed in detail to determine if there was reason to believe that results might be better in the modern era.
 Of the 16 patients, four had pre-ECMO conditions that would now be considered contraindications and five of the remaining patients had major technical complications that are now rare.
 Anticoagulation and fluid management of these patients also would be handled much differently.
 Based on this review and on current experience with extracorporeal support in near-term infants, it is reasonable to expect that survival of moribund premature infants might be 50% or greater with extracorporeal support.
 New phase I trials using improved indications and technology are suggested.
