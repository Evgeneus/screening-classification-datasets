The neodymium:YAG laser recanalization in a patient with azoospermia due to ejaculatory duct agenesis.
 A 32-year-old man with azoospermia is presented.
 Transperineal echographically guided vesiculography of the vas deferens showed absence of the ejaculatory duct and presence of a cystic mullerian duct in which both enlarged seminal vesicles joined.
 Transurethrally, by means of a contact tip over the verumontanum a new channel was created by neodymium:YAG laser irradiation at 25 watts every 2 seconds.
 The patient had 32.10(6) spermatozoa per ml.
 with good quality on semen analysis 10 months later.
