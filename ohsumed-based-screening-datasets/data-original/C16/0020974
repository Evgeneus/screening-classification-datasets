Prevalence of common and dysplastic naevi in a Swedish population.
 The naevus profile was examined in a Swedish population that was randomly selected from a census file.
 The participation rate was considered high at 82%.
 The number of common naevi (CN) and the prevalence of dysplastic naevi (DN) were investigated in 379 subjects (aged 30-50 years).
 The mean total body count of CN greater than or equal to 2 mm was 67 (range 1-300).
 As many as 22% of the population had 100 naevi or more and only 18% had less than 25.
 The counts were not influenced by age or sex.
 DN were diagnosed clinically in 18% (CI 14-22%) of the subjects and histologically in 8% (CI 5-11%).
 Subjects with dysplastic naevi had a significantly larger number of common naevi and a more sun-sensitive skin type than subjects without DN, P less than 0.001.
