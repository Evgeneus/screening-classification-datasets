Evaluation of conservative therapy for exomphalos.
 Two management patterns were identified in 36 patients with exomphalos--primary surgical closure and initial topical therapy with delayed surgical closure.
 Primary surgical closure of minor exomphalos was well tolerated in 15 patients, but was associated with a high local and systemic morbidity rate in 14 patients with major defects.
 In contrast, initial topical therapy with silver sulphadiazine and delayed closure in seven matched patients with a major defect were well tolerated and did not prolong duration of hospitalization.
 Enteral feeding was more readily established and subsequent fascial closure facilitated in the conservatively treated group.
 It was suggested that this method should be more often considered in the management of all instances of major exomphalos.
