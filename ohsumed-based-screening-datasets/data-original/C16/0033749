Surfactant proteins and anti-surfactant antibodies in sera from infants with respiratory distress syndrome with and without surfactant treatment.
 The presence of surfactant protein antigenemia and of surfactant protein antibodies was determined in serum from surfactant-treated and control infants with respiratory distress syndrome who were enrolled in a prospective randomized clinical trial.
 The surfactant used for treatment (surfactant TA) contained surfactant proteins (SPs) B and C and no SP-A.
 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that identify surfactant-associated proteins and ELISAs that identify IgG or IgM directed against surfactant proteins were used to investigate sera from these infants obtained prior to treatment, at 1 week of age, and at 2 months of age.
 There were no significant differences between average values in the surfactant-treated and control groups at each time period.
 However, in the control group, averaged results from ELISAs that identify SP-A and that identify IgM antibodies to SP-A or to SP-B, C showed significant differences between pretreatment sera and sera obtained at 1 week of age.
 No significant differences were noted in averaged results for IgG.
 Positive ELISA values were more frequently found in the control group than in the surfactant-treated group with regard to SP-A, and IgM against SP-A and SP-B, C in sera from neonates at 1 week of age.
 No positive ELISA values were found in sera from infants at 2 months of age.
 It is concluded that some patients with severe respiratory distress syndrome presumably leak surfactant proteins into the circulation and that this induces transient low titers of IgM antibody.
 This occurrence is decreased with surfactant treatment.
 Surfactant treatment may reduce leak of surfactant proteins into the vascular space by reducing lung damage.
