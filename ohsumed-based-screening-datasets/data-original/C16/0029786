Biplane transesophageal echocardiography: clinical applications of the long-axis plane.
 Tomography of the heart and great vessels is limited during conventional transesophageal echocardiography by the inability to rotate the transducer at the end of the transesophageal echocardiographic endoscope.
 A biplane transesophageal echocardiographic probe has been developed recently with a second transducer capable of long-axis imaging that yields long-axis views in addition to the familiar short-axis views.
 We describe our experience with 37 patients with a variety of cardiovascular diseases.
 In 17 patients new diagnostic information was obtained, although management was not changed.
 Long-axis scanning was particularly useful in the assessment of diseases of the thoracic aorta, valvular morphology and regurgitation, and congenital heart disease.
 Important limitations of the biplane imaging system include reduced image quality and a continued inability to rotate the transducer to obtain any desired plane of imaging.
 Nonetheless, biplane imaging enhances the versatility of transesophageal echocardiography and improves three-dimensional conceptualization of cardiac disease.
