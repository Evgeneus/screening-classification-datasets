Indomethacin-induced changes in renal blood flow velocity waveform in premature infants investigated with color Doppler imaging.
 Renal dysfunction has been recognized as an adverse effect of indomethacin treatment and is probably secondary to impairment of renal blood flow.
 We therefore evaluated renal artery blood flow velocity in 15 premature infants with a symptomatic ductus arteriosus before and during the first 12 hours after a single intravenous dose of 0.1 mg/kg of indomethacin.
 Renal artery blood flow velocity was measured serially by color-Doppler flow imaging and used as a qualitative measure of true renal blood flow.
 Indomethacin administration led to a sharp decrease in peak systolic flow velocity and temporal mean flow velocity of the renal artery.
 This effect was maximal at 10 minutes after indomethacin dosing; the flow velocities showed a slow recovery, reaching baseline values again at 2 hours after indomethacin dosing.
 We conclude that indomethacin can affect renal blood supply in the premature infant for a period of at least 1 hour after indomethacin treatment.
