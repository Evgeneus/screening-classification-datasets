Direct analysis of uncultured cytotrophoblastic cells from second- and third-trimester placentas: an accurate and rapid method for detection of fetal chromosome abnormalities.
 Transabdominal chorionic villus sampling can be readily used for detection of fetal chromosome abnormalities in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.
 Although culture of chorionic villi offers little advantage over cultured amniotic fluid cells with respect to time required to obtain results, cytogenetic analysis of chorionic villi by direct analysis of uncultured cytotrophoblastic cells offers clear advantages because of the very short time required to obtain results.
 To determine whether direct analysis of uncultured cytotrophoblastic cells from second- and third-trimester placentas can routinely provide rapid and accurate assessment of fetal status, we evaluated chorionic villus specimens obtained from 57 placentas; 49 placentas were sampled in the second trimester whereas eight were sampled in the third trimester.
 Direct preparations yielded karyotypes in 56 (98.2%) preparations; all results of direct analyses were available within 72 hours and, when requested, within 12 hours.
 All results were confirmed by chromosome analysis of cultured mesenchymal core cells or cultured fetal tissue.
 We conclude that direct analysis of cytotrophoblastic cells from second- and third-trimester placentas is a very rapid and accurate method for determining fetal chromosome status that is comparable with, if not superior to, percutaneous umbilical blood sampling.
