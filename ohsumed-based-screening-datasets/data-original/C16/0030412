Aortic atresia with normal left ventricle.
 A case of single-stage repair of aortic atresia with normal-sized left ventricle and ventricular septal defect in a neonate is reported.
 The surgical procedure included rerouting of the left ventricular bloodstream to the pulmonary artery through the ventricular septal defect and connection of the pulmonary trunk to the aortic arch.
 The right ventricular outflow tract was then reconstructed with an extracardiac valved conduit.
 Three years after the initial operation, replacement of the valved conduit was performed uneventfully.
 The clinical status of the child is very satisfactory.
