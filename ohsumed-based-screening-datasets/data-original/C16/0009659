Alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and the binding of lidocaine in children with congenital heart disease.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of congenital heart disease (CHD) on the serum concentrations of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein (alpha 1-AGP) and the serum binding of lidocaine.
 Thirteen children with acyanotic CHD and 12 children with cyanotic CHD were studied and compared with 28 children without heart disease (control).
 The mean (+/- SD) serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP, as determined by radial immunodiffusion, did not differ significantly among the three groups.
 Five minutes after administration of 1.5 mg.kg-1 intravenous lidocaine, the free fraction of lidocaine correlated inversely and linearly with the serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP in children with acyanotic CHD (r2 = 0.74; P less than 0.001) cyanotic CHD (r2 = 0.57; P less than 0.005), and control (r2 = 0.63; P less than 0.001).
 The slopes and intercepts of the linear regressions did not differ significantly among the three groups.
 We conclude that the serum concentration of alpha 1-AGP in children with CHD does not differ quantitatively or qualitatively from that in children without CHD.
