Rehospitalization for respiratory illness in infants of less than 32 weeks' gestation.
 All 133 surviving infants of gestational age less than or equal to 32 weeks born July 1, 1985, to June 30, 1986, as well as a socioeconomically matched full-term control group were observed prospectively for 2 years to determine the incidence of rehospitalization for respiratory illness.
 Perinatal and seasonal factors associated with increased risk for such hospitalizations were also examined.
 Forty-seven (36%) preterm infants were rehospitalized compared with 3 (2.5%) of 121 term infants (P less than .001).
 Preterm infants with and without rehospitalization were similar for mean birth weight (1104 +/- 329 g and 1188 +/- 360 g, respectively) and gestational age (28 +/- 2 weeks for both groups); however, infants who were subsequently rehospitalized had required more days of mechanical ventilation, supplemental oxygen therapy, and neonatal intensive care.
 While a history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia was a risk factor for rehospitalization (45% compared with 25% of those without bronchopulmonary dysplasia, P less than .05), preterm infants with no history of bronchopulmonary dysplasia still showed a 10-fold increase compared with control infants.
 Among the 43 infants who required no mechanical ventilation beyond the day of birth, 10 (23%) required rehospitalization.
