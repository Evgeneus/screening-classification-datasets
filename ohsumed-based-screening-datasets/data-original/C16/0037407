Doppler echocardiography of fetal ductus arteriosus constriction versus increased right ventricular output.
 A prospective longitudinal study from 121 examinations of 41 normal pregnant women showed that fetal ductal flow velocities increased with gestational age.
 These normal data were compared with data in three groups of fetuses with altered ductal flow velocities: 22 fetuses (mean gestational age 31.3 weeks) had ductal constriction due to maternal indomethacin treatment; 10 fetuses (mean gestational age 27.9 weeks) had been exposed to terbutaline, a positive inotropic agent and 14 fetuses (mean gestational age 33.3 weeks) had hypoplastic left heart syndrome.
 In normal fetuses maximal systolic, mean and end-diastolic ductal flow velocities increased linearly (p less than 0.0001).
 The pulsatility index did not change (mean +/- 2 SD: 2.46 +/- 0.52).
 Fetuses with ductal constriction had higher maximal, mean and end-diastolic flow velocities and a significantly lower pulsatility index than did normal fetuses (1.25 +/- 0.76; p less than 0.0005).
 Six of 10 fetuses of the terbutaline group and 8 of 14 fetuses with hypoplastic left heart syndrome had increased maximal flow velocity, but normal or only mildly elevated mean flow velocity.
 The pulsatility index in fetuses during terbutaline therapy and with hypoplastic left heart syndrome was significantly higher than in normal fetuses (3.11 +/- 0.46 and 3.09 +/- 0.7, respectively, vs.
 2.46 +/- 0.52; p less than 0.0005).
 Fetal ductal waveform analysis was necessary to distinguish fetal ductal constriction from increased right ventricular output.
 These measurements may be helpful in the diagnosis of left-sided outflow obstruction and assessment of fetal hemodynamic data.
