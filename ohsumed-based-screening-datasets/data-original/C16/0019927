The management of retinal detachments associated with choroidal colobomas by vitreous surgery.
 We used vitreous surgery to treat seven patients (eight eyes) with complicated retinal detachments associated with choroidal colobomas.
 All eyes had large choroidal colobomas and no evidence of peripheral retinal breaks.
 Small, atrophic breaks were detected in five of the eyes and were located in the base of the coloboma in four of the five eyes.
 Adjunctive surgical techniques were necessary and included cyanoacrylate retinopexy in four eyes, silicone oil tamponade in five eyes, and retinectomy in two eyes.
 Retinal reattachment was ultimately attained in seven of the eight eyes.
 The number of surgical procedures ranged from one to five, with an average of three.
 Postoperative visual acuity of the eyes that underwent anatomically successful procedures ranged from 20/100 to light perception.
 Proliferative vitreoretinopathy was the most frequent cause of redetachment, occurring in six of the eight eyes.
