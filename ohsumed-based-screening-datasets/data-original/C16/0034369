Inverse relation between density of nevi and terminal cutaneous hair. Study of male volunteer subjects and patients enrolled in a dysplastic nevus syndrome registry.
 Terminal hair density was graded at seven sites in 19 male patients enrolled in a dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS) registry and in 22 matched control subjects.
 An inverse relation between density of nevi and terminal hair for all sites combined was observed for both patients and control subjects (p = 0.0001, regression analysis).
 In addition, the registry patients had significantly less terminal cutaneous hair overall (p = 0.007, Wilcoxon rank sum test) compared with the controls.
