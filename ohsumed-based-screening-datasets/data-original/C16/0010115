Split-thickness skin grafting of the myelomeningocele defect: a subset at risk for late ulceration.
 The appropriate method and timing of the management of the myelomeningocele defect have prompted considerable discussion.
 Use of split-thickness skin grafts acutely has accomplished wound closure with low morbidity and mortality.
 This study was designed to address the question of long-term suitability of the technique of split-thickness skin grafting of the myelomeningocele patient.
 The incidence of late and/or severe skin ulceration and the presence of gibbus deformity were correlated with the method of skin closure.
 Long-term follow-up revealed a higher incidence of chronic skin ulceration in the split-thickness skin graft group as compared with the primary closure group.
 All skin breakdowns appeared in the presence of a gibbus deformity, and gibbus deformity was more prevalent in the split-thickness skin graft group.
 The incidence of skin ulceration and gibbus deformity was site-dependent.
 A thoracic or thoracolumbar myelomeningocele repair with split-thickness skin graft was significantly more likely to be complicated by skin problems than the defect in the lumbar, lumbosacral, or sacral region.
 This relationship was secondary to the frequency of gibbus deformity in the more cephalad defects than defects caudad.
 A treatment plan is outlined that is based on the primary variable of the location of the myelomeningocele and secondarily by defect size.
