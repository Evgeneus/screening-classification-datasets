Survival and place of treatment after premature delivery.
 In a one year prospective study in the Trent region we examined the short term outcome (survival to discharge) of all infants who required admission to a baby care unit.
 Infants of less than or equal to 28 weeks' gestation who received all their perinatal care in one of five large centres (each providing more than 600 ventilator days/year) showed significantly better survival rates than infants electively treated throughout their entire course at one of the 12 smaller units (34 survivors from 65 infants (52%) compared with eight survivors from 37 infants (22%).
 These differences occurred despite the elective transfer of many of the sickest infants from the smaller units to the larger.
 Differences in survival between more mature infants were not significant.
 These results support the policy that there should be a more centralised neonatal service for those infants at or below 28 weeks' gestation.
