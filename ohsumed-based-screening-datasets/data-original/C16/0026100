Specular microscopic observation of posterior corneal vesicles.
 Specular microscopic investigation was conducted on 5 cases with the diagnosis compatible with posterior corneal vesicles.
 Endothelial cells were considerably enlarged with a more or less indistinct margin.
 Deposits onto endothelial cells were occasionally seen.
 The results of specular microscopy suggest that posterior corneal vesicles be classified as a nonfamilial, unilateral variant of posterior polymorphous dystrophy of the cornea.
