Important melanocytic lesions in childhood and adolescence.
 Melanocytic nevi are common in children and adolescents, and the preponderance of these lesions are benign.
 Congenital melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevi, and large numbers of common acquired nevi, however, may indicate an increased risk of malignant melanoma.
 With the exception, possibly, of giant congenital nevi, melanoma associated with these lesions generally occurs in adulthood.
 Nonetheless, some patients can be identified as being at increased risk for the development of melanoma during childhood.
 The poor prognosis associated with advanced melanoma and the curability of early lesions underscore the importance of prompt recognition of melanoma when it does occur in children.
 Furthermore, physicians who care for children are in a key position to decrease risk of melanoma throughout the lifespan by encouraging avoidance of excessive sun exposure during childhood.
