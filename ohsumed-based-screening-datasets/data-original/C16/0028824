Heart catheterization in a neonate by interacting magnetic fields: a new and simple method of catheter guidance.
 Catheter guidance in a critically ill neonate can be difficult and hazardous.
 A new technique of directing a catheter based on the interaction of magnetic fields is described.
 A strong external permanent magnet is moved across the body surface to control the magnetic tip of a catheter in the body.
 We report on the first clinical case of such a heart catheterization in a neonate with complex congenital heart disease.
 This method can also be used for other invasive investigations in the neonatal period.
