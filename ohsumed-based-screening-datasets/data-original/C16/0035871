Permanent transfemoral pacemaker insertion after repair of congenital heart disease.
 In certain patients with anomalies of systemic venous connection, traditional transvenous pacemaker lead insertion may not be technically feasible.
 We report the use of the femoral venous approach to insert a permanent pacemaker in a patient with congenital heart disease who had undergone two previous cardiac operations and had persistent anomalies of the superior systemic venous circulation.
 We recommend that the femoral venous approach be considered in select patients requiring permanent pacing.
