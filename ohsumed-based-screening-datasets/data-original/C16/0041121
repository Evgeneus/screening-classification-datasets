Chromosomal anomaly and malformation syndrome with abdominal polyorchidism.
 We describe a neonate who presented with multiple severe malformations including polyorchidism.
 To our knowledge this is the second case reported with ipsilateral testes located intra-abdominally.
 Chromosomal studies in cases of polyorchidism have been reported previously only once and the patient exhibited a normal karyotype.
 Our patient had a chromosome 21 long arm deletion.
 Interestingly, a trisomy 21 patient has been reported with agonadism.
 We suggest that genes on chromosome 21 may have some role in gonadal development.
