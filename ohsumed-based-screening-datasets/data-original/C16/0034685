Developmental disorders of the pediatric spine.
 Developmental disorders of the pediatric spine are a group of congenital malformations commonly referred to as spinal dysraphism.
 These malformations are characterized by incomplete or absent fusion of midline mesenchymal, bony, and neural structures.
 They can be classified according to the presence or absence of an associated back mass.
 A detailed analysis of the embryology, clinical findings, and radiologic characteristics of the common forms of spinal dysraphism is outlined.
