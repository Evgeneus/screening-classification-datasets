Growth disturbance of the proximal part of the femur after treatment for congenital dislocation of the hip.
 The radiographs of ninety patients in whom treatment of unilateral congenital dislocation of the hip was complicated by disturbance of growth of the proximal part of the femur were studied retrospectively.
 All patients were followed until closure of the affected proximal femoral physis.
 We divided the patients into three groups, according to the degree of vascular insufficiency: patients who had mild vascular insufficiency of the hip, which had little effect on growth; those who had moderate vascular insufficiency, which produces partial arrest of growth; and those who had severe vascular insufficiency, which causes complete arrest of growth.
 Good correlation was found between the initial degree of vascular insufficiency and the radiographic results at the most recent follow-up.
 The radiographic signs that were used to predict the extent of physeal involvement were a crescent-shaped epiphysis, medial bowing of the femoral neck (a shorter and more concave curve between the lesser trochanter and the proximal femoral metaphysis [the lateral portion of the Shenton line]), lateral tilting of the capital epiphysis, and premature physeal closure.
 Signs that were diagnostic of existing physeal involvement were elevation of the greater trochanter and shortening of the affected extremity.
 The presence and severity of these signs correlated well with the degree of vascular insufficiency.
 Medial bowing was the most reliable prognostic factor for the determination of the fate of the hip joint at maturity.
