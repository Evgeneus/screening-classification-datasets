Heart transplantation in children.
 Orthotopic cardiac transplantation has been performed in 15 consecutive neonates and children since 1987.
 Diagnoses include hypoplastic left heart syndrome (5 patients), critical aortic stenosis with small left ventricle (1 patient), complex cyanotic heart disease (6 patients), and cardiomyopathy (3 patients).
 Twelve patients survived operation and have been followed from 1 to 45 months.
 Patients less than 6 years of age are managed with cyclosporine +/- azathioprine; in older patients steroid weaning is attempted.
 Monitoring for rejection is performed with serial echocardiography in patients under 6 years of age; older patients undergo serial biopsies.
 Actuarial freedom from rejection was 26% 3 months after operation; 47% were free of infection 6 months after operation.
 There have been no late deaths.
 Actuarial survival at 3 years is 79%.
 Nine patients have undergone postoperative catheterization.
 Resting hemodynamics were normal in every patient.
 All long-term survivors are asymptomatic and fully active.
 It is concluded that cardiac transplantation in neonates and children is an effective treatment option for end-stage cardiomyopathy or otherwise incurable congenital heart disease.
 Long-term survivors have excellent potential for full rehabilitation.
