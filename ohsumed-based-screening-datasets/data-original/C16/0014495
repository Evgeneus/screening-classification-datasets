Mortality in hereditary antithrombin-III deficiency--1830 to 1989 
 To determine whether antithrombin-III (AT-III) deficiency leads to an excess mortality, we studied 171 individuals from ten families with a proven hereditary deficiency.
 73 were classified as certainly deficient either by direct measurement of AT-III concentration or by mendelian inheritance patterns.
 98 individuals had a high probability (0.5) of deficiency.
 The 64 deaths recorded did not exceed those expected for the general population adjusted for age, sex, and calendar period.
 We suggest that a policy of prophylactic anticoagulation for patients with AT-III deficiency cannot be recommended.
