Spirochetes in atrophic skin lesions accompanied by minimal host response in a child with Lyme disease.
 Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, which has rarely been observed in the United States, is a late skin manifestation of Lyme borreliosis.
 A 12-year-old girl who spent summers on Cape Cod presented with a 2-year history of hyperpigmentation and atrophy of the skin on the hands, wrists, and ankles.
 The skin biopsy specimen of an affected area showed mild dermal fibrosis, a few inflammatory cells, and spirochetes morphologically compatible with Borrelia burgdorferi.
 An IgG antibody response to B.
 burgdorferi could be elicited by immunoblotting, but not by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
 We conclude that this patient had chronic Lyme borreliosis manifested only by indolent infection of the skin.
