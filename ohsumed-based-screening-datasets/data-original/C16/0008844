Childhood pulmonary function following hyaline membrane disease.
 Hyaline membrane disease per se is not associated with abnormal lung function or increased nonspecific airway reactivity in childhood or adulthood.
 Very-low-birth-weight infants who survive almost routinely in neonatal ICUs are at risk, however, for developing airflow obstruction and having airway hyperreactivity as children, and for having recurrent bouts of wheezing, cough, and respiratory infections.
 Neonates who develop BPD have the greatest risk of abnormal pulmonary function as children.
 Continued research into the prevention of premature birth and into the causes of neonatal lung injury, combined with improvements in the neonatal ICU and follow-up treatment, will undoubtedly contribute to improvement in the clinical course of premature infants.
