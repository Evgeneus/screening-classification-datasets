Comparison of 6 and 8 hourly tobramycin dosing intervals in treatment of pulmonary exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients.
 The efficacy and toxicity of a shortened tobramycin dosing interval in the treatment of exacerbations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pulmonary infection in cystic fibrosis patients were evaluated prospectively.
 Patients ages 13 to 30 years received 34 treatment courses and were randomized by pairs to receive tobramycin administered either every 6 or 8 hours.
 Peak serum concentrations were adjusted to 8 to 10 micrograms/ml; thus a larger total daily dosage was administered to patients receiving tobramycin every 6 hours.
 The shorter dosing interval was associated with better pulmonary function at follow-up and significantly longer time before next hospital admission for a pulmonary exacerbation.
 During the study hospitalization there were no differences in pulmonary function tests, clinical score, sputum carriage of P.
 aeruginosa, toxicity or necessary length of hospitalization.
 A 6-hour tobramycin dosing interval was more efficacious than an 8-hour dosing interval in the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.
