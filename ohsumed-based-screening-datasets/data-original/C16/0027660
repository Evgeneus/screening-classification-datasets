Imaging of neonatal pulmonary sequestration including Doppler ultrasound.
 Seven cases of neonatal pulmonary sequestration are reviewed which illustrate the varied clinical presentations and radiological findings.
 In four patients, real time ultrasound scanning was used to image the chest and the features are described.
 In three cases, the systemic supplying artery was demonstrated by duplex Doppler scanning and further invasive investigations were avoided; after a chest radiograph, this should be the examination of choice in the investigation of a neonate with a possible pulmonary sequestration.
