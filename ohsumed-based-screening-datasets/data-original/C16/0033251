Bilateral optic disc neovascularization in association with retinitis pigmentosa.
 Bilateral neovascularization of the optic disc developed in a 16-year-old Hispanic girl with retinitis pigmentosa.
 The neovascularization regressed in both eyes over 1 year without treatment.
 Ocular and systemic evaluation failed to reveal a recognized cause for the neovascularization.
 To our knowledge this is only the third case reported of this unusual association.
