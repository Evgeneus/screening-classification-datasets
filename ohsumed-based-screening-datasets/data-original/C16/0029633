The relationship between autoantibodies and intrauterine growth retardation in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.
 Abnormal levels of autoantibodies have recently been demonstrated in patients with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and patients whose fetuses have intrauterine growth retardation.
 We determined total immunoglobulin levels (immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin M, and immunoglobulin A) and a broad panel of autoantibodies (six antiphospholipid, four antihistone, and four antipolynucleotide antibodies) in 50 normotensive pregnant females, 19 patients with preeclampsia, and 18 patients with chronic hypertension to examine the relationship to intrauterine growth retardation.
 Mothers who were delivered of infants with intrauterine growth retardation demonstrated significantly more autoantibody abnormalities in the two hypertensive groups and in the normotensive control group as compared with patients delivered of appropriately grown infants.
 The most frequently observed autoantibody abnormalities were antiphospholipid antibodies and the most frequently observed among those were immunoglobulin G isotypes.
 Total immunoglobulin levels in both hypertensive and normotensive groups were identical.
 These results suggest a close association between the degree of B-cell activation and both severity of hypertensive diseases and development of intrauterine growth retardation in their offspring.
