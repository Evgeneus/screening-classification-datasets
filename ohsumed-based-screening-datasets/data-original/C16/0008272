Improved outcome at 28 days of age for very low birth weight infants treated with a single dose of a synthetic surfactant 
 Two identical double-blind, controlled, randomized trials were initiated to determine whether the administration of a single 5 ml/kg dose of a synthetic surfactant (Exosurf Neonatal), soon after the delivery of infants with birth weights 700 to 1350 gm, would improve rates of survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
 Both trials were terminated before enrolling their planned sample sizes because of the availability of Exosurf under the provisions of a Treatment Investigational New Drug program.
 We report the combined results of these trials.
 Study infants were stratified according to birth weight and gender before random assignment to a treatment regimen.
 One hundred ninety-two infants received Exosurf and 193 received an air placebo.
 The study groups were similar when a variety of demographic features describing the mothers, their pregnancies, the circumstances of the births, and the infants were compared.
 Exosurf-treated infants required significantly less oxygen and respiratory support during the first 3 days of life in comparison with the air-treated infants.
 Fewer infants in the Exosurf group had pulmonary interstitial emphysema (26 vs 13; p = 0.028).
 In the Exosurf group, there was a significant reduction in the combined outcome, neonatal death or survival with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (57 vs 39; p = 0.042), and there was a significant increase in rates of survival without this disease (128 vs 137; p = 0.042).
 There were no differences between treatment groups in the incidences of a variety of complications of prematurity, including apnea, patent ductus arteriosus, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis.
 We conclude that improvements in respiratory physiology after a single prophylactic dose of Exosurf result in an increased likelihood of neonatal survival without bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
