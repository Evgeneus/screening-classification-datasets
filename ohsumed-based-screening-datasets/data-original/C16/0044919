Staged repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect in infancy.
 Staged repair of interrupted aortic arch and ventricular septal defect was carried out in 20 infants from 1979 through 1990.
 Among the important associated cardiac defects were transposition of the great arteries, truncus arteriosus, and anomalous origin of the right pulmonary artery.
 The first stage, usually consisting of the placement of an 8- or 10-mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft, pulmonary artery banding, and ligation of the patent ductus arteriosus, resulted in 20 survivors (100%) There were two interim deaths (10%) before the second stage of ventricular septal defect closure and pulmonary artery band removal, which had 15 survivors (83%, 15/18).
 Because the major morbidity and mortality early in this experience could be traced to leaving the pulmonary artery band on too long, early removal (within 2 to 3 months) was begun.
 Since 1985, 8 (100%) of 8 infants have survived both stages and are now doing well.
 Because of the relatively large polytetrafluoroethylene graft, only 1 child (aged 9 years) has experienced substantial late aortic arch obstruction and undergone placement of an 18-mm Dacron graft without difficulty.
 Of interest is the finding that in only 1 (5%) of the 20 patients has major (greater than or equal to 40-mm Hg gradient) left ventricular outflow tract obstruction developed.
 In summary, the staged repair of interrupted aortic arch with ventricular septal defect has become very reliable despite the condition of the infant or major associated cardiac anomalies and can be recommended for infants at high risk for primary repair.
 More long-term information will be needed to determine which approach will be the best choice for the majority of infants.
