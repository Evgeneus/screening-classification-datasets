A denaturated venous homograft as an alternative material for shunts and other reconstructions in congenital cardiac surgery.
 A human venous homograft "Varivas R", in clinical use for 10 years for vascular access loops and femoropopliteal bypasses, has been used since December 1985 as a material for aortopulmonary shunts and other reconstructive procedures in congenital heart surgery.
 For this purpose vein segments 5 cm length, varying in diameter from 4 up to 10 mm by steps of 1 mm, were obtained.
 Our experience with Varivas is limited to 59 patients.
 Of 47 infants, 18 received a left, and 25 a right sided aortopulmonary shunt, 9 had bilateral aortopulmonary shunts, 2 right ventricle pulmonary conduits, 1 a pulmonary-pulmonary conduit, 3 interrupted aortic arch reconstructions and 4 a central aortopulmonary shunt, 1 with confluence reconstruction, 3 recidives of coarctation a patch repair.
 Among 11 adults 6 received coronary bypass and 6 others vascular reconstructions.
 In contrast to other artificial graft materials, the vein material offers easy manipulation similar to the daily routine of handling fresh vein material offers easy manipulation similar to the daily routine of handling fresh vein grafts in coronary surgery.
 The appropriate diameter sizes match better the infants anatomy, without the risk of kinking and/or anastomosis displacement.
 Peroperatively it was possible to confirm patency by electromagnetic flow measurement and the postoperative examinations were done by colour Doppler echocardiography.
 We had to reoperate upon 4 infants because of early thrombosis; on 1 infant for stenosis of the graft and on another 5 for late thrombosis.
 In an attempt to extend the indications for "inoperable" pulmonary hypoplasia/atresia we were not able to keep the shunt open in 4 infants.
