Perinatal transmission of human papillomavirus.
 Human papillomavirus infection is probably the most prevalent sexually transmitted disease in the United States.
 In adults, it is associated with condylomata acuminata and with neoplastic changes ranging from dysplasia to carcinoma.
 Infected mothers may transmit human papillomavirus during the perinatal period; affected children face prolonged, difficult treatment for respiratory papillomatosis.
 Prevention of infection remains the best approach, since diagnostic and therapeutic methods are suboptimal.
