Intussusception in cystic fibrosis.
 Two cases of acute intussusception in older children with cystic fibrosis are reported.
 Both cases presented with symptoms and signs consistent with meconium ileus equivalent, which delayed the final diagnosis.
 Both cases required abdominal surgery but made full and uneventful recoveries.
