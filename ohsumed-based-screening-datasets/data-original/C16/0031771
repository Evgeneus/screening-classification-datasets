Recurrent spinal cord tethering by sacral nerve root following lipomyelomeningocele surgery. Case report.
 A 21-year-old woman had recurrent progressive weakness/hypesthesia and pain in both lower extremities.
 At the age of 5 and 19 years, she had undergone surgical resection of a lipomyelomeningocele at L5-S1.
 Surgical exploration revealed that the cord was tethered and pulled over to the side by an excessively short right S-1 nerve root.
 The contralateral L-5 and S-1 nerve roots were markedly stretched.
 Division of the right S-1 nerve root resulted in prompt disappearance of pain in the lower extremities and improvement in neurological function.
