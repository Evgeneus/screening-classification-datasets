Pathologic spectrum of malformations of the tricuspid valve in prenatal and neonatal life.
 The morphologic spectrum of malformations of the tricuspid valve in 14 fetal and 5 neonatal heart specimens is described.
 Echocardiography during fetal life had revealed the valvular malformations along with dilation of the right-sided chambers of the heart and atrioventricular (AV) valve incompetence.
 This functional impairment reflected either Ebstein's malformation (10 cases) or dysplasia of valve leaflets having a normal junctional attachment (9 cases).
 The right atrium and right ventricle were markedly enlarged, and heart weight was increased to 181% (median) and 179% (median) in the groups with Ebstein's malformation and valvular dysplasia, respectively.
 In contrast, lung weight was in the lower range of normal, showing a decrease of 67% (median) in patients with Ebstein's malformation and of 43% (median) in those with valvular dysplasia.
 One ventricular septal defect and six atrial septal defects were noted in each group.
 Severe obstruction at the level of the pulmonary valve was seen in 40% of the group with Ebstein's malformation and in 66% of those with valvular dysplasia.
 The most important factor in the particularly poor prognosis in these patients is the incompetence of the tricuspid valve, leading to right atrial enlargement and subsequent pulmonary hypoplasia.
 No significant difference was found between the pathologic features of fetal and neonatal hearts and no features that might have prompted the valve to become regurgitant during fetal life were identified.
