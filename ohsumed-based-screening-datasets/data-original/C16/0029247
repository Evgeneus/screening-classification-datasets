Treatment choice for infants in the neonatal intensive care unit at risk for AIDS.
 Many infants admitted to neonatal intensive care units are the children of women infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); they have approximately a 30% risk of infection.
 To investigate attitudes surrounding treatment for such newborns, we conducted a survey of professionals at six neonatal intensive care units in New York City.
 A significant proportion of the 247 respondents recommended less aggressive treatment for non-HIV-related conditions for infants at risk for HIV compared with those not at risk.
 For example, 97% of respondents recommended open heart surgery for an infant with no known HIV risk but only 77% recommended surgery for an infant whose mother had acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; if certain the infant was infected, 42% of respondents recommended surgery.
 We conclude that perceived HIV status may influence decision making about treatment for non-HIV-related conditions for critically ill patients, including infants not actually infected.
 Ethical issues concerning the relevance of HIV status need to be examined.
