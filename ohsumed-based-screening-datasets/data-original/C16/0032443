Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis: a new constellation of findings.
 Diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis is a rare, frequently fatal disease characterized by multiple cutaneous and visceral hemangiomas.
 The skin, liver, lungs, intestines, and central nervous system are the most commonly affected organs.
 Death can result from high-output cardiac failure as a result of arteriovenous shunting.
 In this report we present a new constellation of findings in a patient with diffuse neonatal hemangiomatosis, namely, an absent corpus callosum, ectopia cordis (sternal agenesis) with median abdominal raphe, and tricuspid atresia.
