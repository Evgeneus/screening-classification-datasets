Ocular melanoma in families with dysplastic nevus syndrome.
 Five families with the dysplastic nevus syndrome, in each of which one member had ocular melanoma, are reported.
 These five families were examined within a 3-year period in one medical center.
 To date only five other families with such a combination have been reported.
 We suggest a causal relation between ocular melanoma and the familial dysplastic nevus syndrome.
