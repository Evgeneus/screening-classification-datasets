Occipital meningoceles in patients with the Dandy-Walker syndrome.
 Occipital cephaloceles in the Dandy-Walker syndrome are not rare.
 To date, 28 cases have been reported.
 We report on 8 cases of associated occipital meningocele, totalling 16% of all patients with the Dandy-Walker syndrome in our series.
 In all patients, communication existed between the posterior fossa cyst and the occipital meningocele.
 In 2 patients, the occipital meningocele disappeared after cerebrospinal fluid shunting and never required surgical repair.
 It appears that the cranial defect had ossified and resulted in self-closure.
 Poor intellectual development in persons with the Dandy-Walker syndrome is associated with the presence of other central nervous system and systemic abnormalities and not with occipital meningoceles alone.
