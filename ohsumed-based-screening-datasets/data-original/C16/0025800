The long-term clinical outcome of patients with tricuspid atresia. II. Influence of surgical procedures.
 One-hundred and eleven patients with tricuspid atresia were seen during 1972-1982 and thirteen of these were not operated upon.
 The remaining 98 patients have undergone at least one operation.
 Those with low pulmonary blood flow had 1-4 shunt procedures; in 15 patients with high pulmonary blood flow the pulmonary artery was banded.
 The mortality rate after the first shunt was 10% (8/82), 9% after the second shunt (3/32) and 12% after the third and fourth shunts.
 Three out of 15 (20%) patients died after pulmonary artery banding.
 Twenty three patients underwent a Fontan operation and five died (22%); eighteen survivors are clinically well (after 1-7 years).
 One patient required a pacemaker implantation and revision of his Fontan procedure.
 The survivors of the palliative operations and the unoperated patients were more restricted, the older ones having developed pulmonary vascular obstructive disease, chronic heart failure or arrhythmias.
