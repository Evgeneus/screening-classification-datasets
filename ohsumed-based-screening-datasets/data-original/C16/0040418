Pulmonary sequestration: diagnosis with color Doppler sonography and a new theory of associated hydrothorax.
 The diagnosis of pulmonary sequestration has traditionally relied on angiographic demonstration of a systemic artery to the sequestered lung tissue.
 Rarely, extralobar sequestration can be associated with tension hydrothorax, which in the past has invariably led to fetal hydrops and death.
 The authors report the cases of three infants who had initially undergone color and spectral Doppler analysis; in two of them, extralobar sequestrations were associated with congenital hydrothorax.
 All three patients underwent surgical resection and histopathologic evaluation of their sequestrations.
 On the basis of the findings, the authors believe that torsion of the sequestration occludes the efferent venous and lymphatic channels, initiating the accumulation of pleural fluid and subsequent hydrops through systemic venous obstruction.
 Color Doppler made possible the identification of minute feeding vessels, obviating further diagnostic studies.
