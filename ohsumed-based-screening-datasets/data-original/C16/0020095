45,X/46,X dic (Y) mosaicism in a phenotypic male.
 Cytogenetic analysis, confirmed by in situ hybridisation studies, showed a mosaic 45,X/46,X dic (Y) (q12) karyotype in a 14 year old boy who was initially diagnosed as having Noonan's syndrome.
 He made an early response to recombinant growth hormone; this suggests that this treatment may improve final height.
