Nutritional status of infants with cystic fibrosis associated with early diagnosis and intervention.
 The purpose of this study was to characterize the nutritional status of infants diagnosed with cystic fibrosis (CF) through neonatal screening and to determine if they would achieve normal nutrition when managed with early intervention.
 In addition, nutrient intake was assessed to determine energy and macronutrient-consumption patterns.
 Evaluation of growth revealed that normal patterns could be achieved with mean energy intake values at ages 6 and 12 mo of 481 and 426 kJ/kg body wt (115 and 102 kcal/kg body wt), respectively.
 Biochemical assessment demonstrated low alpha-tocopherol and linoleic acid values at diagnosis in the majority of infants whereas one-third had abnormal indices of protein nutriture.
 Essential fatty acid deficiency was also demonstrated at diagnosis by abnormal triene-tetraene ratio values in 27% of screened infants.
 With predigested formula and dietary supplementation, there was improvement in all indices of nutritional status and only a low percentage of patients showed mild biochemical abnormalities at age 12 mo.
