Disorders of calcium and phosphorus homeostasis.
 Calcium and phosphorus are, respectively, the fifth and sixth most abundant elements in the body; both play vital roles in a multitude of physiologic systems.
 Because the great bulk of these elements is found in the skeleton, a large part of the discussion of calcium and phosphorus metabolism focuses on skeletal disorders, the impact of which falls heavily on young children.
 This article reviews the physiology of calcium and phosphorus, the skeletal and systemic consequences of disorders of vitamin D nutrition and metabolism, and the metabolic bone disease of prematurity.
