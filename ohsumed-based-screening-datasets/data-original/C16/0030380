Genetic aspects of admissions to a paediatric intensive care unit.
 Of 821 consecutive admissions to a paediatric intensive care unit, 47 (5.7%) were for chromosomal or monogenic disorders.
 These patients had more readmissions, longer mean stays, and a higher mortality rate than the group as a whole.
 In two of the four cases that died of single gene disorders, failure to store DNA made genetic counseling difficult.
