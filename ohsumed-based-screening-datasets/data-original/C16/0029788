Two-dimensional, spectral Doppler, and color flow imaging in adults with acquired and congenital cor triatriatum.
 Four adult patients ranging in age from 37 to 72 years with cor triatriatum diagnosed by two-dimensional, spectral Doppler, and color flow imaging are presented, including a previously undescribed "acquired" form after orthotopic heart transplantation and the oldest documented patient with cor triatriatum.
 The echocardiographic features of cor triatriatum with use of surface and transesophageal imaging are reviewed, with particular emphasis on the color flow findings.
 Color flow imaging has simplified the diagnosis and assessment of cor triatriatum, including the demonstration of other often-associated congenital cardiac anomalies.
