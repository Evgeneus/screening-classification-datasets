Head circumference/abdominal circumference ratio, ponderal index and fetal malnutrition. Should head circumference/abdominal circumference ratio be abandoned?
 Head circumference/abdominal circumference (HC/AC) ratios of the fetus are accepted as a means of distinguishing different patterns of growth retardation with a high ratio implying malnutrition of the fetus.
 Ponderal index (birthweight/length3) is used by paediatricians as a measure of neonatal wasting and would therefore be expected to correlate with HC/AC ratios at delivery.
 Anthropometric data on 999 newborn infants have been collected and analyzed by multiple regression.
 The results show a poor correlation between ponderal index and HC/AC ratio, worse than that between ponderal index and AC alone.
 The use of HC/AC ratios antenatally to identify subgroups of intrauterine malnutrition should be abandoned.
 The prediction of intrauterine malnutrition by weight/length ratios should be investigated further.
