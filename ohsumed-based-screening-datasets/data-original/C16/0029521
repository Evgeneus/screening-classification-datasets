Transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus with buttoned device: first successful clinical application in a child.
 Several devices are available for transcatheter closure of PDA.
 Most of the available devices either require complicated intracardiac maneuvering or need a large-sized sheath for implantation of the device.
 A recently described "buttoned" device developed by Sideris et al.
 that can be delivered across the ductus via a 7F sheath had undergone successful trials in animal models.
 Because of the ease of device implantation and the requirement for a smaller-sized sheath for delivery than that used with other devices, we have used this custom-made double-disc device in a 5-year-old child and have shown successful closure of the ductus by angiography and by color Doppler studies.
 Further clinical trials with this device seem warranted.
