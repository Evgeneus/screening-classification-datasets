Twin pregnancy: the impact of the Higgins Nutrition Intervention Program on maternal and neonatal outcomes.
 Perinatal outcomes were compared between 354 twins treated with the Higgins Nutrition Intervention Program and 686 untreated twins.
 After differing distributions of key confounding variables were adjusted for, the twins in the intervention group weighed an average of 80 g more (P less than 0.06) than the nonintervention twins; their low-birth-weight rate was 25% lower (P less than 0.05) and their very-low-birth-weight rate was almost 50% lower (P less than 0.05).
 Although the rate of preterm delivery was 30% lower in the intervention group (P less than 0.05), the rates of intrauterine growth retardation were similar in the two groups.
 Fetal mortality was slightly higher (14 vs 12 per 1000, NS), but early neonatal mortality was fivefold lower (3 vs 19 per 1000, P less than 0.06) in the intervention group.
 Maternal morbidity was significantly lower (P less than 0.05) in the intervention group.
 There was a trend towards lower infant morbidity in the intervention group.
 These results suggest that nutritional intervention can significantly improve twin-pregnancy outcome.
