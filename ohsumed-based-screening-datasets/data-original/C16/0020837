Mild fetal lateral cerebral ventriculomegaly: clinical course and outcome.
 The neonatal, pathologic outcome and karyotypic abnormalities are reported for 44 fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly diagnosed antenatally.
 Seventeen of these 44 fetuses (39%) had other ultrasonographic defects, and five (12%) had abnormal karyotypes.
 Five pregnancies were electively aborted and three other fetuses died in the neonatal period.
 Twenty-six (72%) of the remaining 36 live-born neonates are developmentally and clinically normal at 3 to 18 months of age.
 Twenty-one of these 26 had isolated mild ventriculomegaly as the only ultrasonographic finding.
 The other 10 live-born infants are developmentally impaired, and five of these 10 had mild ventriculomegaly as the only prenatal ultrasonographic abnormality.
 In conclusion, these data show that fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly have a lower incidence of associated anomalies and a better outcome than fetuses with more severe ventricular dilatation, as reported in the literature.
 The majority of fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly as an isolated finding and a normal karyotype are developing normally.
