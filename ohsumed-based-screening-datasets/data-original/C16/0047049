Malignant and nonmalignant T cell lines from human T cell lymphotropic virus type I-negative patients with Sezary syndrome.
 The establishment of an in vitro model for cutaneous T cell lymphomas and Sezary syndrome has been difficult since T cells from individuals with these diseases do not proliferate in response to T cell mitogens.
 We found that conditioned media, collected from mitogen-activated PBMC from Sezary patients, contain an IL-2 receptor inducing factor.
 Despite their ostensible proliferative disorder, using a combination Sezary cell-conditioned media and rIL-2, we established IL-2 responsive, human T cell lymphotropic virus type I negative T cell lines from 23 patients, nine of which contain cells with the structural and/or genetic characteristics of neoplastic Sezary T cells.
