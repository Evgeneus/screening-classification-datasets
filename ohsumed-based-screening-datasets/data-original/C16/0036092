Case report of a coronary anomaly: crossing obtuse marginal arteries.
 We present a coronary anomaly of crossing obtuse marginal branches of the left circumflex coronary artery which has not been seen in our laboratory or previously reported.
 Recognition of anomalous intramyocardial branches of the circumflex artery was important to avoid confusion with branches of the left anterior descending artery in conventional angiographic views and was clinically important as well.
 Intramyocardial vessels may not be easily bypassed surgically, and therefore angioplasty may be a better therapeutic option.
