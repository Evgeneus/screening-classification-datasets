Elastic fibre damage induced by low-dose D-penicillamine.
 We have studied 23 patients receiving penicillamine for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis to determine the prevalence of penicillamine-induced elastosis.
 One female patient had pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like skin changes and bramble-bush elastosis without calcification in the involved skin.
 Penicillamine elastosis was present in the joint capsule in 62% of eight patients or 64% of II joints examined and was detected in joint capsules after as little as I year of treatment.
