Tricuspid atresia or severe stenosis with partial common atrioventricular canal: anatomic data, clinical profile and surgical considerations.
 The anatomic findings in 11 cases of tricuspid atresia and in two cases of severe tricuspid stenosis, both combined with partial common atrioventricular (AV) canal, are presented in detail.
 Twelve cases were documented by postmortem examination and the diagnosis was confirmed by echocardiography and surgical observation in the one living patient.
 Clinical data available in nine cases and cardiac catheterization data obtained in eight are included in this report.
 In three cases (23%)--two with tricuspid atresia and one with extreme tricuspid stenosis--the tricuspid valve and right ventricle exhibited characteristics seen in Ebstein's anomaly.
 In all 13 cases, the great arteries were normally related.
 The ventricular septal defect(s) in 10 (83%) of the 12 postmortem cases rapidly became smaller and this resulted in marked diminution of the pulmonary blood flow and severe hypoxia.
 Only three of the eight patients with available cardiac catheterization and angiocardiographic data showed the scooped-out appearance of the left ventricular septal surface characteristic of AV canal defects.
 By contrast, two-dimensional echocardiography, available in the three most recent cases, accurately demonstrated all the defects present and represents the diagnostic method of choice.
 Early surgical intervention to establish a systemic to pulmonary artery anastomosis is essential for survival.
 More definitive surgical treatment can be achieved later by an atriopulmonary or cavopulmonary anastomosis with or without replacement of the cleft and often regurgitant mitral valve.
 The one living patient exemplifies this approach.
 This is the largest series of this unusual type of tricuspid atresia reported to date.
