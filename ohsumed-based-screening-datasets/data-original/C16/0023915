Origin of the left main coronary artery from the "non-coronary" sinus of Valsalva.
 A case is described in which the left main coronary artery arises from the posterior sinus of Valsalva in an otherwise normal heart.
 This coronary anomaly did not result in any functional obstruction or myocardial ischemia but represents only the third such anomaly described in the English language literature.
