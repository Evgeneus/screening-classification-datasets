A controlled trial of long-term bronchodilator therapy in cystic fibrosis 
 To evaluate the effect of long-term bronchodilator therapy in CF patients with demonstrated bronchial hyperresponsiveness, we first performed methacholine challenges to determine responsiveness, then entered 27 patients (16 methacholine responders and 11 nonresponders) into a two-month double-blind crossover trial of albuterol, 90 micrograms by inhalation four times a day vs placebo.
 Among the responders, daily PEFR measures improved significantly more during treatment with albuterol (12 +/- 32 L/min) than with placebo (-0.4 +/- 19 L/min; p less than 0.05).
 In addition, a clinically important level of improvement in PEFR (15 percent increase) was reached significantly more frequently in the responders.
 Methacholine nonresponders had no change in PEFR on either albuterol or placebo.
 Daily symptom scores as well as spirometry measurements at biweekly visits did not show significant changes.
 We conclude that long-term therapy with inhaled albuterol improves lung function in CF patients, but only in those with bronchial hyperresponsiveness as demonstrated by methacholine challenge.
