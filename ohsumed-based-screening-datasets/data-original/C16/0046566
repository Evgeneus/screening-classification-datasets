Early miscarriage and fetal malformations after induction of ovulation (by clomiphene citrate and/or human menotropins), in vitro fertilization, and gamete intrafallopian transfer.
 From the reviewed data, it appears that CC, hMG-hCG, or the association of these drugs with IVF-ET and GIFT programs do not carry an increased risk for congenital malformations as a whole, nor is there any specific malformation that has an increased incidence or is related in any way with the use of these drugs.
 Table 7 represents the specific malformation rate per 1,000 births in the general population and in newborns delivered after treatment with CC, hMG-hCG, or IVF-ET and GIFT.
 The malformation rate in the treated groups does not differ from that of the general population.
 However, as shown by McIntosh et al., the incidence of congenital malformations often rises with a longer follow-up.
 Most of the reports about babies born after ovulation induction are based on the initial examination done shortly after birth.
 Thus, studies including examination of these infants up to at least 12 months of age will be undoubtedly of value.
 Also, data concerning the reproductive capability of women born after ovulation induction is lacking.
 With regard to the abortion rate in pregnancies achieved after such treatments and procedures, it can be concluded that it does not appear to be higher than that of the general population, particularly when early pregnancy loss, advanced maternal age, the infertility status, and the increased incidence of multiple pregnancies occurring in these patients are taken into consideration.
