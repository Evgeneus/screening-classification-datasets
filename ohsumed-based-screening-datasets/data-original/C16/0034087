Placental abruption. A case-control investigation.
 The course of pregnancy and labour, neonatal outcome and social circumstances, were compared between 87 women with placental abruption and a control group of 5697 women.
 First and second trimester haemorrhage, amniocentesis, congenital malformations, maternal smoking and a job involving much standing or walking were associated with placental abruption.
