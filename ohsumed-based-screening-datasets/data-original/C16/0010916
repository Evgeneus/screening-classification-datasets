Evaluation and management of supraventricular tachycardia in children.
 Emergency physicians may be called on to resuscitate acute complications in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease.
 Supraventricular tachycardia, with or without hemodynamic decompensation, is one of the most serious complications.
 We present the case of a 22-month-old boy with a history of single ventricle who presented to our institution with a history of syncope and hemodynamically stable supraventricular tachycardia.
 Initial attempts at pharmacologic conversion with propranolol and verapamil failed.
 The arrhythmia was terminated in response to an IV fluid bolus and dopamine infusion and probably resulted from a combination of anemia, hypovolemia, and impaired contractility.
 Appropriate evaluation and management relating to the cre of acute supraventricular tachycardia in children are discussed.
