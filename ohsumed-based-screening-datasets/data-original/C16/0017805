 Echocardiography is used to assist the prenatal diagnosis group in understanding and identifying normal and abnormal structure, function, and rhythm in the fetal heart, normal variations, and change during development.
 Detailed segmental analysis of the heart's complex structure can be performed by experienced observers and the information used to aid in management decisions and to better understand the complex relationships of fetal cardiovascular anatomy and function, and fetal outcome.
 When used prudently, the technology appears to be safe to fetus and mother, but all who undergo examination will want to know of potential benefits and risks.
