Fibrinolytic parameters in normotensive pregnancy with intrauterine fetal growth retardation and in severe preeclampsia.
 In pregnancy a decrease in fibrinolytic activity, which is due to an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor activity and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and type 2, has been described.
 Because the placenta is a source of both type 1 and type 2 plasminogen activator inhibitor, we have studied them and other fibrinolytic parameters in a group of normotensive pregnant women with intrauterine fetal growth retardation and in two groups of women with preeclampsia, with or without intrauterine growth retardation.
 A significant increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 antigen and plasminogen activator inhibitor activity was observed in preeclampsia, with or without intrauterine growth retardation, but not in normotensive pregnancy with intrauterine growth retardation, when compared with normal pregnancy.
 Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 antigen levels showed a significant decrease in both groups of pregnant women (normotensive or preeclamptic) with intrauterine growth retardation when compared with pregnancies without intrauterine growth retardation.
 A significant correlation between plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 levels and fetal weight has been observed in the clinical groups.
