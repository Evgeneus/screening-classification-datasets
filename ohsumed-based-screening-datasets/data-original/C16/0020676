Serial neurobehavioral assessments in preterm infants.
 The purpose of this study was to compare serial neurobehavioral assessments in a sample of preterm infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) to those of a group of unaffected preterm infants.
 Of the 30 infants included in the study, 5 infants had a grade III or IV/VI intraventricular hemorrhage.
 Infants with IVH demonstrated more abnormalities in mental status and a cluster of abnormal neurologic findings (persistent ankle clonus, tremulousness, and brisk deep tendon reflexes).
 Of the 30 infants, 20 infants were included in a brain metabolism study.
 Infants who had experienced an IVH had significantly different brain metabolism findings, as measured by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR).
 There was a significant correlation between one measure of brain metabolism (PCr/PI) and the neurobehavioral assessment rating for infants with IVH.
