Heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver formation in association with congenital cardiac anomalies.
 Heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver formation is extremely rare.
 We studied a case of heterotopic liver in a 26-week fetus with severe cardiac and conotruncal anomalies.
 The cardiac anomalies are strikingly similar to those of a previously described patient with heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver.
 The cardiac anomalies and heterotopic supradiaphragmatic liver formation may be mechanistically related.
