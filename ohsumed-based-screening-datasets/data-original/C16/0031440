Genetic characterization of the APC locus involved in familial adenomatous polyposis.
 Familial adenomatous polyposis is a rare disease inherited in a Mendelian dominant fashion.
 It is characterized by the occurrence of more than 100 adenomatous polyps in the large bowels of affected individuals.
 The genetic defect responsible for adenomatous polyposis resides at a locus called APC which has been localized to the long arm of human chromosome 5.
 In this study, the APC locus was mapped with respect to 11 markers known to map to this chromosomal segment.
 Linkage of APC to four of these markers had been previously reported.
 Three additional markers are shown here to be linked to APC.
 By multipoint analysis, the APC locus maps to an interval bounded by D5S49 and D5S58.
 The refined map of the APC locus and the new markers described here improve the informativeness and accuracy of the presymptomatic diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis.
