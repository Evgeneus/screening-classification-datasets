Efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of neonatal sepsis.
 In Greece the majority of infections that affect the neonatal population are caused by gram-negative bacteria rather than by group B streptococci as in the United States.
 The present study investigated the efficacy of aztreonam, a beta-lactam antibiotic that is effective against gram-negative organisms, in this population.
 Fifty-five neonates aged 2 hours to 36 days who had sepsis were enrolled in this open study.
 Laboratory tests were extensive, and follow-ups were detailed.
 Aztreonam (90-125 mg/[kg.d]) administered in two or three doses was given in combination with penicillin (100,000 U/[kg.d]) for 6-15 days.
 Fifty-two infants were cured, one improved, and two did not improve and received other, more effective regimens.
 Adverse effects were minimal, and tolerance of aztreonam was excellent.
