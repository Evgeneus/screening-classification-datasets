The effect of trisomy 18 on transverse cerebellar diameter.
 The transverse cerebellar diameter was measured in 19 fetuses with trisomy 18.
 Eleven of the cerebellar measurements (57.9%) were greater than 2 SD below the mean for the patient's gestational age.
 If fetal biometry rather than last menstrual period were used to determine gestational age, four of the 19 (21.0%) cerebellar measurements were greater than 2 SD below the mean.
 Both intrauterine growth retardation and intrinsic central nervous system abnormalities associated with trisomy 18 appeared to affect cerebellar size.
