Straddling mitral valve with hypoplastic right ventricle, crisscross atrioventricular relations, double outlet right ventricle and dextrocardia: morphologic, diagnostic and surgical considerations.
 The clinical, surgical and morphologic findings in five cases of a rare form of straddling mitral valve are presented.
 Three patients were diagnosed by two-dimensional echocardiography, cardiac catheterization and angiocardiography and two had diagnostic confirmation at autopsy.
 All five cases shared a distinctive and consistent combination of anomalies: 1) dextrocardia; 2) visceroatrial situs solitus, concordant ventricular D-loop and double outlet right ventricle with the aorta positioned to the left of and anterior to the pulmonary artery; 3) hypoplasia of right ventricular inflow (sinus) with tricuspid valve stenosis or hypoplasia; 4) large right ventricular infundibulum (outflow); 5) malalignment conoventricular septal defect; 6) straddling mitral valve with chordal attachments to the left ventricle and right ventricular infundibulum; 7) severe subpulmonary stenosis with well developed pulmonary arteries; and 8) superoinferior ventricles with crisscross atrioventricular (AV) relations.
 The degree of malalignment between the atrial and ventricular septa was studied quantitatively by measuring the AV septal angle projected on the frontal plane.
 The AV septal angle in the two postmortem cases was 150 degrees, reflecting marked malalignment of the ventricles relative to the atria.
 This AV malalignment appears to play an important role in the morphogenesis of straddling mitral valve.
 As judged by a companion study of seven postmortem cases, the more common form of straddling mitral valve with a hypertrophied and enlarged right ventricular sinus had less severe ventricular malposition than did the five rare study cases with hypoplastic right ventricular sinus.
 A competent mitral valve, low pulmonary vascular resistance and low left ventricular end-diastolic pressure were found at cardiac catheterization in the three living patients who underwent a modified Fontan procedure and are doing well 2.2 to 5.8 years postoperatively.
