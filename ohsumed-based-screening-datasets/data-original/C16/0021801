Radiology of esophagitis: a pattern approach.
 This article presents a pattern approach for diagnosing esophagitis at double-contrast esophagography.
 In patients with nodular elevations of the mucosa, discrete plaques should suggest Candida esophagitis, whereas poorly defined nodules should suggest reflux esophagitis and a distinctive reticular pattern of the mucosa should suggest Barrett esophagus, particularly if adjacent to the distal aspect of a high stricture.
 In patients with ulceration, one or more shallow ulcers at or near the gastroesophageal junction should suggest reflux esophagitis, whereas discrete, superficial ulcers in the midesophagus should suggest herpes or drug-induced esophagitis, depending on the clinical setting.
 In contrast, one or more giant, relatively flat ulcers should suggest cytomegalovirus esophagitis, particularly in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Finally, thickened longitudinal folds may be caused by esophagitis, varices, or, rarely, "varicoid" carcinoma, but these conditions usually can be differentiated on radiologic grounds.
 By carefully analyzing the appearance and location of nodules, plaques, ulcers, or abnormal folds in the esophagus, one can usually suggest a cause of the disease.
