The IVH complex of lesions: cerebrovascular injury in the preterm infant.
 The term intraventricular hemorrhage has become associated with a variety of cerebrovascular insults in preterm infants.
 Because of a shared pathophysiology and timing, these are the neurologic lesions to search for when evaluating sick preterm infants.
 This complex of lesions is common and, when parenchymal injury occurs, likely to result in neurologic sequelae.
 A review of the variety of injuries, their pathophysiology, their diagnosis by cranial ultrasonography, and their prognosis is offered.
 Emphasis is placed on the need for assessment over time when evaluating parenchymal lesions in preterm infants.
