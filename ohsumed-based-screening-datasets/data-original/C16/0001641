Magnetic resonance imaging in Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome.
 Six girls with suspected Rokitansky syndrome underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and then sonography and laparoscopy to confirm the clinical diagnosis and define the precise characteristics of the malformation.
 The uterus was missing in all; four had mullerian rudiments in place of the uterus, which were cavitary in two as shown by sonography and in one by MRI.
 Both ovaries were present in all cases, normally located in four and extrapelvic in two; they were correctly identified by MRI in all cases and by sonography in four.
 Partially canalized vaginal rudiments were recognized by MRI in two girls and by sonography in one.
 One patient had unilateral renal agenesis, demonstrated by both MRI and sonography.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was more precise than laparoscopy and sonography in defining the anatomical characteristics of Rokitansky syndrome, and is less invasive and expensive than laparoscopy.
