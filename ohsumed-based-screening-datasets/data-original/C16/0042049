A wild-type DNA ligase I gene is expressed in Bloom's syndrome cells.
 Alteration of DNA ligase I activity is a consistent biochemical feature of Bloom's syndrome (BS) cells.
 DNA ligase I activity in BS cells either is reduced and abnormally thermolabile or is present in an anomalously dimeric form.
 To assess the role of DNA ligase function in the etiology of BS, we have cloned the DNA ligase I cDNA from normal human cells by a PCR strategy using degenerate oligonucleotide primers based on conserved regions of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe DNA ligase genes.
 Human DNA ligase I cDNAs from normal and BS cells complemented a S.
 cerevisiae DNA ligase mutation, and protein extracts prepared from S.
 cerevisiae transformants expressing normal and BS cDNA contained comparable levels of DNA ligase I activity.
 DNA sequencing and Northern blot analysis of DNA ligase I expression in two BS human fibroblast lines representing each of the two aberrant DNA ligase I molecular phenotypes demonstrated that this gene was unchanged in BS cells.
 Thus, another factor may be responsible for the observed reduction in DNA ligase I activity associated with this chromosomal breakage syndrome.
