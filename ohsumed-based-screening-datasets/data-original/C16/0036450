The nature of congenital posterior cervical or cervicothoracic midline cutaneous mass lesions. Report of eight cases.
 Between 4% and 8% of cases of spina bifida cystica occur in a cervical or cervicothoracic location.
 Despite a large body of literature concerning spinal dysraphism, there has been little written specifically about patients afflicted with this disorder in a cervical location.
 Eight children who presented at birth with posterior cervical or cervicothoracic lumps, all of which represented a dysraphic state, are discussed.
 Two types of abnormalities were noted.
 Three patients had hydromyelia with an associated myelocystocele herniating posteriorly into a meningocele sac.
 In these three patients there was an associated Chiari II malformation and hydrocephalus.
 The other five children had a meningocele in which a band of tissue extended from the posterior aspect of the spinal cord through a defect in the bone and fascia to the posterior part of the meningocele sac itself.
 No patient had a lesion that could be described as a meningomyelocele.
 The investigation and surgical management of these conditions are discussed and the need for intradural exploration to untether the spinal cord in the cervical region is stressed.
