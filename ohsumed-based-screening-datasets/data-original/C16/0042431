Experience with the Fowler Stephens and microvascular procedures in the management of intraabdominal testes.
 The Fowler Stephens operation and microvascular procedures were compared for the management of 23 intra-abdominal testes in 15 boys, 7 of whom had the prune belly syndrome.
 The Fowler Stephens operation was used for 15 testes (4 single-stage and 11 two-stage) and microvascular transfer was used for 8 testes.
 Eleven testes treated by the Fowler Stephens procedure (73%) and 7 treated by microvascular procedures (88%) were viable and intrascrotal after an average follow-up of 3.0 years, giving an overall success rate of 78%.
 Eight of 9 post-pubertal testes were biopsied.
 Severe maturational arrest was evident in all and carcinoma in situ was present in one.
