Pharmacokinetics of drugs in cystic fibrosis.
 Considerable work has been conducted on patients with CF to clearly demonstrate enhanced clearances of many, but not all drugs.
 The precise mechanisms for enhanced drug clearance in CF remain to be elucidated, and it will be important to examine the two major organs of drug elimination, the kidney and liver, for answers to these questions.
 Although it has not been studied to date, the role of the lung as a contributor to enhanced drug clearance in CF needs to be considered as well.
 In the liver it appears that both hepatic biotransformation as well as biliary excretion may be enhanced.
 In the kidney, there is enhanced CL of acidic drugs, but variable findings for cationic and zwitterionic drugs.
 The latter finding can be explained on the basis of the pKa of the drugs and the urine pH.
 It would be most appealing if enhanced renal and nonrenal clearance of drugs in CF could be attributed to a common single defect.
 At this time, there is no obvious candidate, although altered transmembrane transport would represent a place to start.
