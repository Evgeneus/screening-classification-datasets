In vivo and in vitro rat model for cyclosporine-induced proximal tubular toxicity 
 Cyclosporine is used widely to prevent transplant rejection.
 Unfortunately, this drug causes both renal glomerular and tubular damage.
 To develop a stable reproducible noncatabolic animal model of cyclosporine nephrotoxicity, rats were fed a special liquid diet and daily administered 7.5 mg/kg of cyclosporine intramuscularly.
 Twenty-one days after this regimen was started, the body weight of cyclosporine-treated rats had increased 15%, a value only 38% less than the increase in pair-fed controls.
 After 21 days, glomerular filtration rate fell 34% in cyclosporine-treated rats (p less than 0.001) compared with the pair-fed controls.
 Simultaneously, citrate and N-acetylglucosaminidase excretion increased significantly.
 When isolated proximal tubules obtained after 21 days from the cyclosporine and pair-fed rats were incubated by using 1.0 mmol/L glutamine and 1.0 mmol/L citrate substrates, ammonia production was reduced 40% and glucose production reduced 20% (p less than 0.001) in the cyclosporine-treated rats.
 Discontinuing cyclosporine for 7 days partially reversed all these changes.
 The glomerular filtration rate in cyclosporine-treated rats now was only 15% below that in controls (p less than 0.05), N-acetylglucosaminidase excretion was the same in both groups, and urinary citrate excretion in the cyclosporine-treated rats fell from 122% to 62% above that in controls.
 In vitro differences in tubular ammonia and glucose production also narrowed.
 In summary, these experiments describe a stable reproducible noncatabolic and at least partially reversible rat model for studying cyclosporine nephrotoxicity.
