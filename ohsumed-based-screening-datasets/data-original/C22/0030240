Role of calcium channel blockers in protection against experimental renal injury.
 The available evidence indicates that the first generation calcium channel blocker verapamil has a protective effect against both acute and chronic renal failure.
 At the cell membrane, verapamil helps minimize the effects of excess calcium influx after ischemic injury, evidenced by reduced uptake of 45Ca, thus lessening tubular injury from both calcium-activated phospholipases and mitochondrial calcium overload.
 In experimental chronic renal failure, the long-term administration of verapamil protects against renal dysfunction and damage, independent of any effect on systemic mean arterial pressure.
 Protective effects of verapamil are delineated in several models, supporting the presented hypothesis of the pathogenesis of renal failure.
