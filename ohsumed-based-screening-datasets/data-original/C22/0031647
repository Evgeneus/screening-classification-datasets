Reduction of rattlesnake-venom-induced myonecrosis in mice by hyperbaric oxygen therapy.
 Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) at 1, 2, and 2.75 atmospheres absolute (ATA) was used to treat rattlesnake (Crotalus atrox) venom-induced tissue damage and edema in thigh muscles of mice.
 Tissue damage was evaluated by double-blind histopathologic examination: tissue edema was determined by measuring tissue water content.
 A total of 10 intermittent exposures to oxygen over a period of 4 days at 2 and 2.75 ATA did not influence the resolution of venom-induced tissue edema, whereas tissue damage was significantly ameliorated as compared to air-treated envenomated controls.
 HBOT also promoted healing in the venom-injected mice as evidenced by the presence of regenerating muscle cells.
 It is concluded that HBOT may limit rattlesnake venom-induced myonecrosis and promote healing in a dose-response relationship without reducing venom-induced edema.
