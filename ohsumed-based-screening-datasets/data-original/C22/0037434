Detection of experimental Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteremia and endotoxemia by means of an immunolimulus assay.
 The rapid quantitation of bacteria in blood was achieved by using a novel assay method for gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin, LPS).
 The assay involves the capture of specific LPS onto microtiter plates by means of monoclonal antibodies directed against the oligosaccharide region of the LPS, followed by detection of the bound LPS by a chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) system.
 This immunolimulus (IML) assay combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies with the sensitivity of the LAL system to achieve the first specific, sensitive quantitation of bioactive endotoxin in plasma.
 In the animal model tested, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteremia in infant rats, there was a strong correlation between IML results and the concentration of Hib colony-forming units in blood samples (r = .845, P less than .001).
 Using antibodies with appropriate specificities, this approach should be useful for rapid detection of a wide range of gram-negative bacteria and endotoxins in blood.
