Administration of sucralfate prolongs survival of animals with experimental peptic ulceration.
 Ligation of the pig bile duct (BDL) results in 100% incidence of pars esophageal ulceration within 48 hours of the procedure.
 Usually such ulceration is uniformly fatal unless a highly selective vagotomy is performed simultaneously with the BDL.
 The administration of sucralfate to pigs with BDL prolonged their survival for up to 7 days, with evidence of healing of the ulcer on macroscopic and histologic observations.
 An increase in cell proliferation in the squamous epithelium of the ulcerated area was also seen in this sucralfate group.
 These features were not seen in controls, pigs with BDL only, or pigs with BDL and with magaldrate (Riopone), colloidal bismuth subcitrate (DeNol), or carbenoxolone.
 Analysis by Sepharose 2B gel filtration showed that there was no significant difference in the amounts of polymeric mucin in any group, with a wide scatter of the data seen especially for pigs in the untreated BDL-only group.
 This study suggests that sucralfate may enhance healing in this experimental pig ulcer model via a mechanism independent of the stimulation of mucus secretion.
 We propose that coating the mucosa with sucralfate provides a temporary substitute barrier that creates a microenvironment conducive to wound repair by mucosal proliferation.
