Beagle pup germinal matrix maturation studies.
 Intraventricular hemorrhage, or hemorrhage into the germinal matrix tissues of the developing brain, remains a common problem of preterm infants.
 The "risk period" for this insult is the first 3-4 postnatal days.
 We hypothesized that this risk period for hemorrhage is related to rapid perinatal maturation of the germinal matrix vasculature and employed the newborn beagle pup model for the study of this maturation.
 Newborn beagle pups (n = 30) were anesthetized and systemically perfused with buffered formalin; the brains were removed and prepared for immunohistochemical study.
 Sections stained with Bandeiraea lectin demonstrated that there was no difference in germinal matrix vessel density between postnatal days 1 and 4.
 Germinal matrix sections were also stained for antibodies to alpha-smooth muscle actin, collagen IV, collagen V, desmin, factor VIII-related antigen, fibronectin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, laminin, transferrin, and vimentin.
 Vasculature staining by alpha-smooth muscle actin was not noted until postnatal day 10, and differential staining was detected for antibodies to laminin and collagen V.
 Quantification of staining intensity by confocal microscopy demonstrated a significant increase in both extracellular matrix components at postnatal day 4 compared with day 1 (p less than 0.05 for both).
 These basement membrane proteins may add sufficient structural integrity to germinal matrix vessels to prevent capillary rupture and thus intraventricular hemorrhage.
