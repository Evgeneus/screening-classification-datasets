Experimental hypertension.
 Several interventions are used to induce hypertension in the experimental animal.
 The three most used interventions are renal ischemia, mineralocorticoid excess, and genetic manipulation.
 The sequence of events leading from these initiating manipulations to the elevated arterial pressure is being explored to define the mechanism responsible for hypertension.
 The following mechanisms are currently extensively evaluated: Pressor and depressor factors of renal origin, neurogenic regulation, circulating humoral factors, vessel wall hypertrophy, and membrane transport abnormality.
 The experimental models of hypertension hold great promise in providing an understanding of the mechanisms and developing effective treatment in clinical hypertension.
