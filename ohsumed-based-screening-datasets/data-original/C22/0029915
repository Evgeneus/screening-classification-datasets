An animal model for colon cancer metastatic cell line with enhanced metastasizing ability. Establishment and characterization.
 We have developed an animal model for colon cancer metastasis and produced a metastasizing tumor after using a microinjection technique to inject SW480 cells into the cecal wall of athymic nude mice during "minilaparotomy." After the metastatic foci formed in murine lung, an in vitro primary culture was performed and a new metastatic cancer cell line, which was designated as CC-ML3, was established.
 The studies included: 1) the comparison between SW 480 and CC-ML3 in morphology, growth kinetics, seeding and plating efficiency, and karyotype; and 2) carcino-embryonic antigen determination, origination, and metastatic ability of CC-ML3.
 The results showed that CC-ML3 was significantly different from SW480 in vitro and possessed a high metastatic potential in vivo.
 This newly developed animal model may thus be useful for studying the biology and pathogenesis of metastasis of human colonic cancer.
