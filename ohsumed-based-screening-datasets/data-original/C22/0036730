Topical antibiotic irrigation in the prophylaxis of operative wound infections in orthopedic surgery.
 1.
 Although the orthopedic literature on the clinical use of topical antibiotics is sparse, the effectiveness of topical antibiotics has been shown well enough in vitro and in the surgical literature to justify strong consideration of their use in orthopedic procedures.
 2.
 Saline irrigation should not be relied upon to reduce bacterial contamination completely, although it does remove debris, foreign material, and clot, which often contain bacteria, from the surgical wound.
 3.
 Topical antibiotic agents used for irrigation should have a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity.
 Triple antibiotic solution (neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin) provides the most complete coverage against the organisms most likely to cause infections in both clean and contaminated orthopedic surgical cases.
 These agents should be allowed to remain in the wound for at least 1 minute before their removal.
 4.
 Further studies of topical antibiotic irrigation in orthopedic surgery are needed to demonstrate the most effective antibiotic(s) and technique of administration.
 5.
 There is evidence to suggest that the more often an irrigant is used, the more effective it is in preventing infection.
 6.
 The use of bacitracin as an irrigant should probably be avoided in patients previously exposed to that agent.
 7.
 Antibiotic-containing solutions should be utilized with pulsatile lavage systems.
 Saline alone may drive previously administered antibiotics from bone, leaving insufficient local antibiotic levels.
