In vitro cultivation of Cryptosporidium parvum and screening for anticryptosporidial drugs.
 Sporozoites of Cryptosporidium parvum which were excysted in vitro from oocysts isolated from calves or patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome underwent development in monolayers of the mouse fibroblast cell line L929.
 Asexual multiplication occurred, with the maximum numbers of parasites usually being observed between 24 and 48 h after infection.
 Gametocytes were also found, but their numbers were relatively small compared with those of the asexual stages.
 A study was made of the effect on parasite development of 20 antimicrobial agents, most of which were anticoccidial or antimalarial agents.
 The majority of the drugs had a limited inhibitory effect on parasite development, but usually only at high concentrations.
 The two most active drugs were monensin and halofuginone, which reduced parasite multiplication by more than 90% at high concentrations.
 In the case of monensin, however, inhibition of parasite development at higher concentrations was due, at least in part, to a toxic effect of the drug on the host cells.
