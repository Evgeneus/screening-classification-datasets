Successful management of intractable cryptosporidial diarrhea with intravenous octreotide, a somatostatin analogue.
 A 38-year-old man with AIDS and intractable large-volume diarrhea due to a cryptosporidial infection was successfully treated with intravenous octreotide, a somatostatin analogue.
 The volume of diarrhea, 10-12 liters with 8-13 movements per day, was reduced to three to four semi-formed to formed stools per day when the patient was treated with 400 micrograms intravenous octreotide daily.
 The patient's intravenous hyperalimentation was discontinued and he returned to oral feeding.
 He quickly regained his normal weight and has now resumed his normal activities.
 For those patients who cannot tolerate subcutaneous administration, intravenous octreotide therapy may not only be life-saving but may also markedly increase the quality of life.
 Roxithromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, was also administered to this patient with cryptosporidiosis but efficacy was not demonstrated.
