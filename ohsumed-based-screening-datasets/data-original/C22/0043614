An endogenous inhibitor of calcium-activated neutral protease in UMX 7.1 hamster dystrophy.
 An endogenous inhibitor for calcium-activated neutral protease (CANP) from skeletal and cardiac muscles of muscular dystrophic hamsters (UMX 7.1) was compared with that from normal control animals at 4 and 10 weeks of age by Western blotting using antibody raised against CANP inhibitor.
 Fragmented CANP inhibitor was found in dystrophic skeletal muscles in all cases at both ages, while only intact inhibitor was detected in the skeletal muscle of the normal hamsters.
 A total absence of intact inhibitor was shown in one 10-week-old dystrophic hamster.
 In contrast, there was little difference in CANP inhibitor from heart between dystrophic and control hamsters at 4 weeks.
 However, fragmentation similar to that in skeletal muscle was seen in the heart inhibitor in a few of the 10-week-old dystrophic hamsters.
