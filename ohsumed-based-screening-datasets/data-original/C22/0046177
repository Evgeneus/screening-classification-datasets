The RIIIS/J inbred mouse strain as a model for von Willebrand disease.
 Mice of the RIIIS/J inbred strain have prolonged bleeding times (greater than 15 minutes) after experimental injury when compared with normal C57BL/6J mice (1.8 minutes) and other strains of mice.
 The prolonged bleeding time was accompanied by normal platelet counts.
 Platelet aggregation with collagen and agglutination with ristocetin were not significantly altered in RIIIS/J mice.
 Also, platelets from RIIIS/J mice had normal serotonin content and normal numbers of dense granules by electron microscopy.
 Thus, the bleeding abnormality is not due to platelet storage pool deficiency as has been found in several other mouse mutants.
 The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) which plasma from RIIIS/J mice was prolonged compared with normal mice, and factor VIII:C activity and von Willebrand antigen levels were one half to one third that of normal mouse plasma.
 Factor XI activity was also significantly deficient (levels at 42% to 64% of normal).
 Plasma of RIIIS/J mice contained the full complement of multimers of von Willebrand factor, although each multimer was lower in concentration compared with that in normal mice.
 Platelet alpha-granule von Willebrand antigen levels were similar to those of normal mice.
 The prolonged bleeding time of RIIIS/J mice was corrected by treatment with desmopressin.
 Heterozygous C57BL/6J x RIIIS/J F1 animals had low plasma von Willebrand antigen levels like the RIIIS/J parent and had variable bleeding times.
 Inheritance of the bleeding tendency was as an incomplete dominant, autosomal trait.
 These data indicate the RIIIS/J strain is a suitable animal model for type IA von Willebrand disease.
