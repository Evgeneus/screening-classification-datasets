Comparison of clinical and experimental data from an animal model of pulmonary immunologic sensitivity.
 Isocyanates are highly reactive chemicals capable of causing a multitude of toxicologic effects including respiratory irritation, dermal irritation, contact sensitivity, and pulmonary hypersensitivity.
 In order to probe the mechanism(s) underlying these reactions, an animal model has been developed.
 The guinea pig model reproduces both the respiratory and immunologic effects of isocyanates that have been observed clinically.
 In experimental animals and in humans, isocyanates induce immunologic reactions with specific antibody formation, including IgE.
 This finding allows development of diagnostic reagents to assess isocyanate sensitivity.
 Further characterization of immunologic components in the model is expected to increase understanding of the mechanisms of this immunotoxic disease and develop strategies for treatment and prevention.
