Placental thromboxane and prostacyclin production in an ovine diabetic model.
 We hypothesized that streptozocin-induced ovine diabetes would cause alterations in the placental production of thromboxane and prostacyclin.
 With a tissue incubation technique, we examined the placental production of thromboxane and prostacyclin in cotyledons from seven normal near-term ewes (127 +/- 3 days' gestation) and six streptozocin-induced diabetic ewes (125 +/- 3 days' gestation).
 Diabetic status was verified with serial fasting blood glucose assessments.
 Placental tissue was incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 48 hours at 37 degrees C with 95% oxygen and 5% carbon dioxide.
 Samples were collected at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 32, and 48 hours.
 Radioimmunoassay of the stable metabolites thromboxane B2 and 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha were used to determine thromboxane and prostacyclin production, respectively.
 Placental thromboxane production was reduced in diabetic animals when compared with control animals (5.63 +/- 2.81 vs 7.32 +/- 1.37 pg/mg per hour, respectively; p less than 0.05).
 Prostacyclin production was also significantly reduced in the diabetic placentas compared with control placentas (11.44 +/- 4.06 vs 16.29 +/- 4.59 pg/mg per hour, respectively; p less than 0.05).
 We conclude that the ovine placenta produces thromboxane and prostacyclin.
 The ovine thromboxane production rate is comparable to that of the human placenta but the prostacyclin production rate is approximately two to three times higher.
 The observed decrease in the placental production of thromboxane and prostacyclin may reflect an adverse effect of hyperglycemia directly on eicosanoid production or indirectly through decreased placental cellular proliferation.
