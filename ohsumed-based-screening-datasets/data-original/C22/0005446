Ischemic brain damage in a model of acute subdural hematoma.
 Ischemic brain damage is the most important neuropathological finding in humans who die after acute subdural hematoma; however, its causes are poorly understood.
 We have produced acute subdural hematoma in the rat by injecting 400 microliters of autologous blood (approximately 20% of intracranial volume) into the subdural space.
 Extensive areas of ischemic damage, involving 14 to 16% of the volume of the hemisphere, developed in this model at 4 and 24 hours after the lesion.
 The hematomas were associated with a brief peak in intracranial pressure (51 mm Hg), which remained at three times normal levels (14 mm Hg) for 3 hours.
 In this model, therefore, ischemic damage appears to be due to the local effects of blood overlying the cortex at 4 hours after the ictus, rather than to globally raised intracranial pressure.
 The implications for the pathophysiology of acute subdural hematomas in humans are discussed.
