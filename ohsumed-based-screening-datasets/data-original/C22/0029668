A rapid and simple diagnostic test for active visceral leishmaniasis.
 We have developed an immunodot assay for the serodiagnosis of active visceral leishmaniasis (AVL) which utilizes protein A colloidal gold as the visualizing agent.
 The test is simple, requires few reagents, and can be completed in two hours.
 It is sensitive and specific for active visceral leishmaniasis, and generally correlates with the ELISA.
 Either whole blood or sera in minute quantities may be used as test antibody.
 In addition, the use of the protein A gold immunodot is shown to detect anti-leishmania antibodies in infected dogs.
