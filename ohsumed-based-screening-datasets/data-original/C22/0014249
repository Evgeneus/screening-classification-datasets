Antipneumococcal activity of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and temafloxacin in an experimental mouse pneumonia model at various stages of the disease.
 The efficacy of temafloxacin against Streptococcus pneumoniae in an experimental murine pneumonia model was compared with that of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.
 Erythromycin and amoxicillin were used as reference agents.
 Subcutaneous administration of antibiotics every 12 h for 3 days was initiated at various times after infection.
 The cumulative survival rates of mice treated with temafloxacin at 50 mg/kg were 100%, 92%, 81%, and 50% with treatment beginning 18, 48, 72, and 96 h after infection, respectively.
 The activity of temafloxacin at 50 mg/kg was not significantly different from that of erythromycin and amoxicillin but was superior to that of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.
 The maximum cumulative survival rates of mice treated with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at 100 mg/kg were 67% and 50%, respectively, with treatment beginning 18 h after infection.
 Treatment with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin at 50 mg/kg 18 h after infection did not significantly increase survival rates compared with those of untreated controls.
