Borna disease virus replicates in astrocytes, Schwann cells and ependymal cells in persistently infected rats: location of viral genomic and messenger RNAs by in situ hybridization.
 Borna disease (BD) is an immune-mediated neurological disease caused by infection of the nervous system with a negative strand RNA virus, Borna disease virus (BDV).
 The host range for BDV is broad and extends from birds to primates.
 A BDV-like agent may cause disease in humans.
 Until recently, BDV-infected neural cells could only be identified immunocytochemically using serum from BDV-infected animals.
 The advent of BDV cDNA clones allowed definition of the relationship between viral nucleic acids and viral proteins in vivo.
 In situ hybridization with strand-specific RNA probes from a BDV cDNA clone, pAF4, identified BDV genomic RNA and BDV mRNAs in neurons, astrocytes, Schwann cells and ependymal cells in an anatomic distribution consistent with that of BDV proteins.
 Genomic RNA was contained primarily within the nucleus, whereas mRNAs were found in both the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.
 Viral RNAs were demonstrated in neurons expressing BDV proteins and in glial cells by combined techniques of immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization.
