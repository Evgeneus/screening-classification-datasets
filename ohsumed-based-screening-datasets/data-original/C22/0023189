Monoclonal antibody to the receptor for murine coronavirus MHV-A59 inhibits viral replication in vivo.
 Because many strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infect laboratory mice, no effective vaccine has yet been developed.
 An alternative approach to control MHV disease is the use of a host cell receptor-targeted ligand.
 To address the potential usefulness of this approach, a monoclonal antibody directed against the host cell receptor for the coronavirus MHV-A59 was administered to infant mice that were then challenged oronasally with 10(4) intracerebral infant mouse median lethal doses of MHV-A59.
 Antibody treatment of virus-challenged mice resulted in lower proportions of mice with MHV-A59 in target organs and markedly reduced viral titers in these organs compared with mock-treated infected mice.
 Some antibody-treated infected mice survived for 7 days after viral challenge, whereas no mock-treated, infected mice survived beyond day 3 after viral inoculation.
 These results support a receptor-targeted approach to intervention in coronavirus disease.
