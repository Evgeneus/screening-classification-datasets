Circulating antagonist of luteinizing hormone in association with infertility in stallions.
 Using a LH radioligand receptor assay (RRA) previously validated for use in serum and an equine monoclonal RIA, we have distinguished a subset of subfertile stallions with an elevated RRA/RIA ratio.
 After purification of the active moiety by anion exchange chromatography and immunoprecipitation with the equine LH (eLH) monoclonal antibody, RRA activity remained in the supernatant.
 This activity was also recognized by a polyclonal LH antibody (GDN 15) with wide cross-species recognition.
 This active fraction was further purified by gel filtration chromatography and shown to displace labeled eLH in a dose-dependent fashion in the RRA with an inhibition slope of 2.8 compared with a slope of 1.1 for native eLH.
 This fraction also inhibited the LH-stimulated steroidogenesis of Leydig cells in vitro in a dose-dependent fashion, but had no effect on basal (minus LH) steroid production.
 Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroelution of this material demonstrated RRA activity in a fraction with a mol wt between 45-66 kDa.
 We conclude that this substance 1) competitively inhibited binding of eLH and hCG to the LH receptor, 2) antagonized LH-stimulated steroidogenesis in vitro, and 3) may represent a LH isoform found in association with infertility in these animals.
