Age-related changes and tissue distribution of parvalbumin in normal and dystrophic mice of strain 129 ReJ.
 In murine muscular dystrophy, hindlimb muscle contains a functionally defective thiol protease inhibitor (TPI) which has been implicated in the onset and progression of the disease in mice.
 More recently, this protease inhibitor has been identified as parvalbumin, a calcium binding protein.
 In this study, a polyclonal antibody against mouse muscle parvalbumin was used to study the concentration and distribution of this protein in normal and dystrophic male mice at various ages.
 Immunodetection assays were used to screen extracts of hindlimb, forelimb, brain, heart, lung, liver, and kidney in 60-day-old normal and dystrophic male mice for parvalbumin content.
 Parvalbumin was detected in relatively high amounts in both hindlimb and forelimb muscle extracts, while much lower concentrations were detected in brains of normal and dystrophic animals.
 No parvalbumin was detected in the lung, liver, heart, or kidney extracts using the immunoassay.
 With aging, the parvalbumin concentration in hindlimb muscle of normal mice remained fairly constant for 90 days, whereupon the level increased at 120 days.
 In contrast, the parvalbumin concentration in hindlimb muscle of dystrophic mice decreased steadily with age to about 22%% of normal animals at 120 days.
 The parvalbumin content was also reduced in dystrophic brain.
