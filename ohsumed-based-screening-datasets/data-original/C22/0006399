A simplified technique for the production of heart failure in the dog by rapid ventricular pacing.
 Prolonged rapid ventricular pacing (VP) in dogs produces low output heart failure (HF) characterized by cardiomegaly, ascites, and elevated plasma renin and norepinephrine levels.
 Commercially available pacemaker generators have a protective circuit that prevents pacing at rapid rates.
 Previously, investigators have had to use either external temporary pacemakers or customized generators to pace at rates greater than 130 beats per minute (bpm).
 The authors have developed a simple method to perform rapid VP by gluing magnets on Medtronic VVI generators, which allows programming in a temporary mode to sustain rates up to 400 bpm.
 Our results using 10 generators in 55 dogs demonstrates that HF is produced in all dogs when VP is maintained at 250 bpm for an average of 28 days.
 Technical difficulties during our early experience with this technique included magnets becoming unglued, loss of capture, and wound complications requiring generator removal.
 Thus, our method reuses commercially available generators to rapidly pace the ventricles and induce HF.
