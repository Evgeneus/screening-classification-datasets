Rat as a potential model for hearing loss in biotinidase deficiency.
 Biotinidase deficiency is an inborn error of metabolism that is transmitted as an autosomal recessive disorder.
 Symptoms include hearing loss, ataxia, blindness, mental retardation, and seizures.
 The metabolic defect is an inability to recycle the vitamin biotin, which is an important cofactor in key enzymes.
 We therefore sought to develop an animal model for this disorder by inducing biotin deficiency.
 Rat pups were divided into control and experimental groups.
 Control rats were fed a normal diet whereas experimental animals were given a diet deficient in biotin.
 Animals from both groups underwent brain stem auditory evoked potential testing at various ages.
 Wave I thresholds at various ages were similar in both groups.
 Latencies for wave I, however, and interpeak latencies (I-IV) were prolonged in the biotin-deficient groups compared to controls.
 Scanning electron microscopy of the organ of Corti in biotin-deficient animals showed no significant hair cell loss.
 The biotin-deficient developing rat appears to acquire functional changes in the auditory brain stem.
 These effects may be caused by defective myelination, since biotin is important in fatty acid metabolism.
