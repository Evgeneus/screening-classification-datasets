Tissue distribution of the dystrophin-related gene product and expression in the mdx and dy mouse.
 We have previously reported a dystrophin-related locus (DMDL for Duchenne muscular dystrophy-like) on human chromosome 6 that maps close to the dy mutation on mouse chromosome 10.
 Here we show that this gene is expressed in a wide range of tissues at varying levels.
 The transcript is particularly abundant in several human fetal tissues, including heart, placenta, and intestine.
 Studies with antisera raised against a DMDL fusion protein identify a 400,000 Mr protein in all mouse tissues tested, including those of mdx and dy mice.
 Unlike the dystrophin gene, the DMDL gene transcript is not differentially spliced at the 3' end in either fetal muscle or brain.
