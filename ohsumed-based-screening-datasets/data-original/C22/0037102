Experimental Acanthamoeba keratitis: II. Immunohistochemical evaluation.
 In a Wistar rat experimental model of Acanthamoeba keratitis immunohistochemical techniques were used to analyse the host cellular response.
 The inflammatory cell profile was observed to change at intervals.
 In tissue sections the cellular response consisted of neutrophils on the first day but predominantly macrophages on the following days.
 Some T lymphocytes but no B lymphocytes were observed.
