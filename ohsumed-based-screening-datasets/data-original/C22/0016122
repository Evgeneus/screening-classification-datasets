An autosomal recessive gene that delays expression of lupus in BXSB mice.
 We report the generation and serologic, cellular, histologic, and genetic characteristics of a BXSB/MpJScr substrain, termed BXSB/MpJScr-ll/ll, that has lost early-life male lupus disease.
 Classic genetic analysis suggested that delayed disease expression results from the action of a single autosomal recessive gene.
 This putative gene, referred to as ll (long-lived), causes a significant delay in expression of autoimmune serology (total serum IgG and anti-nuclear antibodies levels), monocytosis, and of immune complex-mediated histopathologic changes such as glomerulonephritis, arteritis, and myocardial infarction.
 Presumably as a consequence of the delayed immunopathology male BXSB/MpJScr-ll/ll mice live three to four times longer than regular BXSB/MpJScr.
 This strain might be useful for analysis of single genes responsible for severe autoimmune disease expression.
