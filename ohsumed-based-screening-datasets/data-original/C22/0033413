Initial recruitment of neutrophils to alveolar structures in acute lung injury.
 The adult respiratory distress syndrome and bacterial pneumonia are both characterized by an influx of neutrophils into the lung.
 The neutrophil has been implicated as having a "pathological" role in adult respiratory distress syndrome, in contrast to its role in bacterial pneumonia.
 We hypothesized that processes resulting in neutrophil recruitment to the lung are distinct, depending on whether the inflammatory stimulus arises in the intravascular or the alveolar compartment of the lung.
 Anesthetized sheep with lung lymph fistulas were utilized to access the three compartments of the lung relevant to studies of transpulmonary neutrophil migration.
 Serum, lung lymph, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were studied for neutrophil influx and chemotactic activity before and after administration of endotoxin by either an intravascular or inhaled alveolar route.
 Both groups developed significant neutrophil influx into the lymph and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid by 3 h postendotoxin.
 Those animals receiving intravascular endotoxin developed chemotactic gradients opposing neutrophil migration into the lung in contrast to animals receiving alveolar endotoxin, suggesting that neutrophil influx into the lung occurs by random migration.
