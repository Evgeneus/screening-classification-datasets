Magnetic resonance imaging of experimental rat brain tumors: histopathological evaluation.
 Using RG-C6 glioma-transplanted rats, we studied precontrast and postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging, extravasation of Evans blue, and histology.
 In all rats, tumor was enhanced with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Gd-DTPA).
 The necrotic portion in the tumor, however, was not enhanced.
 Hemorrhage and hydrocephalus were clearly visualized on both the precontrast and postcontrast images.
 Blood-brain barrier-disrupted areas stained with Evans blue and areas enhanced with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging were nearly consistent.
 It is suggested that the mechanism of brain tumor enhancement with Gd-DTPA on magnetic resonance imaging is simply related to the degree of alteration of the blood-brain barrier.
 The Gd-DTPA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, even with low magnetic field, is useful for the evaluation of size, shape, and location of experimental rat brain tumors.
