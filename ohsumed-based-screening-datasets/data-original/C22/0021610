Creation of a feline model of obstructive uropathy.
 The aim of this project was to create a reproducible, quantifiable feline model of obstructive uropathy.
 Seventy-three adult female cats of comparable age were evaluated to obtain the normal control urodynamic data base.
 Twenty-four cats had a silastic cuff installed around the urethra to induce bladder outlet obstruction, and eight underwent a sham operation.
 Repeated urodynamic evaluations were performed at predetermined postoperative intervals.
 The obstructed and normal cats inhibited detrusor contractility by reflex striated urethral sphincter activity.
 Measurements of voiding pressure to verify the presence, and to assess the degree of induced outlet obstruction, required paralysis of the sphincter by curare.
 Following cuff implantation, voiding pressure increased from a mean normal of 17.2 cm./H2O to 31.6 to 42.5 cm./H2O in animals designated as moderately obstructed, and to 101.7-125.0 cm./H2O in animals designated as severely obstructed.
 84.6% of the high pressure bladders developed vesicoureteral reflux.
 Analysis of resting, low bladder volume, urethral pressure profile (UPP) data and voiding pressures indicate a compensatory sphincteric response to filling in non-curarized animals, and a lack of that response in curarized animals.
 It appears that implantation of a silastic cuff to prevent full opening of the urethra during voiding, without actually compressing it, is a reasonable model of obstructive uropathy.
 The observation that the relationship between striated urethral sphincter activity and inhibition of detrusor contractility is influenced by administration of curare was unexpected, and may have clinical implications.
