The use of an amniotic membrane graft to prevent postoperative adhesions.
 Grafts of trypsin-treated, gamma-irradiated human amniotic membranes were used to cover injured uterine horns of nulliparous female rabbits to prevent adhesions.
 In this study, the gradual integration of the membranes into the serosal layer of the uterus, together with marked neovascularization, was observed.
 By the 30th postoperative day, the grafts had been completely integrated, with little evidence of rejection and no evidence of infection at the graft sites.
 Of 30 uterine horns treated with membrane grafts, only 4 (13.4%) showed any adhesion formation at or among the graft sites.
 All of the 24 untreated controls showed adhesion formation at the site of injury.
 Furthermore, whatever adhesions were found in membrane-treated horns could be graded as thin and filmy, accounting for less than 10% of the surface area of the graft, whereas the controls showed dense, thick adhesions covering 50% to 100% of the injured areas.
 We conclude that these specially prepared amniotic membranes are safe and effective in dramatically reducing postoperative adhesion formation in this animal model.
