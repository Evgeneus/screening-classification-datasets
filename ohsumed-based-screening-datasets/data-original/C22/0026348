Pentastomiasis in Canada.
 We report a case of human pentastomiasis in a 28-year-old man who emigrated to Canada from Nigeria in 1982 and died as a result of a motor vehicle accident in 1989.
 At autopsy, in addition to trauma, numerous small cystic nodules (3 to 9 mm in diameter) were discovered in the liver, pleura, lungs, and mesentery and under the intestinal and parietal peritoneum.
 The parasites were diagnosed as well-preserved, encysted Armillifer armillatus nymphs.
 Neither degenerative nor inflammatory granulomatous reactions were observed in the adjacent tissue.
 To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of human infection with encysted nymphs of A armillatus and the eighth reported case of pentastomiasis in North America.
