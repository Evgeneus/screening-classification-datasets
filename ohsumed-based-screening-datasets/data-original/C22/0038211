Genetic heterogeneity of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
 We examined DNA fingerprints of the spontaneously hypertensive rat from Shimane Institute of Health Science, Izumo, Japan, including seven substrains that were separated in the early stages of the establishment of the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat, and compared their fingerprints with those of rats from other sources.
 Obtained DNA fingerprints revealed that, in both the stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat and the Wistar-Kyoto rat, there is a substantial genetic difference between the rats from the National Institutes of health and from Shimane Institute of Health Science.
 By contrast, only a small genetic difference was observed either between the rats from the National Institutes of Health and Charles River Laboratories or among the substrains of the spontaneously hypertensive rat in the Shimane Institute of Health Science.
 Further, in the strains from the Shimane Institute of Health Science, there were fingerprinting bands that could distinguish either the Wistar-Kyoto rat from all the substrains of the spontaneously hypertensive rat or the stroke-prone from the stroke-resistant spontaneously hypertensive rat in spite of their close genetic backgrounds.
 From the observations above, we concluded 1) that there is substantial genetic variance of the spontaneously hypertensive rat between the two major sources in the world, the National Institutes of Health and the Shimane Institute of Health Science and 2) that by DNA fingerprinting analysis, it is possible to identify the restriction fragment length polymorphisms that are specific for the spontaneously hypertensive rat or the stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat.
 These polymorphisms can be applied in the segregation study of the F2 generation.
