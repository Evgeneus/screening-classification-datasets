Contribution of increased endolymphatic pressure to hearing loss in experimental hydrops.
 After the induction of experimental hydrops there follows a strict sequence of compound action potential (CAP) audiogram changes.
 Within days a low-frequency loss (below 8 kHz) is detected; within weeks a very high-frequency loss (above 8 kHz) develops; and finally within months the 8-kHz region is also affected.
 Following the application of excess pressure, presumably to the endolymphatic spaces, via a cannula placed in the endolymphatic duct, a sequence of CAP audiogram changes occurs that is not similar to that observed with hydrops.
 There is first a very high-frequency loss (above 4 kHz), then a very low-frequency loss (below 4 kHz), and finally the 4 kHz region is also affected and thresholds for all frequencies become even more raised.
 The data thus suggest that a slow accumulation of endolymph as induced by blockage of the endolymphatic duct does not produce the same disorder as a rapid onset of a high pressure applied at the base of the cochlea.
 In addition the data suggest that raised endolymphatic pressure is not likely to be significant in early stages of hydrops, but could contribute to the later high-frequency sensitivity losses.
