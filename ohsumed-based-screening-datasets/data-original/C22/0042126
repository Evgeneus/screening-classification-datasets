Ocular teratology.
 The principles of teratology are described, and animal models for research in abnormal ocular development and clinical studies of human teratogens are surveyed.
 A review is made of presumed ocular teratogenic agents: radiation; external environmental teratogens; maternal conditions such as infections, diabetes, and epilepsy; alcohol and drugs such as thalidomide, retinoic acid, and coumarin anticoagulants; and other agents, such as cigarettes.
