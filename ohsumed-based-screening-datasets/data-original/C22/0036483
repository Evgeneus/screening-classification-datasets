Development of an in vitro temporomandibular joint cartilage analog.
 A method of producing an in vitro cartilage tissue analog by traditional organ culture methods in an animal model is presented.
 The resultant tissue analog had the clinical appearance and characteristics of the temporomandibular joint disc.
 Development of such an analog for in vivo autografting could provide an alternative to present methods for disc repair.
