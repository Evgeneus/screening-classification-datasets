Loss of antigens associated with the apical endocytotic pathway in proximal tubules from rats with heymann nephritis.
 In addition to the glomerular lesions associated with Heymann nephritis, a rat model of human membranous nephritis, proximal tubule damage, and a perturbation of proximal tubule function also have been reported to occur in this disease.
 The aim of the present study was to examine in more detail the nature of the apical plasma membrane damage in proximal tubules using specific antibodies directed against clathrin, gp330, and a proton-pumping adenosine triphosphatase, all of which are components of the apical endocytotic apparatus of these epithelial cells.
 Immunocytochemical studies revealed a marked reduction in staining for all three antigens in proximal tubules from rats with active Heymann nephritis.
 Furthermore endocytotic uptake of intravenously injected FITC-dextran was considerably lower in diseased animals than in normal rats.
 Gp330 and rat IgG were identified as components of the luminal debris that accumulated during the course of Heymann nephritis.
 These results show that perturbation of proximal tubule endocytosis occurs in Heymann nephritis together with a loss of three apical antigens that are normally localized on membrane domains associated with the apical endocytotic pathway in these cells.
 The results also suggest that antibody-antigen complexes may be shed from the plasma membrane in both the glomerulus and the proximal tubule in this disease.
