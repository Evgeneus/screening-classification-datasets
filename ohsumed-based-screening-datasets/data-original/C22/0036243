Neovascularisation of the meniscus with angiogenin. An experimental study in rabbits.
 Angiogenin, a potent blood vessel inducing protein, was implanted into experimentally injured menisci of 75 New Zealand white rabbits.
 Localised neovascularisation occurred in 52% of the angiogenin-treated animals, and in 9% of the controls.
 Neovascularisation induced by angiogenin may enhance healing of injuries within the poorly vascularised meniscal fibrocartilage, and improve the results of meniscal repair.
