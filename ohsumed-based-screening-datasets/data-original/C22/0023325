Effect of cyclosporine on the development of cerebral vasospasm in a primate model.
 The authors studied the effect of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporine (CS) on the development of cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) using a primate model of vasospasm.
 Eighteen monkeys were randomly divided into three groups: a sham-operated control group, an SAH group, and a CS-treated group.
 To induce SAH, the right side of the circle of Willis was dissected free of the arachnoid and an autologous blood clot was placed around the arteries.
 In the CS group, CS (5 mg/kg/day) was administered intramuscularly for 7 days after the induction of SAH.
 The vessel caliber was evaluated on angiograms before the induction of SAH (Day 0) and 7 days after SAH (Day 7).
 Histological changes and the deposition of IgG in the arterial wall were studied in the three groups.
 The combined values of the average reduction of the right cerebral arteries at Day 7 was significant (P less than 0.05) in the SAH group (-43.3%) and in the CS group (-31.3%) as compared with the Sham group (-0.7%); however, there was no significant difference between the values in the SAH and the CS groups.
 In the CS group, the average reduction in vessel caliber of the right middle and anterior cerebral arteries was significantly (P less than 0.05) less than in the SAH group; this did not prove true for the internal carotid artery, however.
 Although the deposition of IgG in the media and an inflammatory reaction were observed in the spastic arterial wall in both the SAH and CS groups, there was no definitive difference in these immune/inflammatory reactions between the two groups.
 It is suggested that CS may be helpful in reducing the severity of vasospasm, but may not have a major therapeutic effect, considering its systemic toxicity.
