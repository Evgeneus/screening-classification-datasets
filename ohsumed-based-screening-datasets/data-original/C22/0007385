Scatter photocoagulation restores tissue hypoxia in experimental vasoproliferative microangiopathy in miniature pigs.
 Experimental retinal branch vein occlusion using argon laser photocoagulation in miniature pigs induced the development of ischemic retinal territories associated with preretinal neovascularization.
 Preretinal partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) measurements on the ischemic territories, using O2-sensitive microelectrodes, established that the ischemic retinal areas were hypoxic.
 Scatter photocoagulation of these ischemic hypoxic territories restores the local PO2 to the normal values within 2 weeks.
 Hence, the reported inhibitory effect of photocoagulation on the development of retinal neovascularization could be due to a reversal effect on tissue hypoxia.
