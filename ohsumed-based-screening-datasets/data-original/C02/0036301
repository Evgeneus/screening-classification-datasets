Influences of dietary restriction on immunity to influenza in aged mice.
 Our previous studies of the immune response of aged mice inoculated with influenza A virus revealed age-related decreases in antigen-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte function (CTL), T-cell proliferation, IL-2 production, antigen presentation, and antibody production.
 Because dietary restriction (DR) of rodents has been shown to extend maximum life span, delay the onset of tumors, and improve many immunologic parameters in aged animals, we tested the effect of such a regimen on the immune response to the influenza virus.
 We report that DR significantly inhibited the age-related decline in antigen presentation and T-cell proliferation.
 It also reduced the decline in antibody production to the virus.
 This is the first demonstration of improved immunity to an actual infectious agent resulting from DR.
 The improvement appears to be on a number of levels and to reflect more than one operative mechanism.
