Spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation in HTLV-II infection.
 We measured lymphocyte proliferation in the absence of antigenic stimulation in 45 HTLV-II infected, 9 HTLV-I infected, and 19 HTLV-I seronegative intravenous drug users (IVDU).
 Lymphocyte proliferation was higher in IVDUs infected with HTLV-II than in seronegative IVDUs but lower than among those infected with HTLV-I.
 Higher rates of proliferation were also associated with needle sharing, CD4+ and IL2R+ lymphocyte counts, and HTLV-I antibody titres.
