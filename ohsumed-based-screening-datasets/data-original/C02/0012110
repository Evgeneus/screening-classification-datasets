Herpes zoster ophthalmicus and iris cysts.
 Herpes zoster ophthalmicus has been associated with numerous complications such as neuropathy, keratitis, anterior uveitis, and neuralgia.
 To my knowledge, there have been no reports of secondary iris cyst formation.
 I hereby report the case of a patient who developed an iris cyst during a Herpes zoster ophthalmicus infection.
