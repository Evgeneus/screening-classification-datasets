Coccidioidomycosis in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.
 Coccidioidomycosis is at best a complicated fungal infection; often it is life-threatening.
 Coccidioidomycosis is confined epidemiologically to the southwestern region of the USA, and most cases have occurred in that area, particularly in Arizona.
 However, we have seen several cases in San Francisco in patients with only a history of travel to endemic areas.
 In part because of its regional distribution, information about the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients with coccidioidomycosis has lagged behind information about other, more commonly encountered AIDS-associated opportunistic infections.
 Drs.
 Galgiani and Ampel have probably had the largest single experience with coccidioidomycosis in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
 These specialists share their experience and make recommendations as to how these complicated conditions should be approached.
