Contribution of antibody response to recombinant HIV-1 gene-encoded products nef, rev, tat, and protease in predicting development of AIDS in HIV-1-infected individuals.
 The relation between antibody-response profiles to Escherichia coli-produced HIV-1 nef, rev, tat, and protease proteins and the risk of developing AIDS was studied using stored serum samples taken sequentially from a cohort of 195 initially symptom-free men who were seropositive for antibodies to HIV-1 structural proteins and 72 men who seroconverted for such antibodies.
 The AIDS attack rates at 39 months follow-up were significantly higher in the men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to nef, tat, and protease, respectively.
 [Difference (D) between attack rates = 11.279, 5.884, and 8.322, respectively].
 No significant difference was found between men with negative versus positive antibody profiles to rev.
 The above differences between AIDS attack rates were clearly lower than those reported from the same cohort for men who were serum HIV-1 antigen positive versus negative, and for men with low versus normal CD4+ lymphocyte counts, but with respect to nef antibody-response profiles, resembled the difference reported between anti-HIV-1 core antibody-negative versus antibody-positive men.
 In the subgroup of men without any of the markers previously found to be predictive of progression to AIDS in the cohort (persistent HIV-1 p24 antigenemia, low anti-HIV-1 anti-core antibody reactivity, and low CD4+ cell counts), antibody profiles to nef, rev, tat, and protease did not contribute to the prediction of outcome of infection.
 When used in combination with persistent HIV-1 p24 antigenemia and low CD4+ cell counts, negative antibody profiles to nef and protease, respectively, were equally sensitive and specific in predicting progression to AIDS, as was low anti-HIV-1 anti-core antibody reactivity.
