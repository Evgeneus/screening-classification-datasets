Response of mononuclear cells from HIV-infected patients to B-cell mitogens: correlation with immunological and clinical features of disease progression.
 Proliferation of mononuclear cells from HIV-seropositive patients to B-cell mitogens was studied in the absence and presence of mixed lymphocyte culture supernatants (MLC-sup).
 The results show: (1) patients' responses to B-cell mitogens overlap with normal responses but are, on average, consistently lower than normal; (2) the addition of MLC-sup increases the proliferative responses to T-cell-independent mitogens, but does not bring patient's responses up to control levels; (3) HIV-positive patients in all clinical categories have decreased responses to B-cell mitogens.
 Although some patients with AIDS Centers for Disease Control (CDC) group IVC and IVD have the lowest responses, asymptomatic (CDC group II) and AIDS-related complex (ARC; CDC groups III/IVA and IVB) patients also show significant defects.
 (4) The same patients were recategorized using an immunological staging system.
 Those patients with more normal immunohematological parameters have significantly greater responses to mitogens compared with patients with more abnormal immunological parameters.
 The data suggest that immunological staging could provide more information than clinical classification with respect to the underlying immunopathogenic events occurring in HIV infection.
