A target-based model for increasing influenza immunizations in private practice. Genesee Hospital Medical Staff 
 OBJECTIVE: To measure the impact of a population-based tracking system on influenza immunization rates.
 DESIGN: Thirteen practices with 45 physicians were randomized to a control and two intervention groups.
 SETTING: Private practices.
 PATIENTS: All patients aged 65 years and over who were seen in participating physicians' practices within the preceding two years.
 INTERVENTION: In both intervention groups influenza immunization rates for physicians were recorded weekly as cumulative percentages of their target populations, using a specially prepared poster.
 In addition, postcard reminders were sent to all the patients in one of the intervention groups.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Immunization rates in the two intervention groups were 30% higher than in the control group; the control group immunized 50% (2,405/4,772) of its target population, while the poster and poster/postcard groups immunized 66% (1,420/2,149) and 67% (2,427/3,604), respectively.
 CONCLUSION: A population-based strategy that monitors performance can significantly improve rates of influenza immunization in private practices.
