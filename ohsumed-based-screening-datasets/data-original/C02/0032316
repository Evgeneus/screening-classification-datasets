Hepatitis prevalence in trauma patients.
 The risks of viral transmission from trauma patients is a continuing concern to those involved in their care.
 However, the prevalence of hepatitis (HPT) in trauma patients is poorly described.
 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of HPT in trauma patients admitted to an urban trauma center.
 Two hundred sixty-four consecutive admissions to an urban Level I trauma center underwent serologic screening for HPT.
 Risk factors were assessed by direct patient questioning.
 Serologic evidence of HPT B was found in 19.7 per cent of patients.
 Intravenous (IV) drug abusers represented eight per cent of the study population; this group had a 67 per cent rate of seropositivity.
 Hepatitis A was not found in any patient.
 Antigenemia was found in 1.9 per cent of patients.
 It is concluded that HPT B seropositivity is common in trauma patients.
 IV drug abusers have particularly high prevalence of HPT.
 This high prevalence rate of HPT B serology poses a significant risk to those involved with the care of trauma patients.
 The authors suggest that specific protocols to avoid the transmission of viral disease should be mandatory in urban trauma centers.
