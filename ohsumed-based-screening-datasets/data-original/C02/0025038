Antiviral effects of 3'-fluorothymidine and 3'-azidothymidine in cynomolgus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus.
 An acute infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVSM) in cynomolgus monkeys was used to evaluate the antiviral effects of 3'-fluorothymidine (FLT) and 3'-azidothymidine [zidovudine (ZDV)].
 Neither compound prevented the infection despite dosing prior to virus inoculation.
 FLT was about ten times more potent than ZDV in delaying the appearance of SIVSM antigen in the monkeys.
 The serum half-life of FLT was longer than that of ZDV and ZDV was bound to plasma proteins to about 60% while FLT was virtually unbound.
 It is proposed that the in vivo difference in potency between ZDV and FLT could, at least partly, be explained as the combined effects of a longer plasma half-life and a higher free concentration of FLT and possibly a higher intracellular concentration of the triphosphate of FLT.
