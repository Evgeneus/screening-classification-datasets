Effects of long-term zidovudine treatment on cell-mediated immune response and lymphokine production.
 The effects of long-term zidovudine treatment on functional parameters of cell-mediated immunity were investigated in 15 symptomatic HIV-antibody-positive patients with clinical evidence of opportunistic infections.
 Mononuclear leukocytes were obtained before administering the drug, and after 3 and 6 months of treatment.
 The cells were stimulated with lectins in order to assess variations of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation and production of gamma-interferon (IFN) and interleukin-2 (IL-2), and with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) to assess variations of alpha-IFN production.
 Mean proliferative responses to PHA and Con-A did not show any significant change between baseline, 3 months, and 6 months values (25,158 +/- 11,763, 24,662 +/- 8,955, and 34,924 +/- 16,283 D-cpm, respectively, for PHA, p greater than 0.05; and 5,470 +/- 1,890, 4,953 +/- 2,518, and 4,539 +/- 3,286 D-cpm, respectively, for Con-A, p less than 0.05).
 Mean response to PWM (9,707 +/- 4,429 D-cpm at entry) increased significantly after 3 months, but returned to baseline values at 6 months (17,039 +/- 5,123 and 10,314 +/- 3,855 D-cpm, respectively, p = 0.016).
 IL-2 production (5.51 +/- 4.0 I.U.
 at entry) rose particularly at 3 months and persisted at the same levels at 6 months (9.6 +/- 4.8 and 9.5 +/- 6 I.U., respectively, p less than 0.05).
 By contrast, a moderate but significant decrease in gamma- and alpha-IFN production was observed (65 +/- 2.2, 35.1 +/- 1.6, and 22 +/- 2 I.U., respectively, for gamma-IFN, p less than 0.05; 60 +/- 3, 64 +/- 2.6, and 12 +/- 1.5 I.U., respectively for alpha-IFN, p less than 0.01).
