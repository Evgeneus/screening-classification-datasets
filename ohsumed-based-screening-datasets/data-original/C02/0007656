Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss and postnatal viral labyrinthitis: a statistical comparison of temporal bone findings.
 Although the cause of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss remains uncertain, a viral origin has been suggested in many cases on the basis of anamnestic microbiologic and pathologic data.
 Twenty-two temporal bone specimens from 18 patients who during life suffered a sudden partial or complete sensorineural hearing loss were studied.
 On the basis of clinical data, these cases were assigned to one of three diagnostic categories, and the temporal bones were studied by light microscopy and serial section analysis.
 The implications of the histopathologic findings for the pathogenesis of idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss are discussed.
