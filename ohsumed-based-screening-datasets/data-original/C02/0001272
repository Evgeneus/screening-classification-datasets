Immunologic and pathologic manifestations of the infection of rhesus monkeys with simian immunodeficiency virus of macaques.
 The striking similarities between simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-induced disease in macaque monkeys and HIV-induced disease in humans make the SIV-induced macaque monkey an extraordinarily important model for the study of AIDS.
 The most significant difference between these lentivirus-induced syndromes is the more rapid progression of disease in SIV-infected monkeys.
 The immunologic and pathologic manifestations of SIV infections in rhesus monkeys are described.
