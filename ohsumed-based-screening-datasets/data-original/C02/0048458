Different types of chronic hepatitis in alcoholic patients: does chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol exist?
 To verify the existence of chronic hepatitis induced by alcohol, the clinicopathological features of chronic hepatitis in heavy drinkers were studied using various viral markers.
 Histological features of chronic active hepatitis were seen in 27 heavy drinkers.
 These patients were divided into four groups.
 The AL group (seven cases) consisted of alcoholics who were negative for both hepatitis C antibody and HBsAg; the HB group (four cases) was positive for HBsAg; the HC1 group (seven cases) was positive for hepatitis C antibody but negative for hepatitis C virus-RNA genome; and the HC2 group (nine cases) was positive both for hepatitis C antibody and hepatitis C virus-RNA genome.
 Serum AST and ALT activity declined during 4 wk of abstinence in most patients in the AL group and in the HC1 group.
 The response of serum AST and ALT to abstinence was poor in most patients in the HB group and the HC2 group.
 Serum desialo-transferrin and alcohol liver membrane antibodies were detected more frequently in the sera of patients in the AL group and HC1 group.
 A trend toward increased frequency of centrilobular ballooning existed in the AL group, but this did not reach statistical significance.
 These results suggest that chronic active hepatitis in patients in the AL group, in whom markers of HBV and hepatitis C virus were absent, may be caused by alcohol.
 Patients in the HC1 group who had hepatitis C antibody but not hepatitis C virus-RNA may represent cases where both alcohol and hepatitis C virus are involved.
