Detection of human papillomavirus DNA on routine Papanicolaou's smears by in situ hybridization with the use of biotinylated probes.
 Specific human papillomavirus (HPV) types have been implicated as playing a major role in the development of cervical neoplasias.
 HPV DNA types usually have been identified by nucleic acid hybridization assays with the use of radiolabeled probes.
 These techniques are sensitive and specific but are not suitable for large-scale clinical use.
 To detect specific HPV DNAs simply and rapidly, in situ hybridization (ISH) with the use of biotinylated HPV DNA 6/11 and 16/18 probes was done on destained Papanicolaou's (Pap) smears from 545 patients.
 All smears showed koilocytotic changes.
 HPV DNAs were demonstrated not only in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and atypia, but also in squamous cells with minimal nuclear changes (karyomegaly) and perinuclear halos.
 HPV DNA 16/18 was detected in 52% of the smears with CIN I, 44% of those with CIN II and III, 19% of those with atypia, and 4% of the minimal changes.
 HPV DNA 6/11 was detected in 27% of the smears with CIN I, 27% of those with atypia, and 6% of the minimal changes.
 HPV DNAs were also detected in smears without koilocytotic changes.
 Thus, ISH with the use of biotinylated probes can serve as an adjunct to Pap smears in detecting HPV infection.
