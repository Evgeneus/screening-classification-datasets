Expression of the Blast-1 activation/adhesion molecule and its identification as CD48.
 We have analyzed the induction and expression of Blast-1 at the mRNA and protein levels and demonstrated its identity with CD48.
 Blast-1/CD48 is expressed on a wider range of cell types, notably T cells and monocytes, than previously thought, but appears to be restricted to lymphoid and myeloid cells.
 Resting B and T cells express Blast-1/CD48 molecules at the cell surface; however, they lack the epitope recognized by the 17D6 mAb.
 Resting B cells express no detectable Blast-1/CD48 mRNA.
 Induction by EBV infection or stimulation with PMA, IL-4, or PHA results in increased levels of Blast-1/CD48 protein (both 6.28 and 17D6 epitopes) at the cell surface.
 Detailed analysis of EBV-induced expression revealed that it is due to increased steady-state levels of Blast-1/CD48 mRNA induced by transforming but not nontransforming strains of the virus.
 Induction by IL-1 beta, ionomycin, or suboptimal levels of PMA plus ionomycin results in increased expression of the 17D6 epitope only.
 In transfected Cos-7 cells Blast-1/CD48 at the cell surface expresses only the 6.28 epitope, whereas cytoplasmic molecules express both 17D6 and 6.28 epitopes.
 We suggest that these results are most consistent with the idea that Blast-1/CD48 molecules are complexed at the surface of resting cells and Cos-7 cells, resulting in masking of the 17D6 epitope.
 Activation causes dissociation of the complex, revealing the 17D6 epitope.
 The existence of 17D6+6.28- Blast-1/CD48 molecules was demonstrated by immunoprecipitation analysis, which also revealed that, unlike the rest of the molecules, this subset was resistant to digestion with glyosylphosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C.
