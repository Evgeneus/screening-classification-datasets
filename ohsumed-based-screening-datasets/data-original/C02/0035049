Production of a nef-specific monoclonal antibody by the use of a synthetic peptide.
 Monoclonal antibodies have been generated against a synthetic peptide of the nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in order to further characterize the biochemical and functional nature of this protein and its role in the control of HIV-1 transcriptional regulation.
 Earlier studies indicated nef to be a negative regulatory factor for viral transcription, whereas more recent studies report evidence against this original hypothesis.
 Nef is a protein of 206 amino acids of approximately 27 kD in most HIV-1 isolates; however, in some other isolates a truncated form of 124 amino acids has been described.
 A peptide sequence of six amino acids, corresponding to a region of the nef protein exhibiting high-sequence homology to thymosin alpha 1 protein, has been synthesized by Merrifield solid-phase methodology.
 This peptide is coded by a sequence located upstream to the stop codon described in some HIV-1 isolates and then is maintained in both complete and truncated forms of the nef protein.
 F14.11 is a nef peptide-specific monoclonal antibody (IgG2a/k) exhibiting the ability to recognize natural nef protein in either radioimmunoassay, radioimmunoprecipitation assay, or immunocytochemical analysis.
 Since F14.11 is able to identify nef protein in the cytoplasm of lymphocytes from HIV-infected seronegative subjects it may prove useful in monitoring the expression of nef during the silent HIV-1 infection.
