Brain perfusion in acute encephalitis: relationship to prognosis studied using SPECT.
 Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and cranial computed tomography were sequentially examined in 2 patients with acute encephalitis.
 Radiographic computed tomography revealed focal low-density areas within a few days of the onset of symptoms in both patients.
 In SPECT, 1 patient exhibited hyperperfusion in the corresponding area, while the other had a normal scan.
 The outcome of the former was poor, while the latter recovered fully.
 Abnormal brain perfusion, thus, coincided with a poor prognosis.
 SPECT may be used to promptly evaluate the focal change of acute encephalitis.
