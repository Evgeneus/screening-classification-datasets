Oral hairy leukoplakia in a HIV-negative renal graft recipient.
 Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) is seen almost exclusively in patients infected with HIV.
 A case is reported of OHL occurring in a patient who was seronegative for HIV and who had a renal graft.
 This occurred following an increase in his treatment with immunosuppressive drugs.
