Aseptic meningitis as a complication of mumps vaccination.
 In 1989 a nationwide surveillance of neurologic complications after the administration of mumps vaccine was conducted in Japan, based on the notification of cases and the testing of mumps viruses isolated from cerebrospinal fluid for their relatedness to the vaccine by nucleotide sequence analysis.
 Among 630,157 recipients of measles-mumps-rubella trivalent (MMR) vaccine containing the Urabe Am9 mumps vaccine, there were at least 311 meningitis cases suspected to be vaccine-related.
 In 96 of these 311 cases, mumps virus related to the vaccine was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid.
 The unusually high incidence may have been partly a result of the adverse media publicity of the problem at the time of surveillance.
 We analyzed clinical features of 165 and 27 laboratory-confirmed mumps vaccine-related meningitis cases that occurred among the recipients of MMR and monovalent mumps vaccines, respectively, during a 1-year period after the introduction of MMR vaccine.
 The incidence of vaccine-related meningitis was similar among the recipients of MMR and monovalent Urabe Am9 mumps vaccines.
 Meningitis was generally mild and there were no sequelae from the illness.
 The complication was more frequent among male than among female children.
