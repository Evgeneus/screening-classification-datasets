Correlation of motor units with strength and spectral characteristics in polio survivors and controls.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether quantitative motor unit analysis in postpolio individuals correlates with muscle strength, endurance, work capacity, or power spectral characteristics of surface EMG and to determine whether power spectrum differentiates postpolio from control subjects.
 This study was designed to compare these variables in 34 symptomatic postpolio, 16 asymptomatic postpolio, and 41 control subjects.
 Quantitative motor unit analysis of the quadriceps femoris muscle was performed using a concentric needle electrode.
 Isometric knee extension peak torque, endurance (time to exhaustion) at 40% of maximal torque, work capacity (tension time index), and recovery of force through 10 minutes post-exhaustion were determined.
 Median frequency of the surface power spectrum was determined during the above testing.
 Power spectrum histograms were compared at the onset and termination of endurance exercise.
 Motor unit action potential variables did not correlate with isometric peak torque, tension time index, endurance time, recovery of strength, or with median frequency.
 Surface power spectrum did not differentiate postpolio from control subjects.
