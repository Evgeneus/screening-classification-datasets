Herpes simplex keratitis: role of viral infection versus immune response.
 The cumulative clinical and experimental data regarding the role of viral infection versus the immune response in the pathogenesis of herpes simplex stromal keratitis and central disciform endotheliitis are discussed.
 Ultrastructural and viral isolation studies have been performed in only a limited number of cases of human stromal keratitis and disciform endotheliitis.
 Virus has been isolated from the minority of corneas cultured, whereas viral particles have been demonstrated in selected cases of stromal keratitis, most of which had been treated with steroids at some point in time.
 The possibility of corneal latency in cases of quiescent herpetic stromal keratitis will require further systematic study.
 Review of the experimental and clinical findings suggests a dialectical role of the immune response in limiting viral infection, while contributing to corneal opacification and scar formation.
