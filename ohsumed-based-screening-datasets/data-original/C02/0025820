Herpes simplex virus hepatitis after solid organ transplantation in adults.
 Twelve patients developed herpes simplex (HSV) hepatitis a median of 18 days after solid organ transplantation.
 This is earlier than cytomegalovirus hepatitis, which usually occurs 30-40 days after transplantation.
 Eight recipients (67%) died, and in seven, the diagnosis was made at autopsy or less than 48 h before death.
 Clinical manifestations associated with mortality were hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), metabolic acidosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and bacteremia.
 Laboratory abnormalities at diagnosis associated with mortality were high creatinine, low platelet counts, prolonged partial thromboplastin time, and a high percentage of band forms on the blood smear.
 Disseminated HSV disease was noted in four of six patients who had an autopsy and included involvement of lungs in three and the gastrointestinal tract in three.
 Five recipients developed DIC and all died.
 Pathologically, HSV hepatitis has two forms, focal and diffuse.
 All three patients with diffuse liver pathology died.
 However, three of seven with focal liver pathology survived with antiviral therapy, which suggests that early diagnosis and treatment may be lifesaving.
 None of these patients had received prophylactic acyclovir.
 It is possible that acyclovir prophylaxis may be able to prevent this disease.
