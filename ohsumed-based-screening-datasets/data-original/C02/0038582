Control of acute lower respiratory illness in the developing world: an assessment of vaccine intervention.
 The major bacterial and viral causes of morbidity and death due to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in the developing world are amenable to control by vaccines.
 Initially, full use of measles, pertussis, and diphtheria vaccines, in appropriately scheduled programs, can make an immediate contribution to the reduction of severe respiratory infection.
 Emerging technologies offer the promise of vaccines against bacterial and viral respiratory pathogens that are suitable for infants and children in developing countries.
 These technologic advances include the use of protein-polysaccharide conjugates of endemic serotypes for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines and new approaches to the use of purified protein components or attenuated live virus with respiratory syncytial virus and paramyxovirus vaccines.
 Such vaccines should soon be available for evaluation in developing countries.
 It is timely to embark upon a program of development, evaluation, and worldwide deployment of vaccines for the control of ALRI.
