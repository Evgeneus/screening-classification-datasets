Influenza type A and B infections in hospitalized pediatric patients. Who should be immunized?
 Medical records of 99 hospitalized pediatric patients whose respiratory viral cultures yielded influenza type A or B during the winter of 1988/1989 were reviewed.
 We compared the records of patients considered to be at high risk (n = 43) with those of patients considered to be at low risk (n = 56) to determine differences in morbidity and mortality and if vaccination was warranted.
 Sixty-six percent of high-risk patients had chronic pulmonary disease.
 Forty-four percent of the high-risk and 11% of the low-risk patients were hospitalized for 14 or more days.
 Nosocomial influenza infections were identified in 14% of the high-risk and 4% of the low-risk patients.
 Four of the high-risk patients and only one of the low-risk patients were intubated.
 Of the three deaths, two occurred in the high-risk group.
 None of the high-risk patients who experienced significant morbidity had been immunized.
 We need to immunize high-risk patients, particularly high-risk pulmonary patients.
