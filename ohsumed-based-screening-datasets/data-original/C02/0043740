Recurrent varicella-zoster virus infections in apparently immunocompetent children.
 Fourteen generally healthy children (5 females, 9 males, ages 18 months to 13 years) who have developed 2 to 5 attacks of chickenpox are described.
 Herpes zoster also occurred in 2 of 14 children.
 No case of chickenpox was severe or associated with complications.
 General studies of immunoglobulins, specific antibodies to immunization agents, complement and lymphocyte subpopulation number and function indicated that 1 of 14 had low serum IgA and 3 of 14 lacked antibody to 1 (n = 2) or 2 (n = 1) immunization agents.
 Varicella-zoster virus (VZV)-specific immune studies showed that the children developed VZV-antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of 1:640 to 1:10 240.
 By immunoblot assay all appeared to develop a normal spectrum of antibodies to individual VZV proteins.
 All but one developed VZV cellular immune responses with stimulation indices ranging from 3.6 to 174.
 Sequential follow-up of 8 patients revealed 1 who became seronegative and 2 who lost VZV cell-mediated immune responses.
 Chickenpox may recur more frequently than is generally recognized.
 General and VZV-specific immune investigations are unlikely to indicate a reason.
