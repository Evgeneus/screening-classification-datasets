High energy underwater shock wave treatment on implanted urinary bladder cancer in rabbits.
 The effects of focused high energy shock waves (SW) on the implanted urinary bladder cancer in rabbits were examined.
 The bladder cancer was exposed to 2000 to 8000 shots of focused SW under ultrasound guidance.
 Although only focal necrosis of the tumor was seen in the one day SW exposure, wider and deeper tumor necrosis was observed in the tumors following serial SW (2000 to 6000 shots, for two to three days).
 Eight to 10 day serial SW exposure (6000 to 8000 shots) decreased the tumor growth in comparison with that of the control.
 Lung metastases examined by periodic chest X-ray after SW treatment revealed that SW did not promote lung metastases.
 Pathological findings were also in accord with the X-ray examinations.
 Polyclonal antibody type 4 collagen was used for immunohistochemical staining of vascular wall in bladder cancer.
 Vascular wall destruction, not found in spontaneous necrotic tumor, were clearly visible in SW induced necrotic area.
 SW induces vascular damage in the tumor, which may be the primary cause promoting the tumor necrosis.
