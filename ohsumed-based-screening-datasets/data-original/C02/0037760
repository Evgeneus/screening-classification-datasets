Immunogenicity of tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine administered with buffer and oral polio vaccine.
 Between January and November 1989, we studied 174 infants aged 6 to 16 weeks in a randomized clinical trial to (1) determine the immunogenicity of a single dose of tetravalent rhesus rotavirus vaccine (RRV-TV) when administered with three different buffer regimens: no antacid buffer and small-volume (2.5-mL) and large-volume (30-mL) antacid buffer; and (2) examine the potential interference of RRV-TV on the immune response to oral polio vaccine.
 Immunogenicity of RRV-TV, measured as a fourfold rise in antibody titers to rotavirus, was similar in the groups receiving small- and large-dose buffer (45% and 49%, respectively) and significantly less in the group that received RRV-TV alone (23%).
 Administration of RRV-TV with oral polio vaccine did not significantly interfere with the neutralization response of oral polio vaccine poliovirus serotypes 1, 2, or 3, and overall, 29%, 87%, and 24% of the infants had a fourfold rise in titer to each serotype, respectively.
