Measles vaccination coverage among Latino children aged 12 to 59 months in Los Angeles County: a household survey.
 A high rate of measles transmission has occurred in Los Angeles County since 1987.
 To determine measles vaccination coverage among Latino preschoolers, the group at highest risk of measles during this period, a cluster survey was conducted among Latino households with children aged 12 to 59 months.
 Of 279 children enrolled, 240 (86%, 95% confidence interval = 81% to 91%) reportedly had received the measles vaccine.
 Measles vaccination coverage among Latino preschoolers in Los Angeles County is insufficient to halt measles transmission within this subpopulation.
