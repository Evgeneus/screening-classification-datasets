A cluster of meningococcal disease on a school bus following epidemic influenza.
 An outbreak of meningococcal disease among children on a school bus offered the opportunity to study a proposed association between this infection and preceding influenza infection.
 Five students who rode the bus became ill with invasive group C meningococcus.
 Transmission was limited to the bus; there was no evidence for school transmission.
 All five students reported influenza-like symptoms within several weeks before the development of meningococcal disease.
 School absenteeism, principally due to upper respiratory tract illness, was higher during the 3 weeks before the outbreak of meningococcal disease than during any period in the preceding 3 1/2 years, suggesting an unusually severe outbreak of respiratory illness.
 A case-control study comparing students with and without influenza symptoms revealed that the outbreak of respiratory disease was due to B/Ann Arbor/1/86 influenza (geometric mean titers, 86 for 80 patients and 33 for 47 controls [P = .0007]).
 These data add to the evidence suggesting that influenza respiratory infection predisposes to meningococcal disease.
