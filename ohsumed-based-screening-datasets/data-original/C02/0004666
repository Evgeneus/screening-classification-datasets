Seroprevalence of human T cell leukemia viruses in selected populations of homosexual men.
 This study sought to define the seroprevalence of human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV) types I and II in selected populations of homosexual men.
 Serum specimens were screened for antibodies to HTLV and to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by enzyme immunoassay; successive testing of specimens with positive results was done by Western blotting and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) and then by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay on available peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC).
 Of 1290 specimens, only 4 had antibodies against HTLV confirmed by RIPA.
 PCR analysis of DNA from PBMC from two subjects showed one to be HTLV-I and the other to be HTLV-II; both men also had HIV antibodies.
 These results demonstrate a lower seroprevalence rate for HTLV than some previous studies and emphasize the need for specific confirmatory tests.
