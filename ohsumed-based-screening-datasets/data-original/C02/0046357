Measles vaccination levels among selected groups of preschool-aged children--United States.
 In 1989 and 1990, the incidence of measles increased dramatically among preschool-aged children in inner cities.
 The largest outbreaks occurred primarily among unvaccinated black and Hispanic children in large cities (e.g., Chicago [2], Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, and New York).
 However, measles outbreaks have not occurred in all large U.S.
 cities; differences in vaccine coverage could account for these variations.
 This report describes surveys of vaccination levels among nonrandomly selected first- and fifth-grade students in Boston, part of New York City (Bronx), Cleveland, Houston, Jersey City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Seattle.
