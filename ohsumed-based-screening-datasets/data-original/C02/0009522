Complications of Tenckhoff catheters post removal.
 Complications due to Tenckhoff catheters can occur at prolonged intervals after their removal.
 From January 1979 to October 1989, 431 patients at our center began continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 278 of whom subsequently transferred to another form of renal replacement therapy.
 We identified 12 patients (4.3% or 12/278) with post removal catheter complications.
 There were 14 post removal complications, two each in two patients, and one in each of 12 others.
 The mean time to complication was 541 +/- 143 days (27-2,040).
 In 71% (10/14) of the complications, an abscess was found at the site of the previously removed Tenckhoff catheter.
 In 29% (4/14) of the complications, foreign body material consistent with a retained cuff was recovered.
 Documentation at the time of Tenckhoff catheter removal should include a statement regarding the presence of the Tenckhoff catheter cuffs, and patients with retained cuffs should be monitored closely for the development of abscesses or other complications.
 Immunocompromised patients are at high risk for these complications.
