Outbreaks of rubella among the Amish--United States, 1991.
 From January 1 through April 19, 1991, at least nine outbreaks of rubella, involving more than 400 cases, have been reported in Amish communities in the United States.
 These outbreaks have been reported from Mecosta and Montcalm counties, Michigan; Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, and St.
 Lawrence counties, New York; Geauga, Knox, and Trumbull counties, Ohio; and Lawrence County, Tennessee.
 In addition, serologically confirmed cases of rubella have been reported from Amish communities in six Pennsylvania counties, suggesting widespread rubella activity among the Amish in Pennsylvania.
 In general, cases have occurred among unvaccinated children and young adults.
