Androscopy for anogenital HPV 
 BACKGROUND.
 Strong evidence now links anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia to the transmission of the human papillomavirus (HPV) through sexual intercourse.
 While there is increasing research on women with this disease, less is known about their male sexual partners.
 METHODS.
 Male patients whose female sexual partners had been diagnosed as having anogenital intraepithelial neoplasia were recruited for the study.
 The genital regions of the male patients were examined and biopsied with the aid of a colposcope after application of a 5% acetic acid solution.
 Treatment was based on the specific findings in each patient.
 RESULTS.
 Genital lesions were found on 65% of the male patients examined, even though no disease had been detected by the individual.
 Seventy-nine percent of patients who were compliant with the prescribed treatment protocol had no detectable HPV-related lesions at the time of their last androscopic examination.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Magnified examination of the male genitalia using an androscope following the application of 5% acetic acid solution is an effective method by which the primary care physician can detect and treat male HPV-related anogenital lesions.
