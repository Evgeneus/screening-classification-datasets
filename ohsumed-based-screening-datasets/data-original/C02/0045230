Experience with a transfusion recipient education program about hepatitis C.
 Shortly after test kits for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) were licensed in May of 1990, our medical community undertook a public education program encouraging previous transfusion recipients to see their physicians about the wisdom of being tested for anti-HCV.
 In response, 1034 samples were received for testing.
 All samples repeatably reactive (RR) with anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) were tested further with a research recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA).
 Overall, 76 of the 1034 (7.4%) recipient samples were RR and 64 of these (84.2%) were reactive with RIBA.
 Recipients transfused prior to surrogate testing (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and anti-hepatitis B core [anti-HBc]) in 1986 showed a 8.6 percent reactivity with RIBA and those transfused after surrogate testing showed a 4.8 percent reactivity, a 44 percent reduction.
 Of the 57 recipient samples reactive with RIBA and suitable for assay, 11 (19.3%) had an elevated ALT.
 Among 76 randomly selected blood donors with RR EIAs studied for comparison with recipients, 20 (26.3%) were reactive with RIBA, 9 of which had an abnormal surrogate test that would have disqualified them.
 ALT concentrations were abnormal in 6 (30%) of the donors who were reactive on RIBA.
 We conclude that an education program that encourages previous transfusion recipients to seek medical advice about anti-HCV testing is practical from the standpoint of the blood center.
 We believe more widespread implementation of similar programs should be considered.
