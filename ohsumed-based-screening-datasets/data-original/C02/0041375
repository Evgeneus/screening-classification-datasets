AIDS awareness among rural Utah physicians.
 Studies of physicians' attitudes and knowledge of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and the clinical precautions they take against exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have focused on urban physicians.
 To determine rural physicians' knowledge and attitudes about AIDS, a questionnaire was mailed to 321 physicians practicing in rural Utah.
 Of the 169 physicians who completed questionnaires, 96% thought that their community or area of service had only a minor or no problem with AIDS; 89%, however, thought that their chance of seeing a patient who was HIV-positive was fair to moderate.
 Of the 169 respondents, 3% were not sure whether they would even treat a patient who had AIDS, 67% said they would, and 30% said they would not.
 Although all physicians are at risk of seeing a patient who has had exposure to HIV and other blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis B, only 55% of the respondents felt a need to take clinical precautions to prevent their exposure to the virus.
 Our study shows the need for all rural Utah physicians to reevaluate their risk of exposure to HIV, to increase precautionary measures for their own protection, to consider the ethical responsibility of treating AIDS patients, and to take a more active role in teaching their patients how to protect themselves from exposure to the virus.
