Interferon for vulvar vestibulitis.
 Eight women with human papillomavirus-associated vestibular adenitis were treated with locally administered alpha interferon, 1 million units, three times weekly for four consecutive weeks.
 Five patients had a complete remission, and one had a slight, transient improvement, with a relapse after the therapy ceased.
