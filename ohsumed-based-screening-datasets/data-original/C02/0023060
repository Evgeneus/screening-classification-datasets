Persistent airway hyperresponsiveness after neonatal viral bronchiolitis in rats.
 Viral bronchiolitis in human infants has been associated with permanent changes in small airways and gas exchange and an increased incidence of hyperresponsive airways later in life.
 Respiratory infection by Sendai virus in neonatal rats also has been reported to cause permanent changes in lung morphology and increased numbers of bronchiolar mast cells and eosinophils.
 We evaluated pulmonary mechanics, gas exchange, and airway responsiveness in rats at 7 and 13-16 wk after neonatal Sendai virus infection.
 Rats from the virus group had lower arterial PO2 and increased total lung resistance compared with controls.
 There were no significant differences between groups for arterial PCO2, dynamic lung compliance, quasi-static respiratory system compliance, or vital capacity.
 Rats from the infected group were significantly more sensitive to aerosolized methacholine than were controls, although both virus and control groups became less sensitive with age.
 We conclude that neonatal Sendai virus infection in rats results in persistent alterations in lung function and airway responsiveness.
 This phenomenon may be valuable for the study of the relationships among airway inflammation, lung morphology, and airway hyperresponsiveness, and it may be relevant to human airway disease.
