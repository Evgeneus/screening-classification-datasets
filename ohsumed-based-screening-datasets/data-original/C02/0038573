Pathogenesis of severe acute respiratory infections in the developing world: respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza viruses.
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) are the most frequently isolated pathogens in infants and children with acute lower respiratory infection (LRI) in the developed world.
 Less information is available about their importance in LRI in the developing world, but they are probably important there also.
 The pathogenesis of viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia involves inoculation and early replication in the upper respiratory tract, followed by aspiration into the lower respiratory tract when both the mucosal and systemic immune systems are involved in a specific response.
 Both disease and recovery reflect processes of viral replication (with attendant cellular destruction) and of immune response (with attendant direct cellular destruction and release of pathogenic, along with beneficial, mediators).
 Factors predisposing to bacterial superinfection are poorly understood except in animal models.
 Conditions leading to heightened susceptibility to severe disease in the developed world are particularly common in the developing world.
 Increasing information on RSV and PIV infections in the developing world will likely point to their importance.
 Strategies for prevention of severe illnesses due to these viruses will follow from concepts elucidated through animal models and studies of infants in the developed world.
