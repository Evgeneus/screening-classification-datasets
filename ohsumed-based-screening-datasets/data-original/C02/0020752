No evidence of frequent human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in seronegative at-risk individuals.
 The possible existence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection in asymptomatic seronegative at-risk individuals was investigated in a prospective study of 55 seronegative high-risk individuals (42 homosexual men and 13 heterosexual individuals) and 32 seronegative hemophiliacs treated with factor VIII or IX concentrates before viral inactivation by heat treatment and systematic screening of blood donations.
 Tests used include the polymerase chain reaction assay with three primer pairs (one in the gag region and two in the pol region) and tests for serum p24 antigen, anti-nef serology (Western blot), and five biologic markers frequently altered by HIV infection (CD4 lymphocyte count, serum beta 2-microglobulin and neopterin concentration, and serum IgG and IgA concentration).
 Although 91 of 92 HIV-1-seropositive persons were positive in testing with at least one primer pair, no positive result was observed in seronegative at-risk individuals or in 117 seronegative low-risk controls.
 No nef antibody was found in seronegative at-risk individuals or seronegative controls, but 44 (47%) of 92 HIV-1-seropositive persons had nef antibodies.
 These findings do not support the existence of frequent HIV-1 infection in seronegative at-risk individuals.
