Ocular disease associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection.
 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a ubiquitous DNA virus of the herpesvirus genus with a high prevalence rate for antibody (about 90%) in the adult population.
 It is the most common causative agent of infectious mononucleosis syndrome.
 During recent years an increasing number of ocular disease entities have been reported to be linked to EBV infection.
 These entities include oculoglandular syndrome, conjunctivitis, dry eye, keratitis, uveitis, choroiditis, retinitis, papillitis and ophthalmoplegia.
 While EBV-specific serologic tests can now document recent and past primary infection with EBV and also identify patients manifesting atypical immunologic reactions to EBV, the lack of an animal model, the absence of clear-cut response to therapy and the paucity of documentation by culture render the pathogenesis uncertain or the association questionable in many of these cases.
