Prevalence of HIV antibody among a group of paraphilic sex offenders.
 Serum specimens from 77 paraphilic sex offenders in treatment at a major community-based sexual disorders clinic were examined for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 In addition to their paraphilic ("sexually deviant") activities, most patients had also had nonparaphilic sexual contacts with consenting adult partners.
 These patients had engaged in a variety of sexual behaviors that involved real or potential exchange of body fluids.
 In spite of that fact, data analysis revealed that none of the 77 paraphilic patients was seropositive for HIV infection as assessed by recombinant enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
