Imported dengue--United States, 1990.
 In 1990, 102 cases of suspected imported dengue were reported to CDC from 24 states and the District of Columbia.
 Of these, 24 (22%) cases (from 14 states and the District of Columbia) were serologically or virologically confirmed as dengue.
 The dengue serotype was identified by virus isolation in two of these cases.
 Fifty-five of the suspected cases were serologically negative for dengue, and the laboratory diagnosis of 23 remained undetermined because convalescent serum samples were not submitted.
 Travel histories were available for 22 of the 24 persons with confirmed dengue.
 Eight cases were acquired in Oceania, six in the Caribbean, six in Asia, and one each in Mexico and Peru.
