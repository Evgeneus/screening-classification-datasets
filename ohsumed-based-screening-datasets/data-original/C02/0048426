FTZ-F1, a steroid hormone receptor-like protein implicated in the activation of fushi tarazu.
 The Drosophila homeobox segmentation gene fushi tarazu (ftz) is expressed in a seven-stripe pattern during early embryogenesis.
 This characteristic pattern is largely specified by the zebra element located immediately upstream of the ftz transcriptional start site.
 The FTZ-F1 protein, one of multiple DNA binding factors that interacts with the zebra element, is implicated in the activation of ftz transcription, especially in stripes 1, 2, 3, and 6.
 An FTZ-F1 complementary DNA has been cloned by recognition site screening of a Drosophila expression library.
 The identity of the FTZ-F1 complementary DNA clone was confirmed by immunological cross-reaction with antibodies to FTZ-F1 and by sequence analysis of peptides from purified FTZ-F1 protein.
 The predicted amino acid sequence of FTZ-F1 revealed that the protein is a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily.
 This finding raises the possibility that a hormonal ligand affects the expression of a homeobox segmentation gene early in embryonic development.
