Detection of HIV-1 DNA in crude cell lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by the polymerase chain reaction and nonradioactive oligonucleotide probes.
 The aim of this study was to detect HIV-1 proviral DNA in lysates of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridization with a nonradioactive probe.
 PBMCs were lysed in 1% Triton X-100.
 PCR was then carried out using primers complementary to a conserved region of the HIV-1 pol gene.
 Bracket and nested amplification protocols were used.
 Products were identified by dot-blot hybridization or agarose gel electrophoresis and Southern hybridization, using an alkaline phosphatase-linked oligonucleotide probe specific for amplified sequences.
 Colorimetric and chemiluminescent substrates were used.
 HIV-1 DNA was detected in PBMCs of 57/59 HIV-1-seropositive individuals, 8 of which were positive only following the use of nested primers.
 Of 12 seropositive samples that were negative by other HIV-1 diagnostic tests (PBMC coculture and serum p24 antigen detection), 11 were positive by PCR.
 PCR using PBMC lysates is a very sensitive method of detecting HIV-1 proviral sequences.
 The use of nested primers appears to increase the sensitivity of the procedure.
