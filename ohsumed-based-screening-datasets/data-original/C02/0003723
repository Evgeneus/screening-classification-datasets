Undiagnosed tuberculosis in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection 
 We describe the clinical features of 11 patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection in whom tuberculosis was undiagnosed and untreated prior to death.
 Most patients (9 of 11) had pulmonary complaints and 8 of 11 had roentgenographic findings suggestive of tuberculosis (hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, pleural effusion, apical infiltrate or miliary pattern).
 Despite these findings, tuberculin skin tests were not performed in any of the patients.
 Acid-fast smears of sputum were obtained in three cases and bronchoscopy performed in only four, reflecting the low index of suspicion for tuberculosis.
 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia was the presumptive diagnosis in nine cases but was confirmed in only one case.
 Autopsy revealed tuberculosis as the cause of death in four patients.
 Of the seven patients who did not undergo autopsy, disseminated tuberculosis, manifest by mycobacteremia, was the only life-threatening illness identified and probably contributed to death.
 Increased awareness of the clinical and roentgenographic features of tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients, combined with more intensive use of acid-fast smears and tuberculin skin testing, are necessary in order to decrease mortality from this treatable complication of HIV-infection.
