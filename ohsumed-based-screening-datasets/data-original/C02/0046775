Confirmation of hepatitis C virus infection by new four-antigen recombinant immunoblot assay.
 A new four-antigen recombinant immunoblot assay (4-RIBA) for confirmation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) C-100 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reactivity was tested in stored serum samples (1984-86) of blood donors and recipients and compared with results from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of fresh (1990) plasma samples in donors and recipients from the original study.
 Of 37 HCV C-100 ELISA-positive blood products, 8 were 4-RIBA positive, of which 7 were implicated in post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis (PT-NANBH) and/or PCR confirmed recipient HCV infection.
 Of 9 recipients with PT-NANBH, 8 were reactive in 4-RIBA (6 positive and 2 indeterminate).
 With fresh plasma samples, 3 donors and 6 recipients who were 4-RIBA positive were also PCR positive.
 4 4-RIBA indeterminate and 78 4-RIBA negative samples of donors and recipients were PCR negative.
 Of 6 4-RIBA positive recipients, 5 were PCR positive four to six years later.
 1.6% of the 383 recipients became chronically infected with HCV.
 The new 4-RIBA represents a candidate confirmation test to discriminate between infective and non-infective HCV C-100 ELISA-positive blood donors.
