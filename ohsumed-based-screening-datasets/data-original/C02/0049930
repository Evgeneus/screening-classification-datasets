Epidemiology of hepatitis C virus infection in a suburban Detroit community.
 A serum analysis for antibodies to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) was performed on a group of patients in a large suburban Detroit community hospital.
 The first 50 anti-HCV-positive patients with clinically suspected chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis were studied.
 Blood transfusions (58%) and intravenous drug use (22%) were the source of infection in most of these patients.
 A significant difference in age-related epidemiology was observed (p = 0.001).
 A remote history of intravenous drug use or tattoo application was elicited in 55% of individuals less than 40 yr old.
 "Sporadic" transmission occurred in 28% of individuals older than 50 yr.
 Sixteen percent (8/50) had no identifiable risk factors.
 Five of these eight patients (63%) were born and raised outside North America.
 Eighty percent of the 35 persons who underwent liver biopsy were found to have either chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis.
 Twenty-nine percent (5/17) of the patients with anti-HCV-related cirrhosis presented with hepatocellular carcinoma.
 None of the patients with noncirrhotic liver disease had a primary liver tumor.
 We conclude that a significant number of patients in suburban America with chronic hepatitis C have no identifiable risk factors for HCV.
 Sporadic transmission of hepatitis C may play an important role in patients with chronic HCV-related liver disease, especially among patients born and raised outside North America.
