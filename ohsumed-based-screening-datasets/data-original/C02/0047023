Long-term therapy of HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma with recombinant interferon alpha-2a.
 Five young male patients with HIV-associated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) were treated with recombinant interferon alpha 2a (rIFN-alpha-2a) over a period of 2-2.5 years.
 An IFN dose of 18 x 10(6) IU was given subcutaneously every day during the first 3 months of treatment and then on alternate days.
 Additional treatment with radiotherapy and laser therapy was given and, in some cases, isolated skin nodules were excised.
 Within 7 months of initiation of therapy one patient had a complete remission of his tumours, however, tumour progression recurred after the patient discontinued treatment.
 In another patient the tumour cleared within 9 months of rIFN therapy, and after 52 months he is still free of KS.
 The condition of a third patient tended to become stabilized during the first 6 months of therapy, but after 60 months there has been a slow progression.
 The fourth and fifth patients died 25 and 28 months, respectively, after the histological diagnosis of KS and the initiation of treatment.
 While on therapy with rIFN-alpha-2a, no life-threatening opportunistic infections occurred.
 The side-effects were mostly well tolerated, and no severe changes in haematological parameters were caused by the therapy.
