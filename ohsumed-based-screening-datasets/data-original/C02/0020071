Safety and pharmacokinetics of rimantadine small-particle aerosol.
 The safety and pharmacokinetics of rimantadine administered by small-particle aerosol were assessed in healthy adults and adults with acute influenza virus infection.
 Aerosolized rimantadine delivered at a concentration of 40 micrograms/liter of air was associated with nasal burning and irritation in normal volunteers.
 A concentration of 20 micrograms/liter of air was well tolerated for up to 12 h by normal volunteers and was not associated with any changes in pulmonary function, as measured by routine spirometry, plethysmography, or diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide.
 Mean peak levels of drug in serum were approximately 10-fold lower after 12 h of aerosol administration than they were after oral administration of 200 mg (29.7 versus 255 ng/ml, respectively), while mean nasal wash levels were approximately 100-fold higher (6,650 versus 66.6 ng/ml, respectively).
 Elimination half-lives were similar after both aerosol and oral administration (24.1 and 25.2 h, respectively), and rimantadine urinary excretion was less than 1% per 24 h in both groups.
 Twenty micrograms of aerosolized rimantadine per liter of air given 12 h daily for 3 days to nine adults with acute influenza virus infection was well tolerated.
 Levels in plasma after 12 h of aerosol inhalation were similar to those in normal volunteers, but were higher at the end of the third treatment than they were at the end of the first treatment (88.3 versus 47.9 ng/ml, respectively).
 Thus, rimantadine delivered via small-particle aerosol at a dose of 20 micrograms/liter of air was well tolerated in normal volunteers and in those with acute influenza and was associated with high local concentrations.
