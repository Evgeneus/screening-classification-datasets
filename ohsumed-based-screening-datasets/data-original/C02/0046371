Molecular cloning of the human hepatitis C virus genome from Japanese patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis.
 The nucleotide sequence of the Japanese type of hepatitis C virus (HCV-J) genome, consisting of 9413 nucleotides, was determined by analyses of cDNA clones from plasma specimens from Japanese patients with chronic hepatitis.
 HCV-J genome contains a long open reading frame that can encode a sequence of 3010 amino acid residues.
 Comparison of HCV-J with the American isolate of HCV showed 22.6% difference in nucleotide sequence and 15.1% difference in amino acid sequence.
 Thus HCV-J and the American isolate of HCV are probably different subtypes of HCV.
 The relationship of HCV-J with other animal RNA virus families and the putative organization of the HCV-J genome are discussed.
