Milrinone, a bridge to heart transplantation.
 We describe the use of a milrinone infusion as a bridge to heart transplantation in the treatment of severe congestive cardiac failure secondary to viral cardiomyopathy.
 The clinical improvement that occurred when milrinone was commenced made it possible to wean the patient from conventional cardiovascular support with an intra-aortic balloon pump and dobutamine.
 There was an improvement in organ perfusion.
