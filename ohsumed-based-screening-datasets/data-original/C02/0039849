Preventing fetal damage from sexually transmitted diseases.
 The STDs threaten the reproductive health of women in many ways, ranging from premature births through congenital infections and death.
 An understanding of the natural history of these diseases permits timely interventions which can mitigate the perinatal damage caused by these infections substantially.
 Ideally, primary prevention or safer sex will be adopted by sexually active women, thereby reducing the morbidity not only for their offspring but for themselves as well.
 Antiviral therapy is not yet available for minimizing any hazard of fetal exposure to HPV, HSV, HIV, and hepatitis B viral infections.
 Early antibiotic therapy should reduce the risk of congenital syphilis and any perinatal hazards associated with chlamydial and gonococcal infections.
