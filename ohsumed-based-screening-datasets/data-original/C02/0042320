Efficacy of SIV/deltaB670 glycoprotein-enriched and glycoprotein-depleted subunit vaccines in protecting against infection and disease in rhesus monkeys.
 Immunization with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine is highly effective in preventing lentivirus infection.
 The viral protein(s) essential to the induction of protective responses, however, have not been identified.
 To define the role of virion components in the induction of protective immunity, we evaluated the efficacy of glycoprotein-enriched and glycoprotein-depleted simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) subunit vaccines prepared by lentil-lectin affinity chromatography of gradient-purified virions using the immunization and challenge regimen previously found successful with an inactivated whole-virus vaccine.
 Infection was determined by successful recovery of virus, the induction of SIV-specific antibody responses, and infection of naive recipients by inoculation with lymph-node-derived lymphocytes from the vaccinates.
 Immunization with the glycoprotein-enriched preparation prevented infection in two out of four monkeys, whereas the glycoprotein-depleted vaccine failed to prevent infection in all four vaccinates tested.
 However, the glycoprotein-depleted vaccine appeared to moderate the progression of SIV-induced disease compared with non-immunized infected control monkeys inoculated with the same challenge dose.
 These data suggest that subunit vaccines containing sufficient quantities of viral glycoproteins can protect against SIV infection, whereas subunit vaccines composed predominantly of viral core proteins cannot.
 The development of effective vaccines against HIV infection should include studies on the optimum presentation of the viral envelope glycoproteins to produce long-term broadly protective immune responses.
