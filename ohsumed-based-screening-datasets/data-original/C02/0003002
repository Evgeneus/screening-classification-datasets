Sensitivity and specificity of various morphological features of cervical condylomas. An in situ hybridization study.
 Fifty-seven cervical biopsy specimens or endocervical curettings showing condyloma, changes suggestive of condyloma, or no changes of condyloma were analyzed for presence of nuclear atypia (nuclear enlargement and irregularity in superficial epithelium), presence of multinucleated cells, and presence of perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing in superficial squamous epithelium.
 The findings were correlated with results of in situ hybridization with biotin-labeled human papillomavirus DNA probes.
 Moderate nuclear atypia was significantly more specific than perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing and 100% sensitive for predicting cases positive for human papillomavirus.
 Of the various morphological features analyzed, perinuclear cytoplasmic clearing had the lowest specificity for predicting positive results on in situ hybridization.
