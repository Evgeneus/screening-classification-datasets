Generation and specificity of monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies against human HIV-specific antibodies. I. Cross-reacting idiotopes are expressed in subpopulations of HIV-infected individuals.
 In this study we have generated monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies against human monoclonal and polyclonal anti-HIV antibodies in seropositive sera.
 A human anti-gp41 mAb (H2, IgM kappa) was used to immunize BALB/c mice and to prepare hybridoma anti-antibodies that react with H2 and not with normal human IgM.
 Similar monoclonal anti-antibodies were made in BALB/c mice immunized with Ig fraction prepared from a pool of HIV-seropositive sera.
 Both kinds of anti-idiotypic antibodies reacted with antibodies in pools of seropositive sera and with individual seropositive sera but not with normal human Ig or seronegative sera.
 The Id-positive Ig from single donors were isolated on two different anti-Id immunoabsorbents and shown to bind to p24 and gp120, respectively.
 The detection and isolation of idiotypically cross-reactive human anti-HIV antibodies from seropositive donors demonstrated, for the first time, the existence of shared Id expressed by antibodies against HIV Ag.
 The utility of cross-reacting anti-idiotypic antibodies as tools to dissect the network regulation of the anti-viral immunity in AIDS is discussed.
