Surgical treatment of the flail knee after poliomyelitis.
 We report our experience of surgical treatment for instability of flail knees after poliomyelitis in 228 patients.
 We made carefully selective use of soft-tissue release, extension osteotomy of the femur, and a patellar bone block for hyperextension.
 After six to nine years follow-up, 87% of the patients had retained significant improvement in stability and walking ability.
