Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection in an HIV positive patient.
 A 25 year old British man of previous good health presented with persistent generalised lymphadenopathy and was found to be human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive.
 Three years later after weight loss and loose stools Strongyloides stercoralis was identified in the latter and successfully treated with thiabendazole.
 Shortly afterwards, a further episode again responded rapidly, but was swiftly followed by a final and fatal illness with severe debility and metabolic imbalance unresponsive to all treatment.
 Necropsy showed widespread and heavy strongyloidiasis with pulmonary haemorrhage, bronchopneumonia, and meningitis.
