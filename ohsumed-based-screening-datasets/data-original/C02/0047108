Coincidental hemochromatosis and viral hepatitis.
 A 35-year-old woman presented with liver failure, hepatic iron overload, and secondary amenorrhea due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
 She had chronic inflammatory hepatitis which was considered to be due to post-transfusional viral hepatitis.
 Her hepatic iron overload was considered to be due to hemochromatosis.
 Her premature menopause was thought to be due to the severity of her liver disease, but her iron overload also could have contributed to gonadotrophin deficiency.
 She underwent liver transplantation and 5 months later, she experienced return of menstrual function.
 The distinction between hepatitis as a cause of iron loading, hemochromatosis as a cause of hepatic inflammation, the small influence of alcohol on increased iron stores, and other features of her history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation are discussed.
