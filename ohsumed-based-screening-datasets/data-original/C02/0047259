The role of chronic viral hepatitis in hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States.
 Although hepatocellular carcinoma is a relatively uncommon tumor in the United States, it is quite common in sub-Saharan Africa and the Far East, where most cases are associated with infection with the hepatitis B virus.
 We have studied 99 American patients with hepatocellular carcinoma for evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C viral infection and compared these findings to those in a group of matched controls with other cancers.
 The two groups differed in proportion, with hepatitis B surface antigen in serum being significantly higher in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (7% vs.
 0%, p = 0.009).
 Antibody to hepatitis C virus was also found more frequently in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (13% vs.
 2%, p = 0.002).
 The relative risk for hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B surface antigen-positive patients was calculated to be 17.3 and for antibody to hepatitis C virus to be 7.3.
 The attributable fraction of cases related to the hepatitis B surface antigen carrier state was 6.7% and for patients infected with the hepatitis C virus was 11.4%.
 Approximately three quarters of cases of hepatocellular carcinoma did not have evidence of either hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus infection.
 These findings provide strong evidence that hepatitis C virus infection is associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma, and in the United States may even play a more important role than the hepatitis B virus.
