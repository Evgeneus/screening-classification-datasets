Identification of human papillomavirus DNA sequences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify and identify the presence of the DNA of human papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of women with and without urogenital HPV infections.
 HPV DNA of various types was found in PBMCs of 13 of 25 (52.0%) patients with urogenital HPV infections and in none of the 19 control subjects who are free of urogenital HPV infections.
 The presence of HPV DNA in PBMCs may impair the immunologic functions of the lymphocytes and play a role in the epidemiology of HPV infections and the pathogenesis of HPV-induced diseases.
