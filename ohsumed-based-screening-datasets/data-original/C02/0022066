Vaccine protection of rhesus macaques against simian immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) immunized with an inactivated whole SIVmac vaccine and muramyl dipeptide (MDP), incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), or aqueous suspension were challenged intravenously with 0.1 TCID50 of cell-free SIVmac.
 Whereas virus was readily recovered from the peripheral blood lymphocytes of 10 of 10 nonvaccinated controls following this challenge dose, virus was not recovered from the three animals that received the vaccine with MDP nor from one of two animals that received the vaccine with IFA and one of three animals that received the aqueous vaccine.
 The animals that were protected against challenge were those that had detectable SIV antibody response to the envelop, both the outer glycoprotein (gp120) and the truncated transmembrane glycoprotein (gp31).
 Protected monkeys tended to have higher titers of syncytial inhibition antibody prior to challenge.
 An anamnestic response after challenge was observed only in the vaccinated monkeys that became infected.
 Vaccinated animals that became challenge-infected tended to live longer than infected controls.
 These results confirm those at two other primate centers and indicate that killed whole SIV vaccines can protect against low challenge doses of SIV and prevent early death in those monkeys that do become infected.
 The mechanism of this protection remains undetermined.
 This finding adds optimism to the possibility of an eventual AIDS vaccine.
