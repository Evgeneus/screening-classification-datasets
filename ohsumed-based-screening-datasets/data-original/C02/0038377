Parotid manifestations of HIV infection.
 A lump in the parotid region is generally a salivary tumor unless proved otherwise.
 Recently with an epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and AIDS-related complex (ARC), a large number of pathologies are noticed in the parotid region.
 These conditions generally involve the intraparotid and periparotid lymph nodes.
 Hyperplastic lymphadenopathy and the benign lymphoepithelial lesions are the most common variants.
 Our knowledge regarding these new conditions is just evolving.
 There remains a therapeutic dilemma starting from observation only to local excision and superficial or total parotidectomy.
 These lesions must be kept in mind when we evaluate a patient with risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
