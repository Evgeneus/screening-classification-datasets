Serum antibodies against respiratory tract viruses in episodes of acute otitis media.
 Although the findings of epidemiological studies have suggested viral respiratory tract infection (RTI) to be crucially involved in the development of acute otitis media (AOM), the relationship between AOM and viral RTI remains unclear.
 Serum samples, obtained in the acute and convalescent phases of 57 AOM episodes (in 35 children during the first three years of life) were analysed for IgG antibodies against influenza A viruses, influenza B viruses, parainfluenza virus type 1, respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses.
 One third of the AOM episodes (18/57) could be related to viral RTI, as evidenced by significant increases in viral serum antibody activity.
 Treatment failure occurred in four AOM episodes where increases in serum viral antibody activity were noted.
 In three of these failures, antibiotic treatment was unsuccessful despite the bacterial strains not being resistant to the drug used.
 This suggests that concomitant viral infection may be a determinant of treatment outcome in some AOM episodes.
