Rabies.
 Human rabies is extremely rare and canine rabies is largely controlled in the United States.
 Wild animals are now responsible for most of the rabies prevention costs and postexposure treatments in the United States, either by direct exposure of humans or by exposure of domestic animals.
 Although the situation is similar in most other developed countries, canine rabies remains widespread and a substantial risk to persons traveling in developing countries, where millions of people are exposed and tens of thousands die of rabies each year.
 People living in the United States should be advised to avoid contact with wild animals and stray or ill-appearing domestic animals.
 Travelers to rabies enzootic countries can substantially reduce the risk of rabies exposures by avoiding all dogs as well as wild animals; those persons whose risk of exposure cannot be reduced should be educated about rabies and should receive preexposure vaccination.
