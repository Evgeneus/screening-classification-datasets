Current issues in neonatal herpes simplex virus infection.
 Significant progress has been made in the recognition and treatment of herpes simplex disease in the newborn.
 This review discusses four current issues surrounding this severe and important infection.
 First, the reasons underlying the failure of antenatal screening programs to identify high-risk pregnancies for herpes simplex are analyzed.
 Second, typical and atypical clinical manifestations of neonatal herpetic infection are reviewed.
 Third, determinants of disease, particularly the immune status of the mother and child, and their therapeutic implications are discussed.
 Finally, controversies surrounding antiviral therapy are examined.
