Detection of cytotoxic T lymphocytes specific for synthetic peptides of gp160 in HIV-seropositive individuals.
 Four synthetic peptides corresponding to the IIIB sequence of gp160 of HIV were recently reported to stimulate Th cell function by PBL from HIV-infected, asymptomatic patients.
 In the present report, we used these same peptides to demonstrate CTL activity in a similar patient population.
 EBV-transformed B-cell lines from asymptomatic, HIV seropositive and seronegative control donors were pre-incubated with the peptides.
 Fresh PBL from 19 (76%) of 25 HIV seropositive donors lysed autologous targets pulsed with at least one of the four peptides.
 Autologous targets pulsed with two non-immunogenic peptides were not lysed.
 PBL from none of the eight HIV seronegative controls lysed peptide-preincubated autologous targets.
 The CTL activity was mediated by T cells, was predominantly MHC class I restricted, and was increased by in vitro restimulation of PBL with the peptides.
 HLA A-2 was identified as a restricting element for all four peptides in different patients, and for three of the peptides in the same donor.
 HLA-A1 or -B8 may also present some of the peptides.
 Thus, the same peptides can be recognized by human Th cells and class I MHC-restricted CTL.
