The diagnosis of drug dependence by primary care providers.
 HIV infection cannot be treated nor can its spread among those who use drugs be contained unless physicians diagnose and treat drug dependence.
 Recent changes in the DSM-III definitions simplify diagnosis.
 It is primarily by the presence and extent of the dependence syndrome that decisions are made regarding early HIV counseling and testing, medical management, referral for drug dependence treatment, and the approach to minimizing disease spread by the patient.
