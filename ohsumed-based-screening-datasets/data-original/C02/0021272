Flexion osteotomy of the femur for genu recurvatum after poliomyelitis.
 We report the results of 21 femoral osteotomies performed in 18 patients for genu recurvatum and flattening of the femoral condyles after poliomyelitis.
 Before operation the average angle of recurvatum was 31 degrees and all the limbs required bracing.
 After a mean follow-up of four years there has been partial recurrence in only one case.
 Nine patients (10 limbs) needed no orthosis and the others had less discomfort and an improved gait.
 Complete remodelling of the femoral and tibial epiphyses was noted in two of the younger patients.
