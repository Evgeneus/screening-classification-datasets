Herpes simplex keratitis in renal transplant patients.
 Five out of 430 patients (1.16%) undergoing kidney transplantation developed an atypical clinical picture of herpetic dendritic keratitis within four weeks after surgery.
 It was manifested by multiple dendrites, located mainly in the corneal periphery or the limbus, developing in relatively uninflamed eyes.
 The response to acyclovir therapy was prolonged and took at least three weeks.
 Additionally, subepithelial infiltrates with ultimate scarring developed in all patients.
 Disciform keratopathy was not found.
 This clinical course is ascribed to the patients' immunosuppressed state.
