Lack of effect of peroral acyclovir for the treatment of acute infectious mononucleosis.
 Perorally administered acyclovir was evaluated in the therapy of acute infectious mononucleosis in a multicentered, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
 A total of 120 patients received 600 mg of acyclovir or placebo five times daily for 10 days.
 All patients were entered into the study within 7 days of symptom onset and had a positive Monospot test.
 Analysis of mean values and time to resolution of fever, lymphadenopathy, weight change, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, liver function tests, atypical lymphocytes, hours of bed rest, sense of well-being, and return to normal activities revealed no significant differences.
 There was a trend toward suppression of Epstein-Barr virus excretion in the oropharynx in acyclovir recipients.
 No toxicity was detected in patients treated with acyclovir.
 Under the conditions of the study, there was no evidence that treatment with perorally administered acyclovir affected the course of infectious mononucleosis.
