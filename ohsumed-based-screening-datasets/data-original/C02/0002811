Spontaneous splenic rupture following infectious mononucleosis.
 Four cases of spontaneous splenic rupture after infectious mononucleosis (IM) have been treated at this institution since 1978.
 The condition is rare, occurring in 0.1-0.5 per cent of patients with proven infectious mononucleosis.
 Splenectomy is considered the treatment of choice for these patients.
 However, because recent trends in the management of traumatic splenic rupture are moving towards nonoperative treatment with selected patients, a similar approach has been considered for the patient with spontaneous splenic rupture following IM.
 The major reason for avoiding splenectomy is the increased incidence of sepsis in splenectomized patients.
 Yet, splenic rupture is accompanied by hemorrhage and the risks associated with blood transfusion for ongoing hemorrhage are of similar magnitude as those of sepsis following splenectomy.
 In addition, the grossly abnormal spleens seen at operation tend to include large, contained hematomas that may also be prone to rupture.
 Therefore, operative management still appears to be the preferred treatment for spontaneous splenic rupture following IM.
 Splenectomy is curative, safe, and obviates the need for transfusion, extended hospitalization, and activity restriction.
