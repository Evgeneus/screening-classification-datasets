Fatal varicella-zoster virus meningoradiculitis without skin involvement.
 A 77-year-old man with T-cell lymphoma developed an acute fatal meningoradiculitis of cranial nerve roots and cauda equina, pathologically and virologically confirmed to be caused by varicella-zoster virus.
 This is the first report of fatal varicella-zoster virus-induced neurological disease in the absence of skin lesions.
 Varicella-zoster virus should be included in the differential diagnosis of acute radiculoneuropathy in the immunocompromised patient, particularly because antiviral treatment for varicella-zoster virus exists.
