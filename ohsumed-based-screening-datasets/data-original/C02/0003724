Pulmonary manifestations of disseminated cryptococcosis in patients with AIDS.
 Forty-eight patients with disseminated cryptococcosis and AIDS were retrospectively studied to define the pulmonary manifestations.
 Cryptococcus neoformans (CN) was first isolated from a pulmonary site in 12 patients.
 Disseminated disease was subsequently documented in all these patients.
 Symptoms and roentgenographic manifestations (normal, nodular/circumscribed infiltrates, pleural effusions, lobar consolidation) were diverse.
 Interstitial infiltrates predicted the presence of another opportunistic lung infection besides cryptococcosis in five patients (three untreated and two treated patients).
 Infectious causes other than cryptococcosis were established by culture and clinical course in five of the ten patients who developed chest roentgenographic abnormalities during amphotericin B therapy.
 Endobronchial abnormalities were identified in four patients at bronchoscopy.
 Bronchoalveolar lavage (9/9) and pleural fluid (3/3) cultures were sensitive tests for detection of pulmonary involvement with CN.
