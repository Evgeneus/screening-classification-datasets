Pharmacokinetics of didanosine in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related complex.
 The pharmacokinetics of didanosine (2',3'-dideoxyinosine) after intravenous and oral administration were evaluated in an open, escalating-dose phase I study in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or severe AIDS-related complex.
 Didanosine was administered twice a day for 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion of 60 minutes duration at doses ranging from 0.4 to 16.5 mg/kg, followed by 4 weeks of oral treatment at twice the intravenous dose.
 Serial blood and urine samples were obtained on the first and final day of intravenous administration and after the first oral dose, as well as at steady state.
 Didanosine demonstrated linear pharmacokinetic behavior over the dose ranges of 0.4 to 16.5 mg/kg intravenously and 0.8 to 10.2 mg/kg orally.
 There was no indication of significant changes in pharmacokinetic parameters with repeated administration.
 The apparent elimination half-life after oral administration was approximately 1.4 hour.
 Renal clearance values exceeded the glomerular filtration rate, indicating that active tubular secretion of didanosine occurs.
 Bioavailability of didanosine when administered as a solution with an antacid was approximately 43% for doses from 0.8 to 10.2 mg/kg in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS-related complex.
 Bioavailability of didanosine from the citrate-phosphate-buffered solution, the formulation currently used in phase II and expanded access studies, was comparable to the formulation used in the phase I trials.
