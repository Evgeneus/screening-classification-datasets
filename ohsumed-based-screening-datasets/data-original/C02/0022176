Pruritic papular eruption of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: a clinicopathologic study.
 The pruritic papular eruption of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is characterized by generalized, pruritic, skin-colored papules and nodules.
 Chronic lesions are excoriated and hyperpigmented.
 The eruption and pruritus typically wax and wane and are resistant to oral antihistamine and topical steroid therapy.
 The characteristic histologic features are (1) superficial and mid dermal perivascular and perifollicular mononuclear cell infiltrate with numerous eosinophils and (2) follicular damage of varying degrees.
 When compared with control subjects, these patients did not demonstrate any significant difference in laboratory or demographic data.
