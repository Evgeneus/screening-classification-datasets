CD36(OKM5)+ dendritic cells in the oral mucosa of HIV- and HIV+ subjects.
 In this study, we have investigated by light and electron microscopy the presence, distribution, and inner structure of CD36(OKM5)+ dendritic cells (DC) in the lamina propria and epithelium of the oral mucosa of HIV- and HIV+ subjects; in the latter, both clinically healthy areas and areas of hairy leukoplakia (HL) were studied.
 Perivascular CD36+ DC were present in the lamina propria of all the specimens studied.
 They were also found in small numbers in the epithelium of clinically healthy mucosa of HIV- and HIV+ subjects, but were practically absent from the epithelium of HL.
 CD36+ DC seemed to be regularly HLA-DR+ in HIV-subjects; this positivity was recognized only in some cells in the clinically healthy mucosa of HIV+ subjects, and practically never in HL.
 Because the only perivascular cells observed in the clinically healthy areas of HIV+ subjects were CD36+, we investigated the ultrastructure of perivascular DC in these same areas.
 These cells were characterized by the presence of a prominent Golgi apparatus, many lysosomes, and focal adhesions to the extracellular matrix.
 It may be concluded that 1) CD36+ DC are physiologic components of the oral mucosa, 2) they share some ultrastructural features with macrophages, 3) no differences in numbers were found between HIV+ and HIV- subjects, and 4) these cells are affected in their expression of HLA-DR antigens during HIV infection, particularly in areas of HL.
 This may be a hint that the antigen-presenting function of these cells in the oral mucosa is negatively affected during HIV infection.
