Human-rodent contact and infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis and Seoul viruses in an inner-city population.
 We collected 1180 sera and 1363 questionnaires with information on demography, rodent exposure, and history of travel from persons visiting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Baltimore between 1986-1988.
 Serological tests for two rodent-borne viruses detected antibodies to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in 54 individuals (4.7%; n = 1149) and antibodies to Seoul virus (SEOV) in three persons (0.25%; n = 1180).
 Antibody prevalence to LCMV increased with age, but there were no racial or sexual differences.
 Neutralization tests and questionnaire responses implicated a domestic, rat-borne hantavirus as the source of SEOV antibody.
 Self-reported human-rodent contact indicated more exposure to house mice than rats within residences, although rats were more commonly sighted on streets.
 Infections with rodent-borne viruses were rare compared to the high rates of reported contact.
