Influenza surveillance--Wales, 1988-89.
 Important functions of influenza surveillance include early detection of epidemics-enabling immunization of persons not previously covered by routine immunization programs, notification of health providers to prepare for the possible impact on clinical workloads and hospital admissions, and characterization of prevalent strains to permit the timely production of appropriate vaccines.
 In 1986, a general-practice-based surveillance system was established in Wales to facilitate reporting of infectious diseases, including influenza and influenza-like illnesses.
 This report summarizes influenza surveillance findings in Wales for 1988 and 1989.
