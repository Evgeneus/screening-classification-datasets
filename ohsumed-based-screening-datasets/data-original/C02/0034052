2',5'-oligoadenylate synthetase, neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals.
 This study examined 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2,5A) synthetase activity in 26 individuals during the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection and its correlation with neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin.
 In HIV-antibody-positive (HIV-Ab+) asymptomatic people, both neopterin and beta 2-microglobulin levels in sera were significantly elevated; in contrast, 2,5A-synthetase activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was not significantly higher than in HIV-antibody-negative controls.
 The 2,5A-synthetase levels in symptomatic people (AIDS-related complex and AIDS) were significantly higher than in either asymptomatic or control individuals.
 However, within the group of HIV-infected asymptomatic individuals, all three markers were positively correlated.
 In this group, neopterin values were negatively correlated with the number of CD4+ lymphocytes while a positive correlation was found between 2,5A-synthetase and the number of CD8+ lymphocytes.
 Asymptomatic people with detectable serum HIV p24 antigen had significantly higher 2,5A-synthetase, neopterin, beta 2-microglobulin and number of CD8+ lymphocytes.
 This study suggests that elevated 2,5A-synthetase activity may reflect a different aspect of host response to HIV infection than do elevated neopterin or beta 2-microglobulin.
