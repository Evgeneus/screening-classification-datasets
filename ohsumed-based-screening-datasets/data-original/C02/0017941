Measles-associated diarrhea in hospitalized children in Lima, Peru: pathogenic agents and impact on growth.
 Because the causes of measles-associated diarrhea are not well known, 0- to 5-year-old children presenting to the hospital with measles-associated diarrhea (cases, n = 77) or acute diarrhea only (controls, n = 77) were compared.
 Growth and diarrheal morbidity were evaluated for 1 month after acute illness.
 Campylobacter jejuni was more frequently isolated from cases (31%) than controls (16%; P = .03).
 Rotavirus was absent in all cases versus 28% of controls (P less than .001).
 Incidence density for new episodes of diarrhea was significantly greater in cases (6.5 vs.
 4.1; odds ratio, 1.6; confidence intervals, 1.09-2.34; P = .01), as was duration of episodes (3 vs.
 2 days, P = .02).
 Both groups showed similar positive cumulative percentage weight gains throughout follow-up.
 These data support the theory of measles as a risk factor for developing diarrhea.
 The bacteriologic and virologic findings may reflect the immunologic response of the host to measles infection.
