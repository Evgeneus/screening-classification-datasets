Liposomal encapsulation of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) results in decreased bone marrow toxicity and enhanced activity against murine AIDS-induced immunosuppression.
 The effect of liposome encapsulation on the bone marrow toxicity and antiviral activity of AZT in C57BL/6 mice was determined.
 Liposomal encapsulation of AZT enhanced localization in the liver, spleen, and lung, and reduced localization in bone marrow.
 AZT administered i.v.
 (0.08-50 mg/kg/day) had significant bone marrow toxicity (30-50% reduction in cellularity) after five injections, maximum toxicity occurring at greater than or equal to 2 mg/kg/day.
 Parallel reductions in the number of erythrocytes and leukocytes were observed.
 AZT encapsulated in liposomes had no bone marrow toxicity at doses of 0.08-10 mg/kg/day, and erythrocyte and leukocyte numbers remained normal.
 Infection of C57BL/6 mice with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus suppressed T- and B-cell mitogenic responses.
 Treatment of LP-BM5 retrovirus-infected mice with 2 mg/kg AZT three times weekly partially protected the mitogenic response at 4 but not at 7 weeks postinfection.
 Treatment with liposomal AZT resulted in normal T- and B-cell mitogenic responses at both 4 and 7 weeks postinfection.
