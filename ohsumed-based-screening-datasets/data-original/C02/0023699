Increased HTLV-I proviral DNA in HTLV-I-associated myelopathy: a quantitative polymerase chain reaction study.
 Using the polymerase chain reaction, we quantitated the amount of human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 18 patients with HTLV-I--associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis; 17 HTLV-I carriers without HTLV-I--associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis, with or without other autoimmune or inflammatory diseases; and 19 seronegative control subjects.
 The HTLV-I proviral DNA was 10- to 100-fold higher in the patients and in the HTLV-I carriers without HAM/TSP who had autoimmune or inflammatory diseases than in the carriers without autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.
 The patients who had had onset of myelopathy at a younger age (15 to 39 years) had an extremely high level of HTLV-I proviral DNA in the early phase, as compared with findings in those with a late onset of myelopathy (at 44 to 61 years).
 The large increase in HTLV-I proviral DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is presumably closely related to the development of autoimmune or inflammatory processes in HTLV-I carriers, including HTLV-I--associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis.
