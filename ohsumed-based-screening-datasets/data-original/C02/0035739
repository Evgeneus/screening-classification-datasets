Invasive aspergillosis in AIDS.
 Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in two patients with HIV infection, one with prolonged neutropenia and another receiving corticosteroid therapy.
 We found 17 additional cases in the literature.
 A known predisposing risk factor for invasive aspergillosis, eg, neutropenia, corticosteroid use, or intravenous drug abuse, was present in 79% of the cases.
 That the known immunologic defect of AIDS is not a major host defense against Aspergillus is supported by the empiric observation of the relative rarity of aspergillosis in patients with AIDS.
 The lung was the most common site of Aspergillus infection (75%), and transbronchial biopsy is diagnostically useful.
 Central nervous system involvement was seen in 55% and appears to be more frequent in HIV-infected patients than in other immunosuppressed patients with invasive aspergillosis.
 Prognosis is grim.
 Despite early institution of amphotericin B therapy in a few cases, the disease was uniformly fatal.
 Efficacy of therapy with amphotericin B plus rifampin or itraconazole remains to be evaluated.
 We conclude that aspergillosis is not an AIDS-related opportunistic infection.
