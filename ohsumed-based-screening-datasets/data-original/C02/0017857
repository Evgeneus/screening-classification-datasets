Esophageal candidiasis in AIDS. Successful therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets taken by mouth.
 In this paper we describe the results of oral therapy of esophageal candidiasis with clotrimazole vaginal tablets in 25 homosexual men with AIDS, of whom 19 had oral candidiasis and 16 had esophageal symptoms.
 Therapy with clotrimazole vaginal tablets, 100 mg, taken by mouth cleared the esophageal symptoms, oral candidiasis, and esophageal lesions completely in all 25 men.
 Clotrimazole vaginal tablets are a useful alternative to other antifungal agents for the treatment of esophageal candidiasis in AIDS patients.
