Reciprocal activation of human T-lymphotropic viruses in HTLV-I-transformed cells superinfected with HIV-1.
 The finding of dual HTLV-I and HIV-1 infection in populations at risk for AIDS raises the possibility that interaction between the two viruses might have clinical significance.
 It was shown that HTLV-I enhances HIV-1 expression, but whether HIV-1 activates HTLV-I remains to be demonstrated.
 To study HTLV-I behaviour following HIV-1 infection, we superinfected cells from two HTLV-I transformed cell lines with HIV-1 (strain IIIB).
 Viral RNA analysis indicated that HTLV-I expression in the doubly infected cells was moderately enhanced.
 Moreover, CAT assays in HTLV-I transformed cells transiently transfected with HTLV-I LTR-CAT disclosed higher activity in the HIV-1 superinfected cultures.
 This enhancement was observed only after infection with active HIV-1 virus, but not following exposure to inactivated viral particles or transfection with HIV-1 tat gene.
