The influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection on tuberculosis in Kampala, Uganda.
 The clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic features of 59 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Kampala, Uganda were studied and correlated with the serologic reactivity to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) of these patients.
 Two-thirds of the patients with tuberculosis were HIV-seropositive.
 Histories of fever and weight loss were more prominent in HIV-seropositive patients, and perihilar and basilar infiltrative diseases were more frequently seen in HIV-seropositive patients.
 Although all patients responded similarly to drug therapy, cutaneous drug reactions were seen in nearly one-third of HIV-seropositive patients receiving thiacetazone.
