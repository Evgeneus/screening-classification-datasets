A 'unified theory' of prion propagation.
 There is now very persuasive evidence that the transmissible agent for spongiform encephalopathies such as scrapie, consists of a modified form of the normal host protein PrPc, devoid of any nucleic acid.
 On the other hand, because there are many different strains of scrapie agent with distinct phenotypes which can be propagated in animals homozygous for the PrPc gene, it has been suggested that a nucleic acid must be a component of the agent.
 Can the two views be reconciled?.
