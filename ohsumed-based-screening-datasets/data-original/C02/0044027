Fatal disseminated hemorrhagic toxoplasmic encephalitis as the initial manifestation of AIDS.
 A 28-year-old woman presented with progressive coma after being asymptomatic for 1 year after the demonstration of seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus and high serum immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers.
 Computed tomographic scanning showed multiple rounded cerebral hemorrhages and massive cerebral edema.
 Postmortem examination disclosed Toxoplasma gondii cysts scattered throughout the brain.
 An overwhelming fatal toxoplasmosis associated with multiple cerebral hemorrhages may be the first presentation of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 We raise the possibility that frequent neuroradiological monitoring may be indicated in asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with high immunoglobulin G toxoplasma titers.
