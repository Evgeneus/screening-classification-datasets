9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) effectively inhibits retrovirus replication in vitro and simian immunodeficiency virus infection in rhesus monkeys.
 9-(2-Phosphonylmethoxyethyl)adenine (PMEA) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the in vitro replication of a number of retroviruses, including HIV-1 and HIV-2, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), simian AIDS-related virus (SRV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and Moloney murine sarcoma virus (MSV).
 PMEA causes a dose-dependent suppression of the induction of anti-SIVmacgp120 antibodies in SIV mac-infected rhesus monkeys.
 Complete suppression of anti-SIVmacgp120 antibodies was achieved in SIV-infected animals treated with PMEA at 2 x 10 or 2 x 5 mg/kg per day for 29 days.
 No toxic side-effects were noted during this treatment period.
 Antibodies against SIVmac gp120 appeared 1-2 weeks after PMEA treatment was stopped, but the antibody titre reached in these animals was significantly lower than in the SIVmac-infected animals who had not been treated with PMEA.
 Our data strongly suggest that PMEA should be pursued for its potential in the treatment of AIDS and other retrovirus infections.
