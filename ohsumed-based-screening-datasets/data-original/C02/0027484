Varicella zoster virus DNA in throat swabs.
 Eighty-one throat swabs from 18 patients infected with varicella were tested for varicella zoster virus DNA by the polymerase chain reaction.
 The positive rates were 26.2% (11/42) during the incubation period and 89.7% (35/39) after clinical onset.
 The results indicate the pharynx is a site for early replication of the virus.
