Seroepidemiology of human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I/II in Benin (West Africa).
 In 1988-1989, a national survey was conducted in Benin to determine the distribution of HTLV-I infection in a representative sample of adult individuals.
 This study comprised 2625 healthy subjects recruited in the six provinces of Benin and 1300 blood donors from Cotonou and from the other five provinces.
 Sera were screened for HTLV-I antibody by both immunofluorescence (IF) and enzyme immunoassay (EIA).
 Sera positive or doubtful by at least one technique were further analyzed by Western blot and radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) when indeterminate.
 Samples were considered as positive if they reacted with two gene products.
 No blood donor was positive.
 Over the 2625 subjects, 39 (1.5%) were positive.
 We observed a statistical difference between male and female (1%, 2%, p less than 0.05).
 A difference was also observed according to the areas studied: the HTLV-I antibody rate increased from coastal (0.3%) to northern (5.4%) provinces.
 HTLV-I seroprevalence increased significantly with age.
 This survey shows that HTLV-I infection exists in Benin but varies according to regions.
