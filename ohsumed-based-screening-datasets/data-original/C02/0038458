Poliomyelitis-like paralysis during recovery from acute bronchial asthma: possible etiology and risk factors.
 A poliomyelitis-like paralytic disease during recovery from an attack of bronchial asthma is described in two young children.
 They presented at the age of 13 and 22 months, respectively, with acute flaccid paralysis of one or both lower limbs and preserved sensation.
 Cerebrospinal fluid examinations revealed mild protein elevation in both and pleocytosis in the second infant.
 Enteroviruses were isolated in a nasal swab and stools of the second patient.
 Acute onset of flaccid paralysis with absent motor action potential and normal sensory responses, detected by electrophysiologic studies, are highly suggestive of motor anterior horn cell disease in these infants.
 A multifactorial setup of immune suppression, stress, and neurotoxic drugs during an acute bronchial asthma attack triggered by a viral disease may render the patient vulnerable to viral invasion of the anterior horn cell with enteroviruses other than poliovirus.
 The overall experience of 22 patients with this serious complication is reviewed.
