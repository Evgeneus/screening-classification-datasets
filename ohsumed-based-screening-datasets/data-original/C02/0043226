Reversible tricuspid stenosis. Demonstration with two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler.
 We report a case of pseudo-tricuspid stenosis as a result of extrinsic compression of the tricuspid valve by a large right-sided pericardial effusion.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography and continuous-wave Doppler enabled accurate noninvasive diagnosis and hemodynamic assessment.
