A silver enhanced, gold labelled, immunosorbent assay for detecting antibodies to rubella virus.
 A silver enhanced, gold labelled, immunosorbent assay (SEGLISA) for the detection of IgG antibodies to the rubella virus in human serum was developed.
 Pre-coated microtitre wells are used as the immobilised base of rubella antigens on to which any rubella antibodies from patient samples will bind.
 This antigen/antibody complex is then visualised firstly by gold labelled anti-immunoglobulin G, which binds to any human IgG that may be present, and then by silver amplification, resulting in a black permanent deposit on the microtitre well surface.
 Patient samples (n = 121) were screened using a commercially available enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an equivalent SEGLISA.
 Results were comparable but the SEGLISA does not have the disadvantages associated with enzyme labels.
 The silver deposit may also be read visually or the dried plate may be stored for future reference.
