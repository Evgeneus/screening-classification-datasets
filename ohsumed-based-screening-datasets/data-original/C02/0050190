Preventing secondary infections among HIV-positive persons.
 Secondary infectious diseases contribute substantially to morbidity and mortality of people infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 The authors developed comprehensive, practical recommendations for prevention of infectious complications in HIV-infected people.
 Recommendations are concerned with the pathogens that are more common or more severe in HIV-infected people.
 Several infectious complications can be prevented by avoiding ingestion of contaminated food or water.
 Zoonoses can be prevented by precautions to be taken in contacts with animals.
 The risk of several fungal diseases can be reduced if activities likely to lead to inhalation of spores are avoided.
 HIV-infected people should be advised how to lower adverse health effects of travel, especially international travel.
 The potential for infectious complications of sexual activity and illicit drug use should be stressed, and recommendations to reduce the risk are discussed.
 Recommendations for use of vaccines in HIV-infected people are reviewed.
 Blood CD4+ lymphocyte concentrations, tuberculin skin testing, Toxoplasma serology, and sexually transmitted disease screening should be performed in certain subsets of HIV-infected people.
 Guidelines for chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii and tuberculosis are presented.
 Recent data suggest that intravenous immunoglobulin therapy may prevent bacterial infections in HIV-infected children.
