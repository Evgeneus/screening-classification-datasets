Monitoring of specific antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus structural proteins: clinical significance.
 Levels of antibodies to six major structural proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (gp120, gp41, p66, p31, p24, and p17) were assessed in serial samples from 22 persons with severe hemophilia (16 asymptomatic and 6 who developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] or AIDS-related complex) with an automated dot blot assay using purified recombinant antigens.
 High and sustained levels of antibody to gp120, gp41, and p31 were found in all patients irrespective of their clinical condition for 4 to 6 years after seroconversion.
 In contrast, immune response to p66 and p17 was significantly lower in symptomatic patients.
 Over time, the levels of these two antibodies, as well as anti-p24, decreased and tended to become undetectable.
 Abnormal immune response and low levels of antibody to p66 and p17 are early indications of rapid clinical progression.
