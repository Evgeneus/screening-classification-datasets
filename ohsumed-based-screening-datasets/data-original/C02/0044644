Focal encephalitis with enterovirus infections.
 We report on four pediatric patients with Enterovirus infections who were admitted to the hospital with signs or symptoms of acute, focal encephalitis.
 All four experienced focal seizures.
 Each had a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis at the initial lumbar puncture.
 In all four patients the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis was entertained.
 Each child improved spontaneously within a few days of admission to the hospital, and only one had residual neurologic abnormalities at the time of discharge.
 A brief review of these cases, and three additional cases from the literature, indicate that the enteroviruses, particularly the group A Coxsackieviruses, are rare causes of acute focal encephalitis in children and adolescents.
