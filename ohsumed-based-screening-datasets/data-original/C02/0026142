Molecular approaches to epidemiologic evaluation of viruses as risk factors for patients who have chronic fatigue syndrome.
 One approach to understanding the chronic fatigue syndrome might be to carry out prospective studies of fatigue that occurs following infection with viral diseases of known etiology, such as influenza, hepatitis, and infectious mononucleosis.
 Among the viral parameters that should be evaluated are virus burden, variation of virus strain, sites of viral replication, and the state of the viral life cycle (e.g., latent or replicative).
 Immunologic studies should focus on the humoral and cellular responses to defined viral gene products to identify subtle, individual variations in immune recognition of specific viral subcomponents.
