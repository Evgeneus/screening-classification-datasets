Specific synthetic peptides for detection of and discrimination between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection.
 A panel of highly purified synthetic oligopeptides representing defined parts of the gag and env proteins of HIV-1 and HIV-2 were used as antigens in ELISA for serodiagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection.
 The analysis included sera from 321 HIV-infected patients and 201 healthy controls from the Ivory Coast, where the prevalence is high for both HIV-1 and HIV-2, and sera from European HIV-1-infected individuals.
 All sera from HIV-1-infected individuals reacted with a 20 amino acid (a.a.) peptide JB-4c (a.a.
 594-613) derived from a highly immunogenic conserved region of the external part of gp41.
 An equally good response was seen in the HIV-2-infected individuals to a 20 a.a.
 peptide, JB-16c, from the corresponding part of HIV-2 gp36.
 Both HIV-1- and HIV-2-seropositive individuals responded well to a peptide, JB-8pc (a.a.
 427-448), representing the C-terminal end of the putative CD4-binding site of gp120 of HIV-1.
 The frequency of reactivity to three selected HIV-1 gag peptides derived from p17 and p15 was 60-70% in both HIV-1 and HIV-2-positive sera.
 To distinguish between HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection, the sera were titrated against the peptides.
 Although there was a high degree of cross-reactivity at lower serum dilutions, it was possible to discriminate the infections at higher dilutions to the HIV-1 and HIV-2 gp41/gp36 peptides JB-4c and JB-16c.
 Analysis of serum reactivity to several selected peptides thus allowed the identification of HIV infection, and the discrimination between HIV-1 and HIV-2.
