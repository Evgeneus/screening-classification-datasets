Changes in lung mechanics and reactivity with age after viral bronchiolitis in beagle puppies.
 We measured changes with growth in lung function and airway reactivity after acute canine parainfluenza virus type 2 (CPI2, n = 5), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV2, n = 7), and sequential CAV2-CPI2 (n = 6) infections or no infection (controls, n = 6) in beagle puppies (age approximately 79 days).
 In the CPI2 and CAV2 groups, a lower respiratory illness developed by day 3 postinfection with clinical recovery by day 14.
 In the CAV2-CPI2 group, puppies were inoculated initially with CAV2 and 12 days later with CPI2.
 In this group, illness persisted until day 14 after infection with CPI2.
 Lung resistance (RL), dynamic (Cdyn) and static (Cst) lung compliance, functional residual capacity (FRC), and responsiveness to aerosolized histamine were measured before infection and at periodic intervals until 239 +/- 43 days of age.
 Lung function data were analyzed using a longitudinal random effects model.
 In all groups, FRC, Cst, and Cdyn increased with age.
 In all infected groups, the regression slopes for Cdyn were steeper than in controls.
 RL decreased linearly with age without group slope differences.
 Histamine reactivity increased with age, but there were no differences in slope among groups.
 Lung pathological studies showed areas of obliterative bronchiolitis and chronic small airways inflammation particularly in the CAV2 and CAV2-CPI2 groups.
 Thus, viral bronchiolitis produces chronic small airways inflammation in beagle puppies and alters the changes in lung function occurring with growth.
 Histamine reactivity increases with age and is not modified by viral infection.
