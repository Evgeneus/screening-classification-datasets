Hospitalization of HIV-seropositive newborns with AIDS-related disease within the first year of life.
 The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion of HIV-seropositive newborns hospitalized for an AIDS-related diagnosis within 12 months of birth and to characterize these hospitalizations.
 The number of HIV-seropositive infants born December 1987 through June 1988 was derived from the blinded New York State Newborn HIV Seroprevalence Study.
 The number of infants who were born in these same months and hospitalized with an ARD within 12 months of birth was obtained from a data base containing information on all hospital discharges in New York State.
 Comparisons were made on the basis of month of birth.
 Of infants born during the study period, 995 tested positive for HIV antibody, and 151 infants (15 percent) were hospitalized with an ARD within 12 months of birth.
 The 151 ARD cases had a total of 240 hospitalizations, accounting for 5,772 patient days.
 Fifty-six percent of the ARD cases were diagnosed within six months of birth.
