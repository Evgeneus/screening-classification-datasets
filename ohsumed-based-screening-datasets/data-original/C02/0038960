Incidence, etiology, and outcome of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.
 This study assessed the incidence, etiology, and consequences of ventilator-associated pneumonia in 1,000 consecutive patients admitted in a medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU).
 A total of 264 patients were submitted to mechanical ventilation (MV) for more than 48 hours.
 Fifty-eight (21.9 percent) patients developed a bacterial pneumonia after a mean of 7.9 days (range, 2 to 40 days) of MV.
 In addition, they were ten superinfections in nine patients, raising the mean incidence to 25.7 percent.
 Five patients developed secondary bacteremia, and another five had septic shock.
 Identification of the causative agent of pneumonia was possible in 47 episodes by means of highly specific techniques (telescoping plugged catheter, blood cultures, and/or necropsy).
 Thirteen (27.6 percent) of these cases were polymicrobial.
 The predominant pathogens isolated in the first episode of pneumonia were Gram-negative bacilli (62.6 percent), but a high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus infection (23.2 percent) was detected.
 Gram-negative bacilli represented 66.6 percent of the total organisms isolated in superinfections.
 The mortality rate in the pneumonia group was 42 percent; this percentage is similar to mortality rate among MV patients without pneumonia (37 percent).
 We conclude that nosocomial pneumonia is a frequent complication of MV in the medical-surgical ICU.
 Ventilator-associated pneumonia does not appear to increase fatality in critically ill patients with a high mortality rate (38 percent); however, it significantly prolongs the length of stay in the ICU for survivors.
