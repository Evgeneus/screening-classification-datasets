Successful haemodialysis via an unusually sited subclavian catheter.
 A 38-year old woman with a history of congenital rubella required temporary venous access for haemodialysis.
 A left sided subclavian catheter was inserted percutaneously and on check radiography it was found to be on the left side of the mediastinum.
 Contrast radiography showed that the catheter was in a left sided superior vena cava which drained into the right atrium via the coronary sinus.
 Haemodialysis was performed without any difficulty.
