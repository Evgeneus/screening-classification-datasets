Search for herpes simplex virus 2 and human papillomavirus genetic expression in vulvar neoplasia.
 Specimens from vulvar carcinomas and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) of various degrees were analyzed for the presence of herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV 2) and human papillomavirus (HPV) genetic information.
 A search for the HPV 16 E6 protein as well as the HSV 2 antigenic determinant LA1 and ICSP 11/12 protein was carried out with an immunoperoxidase assay on 12 vulvar carcinomas and 6 VINs.
 Seven invasive cancers and four VINs were screened for the presence of homology to HPV 16 DNA and HSV 2 DNA transforming sequences with Southern blot hybridization.
 We used specimens from labial tumors and from normal vulvas and cervixes as controls.
 The preliminary results showed that one vulvar carcinoma and two VINs contained HPV 16 DNA.
 Four vulvar carcinomas expressed the E6 protein, while all the VINs were negative.
 Homology to HSV 2 DNA transforming sequences was detected in one vulvar cancer but not in any VIN cases.
 Positivity to HSV 2 ICSP 11/12 was observed in 33.3% of VIN cases and 75% of invasive cancers.
 HSV 2 LA1 antigenic determinant was expressed in 33.3% of VIN and 66.6% of cancer cases.
