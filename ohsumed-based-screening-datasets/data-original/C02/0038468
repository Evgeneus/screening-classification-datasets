Low-dose zidovudine in children with an human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection acquired in the perinatal period 
 This report describes the one-year results of a noncomparative study designed to assess the safety and tolerance of low-dose zidovudine (azidothymidine) given orally to 60 human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected infants and children.
 At baseline, the mean age was 1.9 years (+/- 1.4), and all were symptomatic: 43% were P2A and 57% were P2B to F according to the Centers for Disease Control classification.
 All the patients received zidovudine for at least 6 months, and 52 of them (87%) completed a full year of therapy.
 The mean duration of follow-up was 346 days (+/- 42) (range, 183 to 366 days).
 The initial therapy consisted of four daily doses of 100 mg/m2 (400 mg/m2 per day, equivalent to 20 mg/kg per day).
 However, this treatment was modified when neutropenia or anemia was observed.
 Twenty-nine children (48%) remained at the initial therapy for the entire study.
 Zidovudine dosage was adjusted 92 times in the other 31 children (52%), mostly due to neutropenia (83%).
 Altogether, the time under full-dose therapy represented 81% of the total duration of the protocol for all patients.
 Children with mild symptoms, P2A at study entry, were more likely to remain under full-dose therapy than children with severe symptoms, P2B to F: the time under full-dose therapy represented 91% of the duration of the protocol for the former group and only 74% for the latter one (P less than .02).
 No clinical adverse experiences were attributed directly to zidovudine.
 Thirty-seven children were prescribed trimethoprim-sulfametoxazole as a prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
