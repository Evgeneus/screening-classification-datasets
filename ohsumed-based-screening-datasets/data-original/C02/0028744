Assessment of HIV status using the polymerase chain reaction in antibody-positive patients and high-risk antibody-negative haemophiliacs.
 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the presence of DNA sequences homologous to HIV-1 in the buffy-coat leukocytes of antibody-positive and antibody-negative individuals in a haemophiliac population.
 The presence of HIV sequences was demonstrated in all of the antibody-positive haemophiliacs with the exception of one patient who was repeatedly negative.
 None of the seronegative haemophiliacs gave an overall positive result, although there were clear differences between this population and the negative controls who were examined.
 We conclude that, in our hands, PCR represents a reliable test which represents a useful diagnostic advance in HIV medicine.
