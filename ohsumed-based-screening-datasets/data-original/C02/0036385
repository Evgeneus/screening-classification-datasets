Establishment from Shope carcinoma induced in an inbred rabbit of culture cell lines with various potentials for differentiation and tumorigenicity.
 Shope papillomas induced by cottontail rabbit papilloma-virus (CRPV) in domestic rabbits frequently regress spontaneously or, failing to do so, convert into squamous cell carcinomas at a high rate.
 This papilloma-carcinoma complex in rabbits provides an experimental model for human papillo-mavirus-associated malignancies.
 The aim of this study was to prepare an experimental system in inbred rabbits by establishing culture cell lines of the tumor.
 Squamous cell carcinoma developed from a Shope papilloma that had been induced 6 months previously by inoculating CRPV into an inbred B/J rabbit.
 By in vitro culturing of the tumor cells, cell lines with potentials for terminal differentiation and tumorigenicity were established.
 Cloning yielded sublines that varied in these potentials and possessed episomal and integrated CRPV genomes as revealed by Southern hybridization in both one- and two-dimensional electrophoresis.
 Major CRPV-specific transcripts were similarly observed both in well-differentiated and in poorly differentiated sublines.
 Immunofluorescence with syngeneic rabbit antibody against tumor-specific antigens localized such antigens mainly in the nuclei of the cells of these sublines.
 This experimental system allows experiments that were not feasible in randomly bred rabbits.
