Electrolyte transport in piglets infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus. Stimulation by verapamil and clonidine.
 The effects of clonidine, an alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, and verapamil, a Ca2+ channel blocker, on Na+ and Cl- absorption were studied in stripped jejunal mucosa from control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-virus-infected piglets.
 All infected piglets developed severe diarrhea 18-24 hours after oral inoculation.
 Jejunum from infected animals, as compared with control jejunum, had decreased mucosal-to-serosal, serosal-to-mucosal, and net Na+ and Cl- fluxes.
 Clonidine and verapamil caused a decrease in short-circuit current and stimulation of Na+ and Cl- absorption in control jejunum.
 In infected piglets, although the jejunum exhibited severe villus atrophy, both drugs stimulated Na+ and Cl- absorption and the magnitude of Na+ and Cl- absorption was similar in control and transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum.
 In contrast, D-glucose stimulated Na+ absorption, and the decrease in short-circuit current caused by verapamil and clonidine, were decreased in transmissible-gastroenteritis-infected jejunum.
 Such pharmacological stimulation of Na+ and Cl- absorption might be useful in the management and treatment of certain viral diarrheal diseases.
