A virus-encoded "superantigen" in a retrovirus-induced immunodeficiency syndrome of mice.
 The development of an immunodeficiency syndrome of mice caused by a replication-defective murine leukemia virus (MuLV) is paradoxically associated with a rapid activation and proliferation of CD4+ T cells that are dependent on the presence of B cells.
 The responses of normal spleen cells to B cell lines that express the defective virus indicated that these lines express a cell surface determinant that shares "superantigenic" properties with some microbial antigens and Mls-like self antigens.
 This antigen elicited a potent proliferative response that was dependent on the presence of CD4+ T cells and was associated with selective expansion of cells bearing V beta 5.
 This response was markedly inhibited by a monoclonal antibody specific for the MuLV gag-encoded p30 antigen.
