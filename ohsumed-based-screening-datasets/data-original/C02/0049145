Gamma globulin prophylaxis to reduce post-transfusion non-A, non-B hepatitis after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
 A prospective, randomized study of immune serum globulin (ISG) for prevention of post-transfusion hepatitis was performed on 196 patients (100 controls without gammaglobulin or placebo and 96 who received ISG) undergoing valve replacement or coronary artery bypass with extracorporeal circulation.
 The dose of ISG was 2 ml i.m.
 at premedication and 2 ml i.m.
 on postoperative day 3.
 Probable non-A, non-B hepatitis developed postoperatively in ten of the 100 controls and two of the 96 in the ISG group.
 Two ISG patients and three controls with non-A, non-B hepatitis still have increased serum aminotransferase values after 3-5 years, but liver biopsy revealed hepatitis, which histologically was very mild, in only two control and two ISG patients.
 Low-dose gamma globulin thus reduced the incidence of acute, probable non-A, non-B hepatitis in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.
