Prospective evaluation of posttransfusion hepatitis.
 The incidence of posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) was determined prospectively at our institution.
 An active surveillance program of transfused surgical patients was set up; alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were determined before transfusion and at monthly intervals for 6 months after transfusion.
 Patients with confirmed ALT values greater than 2.5 times the upper reference values were referred to the out-patient clinics for diagnosis.
 Of 4051 surgical patients who underwent transfusion between January 1986 and December 1989, 2459 (60.7%) were enrolled in the surveillance program, and 1018 (25.1%) completed the follow-up; 238 patients received autologous blood only and were used as controls.
 No PTH was observed in the control patients, and the incidence of the disease in patients receiving homologous blood was 10.97 percent in 1986, 6.58 percent in 1987, 5.55 percent in 1988, and 4.29 percent in 1989; the decreasing trend is significant (p = 0.018).
