HTLV-I-associated myelopathy in a Californian: diagnosis by reactivity to a viral recombinant antigen.
 A male patient developed leg numbness and weakness, and bowel, bladder, and erectile dysfunction.
 Examination revealed an isolated thoracic myelopathy, with lower-extremity spasticity, decreased vibration and position sense, hyperreflexia, and Babinski's signs.
 Serum and CSF showed antibody reactivity to human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I or II (HTLV-I/II), suggesting HTLV-I-associated myelopathy.
 Antibody reactivity to a unique HTLV-I recombinant protein provided definitive diagnosis of HTLV-I infection.
