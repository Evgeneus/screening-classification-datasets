Detection of hepatitis C viral RNA in serum of a patient with acute non A, non B hepatitis.
 The sequence of serologic events in a patient with acute type C hepatitis associated with intravenous drug abuse is described.
 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) ribonucleic acid was detectable in serum during the acute episode of hepatitis, whereas antibody to the hepatitis C virus appeared later, after the acute illness had subsided.
 The patient developed chronic hepatitis with persistently elevated serum aminotransferase activities.
 Both hepatitis C viral ribonucleic acid and antibody to hepatitis C virus persisted in serum, together with elevated serum aminotransferases.
 Thus, detection of HCV RNA may be useful in the diagnosis of acute type C hepatitis, particularly in the absence of detectable antibody to the hepatitis C virus.
