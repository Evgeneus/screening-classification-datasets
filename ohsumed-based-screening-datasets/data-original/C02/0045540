Risk factors for measles in a previously vaccinated population and cost-effectiveness of revaccination strategies 
 Using data from a large measles outbreak that occurred in Dane County (Wisconsin) in 1986, we conducted a case-control study to evaluate risk factors for vaccine failure and assessed the cost-effectiveness of school-based revaccination strategies.
 Vaccination before a change in the measles vaccine stabilizer in 1979 (odds ratio, 5.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 28.9) and vaccination before age 15 months (odds ratio, 13.9; 95% confidence interval, 5.9 to 32.6) were identified as risk factors.
 Revaccination strategies for all students ($3444 per case prevented), students vaccinated before 1980 ($3166 per case prevented), and students vaccinated before age 15 months ($2546 per case prevented) were evaluated, assuming use of measles-mumps-rubella vaccine after the initial case was detected in a school.
 However, a large proportion of cases (43% to 53%) may not have been preventable using these strategies.
 Therefore, revaccination in all schools assessed to be at risk for measles may be necessary to prevent large outbreaks until a two-dose vaccination schedule is fully implemented.
