Non-typhoid Salmonella in renal transplant recipients: a report of twenty cases and review of the literature.
 We report 20 cases of non-typhoid Salmonella infection that occurred over a period of 10 years in 592 renal transplant recipients followed by our unit, and present a review of 58 previously reported cases.
 Analysis of these data suggests that infection occurs when immunosuppression is high (early in the post-transplant period, or after anti-rejection therapy).
 A significant number of patients have bacteraemia and widespread focal manifestations are common.
 Despite prolonged antibiotic therapy, relapses occur commonly causing significant morbidity, occasional graft loss and even death.
