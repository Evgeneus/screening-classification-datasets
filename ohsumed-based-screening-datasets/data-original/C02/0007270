Predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in cerebrospinal fluid of AIDS patients with cytomegalovirus polyradiculomyelitis.
 Cytomegalovirus (CMV) polyradiculomyelitis was diagnosed in 4 of 241 consecutive neurologically assessed human immunodeficiency virus type (HIV-1) seropositive patients.
 CMV-related neurologic disease was suspected on clinical grounds and was subsequently confirmed by CMV culture from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and/or CMV in situ hybridization on specific specimens.
 All four patients showed CSF pleocytosis with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs).
 Retrospective analysis of the results of CSF examination, performed in 143 of 241 patients with neurologic symptoms, showed pleocytosis in 58 of 143 patients.
 Predominance of PMNs was found in seven patients, including the four with CMV polyradiculomyelitis.
 It is concluded that in HIV-1 seropositive patients with a clinical diagnosis of polyradiculomyelitis, a predominance of PMNs in CSF could be an indication that the condition is CMV related.
 This should lead to early diagnosis and institution of specific antiviral therapy.
