Transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis from an HIV-positive client in a residential substance-abuse treatment facility--Michigan.
 In November 1989, a man with a history of intravenous (IV)-drug use first presented to the tuberculosis (TB) clinic of the Muskegon County (Michigan) Health Department (MCHD).
 The patient indicated that he had been treated for pulmonary TB in another city, and he produced for clinic staff his labeled medications, which included isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), and ethambutol (EMB).
 The patient also stated that he was an IV-drug user (IVDU) and previously had tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 Sputum specimens for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) were obtained, and the patient was maintained on his anti-TB medications.
 His HIV-antibody status was confirmed.
