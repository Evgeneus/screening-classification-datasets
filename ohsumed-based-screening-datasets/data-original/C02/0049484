Detection and partial sequencing of hepatitis C virus RNA in the liver.
 To detect hepatitis C virus RNA, total RNA was extracted from liver tissue, reverse transcribed to complementary DNA, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction.
 The reaction products were analyzed by ethidium bromide staining in acrylamide gel and hybridization with a radiolabeled probe.
 Hepatitis C virus RNA was thereby detected in 17 of 27 (63%) liver tissue specimens obtained from patients with non-A, non-B chronic liver diseases.
 Of these 27 patients, viral RNA was detected in 12 of 17 (71%) liver tissues from anti-hepatitis C virus-positive patients and in 5 of 10 (50%) liver tissues from anti-hepatitis C virus-negative patients.
 Direct sequencing of amplified complementary DNA (35 nucleotides) of the 17 RNA-positive samples showed only 66% to 77% homology to the reported hepatitis C virus complementary DNA sequence.
 These results indicate that the majority of anti-hepatitis C virus-positive patients are currently infected with hepatitis C virus, and some of the anti-hepatitis C virus-negative patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis are harboring hepatitis C virus in the liver.
 Detection of hepatitis C virus RNA appears to provide a useful indicator in the study of hepatitis C virus infection.
