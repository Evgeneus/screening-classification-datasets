Interleukin-6 in cerebrospinal fluid of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy.
 We demonstrated significant titers of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the CSF from 6 of 11 patients with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy (HAM).
 The patients positive for IL-6 generally had more severe clinical symptoms and signs than those negative for IL-6.
 There was no correlation between the value of IL-6 and inflammatory findings in the HAM CSF.
