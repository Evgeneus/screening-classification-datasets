Etiology and mechanisms of acute infectious diarrhea in infants in the United States.
 Infectious diarrhea, caused by a wide variety of viral, bacterial and parasitic pathogens, is a common reason for morbidity and hospitalization for children in the United States.
 Overall, rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrheal disease in infants.
 Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter are the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens, and Giardia and Cryptosporidium are the parasites that most commonly produce acute infectious diarrhea.
 The mechanisms by which these enteropathogens cause diarrhea are highly variable, and include crypt cell proliferation, cellular invasion, elaboration of enterotoxins or cytotoxins, and enteroadhesion.
 In infants the incidence of diarrheal disease is higher and the severity of the illness is greater than in older children and adults.
 An increased rate of exposure to enteropathogens, as a result of fecal-oral contamination, may explain some of the increased incidence of diarrhea in infants.
 However, age-specific differences in host defense mechanisms may also account for the increased susceptibility to and severity of certain enteric infections in infants.
