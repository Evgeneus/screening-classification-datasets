Characterization of the terminal regions of hepatitis C viral RNA: identification of conserved sequences in the 5' untranslated region and poly(A) tails at the 3' end.
 We have determined the nucleotide sequence at the extreme 5' and 3' termini of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome.
 Our analyses of these sequences show (i) the nucleotide sequence in the 5' untranslated region is highly conserved among HCV isolates of widely varying geographical origin, (ii) within this region, there are blocks of nucleotide sequence homology with pestiviruses but not with other viruses, (iii) the relative position of short open reading frames present in the same region of the HCV genome is similar to that of the pestiviral genome, (iv) RNAs truncated at the 5' and 3' ends are found, but the origin and functions of these RNAs are unknown, and (v) poly(A) tails appear to be present on 3' subgenomic RNAs.
 These data differentiate HCV from the flaviviruses and indicate a closer evolutionary relationship of HCV with the pestiviruses.
 However, HCV also appears to be substantially different from other known pestiviruses.
 These data are consistent with the assignment of HCV to a separate viral genus.
