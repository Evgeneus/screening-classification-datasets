Identification of a recombinant HTLV-II envelope protein for serological detection of HTLV-II carriers.
 To understand the pathogenic potential and the true extent of human T-cell leukemia virus type II (HTLV-II) infection, it is important to develop a specific HTLV-II antigen-based serological test.
 Plasmid pIIB was constructed and induced in Escherichia coli to express a recombinant protein (RP) containing 140 amino acids (amino acid residues 96 to 235) from the middle region of the HTLV-II exterior envelope glycoprotein gp52.
 Serum samples from polymerase chain reaction-confirmed HTLV-II-infected people, HTLV-I carriers, and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) patients were tested for antibody reactivity to RP-IIB by Western blot assay.
 The results showed all 27 HTLV-II carriers, 10 of 20 HTLV-I carriers, and 4 of 17 (23.5%) ATL patients had antibody reactivities to RP-IIB.
 The difference in rates of seropositivity to RP-IIB between HTLV-II carriers (100%) and HTLV-I-infected people (carriers plus ATL patients) (37.8%) is statistically significant (Fisher's exact test, p = 4.30E-08).
