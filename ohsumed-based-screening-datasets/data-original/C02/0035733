Efficacy of aztreonam in the treatment of skeletal infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 Twenty-eight patients with skeletal infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated with aztreonam during two open, noncomparative, multicenter clinical trials.
 Ten patients with septic arthritis received 2 g of aztreonam three times a day (modal) for 30 days (mean).
 The mean follow-up period was 4 weeks.
 Microbiologic cure was achieved in all 10 patients; complete clinical cure, in eight; and partial clinical cure, in two.
 Eighteen cases of osteomyelitis were treated with 2 g of aztreonam three times a day (modal) for 40 days (mean), with a mean follow-up period of 6 months.
 Microbiologic cure was achieved in 17 patients.
 Relapse occurred 1 month after therapy in one patient.
 Complete clinical cure was achieved in 13 and partial clinical cure was achieved in five patients.
 The most common adverse reactions to aztreonam were a transient elevation in levels of hepatic enzymes and transient eosinophilia.
 Three superinfections and one subsequent infection occurred.
 These results support use of aztreonam for the treatment of skeletal infections due to P.
 aeruginosa.
