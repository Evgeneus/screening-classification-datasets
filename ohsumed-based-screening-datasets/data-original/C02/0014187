Seborrheic dermatitis and HIV infection. Qualitative analysis of skin surface lipids in men seropositive and seronegative for HIV.
 We measured skin surface lipids (cholesterol, free fatty acids, triglycerides, wax esters, and squalene) in patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and those seronegative for HIV with and without seborrheic dermatitis.
 Cholesterol and wax ester fractions were similar in all four groups but triglycerides and squalene were significantly increased and free fatty acids significantly decreased in HIV-positive patients, regardless of the presence of seborrheic dermatitis.
 In addition, a strong negative correlation was found between free fatty acid and triglyceride levels.
 We conclude that abnormalities of skin surface lipids are not associated with the development of seborrheic dermatitis in HIV-positive persons but are associated with HIV infection itself.
