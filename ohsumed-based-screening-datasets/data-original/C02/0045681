Prevalence of anti-HCV in Norwegian blood donors with anti-HBc or increased ALT levels.
 Testing for hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc) was performed in 12,104 consecutive blood donors, 139 (1.15%) of whom were found to be positive.
 The first 6036 donors were also screened for ALT; 91 (1.51%) had repeatedly elevated values.
 ALT screening was of no help in detecting anti-HBc-positive donors.
 Those with anti-HBc or repeatedly raised ALT levels were further tested for hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti-HCV), and 3 (2.16%) and 1 (1.10%) anti-HCV-positive donors were detected, respectively.
 This prevalence of anti-HCV (0.5%) is not significantly different from that found in 1000 unselected donors at our blood bank.
 Testing for ALT and anti-HBc as surrogate markers for hepatitis C is therefore not recommended in Norwegian blood donors and should be replaced by anti-HCV screening.
