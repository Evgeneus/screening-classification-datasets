High doses of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon for chronic hepatitis C: a randomized, controlled trial.
 Chronic hepatitis C is often a progressive liver disease for which there is no satisfactory treatment.
 We studied the efficacy of recombinant alpha-interferon or gamma-interferon in the treatment of this disease in comparison with a control group.
 Thirty patients were randomly assigned to three groups.
 Ten patients received 7.5 MU alpha-interferon/m2 body surface three times weekly for 3 mo, then 5 MU/m2 for 3 mo and 2.5 MU/m2 for 6 mo.
 Ten patients were treated with gamma-interferon at a dose of 2 MU/m2 for 6 mo and the other 10 served as controls without treatment.
 The mean serum ALT levels and liver histological findings improved significantly only in the patients treated with alpha-interferon.
 No changes were observed in patients treated with gamma-interferon or in controls.
 Five of 10 patients treated with alpha-interferon had complete responses (mean ALT normal during therapy).
 After treatment ALT returned to pretreatment levels in two of 5 patients.
 The long-term response rate after alpha-interferon therapy was 30% at 18 mo.
 We conclude that alpha-interferon is effective in controlling disease activity in a portion of patients with chronic hepatitis C.
 High doses of alpha-interferon do not appear to add further benefit in the response rate or relapse rate.
 gamma-Interferon therapy is ineffective.
