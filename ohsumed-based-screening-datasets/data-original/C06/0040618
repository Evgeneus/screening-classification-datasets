Protection provided by hepatitis B vaccine in a Yupik Eskimo population. Seven-year results.
 The long-term immunogenicity and protection provided by a plasma-derived hepatitis B vaccine (Heptavax B) was determined in a cohort of susceptible persons immunized in 1981.
 In this study 1581 susceptible persons were immunized with the recommended three-dose regimen of hepatitis B vaccine.
 After 7 years, 74% of vaccinees retained antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) levels of 10 mIU/mL or more.
 Anti-HBs levels at 7 years varied inversely with age and directly with the level of anti-HBs attained 1 year after the first dose.
 During the 7 years after the first dose of vaccine, five vaccine responders and three other persons developed antibody to hepatitis B core antigen and their level of anti-HBs increased.
 None developed detectable hepatitis B surface antigen or clinical hepatitis.
 This update of an ongoing study continues to suggest that the risk of hepatitis B virus infection to most persons with an initial anti-HBs response to hepatitis B virus vaccine of 10 mIU/mL or greater is low, regardless of the initial antibody level.
