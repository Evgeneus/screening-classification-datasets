Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children.
 To determine the effectiveness of percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts, we reviewed the courses of 13 children.
 Six pseudocysts resolved on complete bowel rest and total parenteral nutrition.
 Seven required further therapy.
 Two pseudocysts were treated operatively; five were drained percutaneously with fluoroscopic guidance.
 These five ranged from 5 to 15 cm in diameter and were present for 10 to 42 days (mean, 26 days).
 In all cases, the cyst fluid was clear, had an amylase level of greater than 40,000 IU/L, and grew no organisms.
 The pigtail catheters left in place in four of the five children were removed when drainage stopped.
 Patients were followed by ultrasound while still in the hospital and 1 month after discharge.
 There were no complications nor any pseudocyst recurrence.
 Percutaneous drainage of traumatic pancreatic pseudocysts in children is an effective alternative to the standard operative therapy of pseudocystenteric anastomosis.
