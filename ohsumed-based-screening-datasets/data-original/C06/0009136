Complete jejunoileal necrosis due to torsion of the superior mesenteric artery.
 We have reported a case of small-bowel volvulus in which complete jejunoileal necrosis resulted from torsion of the superior mesenteric artery.
 This case was unusual not only because of the extent of necrosis but also because primary small-bowel volvulus is rare in adults.
 Despite nearly total small-bowel resection, the patient continues to do well 6 months postoperatively.
