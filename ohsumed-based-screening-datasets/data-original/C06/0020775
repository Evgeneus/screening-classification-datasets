Amyloidosis of the small intestine: findings on double-contrast radiographs.
 The appearance of the small intestinal mucosa on double-contrast barium examinations was studied in 26 patients with proved intestinal amyloidosis.
 Findings included innumerable fine granular densities 1-3 mm in diameter (16 patients), multiple nodular densities 3-4 mm in diameter (four patients), multiple polypoid protrusions 4-10 mm in diameter (three patients), irregularities of Kerckring folds (12 patients), and multiple erosions (eight patients).
 The multiple nodular densities and erosions disappeared after the patients were treated with total parenteral nutrition.
 The other abnormalities remained unchanged on follow-up examinations.
 Our results indicate that double-contrast radiographic findings of the small intestine in patients with amyloidosis include mucosal abnormalities that vary according to the pathologic type of amyloid deposition.
