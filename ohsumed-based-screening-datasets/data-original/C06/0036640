Management of bleeding ulcers.
 Hemorrhage is a common complication of peptic ulcer disease and is increased in frequency and severity with aspirin and NSAID use.
 A variety of clinical and endoscopic factors associated with an increased mortality rate from ulcer bleeding have been identified, the most important of which are presentation in shock and ongoing or recurrent bleeding after routine resuscitative measures.
 After hemodynamic stabilization, the goal of therapy is to diminish the chance that an ulcer will continue to bleed or will rebleed.
 Currently, this is best achieved by one of several endoscopic interventions in carefully selected patients.
 The most effective endoscopic techniques for decreasing the risk of ulcer rebleeding are multipolar electrocoagulation, heater probe thermal coagulation, and injection therapy in patients with active bleeding or a visible vessel in the ulcer base.
 Injection therapy may be used alone or in combination with either of the other two techniques.
 The major impact of therapeutic endoscopy appears to be a reduction in the number of emergent operations necessary to control hemorrhage.
 The mortality of emergent surgery for bleeding ulcer is prohibitive, and any means of reducing the need for surgery is likely to have a beneficial effect on survival.
