Incremental spinal anaesthesia using a 32-gauge catheter.
 Incremental spinal anaesthesia using a 32-gauge intrathecal catheter was studied in 13 males scheduled for transurethral resection of the prostate or repair of inguinal hernia.
 The spinal technique failed in four patients.
 Dose-response curves were obtained in the remaining nine patients using increments of 0.5% plain bupivacaine.
 The spinal block was extended safely and reliably without cardiovascular instability.
 No patient had any postoperative headache and all catheters were removed intact.
