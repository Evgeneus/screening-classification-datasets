Combined treatment of symptomatic gallbladder stones by extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).
 Twenty-four patients with symptomatic gallbladder stones (12 radiolucent and 12 calcified) were treated by a combined approach of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) and subsequent instillation of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE).
 The patients received a mean of 1500 +/- 185 shock-wave discharges.
 The mean instillation time of MTBE was 13 +/- 4.2 hr.
 Treatment was tolerated without major adverse effects.
 Within a time period of three to five days eight of 12 patients with pure radiolucent stones and four of 12 with calcified stones became stone-free.
 After a median follow-up of five months (range: one week to 26 months), a total of 11 patients (92%) with radiolucent stones and of eight patients (66%) of those with calcified stones were free of stones, fragments, or debris.
 These clearance rates appear high when compared with reports on monotherapy with ESWL or MTBE, suggesting a positive effect of a combined approach in selected patients.
 Two patients exhibited recurrent stones after six and seven months, respectively.
