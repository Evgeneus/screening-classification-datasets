Use of endoscopy in peptic ulcer disease.
 The diagnosis and treatment of acute bleeding caused by peptic ulcer disease has been greatly facilitated by fiberoptic endoscopy.
 The basic differentiation between malignant and benign gastric ulcer requires endoscopic confirmation with biopsy.
 The management of bleeding from peptic ulceration can be enhanced by endoscopic examination as can the prediction of risk for recurrent bleeding or need for surgical intervention.
 Various therapeutic maneuvers can be performed endoscopically, including monopolar and multipolar cautery, laser and heater probe therapy, and injection of vasoconstrictors to control bleeding.
 Endoscopic balloon dilation for the management of gastric outlet obstruction is often effective.
