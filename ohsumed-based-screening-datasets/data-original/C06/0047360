A practical approach to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 A prospective study of 500 consecutive cholecystectomies was initiated with the introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was attempted in 96% of patients presenting with primary gallbladder disease and was completed in 95%.
 There were no deaths or bile duct injuries.
 Two patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy were transfused for postoperative bleeding, and only one patient required reoperation for any reason.
 A prospective study showed reduced operating time (20 minutes) and patient charges ($546) using electrosurgical dissection compared with laser.
 Reusable trocars were used without any associated injury or morbidity.
 An effective strategy for selective cholangiography was developed based on patient history, liver enzymes, and common duct diameter.
 In conclusion, laparoscopic cholecystectomy appears to be a safe operation.
 The cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic cholecystectomy can be enhanced ($1,271) with no loss of patient benefit using the combination of electrosurgery, reusable trocars, and selective cholangiograms in low-risk patients.
