Effects of treadmill exercise on fuel metabolism in hepatic cirrhosis.
 We studied whole body and regional fuel metabolism before, during, and after 90 min of treadmill exercise at 50% of maximal aerobic capacity (VO2max) in four subjects with hepatic cirrhosis and in four normal volunteers.
 Rates of endogenous glucose production (EGP) were measured using D-[6-3H]glucose infusions and fuel oxidation using indirect calorimetry.
 In the basal state, cirrhotic subjects had similar rates of EGP compared with controls.
 Forearm release of alanine and lactate was significantly greater in cirrhotic subjects (P less than 0.05), suggesting increased basal rates of gluconeogenesis.
 During exercise, EGP increased 2- to 2.5-fold in control subjects (P less than 0.01) but did not increase in cirrhotic subjects.
 Despite lower glucose concentrations in cirrhotic subjects, progressive hypoglycemia did not occur during exercise, probably because cirrhotic subjects demonstrated increased plasma concentrations of fat-derived substrates and derived a greater percentage of total energy requirement from fat oxidation than did controls (P less than 0.05) and because forearm muscle glucose extraction was significantly lower in cirrhotic subjects compared with controls (0.5 vs.
 3.6%, respectively; P less than 0.05).
 During recovery, control subjects demonstrated significant increases in EGP rates compared with both the basal and exercise periods, but cirrhotic subjects showed no increase.
 In conclusion, cirrhotic subjects failed to demonstrate the normal increase in EGP during and after exercise.
 Significant hypoglycemia during exercise did not occur, possibly because of the increased availability of fat-derived fuels, which may spare the requirement for circulating glucose as an oxidative fuel for exercising muscle tissues.
