Endoscopic and histologic appearance of the gastric mucosa in patients with portal hypertension.
 To assess reliability of the endoscopic and histologic appearance of the gastric mucosa for diagnosing portal hypertension, 50 patients with portal hypertension and 1323 controls were studied.
 Endoscopic evidence of mild gastritis was seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension than in the control group (42% vs.
 13.1%, p less than 0.001).
 The mosaic sign was also seen more frequently in patients with portal hypertension compared with controls (14% vs.
 0.9%, p less than 0.001).
 However, the mosaic sign was found to be nonspecific, and the sensitivity for diagnosis of portal hypertension was only 14%.
 Biopsy specimens from the stomach of all patients with portal hypertension and 100 controls with a normal endoscopic appearance revealed mucosal vascular congestion in 72% of patients with portal hypertension compared with 59% of controls (NS).
 There was no correlation between endoscopic and histologic evidence of congestive gastropathy.
 Similarly, there was no correlation between the severity of mucosal vascular congestion and the degree of inflammatory changes observed in the biopsy specimens; both in the control (r = 0.1) and in patients with portal hypertension (r = 0.14).
 It is concluded that endoscopic and histologic features of the gastric mucosa in patients with portal hypertension are of low sensitivity and nonspecific and cannot be used to diagnose portal hypertension.
