Diffuse esophageal spasm. A rare motility disorder not characterized by high-amplitude contractions.
 Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) has frequently been described as a motility disorder characterized by simultaneous, high-amplitude contractions.
 We reviewed the results of esophageal manometry testing on a total of 1480 patients referred to our lab over 36 months.
 Lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure was determined by a mean of four station pull-through.
 Esophageal body motility was assessed following 10 wet swallows.
 In our lab a diagnosis of DES is made when greater than 10% but less than 100% of contractions are simultaneous.
 Manometric findings of DES were rare, with an overall prevalence of 4% (56/1480).
 Of the 56 patients with a manometric diagnosis of DES, high-amplitude (mean greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg) peristaltic contractions were found in only two (4%).
 No simultaneous contractions with amplitude greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg were seen.
 Pressures of simultaneous contractions were consistently lower than peristaltic contractions.
 A hypertensive LES pressure (greater than or equal to 45 mm Hg) was present in 5/56 DES patients (9%).
 Poor LES relaxation was found in 7/56 DES patients (13%).
 We conclude that DES is a rare manometric finding, regardless of the reason for referral, and that the occurrence of high-amplitude contractions in DES is equally rare.
