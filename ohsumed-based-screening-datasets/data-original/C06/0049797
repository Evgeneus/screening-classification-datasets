The roles of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in the management of pyelocaliceal diverticula.
 Various combinations of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) and percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were used in the treatment of 40 stone-containing caliceal diverticula in 39 patients (16 men and 23 women).
 Only 1 of 26 patients (4%) treated with ESWL as a single modality became stone-free, although 9 (36%) became asymptomatic.
 Ten patients undergoing ESWL primarily eventually required percutaneous nephrostolithotomy due to persistence of symptoms and all became stone-free.
 A total of 14 patients underwent a percutaneous approach as a single modality, and the diverticula in 13 of these patients became stone-free, although 2 patients did have residual parenchymal fragments.
 Therefore, 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) became completely free of stones using the percutaneous approach.
 All patients managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy became free of symptoms.
 The complex nature of access during percutaneous nephrostolithotomy favors a 1-stage approach with direct puncture into the stone-containing diverticulum.
 Simultaneous fulguration of the diverticulum at percutaneous nephrostolithotomy is favored, since all 17 patients in whom this technique was used had complete obliteration of the diverticulum on followup contrast studies.
 These data suggest that caliceal diverticula should be managed with percutaneous nephrostolithotomy, since ESWL monotherapy is unlikely to produce a stone-free or symptom-free status.
