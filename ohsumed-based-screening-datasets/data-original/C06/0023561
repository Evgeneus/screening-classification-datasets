Endoscopic nasobiliary catheter drainage in biliary and pancreatic disease.
 Nasobiliary catheter drainage was first introduced a decade ago.
 It provides drainage of the biliary system and facilitates interventional procedures of the biliary and pancreatic system, both for therapy and research purposes.
 The present review addresses the designs of nasobiliary catheters, the technique of insertion, and indications for drainage, with special emphasis on the management of bile duct stones and associated complications.
 Its potential application in biliary research is discussed further.
 Certain caveats in the performance of nasobiliary drainage are also included.
 All of these emphasize the need for this technique to be included in therapeutic endoscopy training.
