Should elective endoscopic sphincterotomy replace cholecystectomy for the treatment of high-risk patients with gallstone pancreatitis? [editorial]
 Since the introduction of endoscopic sphincterotomy approximately 15 years ago, the indications for this procedure have expanded.
 Currently endoscopic sphincterotomy is the procedure of choice for management of retained common bile duct stones following cholecystectomy.
 It is also being used more frequently for choledocholithiasis with an intact gallbladder in high-risk patients and in some patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis.
 In patients recovering from an episode of gallstone pancreatitis, standard practice has been subsequent cholecystectomy with possible exploration of the common bile duct.
 To avoid surgery in high-risk patients, we propose that an elective endoscopic sphincterotomy may be a reasonable therapeutic option regardless of whether common bile duct stones are present at the time of ERCP.
 A prospective trial is needed to examine this issue since to date there is no literature on endoscopic sphincterotomy in the absence of choledocholithiasis for gallstone pancreatitis in patients with intact gallbladders.
