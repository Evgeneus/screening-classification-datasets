Sucralfate retention enemas in solitary rectal ulcer.
 The conservative treatment of solitary rectal ulcer is generally unsatisfactory.
 Six patients, aged 27-54 years, with recurrent solitary rectal ulcer were treated with topical administration of sucralfate in a daily dose of 2 g twice a day for 6 weeks.
 Four patients experienced complete relief of symptoms and the remaining two patients had marked improvement.
 Although macroscopic healing of the ulcer was apparent in all, histologic improvement was not appreciable.
 Five of the six patients remain in remission during a follow-up period of 4-14 months (mean, 8 +/- 1.5 months).
 Recurrence was observed in one patient at 5 months, which satisfactorily resolved with sucralfate enemas.
 From these preliminary observations we infer that solitary rectal ulcer can be effectively treated with topical application of sucralfate.
