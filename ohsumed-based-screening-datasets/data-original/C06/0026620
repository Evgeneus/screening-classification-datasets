Monocyte zinc and in vitro prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured peripheral blood monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease.
 This study investigated the relationship between zinc status and prostaglandin E2 and interleukin-1 beta production by cultured monocytes in patients with Crohn's disease.
 Monocyte zinc was significantly decreased in both 12 inpatients and 22 outpatients compared with controls (P less than 0.001) but lymphocyte and polymorphonuclear cell zinc were normal.
 When cultured monocytes from 10 outpatients with Crohn's disease were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide, prostaglandin E2 production increased markedly, coupled with a fall in monocyte zinc.
 In matched controls, prostaglandin E2 production was significantly less and monocyte zinc remained stable.
 No difference in interleukin-1 release was noted between patients and controls.
 The addition of prednisolone to cell cultures suppressed prostaglandin E2, interleukin-1 synthesis, and monocyte zinc did not change.
 Zinc chloride augmented prostaglandin E2 production in patients, but not controls, and interleukin-1 remained stable.
 These results demonstrate a link between low monocyte zinc concentration and excessive prostaglandin production in patients with Crohn's disease.
