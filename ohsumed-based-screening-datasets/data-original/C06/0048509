Gastric ulcer healing: a comparison of enprostil versus ranitidine.
 Enprostil is a synthetic prostaglandin E2 analogue with gastric antisecretory and mucosal protective properties.
 We compared the effects of enprostil and ranitidine on the healing of gastric ulcers and the subsequent relapse rates over 6 months.
 Patients (N = 156) were recruited for a double-blind study from 12 centers in Europe; 71 were randomly assigned to oral treatment with 35 micrograms enprostil twice daily and 85 to 150 mg ranitidine twice daily for up to 8 weeks.
 Both groups were of similar demography; their healing rates were also similar.
 Cumulative intent-to-treat healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 48%, ranitidine 41%: at 6 weeks enprostil 65%, ranitidine 68%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 72%, ranitidine 80%.
 Of those patients who met all protocol criteria and completed treatment, and were endoscoped at the prescribed times, healing rates were at 4 weeks enprostil 55%, ranitidine 54%, at 6 weeks enprostil 75%, ranitidine 84%; and at 8 weeks enprostil 80%, ranitidine 90%.
 Relief of pain was rapid and similar in both groups.
 The incidence of adverse events was low and similar in the two groups.
 The treatment-free relapse rate at 6 months was enprostil 64%, ranitidine 49%; the median times to relapse were 169 and 203 days, respectively.
 Enprostil and ranitidine appear to be equally effective in healing gastric ulcers.
