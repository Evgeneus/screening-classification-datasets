Helicobacter pylori in children with peptic ulcer and their families.
 Little is known about the source and spread of Helicobacter pylori, but transmission from infected family contacts has been suggested.
 We have therefore investigated 15 children with peptic ulcer and their first-degree relatives for H.
 pylori.
 Serum anti-H.
 pylori IgG, pepsinogen I, and gastrin levels were measured.
 Endoscopy was carried out on the children and relatives, and biopsies were taken from the gastric antrum for histology, microbiology, and urease testing.
 Six of 11 children with duodenal ulcer (55%) and two of four children with gastric ulcer (50%) were positive for H.
 pylori.
 Fourteen of 16 parents (87%) and eight of 13 siblings (61%) of H.
 pylori-positive children with peptic ulcer were also infected compared with eight of 14 parents (57%) and none of four siblings of H.
 pylori-negative children with peptic ulcer (P less than 0.10, greater than 0.05, and NS, respectively).
 The children with H.
 pylori-negative peptic ulcer and negative siblings combined were younger than positive children with peptic ulcer and positive siblings (P less than 0.001).
 The reliability of serum anti-H.
 pylori IgG level as a screening test for infection was confirmed.
 These findings call into question a pathogenetic role for H.
 pylori in some childhood peptic ulceration, but do suggest that person-to-person spread of infection occurs.
