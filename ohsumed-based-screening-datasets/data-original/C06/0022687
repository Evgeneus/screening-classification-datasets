Experimental obliterative cholangitis. A model for the study of biliary atresia.
 Noninfectious obliterative cholangitis results from biliary tract inflammation in clinical conditions such as biliary atresia and sclerosing cholangitis.
 The purpose of this study was to develop an animal model of noninfectious biliary tract inflammation and fibrosis.
 An implantable osmotic pump was connected to a catheter placed into the gallbladder of hamsters.
 Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was infused into the biliary tract for periods of 6 hours to 28 days.
 After 7 days the animals developed neutrophil infiltration, cellular necrosis, and edema of the biliary ducts.
 After 14 days, the animals demonstrated intrahepatic cholestasis with bile duct fibrosis and acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltration.
 By 28 days pronounced portal fibrosis was present, some of which created an early bridging cirrhosis pattern.
 In addition there was evidence of neocholangiogenesis.
 We conclude that long-term PMA infusion into the biliary tract generates an inflammatory response characterized by obliterative cholangitis and fibrosis, sharing many of the histologic features of human biliary atresia.
 This model may provide a relatively simple technique for investigating the process of nonpyogenic biliary tract inflammation.
