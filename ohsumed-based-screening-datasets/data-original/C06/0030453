Hepatitis B virus DNA in cervicovaginal cells.
 Hepatitis B virus DNA sequences were detected in seven (12.1%) of 58 cervicovaginal cell specimens that were obtained from pregnant women by polymerase DNA amplification assay.
 The presence of hepatitis B virus DNA in these cells raises the possibility that infected cervicovaginal cells may be a source through which hepatitis B virus can be transmitted from infected mothers to their newborns and between heterosexual partners.
