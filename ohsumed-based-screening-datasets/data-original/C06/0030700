Structural heterogeneity of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin shown by immunoblot analysis in patients with Crohn's disease.
 Faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin was determined in 34 patients with Crohn's disease and in 19 healthy subjects by immune nephelometry.
 A structural analysis of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin was carried out using immunoblot analysis under non-reducing conditions.
 Native serum alpha 1 antitrypsin migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 45 kDa.
 Proteolytic alpha 1 antitrypsin fragments (5-42 kDa) were specifically immunostained in 13/19 and 22/34 stool samples from control subjects and from patients with Crohn's disease respectively.
 There was a weak correlation (r = 0.47; p less than 0.02) between the molecular weight of fragmented alpha 1 antitrypsin and the faecal concentration in both groups, indicating that alpha 1 antitrypsin inhibits its own proteolysis by intestinal proteases in a dose dependent way.
 The incidence of polymeric forms (greater than 45 kDa) was similar in patients (10/34) and control subjects (5/19).
 In only one case in each group was the native serum form of alpha 1 antitrypsin found in faeces.
 We conclude that faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin differs structurally from the native serum form.
 Immunochemical measurements, therefore, reflect rather than represent faecal concentrations of alpha 1 antitrypsin.
 The controversial results in published reports may be partly explained by these findings.
 The molecular heterogeneity of faecal alpha 1 antitrypsin is not specifically associated with Crohn's disease.
