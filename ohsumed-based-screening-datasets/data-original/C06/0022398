Treatment of severe peptic esophageal stricture with Roux-en-Y partial gastrectomy, vagotomy, and endoscopic dilation. A follow-up study 
 Eleven patients with dysphagia caused by severe esophageal stricture (length 2 to 10 cm) resulting from reflux esophagitis were treated with fibroendoscopic dilation (Eder-Puestow) and Roux-en-Y partial gastrectomy with vagotomy during 10 years (1979 to 1988).
 There was no operative mortality, but complications developed in three patients: One patient had a mediastinal abscess demanding thoracotomy as a result of esophageal perforation after dilatation; one had postoperative pneumonia; and one patient had ileus.
 After a mean follow-up of 4 years (range 1 to 10 years) esophagitis healed in all cases, as judged by endoscopy.
 Eight patients were asymptomatic, but three had slight transient dysphagia.
 Postoperatively one to eight dilations (average three to four) were needed to relieve dysphagia in the first postoperative year, but later the stricture healed in every case.
 Postoperative pH measurement was performed in six latest patients and showed complete absence of reflux in all cases.
 It is concluded that Roux-en-Y partial gastrectomy with vagotomy and endoscopic dilation is an effective, simple, and safe procedure in the management of severe peptic esophageal (acid or alkaline esophagitis) stricture.
 However, occasional postoperative dilations at the outpatient clinic are often needed in severe cases in the first postoperative year.
