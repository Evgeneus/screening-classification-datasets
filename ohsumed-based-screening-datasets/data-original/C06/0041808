Cholecystokinin cholescintigraphy: detection of abnormal gallbladder motor function in patients with chronic acalculous gallbladder disease.
 CCK cholescintigrams were performed in 374 patients with recurrent postprandial right upper quadrant pain, biliary colic, and a normal gallbladder sonogram and/or cholecystogram.
 The results of these examinations were correlated with the patients' final medical/surgical diagnoses.
 Twenty-seven patients recruited as control volunteers without objective clinical evidence of biliary disease also underwent CCK cholescintigraphy to determine if the degree of gallbladder contraction post-CCK differs in symptomatic versus asymptomatic subjects.
 Decreased gallbladder motor function was identified (maximal gallbladder ejection fraction response to CCK less than 35%) in 94% of patients with histopathologically confirmed chronic acalculous cholecystitis or the cystic duct syndrome and in 88% of patients clinically believed to have chronic acalculous biliary disease.
 Decreased gallbladder motor function does not distinguish symptomatic from asymptomatic gallbladder disease.
