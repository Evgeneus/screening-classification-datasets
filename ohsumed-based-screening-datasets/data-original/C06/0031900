Alcoholic cirrhosis and osteoporosis in men: a light and scanning electron microscopy study.
 Subjects with chronic alcoholism are associated with a higher prevalence of bone fractures, compared with age-matched controls.
 However, the pathogenesis of alcoholic osteopathy remains poorly understood.
 In this study, the bone cells activities and the bone matrix were studied using different techniques such as bone morphometry, scanning electron microscopy and computer reconstruction.
 Male patients (N = 20), aged 59.1 +/- 10.1 years, presenting a chronic decompensated alcoholic cirrhosis, were admitted into this study.
 A histomorphometric analysis of a transiliac bone biopsy was done after a double tetracycline labeling of the bone.
 A scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study was performed on eight out of the 20 patients on an additional biopsy.
 The bone mass was significantly decreased in cirrhotic patients.
 A marked defect in the osteoblastic function was observed with reduced osteoid parameters, lower mean wall thickness, and slower bone formation rate leading to a thinning of bone trabeculae.
 Conversely, trabecular resorption surfaces were markedly increased.
 SEM examination of bone biopsies was also consistent with delayed and impaired osteoblastic activity leading to extended and scalloped resorption surfaces covered by unusually thin layers of calcified collagen fibers.
 The reduced osteoblastic activity associated with normal osteoclastic function appears to play a major role in the pathogenesis of alcoholic osteoporosis leading to decreased bone mass with thinner trabeculae.
