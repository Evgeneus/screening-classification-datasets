Cholecystectomy as a risk factor for colorectal adenomatous polyps and carcinoma.
 Multiple studies have suggested a possible relationship between prior cholecystectomy and the occurrence of subsequent colorectal carcinoma.
 This relationship has been particularly noticed among female patients and for right-sided lesions of the colon.
 In the current study, the authors undertook a case-control study among patients who underwent colonoscopy in three private practices in New York City between April 1986 and March 1988.
 Over this period, 302 adenomatous polyp cases, 106 colon cancer cases, and 507 controls were interviewed regarding their prior history of cholecystectomy.
 Overall, no significant association was observed between cholecystectomy and either colorectal adenomatous polyps or cancer.
 Cholecystectomy does not appear to be a significant risk factor for colorectal neoplasia.
