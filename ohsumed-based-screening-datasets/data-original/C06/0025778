Hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection mimicking metastatic cancer to the liver.
 A cholestatic syndrome caused by sclerosing cholangitis and papillary stenosis has been described in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and hepatobiliary cryptosporidiosis and cytomegalovirus infection.
 The case of a 41-year-old homosexual man with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, fever, and cholestasis is reported.
 A percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram showed that the extrahepatic and right-sided intrahepatic ducts were normal.
 Computerized tomography of the abdomen showed multiple hypodense lesions in the liver.
 Guided needle biopsies of several of these lesions showed severe confluent necrotizing pericholangitis with cytomegalovirus-infected cells.
 Numerous cryptosporidia were seen attached to biliary epithelium.
 The unique histopathologic and radiographic features of this case should be added to the spectrum of hepatobiliary manifestations of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
