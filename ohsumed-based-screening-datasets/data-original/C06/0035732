Aztreonam plus clindamycin versus tobramycin plus clindamycin in the treatment of intraabdominal infections.
 In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial, aztreonam and tobramycin were compared for efficacy and safety in the treatment of intraabdominal infections.
 Patients were randomly assigned to one of the drug regimens, and all but two patients were treated concomitantly with clindamycin.
 Efficacy of treatment could not be evaluated for 107 of the 316 patients enrolled in the study.
 Among the 209 patients who could be evaluated (104 treated with aztreonam and 105 with tobramycin), microbiologic cure was achieved in 93% and 86%, respectively, and a favorable clinical response was noted in 85% of the patients in both groups.
 The frequency of adverse drug reactions in the two groups was similar.
 In this study, the efficacy and safety profiles of aztreonam plus clindamycin were comparable to those of tobramycin plus clindamycin.
