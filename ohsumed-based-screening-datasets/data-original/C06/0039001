Successful shock-wave lithotripsy of bile duct stones using ultrasound guidance.
 Eighteen patients with 41 gallstones in the common bile duct, common hepatic, cystic, and intrahepatic ducts underwent shock-wave lithotripsy using the electrohydraulic Sonolith 3000 lithotripter.
 Lithotripsy was performed using ultrasound guidance alone under intravenous analgesia/sedation.
 All patients previously had failed stone extraction via retrograde endoscopy, T-tube, or cholecystostomy.
 Lithotripsy was performed according to an FDA-approved protocol allowing a maximum of two 2500 shock-wave treatments at a 48 hr interval.
 Following the final lithotripsy or cholangiographic evidence of stone fragmentation, residual fragments were removed via endoscopic or percutaneous route within 24-72 hr.
 Ultrasound localization of gallstones was aided by continuous infusion of the common bile duct with saline solution.
 In 15 of the 18 patients, complete fragmentation of the stones was accomplished, two had minimal fragmentation, and one with an encysted stone had no fracturing.
 No serious complications were encountered.
 Overall nonsurgical stone-free success rate was 17 of 18 patients, indicating biliary duct stones can be successfully treated using an ultrasound-guided lithotripter and intravenous sedation alone.
