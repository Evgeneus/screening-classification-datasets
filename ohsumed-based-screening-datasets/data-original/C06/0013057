Successful prophylaxis for fungal peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: six years' experience [published erratum appears in Am J Kidney Dis 1991 Jun;17(6):726]
 Fungal peritonitis as a serious complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is often associated with severe morbidity, CAPD "drop-out" and, occasionally, death.
 Most episodes of fungal peritonitis occur during or after a period of antibiotic treatment of various bacterial infections, usually bacterial peritonitis.
 From April 1979 to December 1982 (period I), 10 episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 415 patient-months, ie, 10.5% of all peritonitis episodes recorded in our CAPD program.
 After the introduction of oral prophylaxis with 3 x 500,000 IU [corrected] nystatin during every course of antibiotic treatment, only four episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred during 2,102 patient-months, ie, 3.1% of all peritonitis episodes from January 1983 to March 1989 (period II).
 This difference between the first and second periods is significant (P less than 0.05).
 Moreover, none of the four patients who contracted fungal peritonitis in the second period received nystatin prophylaxis.
 Thus, the simple measure of oral prophylaxis using this nonabsorbable antifungal agent in every case of an antibiotic treatment largely eliminates the risk of fungal peritonitis in patients on CAPD.
