New technique of esophageal exclusion for chronic esophageal perforation.
 A new technique of near-total esophageal exclusion was used successfully in the treatment of 2 patients with chronic thoracic esophageal perforation and continuing sepsis.
 The most striking point of this technique is the use of cervical T-tube esophagostomy with the lower arm of the T tube circumfixed by chromic catgut tie to prevent swallowing of saliva.
 Whereas most of the previously reported procedures of cervical esophageal diversion require subsequent esophageal reconstruction, this technique is simple and effective and does not require a second operation.
