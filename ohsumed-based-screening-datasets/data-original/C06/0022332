Vaccines and milk immunoglobulin concentrates for prevention of infectious diarrhea.
 Considerable progress has been made in the last decade in developing vaccines against the most important enteric infections.
 Two new, widely licensed vaccines (oral Ty21a and parenteral Vi) are available against typhoid fever, and new attenuated Salmonella typhi strains are ready for testing.
 An engineered live orally administered cholera vaccine, CVD 103-HgR, is undergoing clinical trials for safety, immunogenicity, and transmissibility in children in areas where cholera is endemic.
 Multiple candidate vaccines against rotavirus, Shigella, and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli are in clinical trials.
 Newly acquired knowledge about pathogenesis and mucosal and cellular immunology, coupled with application of biotechnology, has already resulted in many candidates for vaccines, and more are expected to appear within the next few years.
