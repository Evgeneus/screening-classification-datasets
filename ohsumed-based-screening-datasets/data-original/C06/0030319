Laparoscopic trancystic choledocholithotomy as an adjunct to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is rapidly becoming the standard operation for symptomatic cholelithiasis.
 Initially, common duct stones presented a barrier to this treatment modality and are said to be unsuspected in 5-9 per cent of patients.
 A technique is described that removes common bile duct stones through the cystic duct with a flexible nephroureteroscope, thereby extending the range of laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
