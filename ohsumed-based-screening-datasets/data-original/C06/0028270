Management of lipoprotein-X accumulation in severe cholestasis by semi-selective LDL-apheresis.
 Liver disorders characterized by prolonged bile stasis are often associated with the accumulation of an abnormal lipoprotein, lipoprotein-X (LP-X), in plasma.
 LP-X is separated in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) density range, but lacks apolipoprotein B and does not interact with the LDL receptor; LP-X can cause hyperlipidemia, cutaneous xanthomas, and worsening of arterial disease.
 We report the case of a patient with severe cholestasis, markedly elevated plasma cholesterol levels (26.8 to 31.5 mmol/L), mainly due to a massive accumulation of LP-X in plasma, and diffuse xanthomas.
 To reduce the elevated cholesterol levels, the patient was given extracorporeal treatment aimed at removing atherogenic lipoprotein (LDL-apheresis).
 LDL-apheresis was performed at weekly or bi-weekly intervals, either by a semi-selective technique using filters with a defined pore diameter (double filtration, DF) or by a more selective technique using dextran-sulfate-cellulose (DSC) columns able to bind LDL.
 The semi-selective DF technique proved more effective than DSC, removing 48% of total cholesterol (compared to 30% with DSC), and lowering cholesterol levels to 11.1 mmol/L in 6 weeks.
 DF removed both LDL and LP-X from plasma, whereas DSC selectively decreased the LDL content.
 The reduction of plasma cholesterol levels was associated with a complete regression of the xanthomas, supporting DF apheresis as a first-choice treatment for patients with massive LP-X accumulation due to cholestasis.
