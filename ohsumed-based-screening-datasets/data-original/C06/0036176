Lack of effect of peritoneal endometriosis on fertility in the rabbit model.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the isolated influence of peritoneal endometrial implants on fertility in an adhesion-free rabbit model.
 STUDY DESIGN: Thirty-two rabbits with endometrium implants were used; 31 rabbits with fat implants served as controls.
 In these rabbits parameters of early embryonic development were investigated.
 RESULTS: No significant differences were noted in ovulation, ovum pick-up, fertilization, tubal transport, and embryonic and fetal development.
 CONCLUSION: In the adhesion-free rabbit model, peritoneal implants of endometriosis do not have an effect on fertility.
 This supports the contention that therapies focused toward the implants are unlikely to change the pregnancy outcomes.
 Alternatively, it may cast doubts onto the relevance of animal models in studying this disease.
