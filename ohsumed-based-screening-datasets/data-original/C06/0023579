Successful liver transplantation in a patient with a thrombosed portomesenteric system after multiple failed shunts.
 Combined portal and mesenteric vein thrombosis preventing restoration of adequate portal venous flow has been considered a contraindication to liver transplantation.
 We report a patient with failed splenorenal (SR), portocaval (PC), and mesocaval (MC) shunts, who despite the absence of any obvious means for supplying portal venous inflow to a hepatic graft, successfully underwent orthotopic liver transplantation.
 A method of reconstruction of the portal vein with the use of vein grafts anastomosed to a large splanchnic venous collateral is described.
 This technique can be used in selected patients in whom orthotopic liver transplantation might otherwise be considered technically impossible.
