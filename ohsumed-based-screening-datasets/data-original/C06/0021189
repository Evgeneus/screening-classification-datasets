Utility of upper endoscopy in the evaluation of noncardiac chest pain.
 The diagnostic yield of esophagogastroduodenoscopy, esophageal manometry, and Bernstein testing was assessed in 100 consecutive patients being evaluated for non-cardiac chest pain.
 Manometric studies revealed the nutcracker esophagus in 21 patients; non-specific esophageal motility disorders in 19 patients; a hypertensive lower esophageal sphincter in 4 patients; diffuse esophageal spasm in 2 patients; and normal motility in 54 patients.
 Endoscopy was normal in 38 patients; but revealed grades II to IV esophagitis in 24 patients; gastritis and/or duodenitis in 18 patients; a sliding hiatal hernia without evidence of esophagitis in 14 patients; and gastric or duodenal ulcers in 6 patients.
 Twenty-five individuals were found to have normal manometric studies in combination with a negative Bernstein test.
 Among these 25 patients, however, 7 patients had esophagitis (grade II or higher); 6 patients had gastritis and/or duodenitis; five patients had a sliding hiatal hernia without esophagitis; 1 patient had peptic ulcer disease; and only 6 patients had a normal endoscopic exam.
 Our results indicate that endoscopy can identify a significant number of patients with acid-peptic disease who present with non-cardiac chest pain, that would not have been otherwise diagnosed by esophageal manometry or Bernstein testing alone or in combination.
