Assessment of the risk of bleeding from esophageal varices by continuous monitoring of portal pressure.
 Portal pressure was monitored by means of an indwelling hepatic vein balloon catheter in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and bleeding varices to determine the safety and feasibility of the technique and its value in predicting recurrence of bleeding.
 Forty patients were enrolled.
 Central venous access could not be achieved in 4 patients (10%).
 Hepatic vein catheterization was accomplished in the remaining 36 patients.
 Fourteen patients were either later found to have nonalcoholic liver disease or had already received treatment that excluded them from the protocol.
 The remaining 22 patients, who were treated with blood and fluid replacement, were monitored for up to 72 hours.
 Portal pressure was greater than 11 mm Hg in all patients (normal, less than 5 mm Hg) and did not change significantly over the 3 days of study.
 Portal pressure was significantly higher in the 9 patients who continued to bleed or rebled compared with the 13 patients who remained stable.
 The lowest pressure associated with continued bleeding or rebleeding was 16 mm Hg.
 Continuous monitoring of portal pressure in patients with bleeding esophageal varices due to alcoholic cirrhosis is safe and feasible and permits rapid stratification of the risk of continued bleeding or early rebleeding.
