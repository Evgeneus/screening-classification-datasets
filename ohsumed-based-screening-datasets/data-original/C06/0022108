Pharmacokinetics and protein binding of cefpiramide in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.
 The pharmacokinetics of cefpiramide, a new cephalosporin, were investigated after a single 1 gm intravenous injection in 11 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and compared with those of 11 healthy subjects.
 In patients with cirrhosis the plasma elimination half-life was three times longer than that in normal subjects.
 The total plasma clearance was decreased significantly (p less than 0.001): 12.3 +/- 6.5 ml/min in patients and 25.6 +/- 4.6 ml/min in healthy volunteers, respectively.
 The urinary excretion of unchanged drug (percent of intravenous dose) for patients (69.8% +/- 29.9%) was statistically higher (p less than 0.01) than that for subjects (16.2% +/- 3.9%).
 The renal elimination became increasingly important with hepatic impairment.
 Protein binding of cefpiramide was reduced significantly in the group with cirrhosis.
 The average unbound fraction was 10.4% +/- 9.5% in patients with cirrhosis and 1.9% +/- 0.3% in normal subjects (p less than 0.01).
 Because the rate of elimination from plasma in patients is slower, the dosage regimen of cefpiramide would probably be modified in cirrhosis.
