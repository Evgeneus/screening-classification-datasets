Self-expandable stainless steel endoprostheses for treatment of malignant bile duct obstruction.
 The Wallstent biliary endoprosthesis is a mesh of stainless steel that is delivered percutaneously over a 7-French catheter but expands to achieve a 1-cm lumen when released across a bile-duct stricture.
 The small transhepatic track required makes insertion easier, less painful, and probably safer when compared with plastic stents, and the large internal lumen reduces the rate of occlusion by encrusted bile.
 Wallstent endoprostheses were inserted under local anesthesia in 41 consecutive patients with malignant obstructive jaundice.
 Biliary drainage was considered the treatment of choice in all of these patients.
 The diagnosis was based on biopsy results in 32 patients and on radiologic appearances in nine.
 The patients were followed up in outpatient clinics for 16 months and had repeated radiologic examinations only if they had symptoms suggesting stent occlusion.
 No cases of hemobilia due to damaged hepatic vessels occurred.
 Two patients had septicemia treated with antibiotics.
 Three patients had recurrent jaundice due to growth of tumor below or above the stents.
 Endoprosthesis migration was not seen.
 No cases of stent occlusion due to encrustation of bile occurred.
 The median survival of patients was 105 days (range, 10-545 days).
 Our experience shows that Wallstent endoprostheses can be inserted with little discomfort for the patient and with relatively few complications.
 They provide good palliation in patients with malignant obstructive jaundice.
