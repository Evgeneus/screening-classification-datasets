Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: 111 consecutive cases.
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy removes the gallbladder through three or four puncture wounds in the abdominal wall.
 The technique reduces the recuperative time to full activity, from as long as 4 wk to as little as 3 days, compared with conventional cholecystectomy.
 We herein present our initial experience with this procedure.
 In this series of 111 laparoscopic cholecystectomies, there were no mortalities and only one morbidity.
 Thirty-nine patients (35%) had a history of prior abdominal surgery.
 Fourteen underwent laparoscopic lysis of adhesions.
 Intraoperative cholangiograms were performed in 24 patients (21%), demonstrating choledocholithiasis in three.
 Two of the three patients underwent postoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP); in the other, laparoscopic common bile duct exploration was performed.
 In each case, the common bile duct (CBD) was completely cleared of stones.
 Incidental laparoscopic appendectomy was also performed in three patients.
 The average time for completion of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in cases of chronic cholecystitis was 40 min.
 If the gallbladder was acutely inflamed, the procedure took a mean of 126 min.
 This series had a higher percentage of patients (19%) with acute cholecystitis then previously reported; therefore, the 2% conversion rate in this series emphasizes the broad applicability of the technique.
 The average length of stay in the hospital was 1.4 days, and patients returned to work in about 7 days.
