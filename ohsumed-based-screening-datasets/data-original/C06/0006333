Endoscopic management of chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach.
 Endoscopic correction of the chronic organoaxial volvulus of the stomach was attempted in seven cases of primary and three cases of secondary volvulus.
 Endoscopic correction was successful in six cases of primary volvulus and one case of volvulus secondary to duodenal carcinoma.
 This paper describes the details of the technique of endoscopic correction of gastric volvulus, and documentation of correction of the volvulus by barium meal study with a follow-up of 5-26 months.
