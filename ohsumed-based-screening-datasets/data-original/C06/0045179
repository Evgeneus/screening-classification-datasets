Simple examination techniques to aid in the diagnosis of urethral diverticulum.
 Patients with urethral diverticula classically present with dyspareunia, dribbling of urine, chronic dysuria, and/or a tender suburethral mass.
 Physical examination, urethroscopy, positive pressure urethrography, and the urethral pressure profile may not confirm the suspected diagnosis.
 Three simple diagnostic maneuvers are presented to aid in confirming the diagnosis before surgical exploration.
