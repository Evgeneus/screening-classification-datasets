Total parenteral nutrition-induced steatosis: reversal by parenteral lipid infusion.
 Prolonged use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) may be associated with hepatic complications, primarily steatosis and cholestasis.
 A case is reported of an 18-year-old woman with chronic idiopathic intestinal pseudo-obstruction syndrome who was on prolonged home parenteral nutrition without lipid supplementation and developed steatosis.
 This finding was reversed by addition of lipid emulsion, at a dose of 0.5 g/kg/day, to the parenteral nutrition solution.
 The lack of lipid supplementation as a possible cause of steatosis, as well as other mechanisms of liver steatosis associated with TPN, are discussed.
