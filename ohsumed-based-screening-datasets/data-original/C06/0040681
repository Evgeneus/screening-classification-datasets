Pellagra in a patient with an eating disorder.
 A case of pellagra is described that occurred in a patient with an eating disorder and who presented with marked photosensitivity and diarrhoea.
 We found urinary 5-hydroxy-indole-acetic acid to be low and suggest that this may be a useful screening test.
 To our knowledge this is only the second reported case of pellagra associated with an eating disorder.
