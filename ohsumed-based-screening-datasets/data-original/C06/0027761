Treatment of refractory peptic ulcer with omeprazole or continued H2 receptor antagonists: a controlled clinical trial.
 We tested the hypothesis that the gastric H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor, omeprazole, because of its different mode of action and pronounced inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion, may be more effective in peptic ulcer that is refractory to histamine H2 receptor antagonist treatment than continuing the same therapy.
 Altogether 107 patients (duodenal ulcer, n = 88; prepyloric ulcer, n = 14; gastric ulcer, n = 3; mixed sites, n = 2) with refractory peptic ulcer - that is ulcer unhealed after at least two months' treatment with cimetidine 0.8 g or 1 g daily or with ranitidine 0.3 g daily - were randomly allocated to receive either omeprazole 40 mg daily (n = 54) or to continue treatment with the same H2 receptor antagonist and at the same dose (n = 53) for up to eight weeks.
 The patients in the two treatment groups were well matched demographically.
 Healing by 'intent to treat' analysis was as follows: at four weeks, omeprazole 46 of 54 (85%), H2 receptor antagonist 18 of 53 (34%) (p less than 0.0001); and at eight weeks, 52 of 54 (96%) and 30 of 53 (57%) respectively (p less than 0.0001).
 One patient was lost to follow up but of the 22 patients whose ulcers were shown to be unhealed at endoscopy after receiving continued H2 receptor antagonist treatment, 21 healed in four to eight weeks when changed to omeprazole.
