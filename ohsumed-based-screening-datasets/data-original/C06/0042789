Special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations in elderly patients with upper gastrointestinal disease.
 Special diagnostic and therapeutic considerations apply to older patients with upper gastrointestinal disease.
 Age-related anatomical and physiologic changes occur in the major organ systems, affecting functions as diverse as swallowing and hepatic and renal clearance of therapeutic drugs.
 Because of these factors, and because older patients are more likely to be receiving multiple drugs for concomitant illness, they are more prone to drug-drug interactions and to medication-induced injury of the esophagus and stomach.
 In addition, several gastrointestinal disorders, notably gastroesophageal reflux and peptic ulcer disease, are commonly seen in the elderly.
 This report reviews those age-related system changes that affect the gastrointestinal tract, and also reviews the esophageal and gastric disorders that are common and/or particularly problematic in the elderly.
 Diagnostic techniques to evaluate gastrointestinal disease in older patients and approaches to therapy for this population are described as well.
