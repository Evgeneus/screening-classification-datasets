Development of multiple necrotizing enteritis induced by a tumor necrosis factor-like cytokine from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peritoneal macrophages in rats.
 We report the development of an animal model of multiple necrotizing enteritis (MNE) in rats.
 When rats were injected directly with a culture supernatant of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rat peritoneal macrophages into the abdominal aorta, the overt pathologic lesions of MNE developed within 30 minutes after injection.
 The rats showed an elevated level of blood fibrinogen degradation product content even 30 minutes after injection.
 Furthermore the rats that were pretreated intravenously with heparin sulfate did not develop MNE, indicating the acute disturbances of blood microcirculation in the intestine.
 Multiple necrotizing enteritis was developed also by the injection with recombinant tumor necrosis factor (rTNF) but rarely was observed with even a high dose of recombinant interleukin-1 (rIL-1) or platelet-activating factor (PAF).
 The supernatant was cytotoxic in vitro to TNF-susceptible LM and many other cells but was less cytotoxic to the TNF-resistant LR line.
 Partial purification of the supernatant suggested that the supernatant contained a cytokine that has biochemical features of TNF.
 Furthermore polyclonal anti-TNF antibody could inhibit not only the cytotoxicity in vitro but also MNE development in vivo by this factor.
 These data strongly indicate that MNE possibly could be caused by a TNF-like cytokine produced by macrophages that are stimulated by the endotoxin.
