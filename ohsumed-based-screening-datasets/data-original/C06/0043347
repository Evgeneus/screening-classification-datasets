Decreased serum growth hormone-binding protein in patients with liver cirrhosis.
 The recently characterized GH-binding protein (GH-BP) has an amino acid sequence identical to the extracellular domain of the GH receptor.
 Serum GH-BP reflects the amount of GH receptors, and the liver seems to be their main source.
 To evaluate the effect of liver disease on GH-BP, 52 patients with liver cirrhosis were studied.
 Serum GH-BP was measured by a binding assay with dextran-coated charcoal separation.
 Levels of GH-BP were correlated against the clinical state, assessed by Pugh's score.
 The GH-BP of 31 Pugh's class A patients was 9.7 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum, and that of 21 Pugh's class B and C patients was 7.2 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum compared to 11.3 +/- 0.5%/50 microL serum in age-matched controls.
 GH-BP correlated negatively with Pugh's score and serum bilirubin, and positively with serum albumin.
 It did not correlate with serum liver enzymes or serum insulin-like growth factor-I.
 Scatchard analysis of GH binding to the GH-BP revealed similar binding affinities in Pugh's A, B, and C patients and controls.
 The binding capacity in cirrhosis was significantly lower than that in controls.
 We conclude that serum GH-BP is controlled mainly by the liver and can provide an additional measure of disease severity in liver cirrhosis.
