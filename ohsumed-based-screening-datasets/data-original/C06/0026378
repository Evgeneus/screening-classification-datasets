Cystic duct cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 At present, there is no consensus regarding the routine use of intraoperative cholangiography during cholecystectomy.
 We describe a reliable technique for performing cystic duct cholangiography during laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 Using this technique, we were able to cannulate the cystic duct in 97% of patients, completely visualize the biliary tree and duodenum in 93% of patients, and identify unsuspected choledocholithiasis in 3% of patients.
 Treatment options for the management of choledocholithiasis demonstrated by cholangiograms during laparoscopic cholecystectomy include conversion to an open cholecystectomy and common duct exploration, or endoscopic sphincterotomy and common duct stone extraction following laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
