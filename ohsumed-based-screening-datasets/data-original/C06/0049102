Ventricular tachycardia with congenital ventricular diverticulum.
 A 24-year-old man presented with symptomatic, recurrent, sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT).
 He was found to have a basal inferior left ventricular diverticulum.
 His sustained VT was reproduced by programmed electrical stimulation and was unresponsive to procainamide, tocainide, propafenone, and flecainide.
 Endocardial mapping followed by resection and cryoablative surgery was performed.
 The patient had only one recurrence after 18 months, with subsequent control with procainamide for over 14 months.
