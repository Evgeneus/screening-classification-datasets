Superiority of granisetron to dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in the prevention of chemotherapy-induced emesis.
 Trials of selective 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonists have shown excellent antiemetic activity for chemotherapy containing cisplatin when compared with high-dose metoclopramide.
 There is little information about the efficacy of these new agents for chemotherapy other than for high-dose cisplatin.
 We performed a double-blind, randomized trial comparing a single dose of the 5-hydroxytryptamine3 receptor antagonist granisetron (BRL 43694A) as a single intravenous dose with dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in 152 patients receiving their first course of moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (mainly doxorubicin- and cyclophosphamide-containing combinations).
 During the first 24 hours, there was a statistically significant advantage for the granisetron group in terms of the prevention of both nausea and emesis.
 There was no difference in the frequency of reported adverse events.
 We conclude that granisetron is more effective than dexamethasone plus prochlorperazine in patients who are receiving moderately emetogenic cytotoxic agents.
