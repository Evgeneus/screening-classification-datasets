Cytomegalovirus appendicitis in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
 We report a homosexual patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and histopathologic evidence for cytomegalovirus (CMV) appendicitis in a patient with no prior history of CMV infection.
 The patient presented with right lower quadrant pain and intermittent fevers.
 The diagnosis of appendicitis was difficult to make in this patient because of the presumptive diagnosis of tuberculosis ileitis and the frequent presentation of abdominal pain with fever in AIDS patients.
 Although CMV colitis is frequently seen in AIDS patients, the prevalence of CMV appendicitis is exceedingly rare.
 The problems related to making a diagnosis of CMV appendicitis and the therapeutic management of CMV infections are reviewed.
