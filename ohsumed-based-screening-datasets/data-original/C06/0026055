Concomitant medical disease and headache.
 The treatment of headache disorders in patients with concomitant medical illness constitutes one of the more challenging areas of headache therapy.
 As new agents are added to our pharmacologic armamentarium, it will become easier to tailor therapy to our patients.
 The physician who treats the headache patient with concomitant medical illness must be particularly aware of drug side effects and pharmacology in order to prevent a worsening of underlying medical conditions or an exacerbation of headaches.
