Swallowing disorders and nutritional support.
 Evaluation of nutritional needs in patients with swallowing disorders should include a global assessment.
 This includes a nutritional assessment, a determination of the metabolic state, and a separation of the causes of nutrient deficits due to the patient's underlying disease(s) from diminished nutrient intake related to the dysphagia.
 Techniques for intense nutritional support are surveyed, and the complications of each are discussed.
