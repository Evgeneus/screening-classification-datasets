Isolated ventral pancreatitis in a patient with pancreas divisum.
 A previously healthy 22-yr-old woman was found to have chronic pancreatitis restricted to the ventral pancreas in association with pancreas divisum.
 When conservative treatment failed, sphincteroplasty of both papillae was performed with good results.
 This well-documented case represents a clear exception to the commonly held concept that obstruction of the dorsal duct is the essential pathogenic factor in the development of pancreatitis associated with pancreas divisum.
 The importance of visualizing both the dorsal and ventral pancreatic ducts to direct therapy for patients with idiopathic pancreatitis is discussed.
 Theories of the pathogenesis of concomitant pancreatitis and pancreas divisum are reviewed.
