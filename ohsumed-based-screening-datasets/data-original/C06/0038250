Splenosis: an unusual cause of intraabdominal hemorrhage.
 A 31-year-old female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset of severe abdominal pain.
 She developed hypovolemic shock from an intra-abdominal bleed.
 At laparotomy she was found to be bleeding from two areas of splenosis on the uterine ligament.
 The patient had sustained a ruptured spleen 22 years prior and had no symptomatology from her areas of splenosis.
 A short review of splenosis is presented.
