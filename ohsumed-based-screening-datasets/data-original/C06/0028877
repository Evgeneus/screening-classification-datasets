Insulin and glucagon therapy of acute hepatic failure.
 When insulin and glucagon are administered to rats with severe liver injury, survival is enhanced with an attenuation of the liver injury compared to that of untreated controls.
 In rats with acute liver injury both hormones produce a rapid normalization of hepatic protein content following initiation of DNA synthesis.
 When rats receive both hormones after partial hepatectomy, the first burst of DNA synthesis reaches a maximum earlier than that seen in controls.
 Both hormones enhance the increment of hepatic putrescine essential for DNA synthesis through activation of ornithine decaroxylase and/or spermidine-N1-acetyltransferase.
 The enhancement of putrescine content by each hormone is additive.
 Putrescine supplementation promotes hepatic DNA synthesis after hepatectomy.
 Based on these data, we conclude that a combination of insulin and glucagon is effective in the therapy of acute hepatic failure in rats.
 The restoration of liver function as well as the stimulation of liver cell proliferation via putrescine production may contribute to this effect.
