Comparative evaluation of acid- and bile-induced damage to pedicled jejunal or colonic segments in the rat.
 The choice of the esophageal substitute after surgical resection for peptic stricture lies between the colon and jejunum.
 The current study was designed to compare long-term resistance of the colonic and jejunal mucosa to gastric or mixed duodenogastric secretions.
 The following preparations were performed in Wistar rats: transposition of a colonic or jejunal patch (a) to the gastric body, with or without truncal vagotomy, or (b) to the gastric antrum and proximal duodenum, with or without truncal vagotomy.
 Jejunal and colonic patches were removed 4, 8, and 12 months after surgery.
 The only damage to the transposed mucosae was the alteration of microvilli.
 The alteration was more severe in colonic than in jejunal patches and was prevented by truncal vagotomy.
 Long-term resistance of the transposed mucosae to the environmental challenge may depend on their adaptation potentiality, involving both specific and nonspecific mechanisms.
 Nonspecific mechanisms include the increased production of mucus and the gastric-like transformation of the superficial epithelial layer.
 Specific mechanisms include the reduction of the mucosal surface size for jejunal segments and the shifting in mucin secretion patterns for colonic segments.
