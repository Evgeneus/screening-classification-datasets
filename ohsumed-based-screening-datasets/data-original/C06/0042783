Clinical studies of sucralfate in reflux esophagitis. The European experience.
 Reflux esophagitis is encountered quite frequently in clinical practice.
 Symptoms can be mild, moderate, or severe and complications can occur, particularly if the disorder is untreated or undertreated.
 Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms, healing lesions, and preventing complications.
 Various pharmacologic options are available for treatment, including antacids, alginate/antacid compounds, acid-reducing agents, prokinetic drugs, and agents that protect the mucosa.
 This article reviews a number of clinical studies evaluating sucralfate in the treatment of reflux esophagitis.
 Almost all of the investigations were conducted in Europe and encompassed open-label studies, placebo-controlled trials, and comparative studies.
 From the studies discussed, it can be concluded that sucralfate not only has a place in the treatment of peptic ulcer disease, but is also effective in treating reflux esophagitis.
 Sucralfate is comparable to H2-receptor antagonists in symptom improvement and healing rates.
 In addition, the studies reviewed have shown sucralfate to be safe and well tolerated.
