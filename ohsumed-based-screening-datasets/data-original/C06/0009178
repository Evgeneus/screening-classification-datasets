Primary adrenal insufficiency: a new cause of reversible gastric stasis.
 Primary adrenal insufficiency is known to cause a wide spectrum of sometimes severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms; however, it has not previously been shown to be the cause of reversible gastric stasis.
 We have documented such a case in which the symptoms and physiologic abnormalities associated with gastric stasis were reversed by steroid replacement.
 A follow-up radionuclide gastric-emptying study after physiologic steroid replacement showed complete normalization of gastric emptying.
 Although gastric stasis has long been suspected of being present with primary adrenal insufficiency, this represents the first case in which it has been documented, and so should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with chronic nausea and vomiting.
