Does patient age or intestinal pathology influence the bacteria found in cases of necrotizing enterocolitis?
 To evaluate the relationship between bacterial colonization in neonatal peritonitis and patient age or intestinal pathology, we retrospectively reviewed peritoneal culture results from 96 infants having surgery for necrotizing enterocolitis.
 Microorganisms recovered mirrored those usually found as fecal flora within the neonatal intensive care unit.
 These reflect, in turn, the abnormal colonization intrinsic to care in the intensive care nursery.
 Analysis revealed no significant correlation between the disease and either age of the infant or intestinal site of disease.
