Nutritional therapy for infants with diarrhea.
 The appropriate choice of treatment for infants with diarrhea has long provoked debate.
 Growth of infants with diarrhea is adversely affected by associated diseases including anorexia, malabsorption, catabolic response to infection, and iatrogenic starvation.
 To prevent the negative effects of diarrhea on the nutrition of infants, continued feeding during the active and early convalescent phases has been recommended.
 Although this concept is not new, until recently it has been little used in the treatment of diarrhea.
 In this article we examine the current knowledge about, and trends in, feeding infants with diarrhea.
 We will discuss treatments for the well-nourished infant with acute diarrhea, the infant with prolonged diarrhea, and the malnourished infant.
 Information regarding the use of local staples will also be provided.
