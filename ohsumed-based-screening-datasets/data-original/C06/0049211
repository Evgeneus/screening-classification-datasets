Noninfectious colitis associated with short gut syndrome in infants.
 We describe noninfectious bloody diarrhea in 13 of 16 infants referred for management of short bowel syndrome and parenteral nutrition during a 33-month period.
 The condition was characterized by bloody, watery stools associated with carbohydrate malabsorption.
 Colitis occurred at a mean age of 4.2 months during periods of advancing enteral feedings of a hydrolyzed protein- or amino acid-containing formula.
 Sigmoidoscopy performed in nine patients revealed edema, patchy erythema, loss of normal vascular pattern, and mucosal friability without ulcerations or pseudomembranes.
 Colonic biopsy specimens demonstrated edema and mixed hypercellularity of the lamina propria, with prominent eosinophilia.
 Rectal bleeding ceased if formula feedings were decreased or withheld.
 Of multiple medications administered, sulfasalazine seemed to improve rectal bleeding most effectively in our patients and allowed for more rapid reintroduction of enteral feedings.
