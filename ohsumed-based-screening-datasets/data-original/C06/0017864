Biliary pain in postcholecystectomy patients without biliary obstruction. A prospective radionuclide study.
 Biliary pain without obvious biliary obstruction is common in postcholecystectomy patients.
 We studied 20 symptomatic patients with episodes of biliary-type pain after cholecystectomy (all having undergone endoscopic retrograde cholangiography), and in 18 asymptomatic postcholecystectomy controls.
 We performed quantitative hepatobiliary radionuclide analysis with dimethyl-imidodiacetic acid.
 From a series of 90 dynamic images at 1-min intervals using a gamma camera coupled to a computer, time-activity curves were produced in regions of interest in the liver, intrahepatic biliary tree, common duct, and heart, from which quantitative biliary excretion indexes were obtained.
 The results demonstrate a biliary kinetic dysfunction in patients with postcholecystectomy pain without morphological abnormalities.
