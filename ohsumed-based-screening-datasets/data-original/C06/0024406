Midgut volvulus in infants: diagnosis with US. Work in progress.
 The authors present findings from ultrasound (US) studies that can alert sonologists to the possibility of midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus in neonates and infants.
 A fluid-filled, distended duodenum seen at US examination in infants is a nonspecific sign of duodenal obstruction, as well as one of the signs of midgut malrotation.
 In addition, dilated, thick-walled bowel loops, mainly to the right of the spine, and peritoneal fluid were found at abdominal US examinations of three infants with midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus.
 In one infant with uncomplicated midgut malrotation, only signs of duodenal obstruction were present.
 The findings at US of duodenal obstruction associated with thickened bowel loops to the right of the spine and peritoneal fluid should lead the sonologist to suspect midgut malrotation complicated by volvulus, a potentially fatal condition, and an upper gastrointestinal series should then be performed to confirm the diagnosis.
