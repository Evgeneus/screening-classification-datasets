Does paramedic-base hospital contact result in beneficial deviations from standard prehospital protocols? 
 We reviewed written and audio records of paramedic-base hospital radio contact to determine whether care differed from that suggested in standard prehospital care protocols.
 Records of all 659 contacts for seizure, syncope, abdominal pain, or altered mental state during 1987 (28.4% of all contacts) were scored for the use of standard therapies (such as intravenous access, oxygen, naloxone hydrochloride) and unanticipated therapies (intubation, nitroglycerin).
 Cases that involved unanticipated treatments were reviewed to determine whether they could have been prospectively identified by simple clinical findings.
 Standard therapies were used in the majority of patients.
 Unanticipated therapies were administered to 13 patients, all of whom had abnormal vital signs, diaphoresis, respiratory distress, or a second prominent symptom.
 Data suggest that protocols could replace radio contact for most patients and that the few who might benefit from radio contact can be easily identified.
 A 90% reduction in radio contacts in Los Angeles county could save $3 million each year.
