Diarrheal deaths in the United States, 1979 through 1987. A special problem for the elderly.
 OBJECTIVE.--Diarrhea is an important cause of death among young children in both developing and developed countries, but little is known about diarrheal death among adults.
 In this study, we examined trends in diarrheal deaths among all age groups in the United States.
 DESIGN/SETTING/PARTICIPANTS.--We reviewed national mortality data complied by the National Center for Health Statistics, Hyattsville, Md, which consists of information from all death certificates filed in the United States for the period 1979 through 1987.
 A death for which diarrhea was listed as an immediate or underlying cause was considered a "diarrheal death" and included in the analysis.
 RESULTS.--We found that 28,538 persons died of diarrhea cited as either an immediate or the underlying cause of death during the 9-year period.
 A majority of diarrheal deaths occurred among the elderly (older than 74 years of age, 51%), followed by adults 55 to 74 years of age (27%), and young children (younger than 5 years of age, 11%).
 For the elderly, adjusted risk factors for dying of diarrhea included being white, female, and residing in a long-term care facility.
 Only the elderly and young children had clear, distinct winter peaks of diarrheal deaths, suggesting that the diarrhea may, in part, be infectious in origin.
 CONCLUSION.--For the elderly, more directed studies of those at risk, such as nursing home residents, are needed to determine if oral rehydration therapy, vaccines, or other preventive measures might benefit this population.
