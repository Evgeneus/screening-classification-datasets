Treatment of hepatolithiasis: improvement of result by a systematic approach.
 In previous decades the result of treatment of hepatolithiasis has been unsatisfactory.
 The incidence of residual stones after surgery might reach 77%.
 In the past 6 years we adopted a systematic approach comprised of accurate delineation of disease in the liver and biliary tract by direct cholangiography, ultrasonography, and computed tomography; tailored surgical treatment according to the extent of involvement of the liver and biliary tract; access to the intrahepatic ducts through the left duct or round ligament approach when there was difficulty with common bile duct exposure; routine use of flexible choledochoscopy; and application of electrohydraulic lithotripsy for large and impacted stones.
 Complete stone clearance was achieved in 114 of 127 patients (89.8%).
 Of those patients who had incomplete stone clearance, only six cases (4.7%) were related to technical failure of postoperative choledochoscopy.
 The incidence of stone recurrence was 15.8%, the lowest rate so far reported.
 It was the same regardless of whether a biliary drainage procedure had been performed, but the treatment for recurrent stones was facilitated by previous hepaticocutaneous jejunostomy.
 Overall the surgical treatment required for stone recurrence was of a lesser magnitude than that in the past.
