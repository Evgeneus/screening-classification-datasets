Gastroesophageal reflux disease. When antacids aren't enough.
 Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a very common condition that is usually manifested by heartburn or regurgitation.
 Reflux esophagitis, caused by mucosal exposure to the backflow of caustic gastric contents, is primarily a result of lower esophageal sphincter dysfunction.
 Diagnostic workup varies but commonly includes esophagoscopy, 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring, and radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract.
 Treatment, which progresses from simple life-style changes and antacids to histamine2 receptor antagonists to omeprazole (Prilosec) or surgery, is tailored to individual needs and is generally successful.
