The role of epidermal growth factor in the pathogenesis of peptic ulcer disease.
 Duodenal biopsies obtained from seven normal subjects and six ulcerous patients were cultured in vitro for 30 min at 37 degrees C under various experimental conditions.
 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) and somatostatin released in the culture medium were determined by radioimmunoassay.
 Under basal conditions, EGF and somatostatin levels were significantly higher in normal subjects (11.49 +/- 3.07 ng/mg protein and 3.06 +/- 0.8 ng/mg protein, respectively) than in ulcerous patients (6.9 +/- 1.98 ng/mg protein and 1.75 +/- 1.23 ng/mg protein, respectively).
 However, when antibodies to somatostatin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were added together to the culture media, in ulcerous patients, EGF levels also were lower as absolute values, but were higher as a percentage of variation than controls (p less than 0.05).
 The fall of EGF secretion from tissue cultures of ulcerous patients could be the consequence of endocrine cellular loss or damage, rather than the cause of ulceration.
 Moreover, the EGF-producing cells around the lesion in ulcerous patients seems to be hyperactive, and this hyperfunction of EGF-producing cells might contribute to the in vivo repair of tissue damage.
