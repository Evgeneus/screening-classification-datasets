Role of intraoperative enteroscopy in obscure gastrointestinal bleeding of small bowel origin.
 Intraoperative enteroscopy was performed in 12 patients (median age 68 years) with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding probably of small bowel origin, six of whom were men.
 All the patients were evaluated by routine haematological, coagulation and biochemical profiles, upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies, visceral angiography and/or isotope scanning.
 All the patients were anaemic.
 Visceral angiography was useful on three of the 12 occasions on which it was used and isotope scanning was valuable on eight of the 11 occasions it was used.
 Nine patients had undergone previous laparotomy.
 Enteroscopy was performed successfully in all cases, with fresh blood and discrete vascular lesions being the chief findings (10 of 12 cases).
 Segmental resections (n = 8) and local resections (n = 2) were performed in ten patients, with two patients having more than one laparotomy for rebleeding.
 Five patients developed postoperative complications and there was an operative death and one late death.
 Three of the ten surviving patients experienced further rebleeding.
 Intraoperative enteroscopy is now an essential adjunct to laparotomy for gastrointestinal bleeding which has been localized to the small bowel before operation.
