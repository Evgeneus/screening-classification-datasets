The child with spells.
 The purpose of this article was to discuss paroxysms, both neurologic and non-neurologic, that can mimic seizures.
 This is summarized in Table 4.
 It should be clear that the evaluation of any spell in a child should begin with a detailed and complete history.
 Historical features should focus on all aspects of the event--length of time, situation, appearance, quantity, as well as other features not directly pertaining to the event.
 Physical and neurologic examinations are frequently normal.
 Ancillary testing that may prove valuable include routine and video EEG monitoring as well as home video recording.
