The surgical pathology of gastrointestinal Hodgkin's disease.
 The files of the National Cancer Institute were searched for all surgical specimens from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease (HD) that were accessioned during the years 1953-1990; six patients with a histologically reconfirmed diagnosis were identified.
 Of these patients, four presented with GI HD and two had recurrent HD.
 Primary HD appeared in the stomach (three patients) and the duodenum (one patient); recurrent HD after diagnosis in a conventional nodal site appeared in the stomach (one patient) and the colon (one patient).
 One of the cases of primary gastric disease was a composite lymphoma consisting of HD and diffuse large cell lymphoma.
 In view of the rarity of GI tract involvement by HD, a diagnosis of primary GI HD should be viewed with skepticism; support for such a diagnosis may be provided by both classic histopathologic features of HD and immunostaining, but no single feature can be regarded as pathognomonic.
