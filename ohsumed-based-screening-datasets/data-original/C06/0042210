Treatment of peptic ulcer disease with sucralfate: a review.
 Sucralfate has been used widely for the treatment of peptic ulcer.
 Healing rates for duodenal ulcer range from 60 to 90% at 4-6 weeks and up to 90% at 12 weeks for gastric ulcer.
 The small number of maintenance trials suggest that relapse of duodenal ulcer is reduced comparably to H2 receptor antagonists.
 There has been considerable interest in the possibility of lower relapse ratios after initial healing with sucralfate compared with H2 receptor antagonists, but more studies of the possible mechanisms as well as larger trials are still needed to confirm these observations.
