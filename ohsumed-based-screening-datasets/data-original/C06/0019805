Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver.
 Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver is an extremely rare entity.
 Because of its unusual clinical presentation and confusing histologic picture, a diagnosis of malignancy is frequently made.
 Thus the surgeon is closely involved with the case and extensive procedures are not uncommon.
 However, this lesion is benign and will even regress spontaneously, making radical surgical procedures contraindicated.
 The difficulty lies in establishing an accurate diagnosis and the histologic pitfalls of this particular process.
 Conservative therapy can then be applied, avoiding surgical morbidity.
