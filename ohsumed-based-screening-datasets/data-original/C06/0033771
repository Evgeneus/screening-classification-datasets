Mesalamine in ulcerative colitis.
 Sulfasalazine has been used for many years in the management of ulcerative colitis.
 As many as 20 percent of patients treated with it experience intolerable adverse effects usually attributed to its sulfapyridine component.
 The other active component is 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA); the only 5-ASA enema preparation currently available in the U.S.
 is mesalamine (Rowasa, Reid-Rowell) containing 5-ASA 4 g in 60 mL.
 In clinical trials, mesalamine has proved efficacious in treating refractory cases of distal ulcerative colitis, proctitis, and proctosigmoiditis.
 Because of its high cost compared with more conventional treatment modalities, it should be reserved for cases that are either refractory or intolerant to conventional treatment.
