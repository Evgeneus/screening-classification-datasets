Controlling gastric pH: the impact of newer agents on the critically ill patient.
 The critically ill patient is at increased risk for developing erosive injury of the stomach, duodenum, and esophagus.
 To date, the most effective way to prevent and treat this problem is by assuring excellent intensive care support and by reducing gastric acid secretion.
 The histamine H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs) are effective in both prevention and treatment of such gastric mucosal injury.
 Newer agents are available that have potential for use in this setting, although none have been studied as extensively in critically ill patients as have the H2RAs.
 These new agents include proglumide, pirenzepine, misoprostol, omeprazole, and somatostatin.
 To date, only the latter has been extensively studied in critically ill patients.
 Omeprazole, which suppresses acid very effectively, may be problematic in the critically ill, limited by its oral dosage form, acid-labile properties, and potential drug interactions.
