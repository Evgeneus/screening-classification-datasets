Rectal potential differences in irritable bowel syndrome and in inflammatory bowel diseases in man.
 We have studied rectal potential difference (pd) in 200 subjects: 30 healthy volunteers or control patients, 46 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and painless diarrhoea (group I), 60 IBS patients without diarrhoea (group II) and 64 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with (group III, n = 41) or without (group IV, n = 23) rectal involvement.
 Pd measurement used a rectal perfused probe and a subcutaneous needle both connected, via agar-KCl bridges, to calomel electrodes and a millivoltmeter.
 Statistical analysis used Student's t-test for paired and unpaired data and Mann-Whitney U-test as appropriate.
 Mean rectal pd values were, respectively -43.5 +/- 8.7 mV in control group, -32.9 +/- 10.2 mV in IBS-group I patients (P less than 0.001), -41.3 +/- 12 mV in IBS-group II patients (NS), -21.4 +/- 14.1 mV in IBD patients with rectal involvement (P less than 0.001), and -45.1 +/- 14.3 mV in IBD-group IV patients (NS).
 A histological examination was performed in 36 IBS patients; mean rectal pd was significantly decreased in patients showing abnormal patterns (n = 27, pd = -31.8 +/- 9 mV) compared to patients with normal mucosa (n = 9, pd = -41.1 +/- 6.5 mV; P less than 0.01).
 These results show that: (1) potential difference is significantly decreased in patients with ulcerative and rectal involvement; (2) in patients with Crohn's disease, normal rectal pd values do not assess the appearance of colonic mucosa above; (3) patients with IBS and diarrhoea also present a significant diminution in mean rectal pd.
 Although the mechanisms involved remain unclear, rectal pd measurement appears to be an objective test for intestinal mucosae weakness in functional or inflammatory diseases of the large intestine and rectum.
