Massive incisional hernia: abdominal wall replacement with Marlex mesh.
 Marlex (polypropylene) mesh was used to replace the abdominal wall in massive incisional herniation in 50 patients.
 Seventeen unsuccessful attempts at primary repair had previously been made on nine patients.
 Patient follow-up ranged from 6 to 120 months (mean = 45 months).
 There was minor hernia recurrence in four (8 per cent) patients.
 In each instance it was due to partial detachment of the peripheral fixation of the patch.
 Complications were: wound infection, four (8 per cent); wound seroma, two (4 per cent); wound haematoma, one (2 per cent); and wound sinus, six (12 per cent).
 Complications did not necessitate removal of the patch in any case.
 Inadequate peripheral attachment of the patch has been the only cause of hernia recurrence and should be avoidable.
