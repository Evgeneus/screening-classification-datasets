Retained bile duct stones in a patient with Billroth II gastrectomy: extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation via T tube.
 A postoperative T tube cholangiogram after cholecystectomy in a 62 year old patient showed two retained calculi of 14 mm diameter each.
 Endoscopic sphincterotomy was not possible because of previous Billroth II gastrectomy.
 The stones were disintegrated by electromagnetically generated extracorporeal shock waves.
 The T tube was replaced by a balloon catheter and the papilla of Vater was dilatated allowing passage of stone fragments.
 We conclude that retained bile duct stones can be removed without sphincterotomy or percutaneous extraction by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and papillary dilatation.
 This method should be considered especially in patients with Billroth II gastrectomy.
