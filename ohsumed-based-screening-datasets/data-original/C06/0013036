Pharmacokinetics of famotidine after intravenous administration in liver disease.
 The pharmacokinetics of famotidine were studied after the administration of a single intravenous dose of 20-mg to seven normal volunteers, six patients with chronic hepatitis, 14 patients with compensated cirrhosis, and seven patients with decompensated cirrhosis.
 The plasma terminal elimination half-life of famotidine was significantly prolonged and famotidine total body clearance was significantly reduced in patients with decompensated cirrhosis, whose creatinine clearance was 57.2 +/- 6.7 ml/min/1.48 m2, but these changes were not significant in patients with chronic hepatitis (creatinine clearance: 109.2 +/- 10.5 ml/min/1.48 m2) or in patients with compensated cirrhosis (creatinine clearance: 72.2 +/- 26.5 ml/min/1.48 m2 in comparison with normal volunteers.
 The total volume of distribution at steady state was not significantly different between the normal volunteers and the three groups of patients.
 Famotidine total body clearance showed a weak but significant correlation with the creatinine clearance (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001), serum albumin level (r = 0.51, p less than 0.01), and serum total bilirubin level (r = 0.36, p less than 0.05), which suggested that the reduction in clearance was due in part to the concomitant renal impairment, as well as hepatic dysfunction in these patients.
 In conclusion, famotidine total body clearance was reduced in decompensated cirrhosis, indicating that the dose schedule requires modification in patients with this condition.
