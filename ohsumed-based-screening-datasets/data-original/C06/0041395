Intradermal hepatitis B vaccination.
 The availability of vaccine since 1982 for immunization against hepatitis B virus (HBV) has had minimal impact on the disease; mass immunization has been suggested.
 Intradermal vaccination, which has precedent in prophylaxis of other infectious diseases, has been investigated as a low-cost alternative to traditional intramuscular HBV vaccination.
 Results of open and comparative trials indicate similar seroconversion rates for intradermal and intramuscular HBV vaccination routes in healthy adults.
 However, antibody titers and, presumably, duration of antibody protection appear to be decreased with intradermal HBV vaccination.
 Limited data suggest that demographic factors such as age and gender may affect vaccine responsiveness to intradermal HBV vaccine.
 Adverse skin reactions are common but do not represent a deterrent to continued intradermal HBV vaccination.
 There is a need for large-scale prospective comparative trials to substantiate the value of intradermal HBV vaccination.
 Nevertheless, the potential economic and epidemiologic benefit of intradermal vaccination justifies continued investigation for prevention of HBV infection.
