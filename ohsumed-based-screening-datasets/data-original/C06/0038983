Closure of a tracheoesophageal fistula by bronchoscopic application of fibrin glue and decontamination of the oral cavity.
 A tracheoesophageal fistula was successfully closed with a fibrin adhesive applied by means of a fiberoptic bronchoscope, instead of by esophagoscopy.
 To facilitate closure of the fistula, the technique was combined with decontamination of the oral cavity, to avoid bacterial contamination.
 The procedure is proposed as an alternative to surgery for critically ill patients.
