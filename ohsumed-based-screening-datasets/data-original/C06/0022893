Dysphagia as a manifestation of occult hypoxemia. The role of oximetry during meal times.
 A 25-year-old woman with severe kyphoscoliosis reported a six-month history of increasing dysphagia to both liquids and solids.
 A barium swallow and esophageal motility studies showed no significant gastrointestinal abnormalities.
 Trials of antispasmodic agents were unsuccessful in relieving her symptoms.
 Pulmonary function tests showed a severe restrictive ventilatory defect (vital capacity = 0.67 L) with adequate oxygenation and alveolar ventilation as reflected by arterial blood gas testing during quiet wakefulness.
 However, continuous noninvasive oximetry demonstrated desaturation to 85 percent while eating.
 These transient episodes of desaturation were abolished by the administration of supplemental oxygen delivered by nasal prongs.
 Following the prescription of supplemental oxygen, dysphagia resolved immediately, with weight gain following over several weeks.
 We conclude that dysphagia may be a presenting feature of hypoxemia.
 This case report draws attention to the usefulness of continuous noninvasive monitoring of oxygenation and the clinical importance of at least some transient hypoxemic events.
