Tuberculosis of the esophagus.
 Tuberculosis of the esophagus is rare.
 More cases of secondary tuberculosis of the esophagus have been reported compared to primary esophageal tuberculosis.
 An illustrative case of primary tuberculosis of the esophagus is presented and 54 published cases of esophageal involvement in tuberculosis are reviewed.
 There were eight primary and 46 secondary cases of esophageal tuberculosis.
 There were more male than female patients (M/F = 2.6:1) with an average age of 39.2 years (range 6 months to 75 years).
 Diagnosis can be difficult, being based on clinical, radiological, endoscopic, and histological features and on the response to chemotherapy.
 Most cases can be successfully treated with antituberculous chemotherapy even in the presence of fistulous tracts.
 Patients with esophageal tuberculosis in the presence of AIDS do not respond as well to antituberculous chemotherapy.
