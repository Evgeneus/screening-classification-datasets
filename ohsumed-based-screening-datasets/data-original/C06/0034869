Acute appendicitis in patients with AIDS/HIV infection.
 Nine patients known to have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and operated on for acute appendicitis are presented.
 Six of the nine patients did not have an elevation in the white blood cell count preoperatively.
 Two patients underwent diagnostic laparoscopy prior to exploration.
 In four cases, a perforated appendix was removed.
 Seven patients had persistent postoperative fever, while all nine had a significant lack of leukocytosis after surgery.
 Other than the absence of a preoperative increase in white blood cell count, the presenting characteristics of this group were similar to those expected in immunocompetent patients.
 However, concern for a possible opportunistic infection etiology and a desire to avoid operating on these patients resulted in an undue delay prior to exploration.
 The use of diagnostic laparoscopy aided in earlier and more accurate diagnosis.
 Despite persistent postoperative fever, appendectomy was performed in patients with AIDS/HIV infection without significant increase in morbidity and mortality.
