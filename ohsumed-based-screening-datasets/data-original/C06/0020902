Is primary repair of gastroschisis and omphalocele always the best operation?
 Optimal surgical management of neonates with gastroschisis and omphalocele remains controversial.
 Suggested benefits of primary fascial closure include earlier return of gastrointestinal function, decreased hospital stay, less sepsis, less risk of postoperative intestinal obstruction and fistulae, and lower mortality.
 Between 1978 and 1989, 40 neonates with gastroschisis or omphalocele underwent repair.
 Primary fascial repair was performed in 30 children, 18 of whom had a gastroschisis and 12 of whom had an omphalocele.
 Ten children had staged repair with the use of a silastic silo; seven of these had a gastroschisis and three an omphalocele.
 Comparison between the groups was made regarding birth weight, days on the ventilator before and after surgery, days to first feeding, days in the hospital after surgery, postoperative complications, and survival.
 There was no significant difference in birth weight, days on the ventilator, days to first feeding, and postoperative days in the hospital.
 There were nine complications in nine patients (30%) with primary repair and four complications in two patients (20%) with staged repair.
 Two infants died after primary repair (6.7%), and one (10%) died after staged closure.
 It was concluded that silastic silo repair and primary fascial closure are both acceptable alternatives.
 Primary closure is attractive whenever possible to avoid additional operations.
