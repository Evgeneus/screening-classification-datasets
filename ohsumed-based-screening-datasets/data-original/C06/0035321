Cimetidine and ranitidine may not cross-react to cause thrombocytopenia.
 We report the case of a patient with peptic ulcer disease who developed cimetidine-induced thrombocytopenia.
 The thrombocytopenia resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of cimetidine, and did not recur with ranitidine.
 We concluded that cimetidine and ranitidine do not necessarily cross-react to induce thrombocytopenia.
 Thus the exclusion of both H2-blockers in the event that one has caused thrombocytopenia may not be justified.
