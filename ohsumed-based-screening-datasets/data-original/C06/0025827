Isolation of group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter species from Thai children with diarrhea.
 Campylobacter species were isolated from 93 (15%) of 631 Thai children with diarrhea using the membrane filter technique on nonselective blood agar incubated at 37 degrees C.
 Campylobacter jejuni was isolated from 62 (10%), Campylobacter coli from 14 (2%), and atypical campylobacters from 17 (3%).
 The 17 atypical strains were first characterized biochemically and by dot blot DNA hybridization.
 Catalase-negative strains also were characterized by DNA hybridization and ribotype pattern.
 One strain was a catalase-negative "Campylobacter upsaliensis" and another was a nitrate-negative Campylobacter jejuni doylei.
 Fifteen isolates were aerotolerant strains most closely resembling Campylobacter cryaerophila or "C.
 upsaliensis" by dot hybridization.
 These aerotolerant strains, designated group 2 ("Campylobacter butzleri"), had ribotypes distinct from C.
 cryaerophila and have previously been shown to be related by DNA hybridization at the species level to the group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter type strain (D2686).
 Group 2 aerotolerant Campylobacter were the atypical Campylobacter species most frequently isolated from Thai children with diarrhea.
