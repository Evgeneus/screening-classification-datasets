A randomized clinical trial of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin versus cefotaxime and clindamycin in children with ruptured appendicitis.
 This prospective, randomized, double-blind study compares the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin (AGC) or cefotaxime and clindamycin (CC) for the treatment of children with complicated appendicitis.
 Ninety-seven children were randomized.
 Forty-seven were assigned to the AGC regimen and 50 received CC.
 Forty-two patients in the AGC group had an appropriate therapeutic outcome, whereas 48 of 50 children who received CC completed the trial successfully (p = NS).
 There were no differences between the groups with reference to the duration of antibiotic administration, fever, leukocytosis or length of hospitalization.
 Complications of therapy were uncommon and neither regimen demonstrated a significant advantage from an economic standpoint.
 We concluded that, in childhood, complicated appendicitis can be treated with either CC or AGC with equal efficacy.
