Fat-saturation MR imaging of the upper abdomen.
 The fat-saturation (fatsat) MR technique decreases the signal intensity of fat, thereby enhancing the definition of upper abdominal organs and reducing artifacts while maintaining the T1 and T2 information available on spin-echo sequences.
 To evaluate the potential of fatsat in examining the abdomen, we conducted a prospective study involving 30 subjects, including four normal volunteers, 18 patients investigated for liver disease, and eight patients studied for miscellaneous abdominal disease.
 Short TR, 300-600/15-20 (TR/TE), and long TR, 2000-2500/20-30, 70-80, spin-echo images with and without fatsat were compared.
 The images were evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively.
 Qualitative assessment was made with receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve analysis of the confidence level of observers to detect the presence of disease, comparing fatsat with standard spin-echo sequences.
 ROC analysis showed greater interpreter confidence and accuracy for fatsat sequences than for standard spin-echo sequences.
 The measured signal-difference-to-noise (SD/N) ratio comparing upper abdominal organs with surrounding tissue revealed the highest values for short TR/TE regular spin echo, followed by short TR/TE fatsat.
 The highest SD/N ratio for hepatic masses was with long TR/TE fatsat followed by short TR/TE fatsat.
 The results of this study suggest that the fatsat technique may improve abdominal MR imaging.
