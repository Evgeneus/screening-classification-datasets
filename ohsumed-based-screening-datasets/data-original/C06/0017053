The value of the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap in the treatment of complex perineal fistula.
 Complex perineal fistula and persistent perineal sinus are difficult to treat.
 We describe our experience with wide excision of the diseased perineum using a combined abdominoperineal approach.
 Ten patients were reconstructed by a rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (n = 7), rectus abdominis muscle flap (n = 2), and omental graft (n = 1).
 Primary healing was achieved in all cases.
 A median follow-up of 18 months (range 6-54 months) has shown no recurrence of perineal disease or associated abdominal incisional hernia.
 There were no perioperative deaths.
 We propose that the rectus abdominis myocutaneous flap is indicated if large amounts of perineal skin has to be sacrificed.
 When less skin is removed a repair with greater omentum or rectus muscle alone is adequate.
 The abdominoperineal approach together with filling the residual pelvic cavity with well-vascularized tissue allows definitive treatment to be carried out in one stage.
