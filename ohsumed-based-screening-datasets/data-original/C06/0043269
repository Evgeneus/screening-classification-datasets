Enterogastric reflux after various types of antiulcer gastric surgery: quantitation by 99mTc-HIDA scintigraphy.
 In 28 controls and 142 patients subjected to a variety of antiulcer procedures, the enterogastric reflux (EGR) was quantitated by 99mTc-HIDA scintigraphy and expressed as the EGR index on 229 different occasions.
 The EGR index was calculated according to two different formulas: one based on the maximal radioactivity over the gastric area as a percentage value of the total abdominal activity (EGR-Im) and the other based on the relative maximal radioactivity over the gastric area as a percentage value of the relative hepatobiliary activity (EGR-It).
 There was a significant positive correlation of values between the two methods (P less than 0.0001).
 In patients with an EGR-Im greater than 20% or EGR-It greater than 57% and postgastric surgery symptoms some of the symptoms were attributed to EGR, an antireflux procedure is expected to relieve those symptoms.
 Sixteen of these patients underwent Roux-en-Y gastrectomy and their preoperative symptoms were relieved.
