Study of preneoplastic changes of liver cells by immunohistochemical and molecular hybridization techniques.
 The status of hepatitis B virus DNA was investigated by in situ hybridization in multifocal areas of a noncancerous hepatitis B virus-associated cirrhosis.
 This liver exhibited a marked degree of dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia.
 The results of these studies were correlated with the histopathology and immunohistochemical stains for hepatitis B core and surface antigens.
 There was clear evidence of a marked reduction to absence of hepatitis B viral DNA by in situ hybridization and absence of HBc and HBsAg in the foci of liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia.
 These results support the hypothesis that liver cell dysplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia are preneoplastic in nature.
