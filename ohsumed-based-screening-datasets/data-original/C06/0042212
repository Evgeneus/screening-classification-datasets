Sucralfate versus cimetidine in the treatment of reflux esophagitis, with special reference to the esophageal motor function.
 Sixty patients entered a double-blind clinical trial comparing the effect of 1 g of sucralfate granulate given four times daily and cimetidine, 400 mg twice daily.
 Twenty-six patients treated with sucralfate and 26 treated with cimetidine were examined with short-term pH monitoring before and after 12 weeks of treatment.
 Thirty patients, 19 treated with cimetidine and 11 treated with sucralfate, had esophageal motility studied by a radionuclide test before and after 12 weeks of treatment.
 The efficacy of the treatments was judged by symptoms and endoscopic response after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of treatment.
 The endpoint healing rate was approximately 60% in both groups and symptoms were relieved in half of the patients in both groups (difference not significant).
 The effect of the treatments on pH and number of spikes reflected the different pharmacodynamic profiles of the drugs, whereas the mean transit time (MTT) was not changed by the treatments.
 The residual activity after radionuclide transit in the sitting position was significantly increased after treatment with cimetidine.
 The data support the hypothesis that primary dysmotility might be involved in the pathogenesis of reflux esophagitis in about 33% of the patients.
 Possibilities for a combination therapy with sucralfate and cimetidine are stressed.
