Influence of human immunodeficiency virus infection on cell-mediated immunity in chronic D hepatitis.
 To determine whether the abnormalities of cell-mediated immunity described in chronic D hepatitis are associated with hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection or concomitant human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, serologic and tissue hepatitis B virus (HBV) and HDV markers and T lymphocyte subsets were studied in serum samples from 38 patients with chronic D hepatitis, 26 of whom had HIV infection.
 Patients with chronic D hepatitis and HIV infection had significantly lower peripheral blood T4:T8 ratios resulting from a significant increase in T8+ (suppressor/cytotoxic) cells, while numbers of T lymphocyte subsets were normal in cases with chronic D hepatitis only.
 HIV+ patients showed an increase in HBV replication (identified by hepatitis B core antigen in liver and hepatitis B e antigen and HBV DNA in serum) and in HDV replication (tissue D antigen and HDV RNA) without evidence of more active liver disease.
 Probably the immunologic disturbances detected in chronic D hepatitis are secondary to HIV infection, do not contribute to the pathogenesis of liver injury, and are associated with increased viral B and D replication.
