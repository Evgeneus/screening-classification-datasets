Chronic diarrhea in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia: a manifestation of visceral vasculitis?
 Gastrointestinal involvement occurs frequently in essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, and most often involves the liver and spleen.
 Intestinal involvement is much less common and is generally felt to be a late and often catastrophic manifestation of the disease due to severe vasculitis.
 Occasionally, the disorder mimics inflammatory bowel disease, both clinically and radiographically.
 We recently cared for a patient with essential mixed cryoglobulinemia who developed persistent diarrhea.
 Endoscopic evaluation revealed scattered petechial lesions in the duodenum and colon as well as prominent lymphoid hyperplasia in the terminal ileum.
 Mucosal biopsies disclosed the presence of diffuse inflammation.
 We suggest that this patient's diarrhea was due to intestinal vasculitis and that prominent ileal lymphoid hyperplasia may be a manifestation of essential mixed cryoglobulinemia.
