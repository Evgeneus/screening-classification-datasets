PEG ileus. A new cause of small bowel obstruction.
 A case of small bowel obstruction due to a lodged percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube inner bumper is described.
 Most probably inner bumper lodgement in the terminal ileum is related to its size.
 Laparotomy was required to remove the bumper and relieve the obstruction.
 We suggest that all percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy bumpers be retrieved endoscopically when the PEG tube is removed or replaced unless a collapsible inner bumper is used.
