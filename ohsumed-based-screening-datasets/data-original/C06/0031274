Interference between gastroesophageal reflux and sleep in near miss SIDS.
 GER may be considered as one of the triggering factors in some apparently life-threatening events or even SIDS.
 Also at the present time, many teams perform 24-h pH monitoring in at-risk infants and treat those with abnormal scores.
 However, further investigations are needed to answer the question: Which unknown additional factor(s) is present when a specific episode of GER causes apnea and/or bradycardia either during sleep or wakefulness?.
