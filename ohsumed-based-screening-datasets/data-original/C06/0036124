Dual effects of N-ethylmaleimide on ethanol-induced gastric lesions in rats.
 The effects of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), a sulfhydryl (SH) blocker, on ethanol-induced gastric lesions were investigated in rats by varying the route of administration.
 Oral administration of acidified ethanol (60% ethanol in 150 mM HCl, 1 ml) produced hemorrhagic bandlike lesions in the gastric mucosa.
 Pretreatment of the animals with orally administered NEM (0.1-10 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited these lesions (the inhibition was over 80% at 1 mg/kg or greater), and the effects were partially reversed by indomethacin (5 mg/kg, subcutaneous).
 However, when NEM (10 mg/kg) was given subcutaneously, this agent significantly worsened the lesions.
 Intragastrically applied NEM produced a dose-dependent reduction of the transmucosal potential difference (PD) and the mucosal nonprotein SH levels, an increase of the volume of gastric contents, and an inhibition of gastric motility, while these parameters remained unaltered after subcutaneous administration of the agent.
 The microvascular permeability in the mucosa was significantly increased by both oral and subcutaneous administration of NEM (10 mg/kg) but remained unchanged in response to lower doses of orally administered (less than 3 mg/kg).
 These results suggest that NEM given orally is cytoprotective to the stomach against ethanol, probably by acting as a mild irritant and due to dilution of an irritant and inhibition of gastric motility (muscle relaxation), but when given subcutaneously it aggravates the lesions by unknown mechanisms.
