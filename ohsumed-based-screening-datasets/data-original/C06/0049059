Milk-induced malabsorption in malnourished African patients.
 Fifty malnourished rural African patients were randomly assigned to whole milk (50 g lactose/L), acidified milk (24 g lactose/L), or a commercial lactose-free diet (LFD) as a constant nasogastric infusion for 3 d, starting at 2 L/d and increasing to 3 L/d if tolerated.
 During the first 2 d mild symptoms of intolerance developed in 63% of patients on whole milk, 37% on acidified milk, and 54% on LFD whereas severe intolerance, necessitating withdrawal, was encountered in 22% receiving whole milk and none receiving LFD.
 Stool weights and fat excretion on day 3 were greater (P less than 0.02) in the remaining milk-fed patients whereas nitrogen balance remained strongly positive in all three groups.
 Eighty-seven percent of patients were methane producers, and high excretion rates were associated with better milk tolerance.
 The results suggest that although undiluted cow milk will not form a suitable tube feed for malnourished African patients, products such as acidified milk may prove cost effective.
