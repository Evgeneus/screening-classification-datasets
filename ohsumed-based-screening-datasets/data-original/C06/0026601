Mucosal cell proliferation of the rectal stump in ulcerative colitis patients after ileorectal anastomosis.
 The proliferative activity and polyamine levels of the rectal epithelium in unoperated ulcerative colitis patients and in ulcerative colitis patients after total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis were determined and compared with control subjects.
 Cell proliferation was evaluated in rectal biopsies by in vitro 3H thymidine incorporation by measuring the labeling index and the position of labeled cells along the crypt; polyamines were determined with a chromatographic method.
 In ulcerative colitis patients the labeling index was significantly increased, and labeled cells were shifted toward the upper part of the crypt when compared with controls.
 Ileorectal anastomosis patients showed a normalization of the labeling index and a distribution of labeled cells similar to controls.
 Polyamine levels were also increased in ulcerative colitis patients; in ileorectal anastomosis patients, the level of polyamines was decreased in respect to unoperated patients and return to normal values except for spermine.
 Because the increased proliferation and higher polyamine levels are related to increased colon cancer risk, our results confirm that ulcerative colitis is a risk factor for the development of carcinoma.
 Ileorectal anastomosis may reduce this risk through a normalization of mucosal cell proliferative activity and of some polyamine levels.
