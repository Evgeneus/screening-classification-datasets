Scopolamine patch reduces postoperative emesis in paediatric patients following strabismus surgery.
 Scopolamine patch was evaluated for the prevention of postoperative emesis in 50 children undergoing strabismus surgery.
 All subjects were premedicated, with none receiving narcotic premedicants.
 Anaesthesia included controlled ventilation with the use of muscle relaxants, atropine, and halothane.
 Before operation, the subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups: a treatment group received a scopolamine patch at a dose of either 0.75 mg or 0.375 mg, and a control group received no patch.
 Both the incidence and frequency of vomiting in the scopolamine-treated group were significantly (P less than 0.05) lower than in the control group.
