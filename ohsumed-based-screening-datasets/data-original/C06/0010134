Hepatocellular carcinoma within siderotic regenerative nodules: appearance as a nodule within a nodule on MR images.
 Large regenerative nodules in cirrhotic livers may accumulate iron and develop internal iron-poor foci of hyperplasia or malignancy.
 Magnetic resonance examinations were performed on 23 patients with biopsy-proved cirrhosis.
 A "nodule-within-nodule" appearance was noted in two patients.
 This appearance consisted of markedly low intensity of a large nodule on gradient-echo images, with one or two internal foci that were isointense to the liver.
 Each of the large nodules was 2 cm in diameter, and each of the internal foci was less than 1 cm.
 Serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were normal in both patients.
 Aspiration biopsy performed in one patient failed to show malignancy, but histologic confirmation of hepatocellular carcinoma was obtained eventually in both cases.
 The nodule-within-nodule sign, which reflects the unique histopathology of hepatocellular carcinoma in large siderotic regenerative nodules, is strongly suggestive of early hepatocellular carcinoma, even if serologic markers and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.
