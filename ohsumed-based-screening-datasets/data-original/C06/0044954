HLA-DR expression on the microvasculature of portal tracts in idiopathic portal hypertension. Immunohistochemical characteristics and relation to portal phlebosclerosis.
 We recently reported that HLA-DR antigen was expressed on the microvasculature of portal tracts more frequently in idiopathic portal hypertension (IPH) than in normal livers or in other hepatic diseases, and that this HLA-DR expression may be involved in the development of the portal venopathy characteristic of IPH.
 The present study was performed to evaluate the relationship between the HLA-DR expression and portal tract lesions, as well as to investigate the immunohistochemical characteristics of the HLA-DR-positive microvasculature using liver wedge biopsy specimens obtained from 32 patients with IPH.
 According to the degree of phlebosclerosis of the portal veins, the portal tracts were divided into three groups: mild, moderate, and severe.
 The microvasculature in portal tracts was positive for HLA-DR in 21 (66%) of the 32 specimens and in 133 (44%) of 302 portal tracts.
 In the 21 specimens, there was no significant difference in the prevalence of HLA-DR-positive microvasculature among the three groups: it occurred in 57 (66%) of 86 portal tracts in the mild group, 53 (61%) of 87 portal tracts in the moderate group, and 23 (49%) of 47 portal tracts in the severe group.
 The HLA-DR-positive microvasculature was positive for type IV collagen and receptors of Ulex europaeus lectin I, suggesting that HLA-DR-positive microvessels are blood vessels.
 These findings suggest that HLA-DR antigen is already expressed on portal microvessels in the incipient stage of IPH, and that HLA-DR expression persists during the progression of portal phlebosclerosis.
 The HLA-DR expression may be an initiating factor leading to immunologic assault on portal microvessels in IPH.
