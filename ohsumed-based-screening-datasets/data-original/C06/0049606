Liver dysfunction associated with long-term total parenteral nutrition in patients with massive bowel resection.
 Sixteen patients with massive bowel resection receiving long-term home total parenteral nutrition (HTPN) for 31 to 145 months were reviewed for evidence of liver disease.
 Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 with duodenocolostomy (n = 3), group 2 with an estimated 15-43 cm residual small bowel (n = 7), and group 3 with an estimated 55-120 cm residual small bowel (n = 6).
 Two patients in group 1 developed liver cirrhosis; one was diabetic and died of sepsis and liver failure at the 88th month on HTPN; the other died of lung cancer at the 46th month on HTPN.
 The third patient, followed for 33 months, had transient severe liver function abnormalities associated with a blood transfusion.
 In groups 2 and 3, only one patient (with a history of probable liver disease before HTPN) developed biopsy-proven cirrhosis at the 60th month of HTPN.
 All four patients with clinically apparent liver disease developed persistent elevation of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) early in HTPN.
 Four other patients (all in group 3) with abnormal AST values in the early phase of HTPN normalized them later; they did not develop clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up time of 110 months (range, 39-152).
 None of the remaining eight patients (seven in group 2 and one in group 3) had significant liver function test abnormalities and none developed clinical liver disease over a mean follow-up period of 72 months (range, 39-120).
