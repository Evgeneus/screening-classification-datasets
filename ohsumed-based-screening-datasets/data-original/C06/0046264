Hepatitis B vaccination programs for health care personnel in U.S. hospitals.
 A random sample of 232 U.S.
 hospitals was surveyed.
 Of those hospitals, 75 percent had hepatitis B vaccination programs.
 The presence of a program was associated with hospital size (60 percent of those with 100 beds, 75 percent with 100-499 beds, 90 percent with 500 or more beds; P = 0.0013) and hospital location (urban 86 percent; rural 57 percent; P less than 0.001).
 The frequency of needlestick exposures per month among hospital personnel and hospital location were directly related to and best predicted the existence of hepatitis B vaccination programs.
 All hospitals with programs offered vaccine to high-risk personnel (as defined by the hospital).
 Seventy-seven percent of hospitals paid all costs for vaccinating high-risk personnel; 19 percent paid for any employee to be vaccinated regardless of risk status.
 Forty-six percent of hospitals with programs were estimated to have vaccinated more than 10 percent of all eligible personnel, and 13 percent to have vaccinated more than 25 percent of eligible personnel.
 The highest compliance rates were associated with hospitals paying for the vaccine and requiring vaccination of high-risk personnel.
 Fifty-four percent of hospitals attributed noncompliance to concern regarding vaccine safety and effectiveness.
 The reasons why there was no vaccination program in 58 hospitals were (a) low incidence of hepatitis B virus infections among personnel, (b) cost of vaccine, and (c) vaccination being offered as part of a needlestick protocol.
 Full utilization of hepatitis B vaccine could eliminate the occupational hazard that hepatitis B virus presents to health care personnel.
