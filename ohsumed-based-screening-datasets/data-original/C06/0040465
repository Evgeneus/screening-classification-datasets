Altered gallbladder contractility after extracorporeal shock-wave cholecystolithotripsy.
 Change in gallbladder contractility after biliary extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) may significantly influence the clearance of fragments after successful gallstone fragmentation.
 We assessed changes in gallbladder contractility in response to an oral fatty meal in 50 patients 1 month after biliary ESWL (all fragments were smaller than 3 mm) and also in a separate group of 10 patients 3 months after complete clearance of fragments.
 The prevalence of persistent lumen-obliterating contraction of the gallbladder after biliary ESWL also was analyzed in 325 patients.
 Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged in 30, increased in nine, and decreased in 11 of the 50 patients.
 The average reduction in the fasting gallbladder volume after lithotripsy was 28% (p less than .001).
 Gallbladder contractility remained unchanged 3 months after complete clearance of fragments in six of 10 patients studied separately.
 A decrease (n = 2) or increase (n = 2) in contractility was seen in the remaining patients.
 No significant difference occurred in the average ejection fraction of the gallbladder before lithotripsy and after complete clearance of the fragments.
 Thirty-four of the 325 patients who have so far undergone biliary ESWL had a completely contracted gallbladder with no lumen visible on sonography.
 The gallbladder returned to a relaxed state in half of these patients within 1-9 months.
 Thus, biliary ESWL did not significantly alter gallbladder contractility in 60% of patients.
 A significant reduction in the volume of the fasting gallbladder occurred after lithotripsy.
 Successful clearance of fragments did not improve the contractility of stonebearing gallbladders in the majority of patients.
