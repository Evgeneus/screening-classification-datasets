A case of severe pancytopenia caused by ibuprofen.
 We here present the case of a patient with severe neutropenia, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia associated with long-term use of ibuprofen.
 The blood parameters rapidly normalized when the drug was discontinued, and no further treatment, except for a short course of antibiotics, was required.
