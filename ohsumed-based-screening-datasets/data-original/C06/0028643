Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and peptic ulcer disease. An overview.
 Evidence is accumulating that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) is linked to ulceration of the stomach and duodenum and can cause significant, life-threatening ulcer complications.
 The mechanism of action seems to be both topical damage to the mucosal barrier and the systemic effect of a reduction in levels of mucosal prostaglandins.
 Patients especially at risk are the elderly, those with concomitant debilitating disease, those with a history of ulcers, and those taking corticosteroids.
 Histamine2 blockers are reported to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced duodenal ulcer, and misoprostol (Cytotec) has been shown to significantly reduce the incidence of NSAID-induced gastric ulcer.
 Prophylaxis with these agents should be considered for high-risk patients who need NSAID therapy to maintain a reasonable life-style.
