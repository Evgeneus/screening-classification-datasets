A 2-year experience with the Wolf piezoelectric lithotripter: impact of repeat treatment on results and complications.
 During a 2-year period, 884 extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy treatments have been performed on stones in 388 renal units (kidney and upper ureter) using a Wolf Piezolith device.* Lithotripsy routinely was performed on an outpatient basis without use of anesthesia or premedication.
 Often, the maximum number of pulses allowable by a Food and Drug Administration protocol (4,000) was delivered and retreatments frequently occurred on successive days.
 Of the patients 75% were stone-free 3 months after treatment, while another 20% had only residual small fragments.
 No intrarenal or perinephric hematomas were observed and only 1 patient has had hypertension requiring medication.
 Renal colic from passage of stone fragments occurred in only 10% of the patients.
 An aggressive treatment policy using repeat treatments as necessary provides for superior results with this device without an incision or complication.
