Plasma gastrin and cholecystokinin response after pylorus-preserving pancreatoduodenectomy with Billroth-I type of reconstruction.
 Plasma gastrin and cholecystokinin (CCK) responses were measured after a pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) using the Billroth-I type reconstruction combined with distal partial gastrectomy (standard PD) and combined with preservation of the pylorus and the duodenal bulb (PPPD).
 Six unoperated patients, 4 men and 2 women, were studied as control subjects.
 Basal plasma levels of gastrin were significantly higher in controls than in patients who had a standard PD (p less than 0.05) and gastrin responses to a meal were also blunted in these patients.
 In contrast basal and postprandial levels of gastrin after PPPD were significantly higher than these found in patients with standard PD (p less than 0.05).
 Postprandial gastrin response after PPPD were similar in pattern to these found in controls.
 Integrated gastrin release after PPPD was less than that of the control but was significantly greater than that in patients with standard PD.
 Basal plasma levels of CCK in the patients after the standard PD were significantly lower than in controls and significantly higher postprandial levels of CCK were found after PPPD compared to standard PD (p less than 0.05).
 However integrated CCK from 0 to 120 minutes were not significantly different between PPPD and standard PD groups.
 Based on these observations concerning hormonal release of gastrin and CCK, preservation of the stomach and the duodenal bulb appears to be a more physiologic reconstructive procedure than the standard PD.
 In addition the operation probably has more beneficial effect on the injured pancreas in time.
