Adnexal torsion. An unusual cause of abdominal pain in postmenopausal women.
 Adnexal torsion is a rare cause of abdominal pain in older women.
 Because the presenting symptoms and signs are vague, the diagnosis is not often considered.
 Lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting are usual in patients with torsion.
 Ultrasonography or computed tomography are useful diagnostic tests.
 Two case reports of older patients with adnexal torsion are presented to emphasize the diagnostic features of this entity, including lower abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and abdominal mass.
 Although the condition is uncommon, adnexal torsion should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute abdominal pain.
