Clinical experience with biliary extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
 Biliary lithotripsy is a new and important development in the nonsurgical management of gallbladder, cystic duct, and bile duct stones.
 Most patients do not require general or epidural anesthesia with newer second-generation machines.
 Patient selection and the use of adjuvant therapy to aid fragment clearance are important issues that are discussed.
 Results from different centers are compared but few long-term results are yet available, i.e., longer than 18 months.
