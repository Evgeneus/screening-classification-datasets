Gastric emptying in patients with severe reflux esophagitis.
 The pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is not fully understood.
 There have been reports that delayed gastric emptying is a contributing factor in some patients.
 To determine whether delayed gastric emptying plays a role in the genesis of GER, we correlated gastric-emptying measures obtained by scintigraphic techniques with the degree of acid reflux assessed by esophageal pH monitoring.
 Ten patients, all of whom had evidence of esophageal mucosal disease and severe acid reflux, were studied.
 Four of the 10 patients with reflux had prolongation in the lag phase of gastric solid emptying, and one of the four showed prolonged gastric-emptying t1/2.
 There was no significant difference, however, in the mean gastric-emptying t1/2 between a control group and the patient group.
 Furthermore, there was no correlation between gastric-emptying measures and degree of acid reflux.
 We conclude that in this group of 10 patients with severe GER, delayed gastric emptying does not play an important role in the development of gastroesophageal reflux.
