Antibody to hepatitis C is common among patients with alcoholic liver disease with and without risk factors.
 Thirty-seven patients with clinically suspected alcoholic liver disease were retrospectively studied for the prevalence of antibody to hepatitis C virus (HCV) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunoblot assay.
 Twenty-four had biopsy-proven cirrhosis.
 Nineteen had identifiable risk factors for non-A, non-B viral hepatitis, and 18 did not.
 Five of 19 high-risk (26%) and 6 of 18 low-risk (33%) patients had positive antibody, compared with two of 179 healthy blood donors (p less than 0.01 for either group of alcoholics compared with blood donors).
 Nine of 11 ELISA-positive patients were also either positive or indeterminable by immunoblot testing.
 Histologic scores for parameters commonly associated with chronic viral hepatitis were numerically worse among anti-HCV-positive patients, but none reached statistical significance.
 Clinically, seven of 11 (64%) of anti-HCV-positive patients versus 14 of 26 (54%) anti-HCV-negative patients were Child's class C.
 Among the 21 Child's class C patients, seven (33%) were anti-HCV-positive versus four of 16 (25%) of Child's class A/B patients.
 A weak correlation between IgG and ELISA optical density was observed (r = 0.52).
 We conclude that antibody to hepatitis C by ELISA and immunoblot is common among alcoholics with liver disease even in the absence of known or suspected risk factors for viral hepatitis.
 Although hepatitis C-positive patients tended to have more severe histologic disease, neither histologic parameters nor clinical findings were adequate to predict antibody seropositivity.
