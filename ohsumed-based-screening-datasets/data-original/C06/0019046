Importance of the omentum in the development of intra-abdominal metastases.
 Areas of trauma are preferred sites for metastatic tumour growth.
 In extensive intra-abdominal tumour recurrence the omentum is invariably involved.
 The importance of the omentum in the development of tumours at sites of intra-abdominal trauma has been investigated.
 Colonic anastomoses were performed in Hooded-Lister rats with and without omentectomy.
 Animals received intraluminal or intraperitoneal injections of a syngeneic tumour.
 With intraluminal injection, tumour occurred at the anastomosis and in the omentum in 38 and 43 per cent of animals respectively but following omentectomy the values were 14 and 9 per cent (omental remnant).
 With intraperitoneal administration tumour occurred in 53 per cent at the anastomosis and in 79 per cent in the omentum compared with 16 and 29 per cent (in omental remnant) following omentectomy.
 In this model a reduced ability of an anastomosis to support 'seeded' tumour following removal of the omentum is demonstrated and the development of local recurrence from spilled tumour cells during operation may be enhanced by, or be dependent on, the proximity of the omentum.
