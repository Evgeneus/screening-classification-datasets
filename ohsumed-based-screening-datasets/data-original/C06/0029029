Paraesophageal hernia causing colonic obstruction.
 In a paraesophageal hernia, the esophagogastric junction remains below the hiatus while portions of the fundus or other parts of the stomach herniate in front and to the left of the esophagogastric junction through the hiatus into the thorax.
 We describe an unusual presentation of a paraesophageal hernia, in which herniation of the splenic flexure of the colon led to colonic obstruction.
