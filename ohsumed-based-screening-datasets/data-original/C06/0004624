Evaluation of WC3 rotavirus vaccine and correlates of protection in healthy infants.
 The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of WC3 rotavirus vaccine was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of healthy infants 2-12 months of age; 103 received one dose of vaccine and 103 received placebo.
 Vaccination appeared to be safe and induced an antibody response (WC3 neutralizing antibody) in 97% of vaccinees.
 Only 9 (9%) of these, however, produced antibody to human rotavirus serotypes; at least 7 of the 9 were naturally infected before vaccination.
 Neither the number of symptomatic episodes of rotavirus diarrhea (21 vs 25) nor the number of moderate to severe rotavirus illnesses (9 vs.
 15) was significantly different in vaccine or placebo recipients, respectively, during a predominantly serotype 1 rotavirus season.
 A slight but significant decrease in mean symptom score was detected in vaccine recipients.
 Despite an overall lack of efficacy, protection could be correlated to previous rotavirus infection, high levels of WC3 neutralizing antibody, and preexisting (maternal) serotype 1 neutralizing antibody with a titer greater than or equal to 30.
