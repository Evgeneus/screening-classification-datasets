Bleeding peptic ulcer after abdominal aortic aneurysm surgery.
 A retrospective study of 112 patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) and 232 with arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) demonstrated that 16.7% of those with AAA and 1.6% of those with ASO had a history of gastroduodenal ulcer; 83% of these lesions with AAA were gastric ulcers.
 Ulcer bleeding after vascular reconstruction developed in seven patients with AAA and one with ASO.
 Serum fibrinogen levels and platelet counts were significantly lower in patients with AAA than in those with ASO or controls.
 A prospective study showed that 25 (52.1%) of 48 patients with AAA and six (20.0%) of 30 patients with ASO had endoscopically proved gastroduodenal lesions before vascular reconstruction.
 None of them developed postoperative bleeding after treatment of both their gastroduodenal lesions and coagulopathy.
 Furthermore, the significant decrease in blood flow and prostaglandin content of gastric mucosa was demonstrated in patients with AAA.
