Pathogenetic role of Helicobacter pylori in duodenal ulcer disease. Multivariate analysis of factors affecting relapse.
 The pathogenesis of duodenal ulcer disease is multifactorial and the contribution of Helicobacter pylori in relation to the other factors to the release of duodenal ulcer is unknown.
 To investigate this, we studied 147 patients with endoscopically proven healed ulcers.
 These patients were randomized to receive either placebo, misoprostol 200 micrograms or misoprostol 300 micrograms four times daily, and clinical, personal, physiological and endoscopic characteristics were obtained prospectively.
 Endoscopy was performed at the active phase of the ulcer and when the ulcer healed.
 Biopsies were taken from the antrum to assess histologically for: (1) the activity of gastritis as assessed by the degree of polymorph infiltration, (2) the degree of chronic inflammation by the degree of chronic inflammatory cells infiltration and degree of mucosal degeneration, and (3) bacteriologically for the presence of H.
 pylori.
 The severity of the gastritis and the bacterial density were graded independently by two pathologists.
 The patients were assessed at two-month intervals for 12 months or until the ulcer relapsed.
 The results demonstrated that the relapse rates of duodenal ulcer were similar in the three treatment groups.
 The relapse rate was higher in the group with higher density of the bacteria (P less than 0.05).
 The degree of gastritis did not affect the relapse rate of duodenal ulcer in either the placebo or misoprostol group or in all patients combined.
 Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified that increased duodenal inflammation, male sex, early-onset disease, and H.
 pylori adversely affected relapse of the ulcer.
 We conclude that multiple factors affect the relapse of duodenal ulcer and H.
 pylori is one of them.
