Local anesthesia blocks the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture.
 The incidence of postoperative illness was monitored for 6 hours in 74 women premedicated with nalbuphine, 10 mg, and undergoing short gynecologic operations of similar duration under methohexitalnitrous oxide-oxygen anesthesia.
 Each patient received P6 acupuncture for 5 minutes at the time of administration of premedication.
 In random order the site of the acupuncture had been previously infiltrated with normal saline solution in half of the patients and 1% lidocaine in the remaining patients.
 Postoperative emetic sequelae occurred significantly more often in those who received lidocaine compared with the group that received saline solution.
 This demonstrates the ability of a local anesthetic administered at the point of stimulation to block the antiemetic action of P6 acupuncture in a manner similar to that shown by others for analgesia.
