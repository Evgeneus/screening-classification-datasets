Spinal anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in high-risk neonates.
 To avoid the high incidence of respiratory complications associated with general anaesthesia in premature neonates, 44 spinal anaesthetics for inguinal hernia repair in very low birthweight infants were administered in 47 attempts.
 Hyperbaric tetracaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was administered in a dose range of 0.27-1.10 mg.kg-1.
 Attempted lumbar puncture failed in three infants.
 In 24 procedures, spinal anaesthesia alone provided satisfactory operating conditions; in 20, supplementary inhalational general anaesthesia or iv ketamine was necessary.
 Perioperative apnoeic episodes requiring bag/mask assisted ventilation occurred in six infants.
 In five infants, apnoeic spells occurred in the postoperative period.
 No infant required tracheal intubation; there was no haemodynamic instability.
 Twenty-four infants required no postoperative analgesia.
 Our experience suggests that spinal anaesthesia for inguinal hernia repair in very low birth weight infants reduces but does not eliminate the risk of respiratory instability, and that supplementary anaesthesia is often necessary to provide satisfactory operating conditions.
