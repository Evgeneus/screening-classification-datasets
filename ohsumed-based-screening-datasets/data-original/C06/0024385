Radiologic features of closed loop obstruction: analysis of 25 confirmed cases.
 The obstruction of a segment of bowel at two points results in a closed loop obstruction.
 Progression to strangulation is not an invariable component of this entity when surgical intervention is delayed.
 Enteroclysis is increasingly being used to evaluate obstruction of the small intestine.
 The authors retrospectively analyzed 25 surgically confirmed cases of closed loop obstruction and noted four enteroclysis features suggestive of the diagnosis: (a) crossing defects obstructing two segments of a loop of bowel secondary to dense adhesive bands (14 patients), (b) focal fixation of two limbs or twisting of the folds at the point of obstruction suggestive of volvulus (three patients), (c) abdominal wall herniation with obstruction (six patients), and (d) focal intraperitoneal segregation of a loop of bowel with tight obstruction suggestive of internal herniation (two patients).
 Recognition of the different patterns allows prompt preoperative radiologic diagnosis prior to strangulation.
