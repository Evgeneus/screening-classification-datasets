Treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal.
 Progress in the prognosis of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal has followed the use of multimodality therapy.
 From 1977 to 1985, 42 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal were treated with mitomycin C (15 mg/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (750 mg/m2) on day 1, 5-FU (750 mg/m2/d) alone on days 2 to 5, and radiation therapy (3000 cGy) on days 7 to 28.
 They were evaluated 4 to 6 weeks after completion of the chemotherapy/radiation therapy protocol and received local excision, abdominoperineal resection, or both.
 Patient follow-up times ranged from 7 to 161 months, with a mean follow-up time of 71 months.
 Pathologic examination showed no residual carcinoma in 19 (45%) patients.
 The authors could not predict, based on clinical evaluation, which patients would have a complete response.
 Of the patients with a complete clinical response, 44% had tumor in the pathology specimen.
 Wide local excision was the most common initial operation (23 of 42 patients; 55%), with five of these patients subsequently requiring abdominoperineal resection.
 Anal continence was retained in 18 of 42 (43%) patients.
 Eleven patients experienced recurrent disease: six local recurrences, one distant, and four both local and distant.
 The 5-year overall survival rate was 82% and the 5-year disease-specific survival rate was 87%.
 There were no treatment related deaths.
 Preoperative tumor size was the only factor significantly related to survival.
 Contrary to other reports, tumor in the pathology specimen did not adversely affect long-term survival.
 Hence, patients should be treated after chemotherapy/radiation therapy with surgical therapy sufficient to control local disease.
