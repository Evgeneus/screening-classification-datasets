Helicobacter pylori and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
 Helicobacter pylori (previously Campylobacter pylori) is almost invariably associated with chronic duodenal ulcer disease.
 The relationship between H.
 pylori infection and duodenal ulcer in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is unknown.
 We investigated the frequency of H.
 pylori infection in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and also what effect H.
 pylori infection had on gastric function in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
 H.
 pylori infection was diagnosed based on a specific serologic (ELISA) assay based on high-molecular-weight cell-associated proteins of H.
 pylori.
 We studied 20 patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome; 15 men and 5 women ranging in age from 24 to 71 years, median age 51.
 Six Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients had H.
 pylori infection compared to 100 consecutive patients with chronic recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (P less than 0.05).
 Pretreatment basal acid output in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome patients ranged from 7.9 to 95.0 mmol/hr, median 35.2.
 Pentagastrin-stimulated maximal acid output ranged from 8.5 to 132 mmol/hr; median 52.7.
 Acid secretion was lower in the H.
 pylori-infected patients than the uninfected patients (BAO 24.5 +/- 6.5 vs 45.4 +/- 6.6, and MAO 44.3 +/- 11.8 vs 67.9 +/- 10.7, for H.
 pylori infected vs uninfected patients, respectively).
 The difference in BAO was statistically significant (P less than 0.05).
 The present results indicate that H.
 pylori is not a major contributing factor in duodenal ulcer associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.
 The association of a reduced BAO with H.
 pylori suggests that these findings may be related.
