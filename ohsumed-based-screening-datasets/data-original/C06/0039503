Bacterial translocation.
 The phenomenon of bacterial translocation, the movement of viable indigenous microorganisms across the intestinal epithelial barrier, has been recognized for almost 100 years.
 At the present time, the precise mechanism of microbial transport is unknown.
 Active epithelial uptake and phagocyte-mediated transport have been proposed as likely explanations for the extraintestinal movement of bacteria to mesenteric lymph nodes and distant organ sites.
 Translocation has been proposed as the pivotal process associated with intestinal origin portal sepsis in seriously ill and immunocompromised patients.
 While several etiologic factors can be implicated in the pathogenesis of bacterial translocation, the present clinical implications are based almost solely on studies of dogs, rats and mice.
 Present investigations continue to suggest a causal relationship between intestinal mucosal integrity and infection by indigenous gastrointestinal bacteria.
