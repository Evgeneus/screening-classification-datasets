Hepatitis C in liver transplant recipients.
 HCV infection is commonly found in patients with chronic liver disease undergoing liver transplantation.
 However, the presence of antibody to HCV does not appear to be associated with the development of hepatitis posttransplant.
 No other risk factors were identified that appear to predispose patients to development of hepatitis in the posttransplant period, including amount of blood product exposure.
 The role of immunosuppression in the acquisition and expression of liver disease caused by HCV remains to be determined.
