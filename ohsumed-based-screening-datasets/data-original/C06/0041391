Chemical peritonitis associated with intraperitoneal vancomycin.
 A case of chemical peritonitis associated with intraperitoneal vancomycin is reported.
 A 23-year-old woman presented with signs and symptoms consistent with a chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis catheter exit-site infection.
 Intraperitoneal vancomycin (Vancoled) 1 g was given, followed by 25 mg/L into each subsequent exchange.
 On day 4 the patient developed abdominal pain and cloudy dialysis effluent.
 The vancomycin was discontinued, and the dialysate cleared by day 8.
 Fluid cultures were negative, and Staphylococcus aureus was isolated from the exit site.
 Subsequent intravenous vancomycin, and smaller intraperitoneal doses, failed to repeat the event.
 Fluid and serum white blood cell count, serum immunoglobulins and complement, culture results, and the temporal relationship are strongly suggestive of a vancomycin-induced chemical peritonitis.
