Medical treatment of peptic ulcer disease.
 Our understanding of PUD and its treatment has improved dramatically during the past 15 years.
 During this time, many new effective drugs have been approved by the FDA, and possibly even more potent and effective therapies are now being evaluated.
 The H2-blockers, sucralfate, and antacids heal over 90% of duodenal ulcers in 6 to 8 weeks, and H2-blockers heal about 80% of gastric ulcers by 8 weeks and over 90% by 12 weeks.
 The new, more potent pump blockers (omeprazole) promise to be even more effective drugs, even for the healing of patients who are taking NSAIDS.
 However, the potential hazards of marked, long-term acid suppression must still be evaluated.
 Maintenance therapy with H2-blockers or sucralfate, ideally used for patients who would otherwise have frequent symptomatic recurrences of duodenal ulcer disease or who have had complications, reduces the relapses, especially symptomatic relapses.
 Maintenance therapy with H2-blockers also seems to reduce the recurrences of GUD, but this use has not yet received FDA approval.
 Elimination of H.
 pylori infection with antibiotics may prove to reduce recurrent ulcer disease and negate the need for maintenance therapy.
 Colloidal bismuth subcitrate alone, which suppresses but does not eradicate H.
 pylori infection, seems to be an effective ulcer drug and may even reduce the rate of early recurrences.
 Effective ulcer therapy, especially if it prevents recurrent disease, may reduce the complications of PUD, but this expectation has yet to be established.
 The use of prophylactic cytoprotective prostaglandins (misoprostol) reduces the incidence of NSAID-induced GUD.
