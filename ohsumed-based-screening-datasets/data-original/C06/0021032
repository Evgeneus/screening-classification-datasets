Should urologists wear spectacles for transurethral resection of the prostate?
 Contamination of the eyes by irrigation fluid during transurethral resection (TUR) of the prostate was assessed by measuring droplet splashes on to spectacles worn by 2 surgeons.
 During 30 consecutive operations, droplet splash contamination occurred during every procedure.
 The number of splashes increased with time.
 The use of spectacles during TUR will reduce the risks of eye contamination from droplet splashes and therefore the possibility of transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus from infected patients.
