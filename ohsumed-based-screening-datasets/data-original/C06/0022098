Resolution of cirrhotic glomerulonephritis following successful liver transplantation.
 A 38-year-old man with liver failure due to Laennec's cirrhosis developed nephrotic range proteinuria and hematuria.
 Renal biopsy showed membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis with 2+ staining for IgA and complement consistent with cirrhotic glomerulonephritis.
 After orthotopic liver transplantation, proteinuria and hematuria rapidly resolved.
 This case indicates that glomerulonephritis associated with cirrhosis may be successfully treated with hepatic transplantation.
 Whether the improvement in glomerular abnormalities resulted from immunosuppression therapy or from restoration of normal hepatic function is unknown.
