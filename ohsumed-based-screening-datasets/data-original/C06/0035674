Common bile duct and intrahepatic stones: results of transhepatic electrohydraulic lithotripsy in 50 patients.
 Percutaneous, transhepatic, intracorporeal, electrohydraulic shock wave lithotripsy was performed in 50 patients after failure of endoscopic treatment (n = 43) or directly in patients with a strictured hepaticojejunostomy (n = 7).
 Twenty-seven patients had common bile duct stones; 23, intrahepatic stones.
 Three steps were used: A transhepatic bilicutaneous fistula was created, a wide communication between the bile duct and the gut was established, and contact shock wave lithotripsy was performed under endoscopic guidance.
 Afterward, 46 patients were free of stones.
 In four patients with diffuse intrahepatic lithiasis, only 75% of stones could be cleared.
 Severe complications, seen in 11 patients (hemobilia necessitating transfusion [n = 6], bile duct perforation resulting in cholangitis [n = 3], acute pulmonary edema [n = 1], and hemothorax [n = 1]), were fatal in four patients; all occurred early in the study.
 The authors modified their technique by dilating the biliary tract in two sessions 3 days apart, waiting 6 days for the tract to mature, and then introducing the cholangioscope directly through the skin, significantly reducing complications and mortality (P less than .005).
