Gingival and cutaneous xanthomatosis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis. Report of a case.
 The first comprehensive case report of intraoral xanthomatosis associated with primary biliary cirrhosis is detailed.
 The lesions were present along the free gingival margin and labial vestibule.
 Crevicular fluid was noted to be tinged yellow.
 Generalized cutaneous eruptions were also seen.
 The xanthomas were attributed to the underlying hyperlipoproteinemia.
 Advanced progression of the hepatic disease necessitated a liver transplant.
 Disappearance of both oral and skin lesions were subsequently observed.
