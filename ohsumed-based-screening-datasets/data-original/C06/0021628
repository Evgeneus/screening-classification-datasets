Hyperdynamic circulation in cirrhosis: a role for nitric oxide?
 Hypotension, low systemic vascular resistance, and a reduced sensitivity to vasoconstrictors are features of cirrhosis.
 These cardiovascular changes might be the result of increased synthesis of a vasodilator.
 Nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator, is synthesised in and released from peripheral blood-vessels in man.
 Studies in animals indicate that bacterial endotoxin and cytokines induce NO synthase expression in vessel walls, with sustained NO release and consequent hypotension.
 Endotoxaemia is a common feature of cirrhosis; persistent induction of NO synthase may account for the associated haemodynamic changes.
