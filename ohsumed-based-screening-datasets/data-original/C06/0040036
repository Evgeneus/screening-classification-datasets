Attaching and effacing enteropathogenic Escherichia coli as a cause of infantile diarrhea in Bangkok.
 To identify Escherichia coli that cause infantile diarrhea in Bangkok, Thailand, E.
 coli isolated in a year-long study of infantile diarrhea were examined for O and H serotypes and virulence determinants.
 Classic enteropathogenic E.
 coli (EPEC) were isolated from 28 of 509 infants with diarrhea (cases) and 11 of 509 age-matched controls (P = .009; odds ratio [OR], 2.64).
 Most of this difference was attributable to EPEC adherence factor (EAF)-positive EPEC that produced an attachment and effacement lesion, as identified in the fluorescence actin staining assay, isolated from 13 cases and 1 control (P = .003; OR, 13.3).
 EAF-EPEC was isolated from 15 cases and 10 controls (P = .418; OR, 1.52) and EAF+ non-EPEC from 17 cases and 10 controls (P = .242; OR, 1.72).
 EAF+EPEC that caused an attachment and effacement lesion was found in 3% of children less than 6 months old with diarrhea who were studied in an outpatient clinic in Bangkok in 1988.
