Low serum levels of alpha-interferon, gamma-interferon, and interleukin-2 in alcoholic cirrhosis.
 The existence of cellular immune deficit in alcoholic cirrhosis, together with the role of alpha- and gamma-interferon and interleukin-2 in the immune system, led us to compare serum levels of these immune system mediators in a group of 40 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis classified according to Child-Pugh's grade of severity of liver disease and 23 healthy volunteers.
 Serum levels of alpha-IFN, gamma-IFN, and IL-2 were significantly depressed in alcoholic cirrhotics, with no significant differences between the different degrees of hepatic damage.
 The results suggest a profound alteration in the immune system of alcoholic cirrhotics, which may contribute to the development of the disease and the accompanying immune system deficit.
