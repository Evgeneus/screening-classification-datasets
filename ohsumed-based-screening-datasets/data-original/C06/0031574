The endocrine effects of long-term treatment with mifepristone (RU 486).
 Mifepristone (RU 486) is a compound with progesterone as well as cortisol-blocking activities.
 We investigated the endocrine effects of long-term therapy of 10 patients with meningiomas with 200 mg mifepristone daily for 1 yr.
 Most patients initially complained of nausea, vomiting, and/or tiredness.
 In four patients prednisone (7.5 mg/day) had to be given simultaneously in order to overcome these side-effects.
 In retrospect those patients who presented with the most severe side-effects showed the most rapidly occurring activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal-axis, as measured by an increase of circulating cortisol levels as well as of urinary cortisol excretion.
 Therapy with RU 486 activated the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, resulting in a resetting of this system at a higher level at which the diurnal rhythm and the responsiveness to CRH stimulation were maintained, whereas the sensitivity to dexamethasone had diminished.
 Secondarily the production of androstenedione and estradiol increased considerably.
 These endocrine changes were caused by the induction of partial cortisol receptor resistance during therapy with RU 486.
 The compensatory overproduction of androgens and consequently of estrogens during long-term RU 486 therapy might limit its use as a single treatment in the treatment of estrogen-dependent cancer.
