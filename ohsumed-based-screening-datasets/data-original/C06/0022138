Pilot study of sandostatin (octreotide) therapy of refractory HIV-associated diarrhea.
 Seventeen AIDS patients were enrolled in a prospective open-label dose-finding study of octreotide (Sandostatin) therapy for refractory diarrhea.
 Five were nonevaluable due to progression of AIDS symptomatology, and one was excluded because of lack of confirmation of HIV infection.
 Five of 11 evaluable patients responded to therapy (45%); two each at 50 micrograms and 100 micrograms, and one at 250 micrograms thrice daily doses.
 A sixth patient demonstrated a moderate reduction in stool volume at 250 micrograms thrice daily, which, although deemed clinically relevant, did not meet the criteria for response.
 On discontinuation of therapy, diarrhea recurred in all patients within 1-12 days, and responded to reinitiation of octreotide in those five patients who resumed treatment.
 Only one of the three patients with concurrent cryptosporidial infection responded to treatment.
 The drug was well tolerated, with mild symptomatology in three patients.
 Long-term treatment at a stable dose was effective in three of five treated patients for periods for seven months in one (moderate responder) and one year in two.
 One patient required dose increases to control symptoms, but after one year of treatment developed severe nausea following injections, which required dose cessation.
 One patient had partial control of his diarrhea for only three months despite two dose increases.
 These data suggest that octreotide may be of useful therapeutic value in HIV-associated diarrhea and that further studies are indicated.
