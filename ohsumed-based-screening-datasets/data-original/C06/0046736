Incidence and treatment of rejection episodes in primary orthotopic liver transplantation under FK 506.
 FK 506 therapy with low doses of steroids was adequate to control rejection in most liver recipients.
 Rejection episodes were readily reversed with single IV doses of methylprednisone or hydrocortisone.
 Short courses of OKT3 (3 to 5 days 5-10 mL) controlled severe rejections.
 The rate of retransplantation directly due to rejection was low (1.6%).
 There was a limited need for steroids either early or out to 6 to 12 months.
