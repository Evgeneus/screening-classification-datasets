Fibrin glue sealing of pancreatic injuries, resections, and anastomoses.
 Fibrin glue made with highly concentrated human fibrinogen and clotting factors was evaluated as a means of preventing pancreatic fistulas in 15 patients operated on for traumatic and nontraumatic conditions.
 Fibrin glue was applied directly to penetrating pancreatic injuries, pancreatic suture and staple lines in patients treated by partial resection, and pancreaticointestinal anastomoses.
 Postoperatively, no patient developed pancreatic fistulas, pancreatic abscesses, or pseudocysts.
 Fibrin glue sealing of pancreatic injuries, resections, and anastomoses may aid in preventing fistulas after pancreatic surgery.
 Additional potential uses include the sealing of pancreatic biopsy sites and occlusion of the pancreatic duct in pancreatic transplantation.
