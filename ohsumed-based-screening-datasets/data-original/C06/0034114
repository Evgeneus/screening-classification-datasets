Risks of leaving the gallbladder in situ after endoscopic sphincterotomy for bile duct stones.
 There is controversy concerning the subsequent clinical course of patients whose gallbladder is left in situ following successful endoscopic removal of stones from their common bile ducts.
 A total of 191 patients (median age 76 years) were reviewed between 12 and 100 months (mean 38 months) after endoscopic sphincterotomy.
 Ten patients (5.2 per cent) had symptoms requiring cholecystectomy which was uneventful, nine in the first year.
 Cholangitis at presentation or failure to fill the gallbladder by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography were not helpful in identifying these patients.
 Forty-nine (25.6 per cent) patients died during the review period from non-biliary pathology (usually cardiovascular).
 Elective cholecystectomy is not required in elderly patients with symptomatic bile duct stones if the common bile duct can be cleared of stones after endoscopic sphincterotomy.
