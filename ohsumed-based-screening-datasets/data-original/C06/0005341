Coccidioidomycosis during human immunodeficiency virus infection. A review of 77 patients.
 Through a retrospective review, we identified 77 previously unreported cases of coccidioidomycosis during HIV infection.
 Patients were classified into 1 of 6 categories based on their primary clinical presentation: 20 had focal pulmonary disease (Group 1), 31 had diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2), 4 had cutaneous coccidioidomycosis (Group 3), 9 had meningitis (Group 4), 7 had extrathoracic lymph node or liver involvement (Group 5), and 6 has positive coccidioidal serology without a clinical focus of infection (Group 6).
 Coccidioidal serologies were positive on initial testing in 83% of the patients in whom such serologic testing was performed.
 Sera from 39% of patients were positive for TP antibodies while 74% had CF antibodies.
 Eleven of 12 seronegative patients had pulmonary disease (Group 1 or 2).
 Serologic results of other patients sent to a single reference laboratory were similar, with 26% positive for immunodiffusion TP antibodies and 79% positive for immunodiffusion CF antibodies.
 For the 77 patients in this study, the CD4-lymphocyte count was below 0.250 X 10(9) cells/L in 46 of the 55 patients who had this test performed, and a low CD4 count was significantly associated with mortality (p less than 0.01).
 At the time of follow-up, 32 of the 77 patients (42%) had died.
 There were significantly more deaths in those with diffuse pulmonary disease (Group 2) than in other groups (p less than 0.001).
 Amphotericin B, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and itraconazole were all used as antifungal therapies.
 Outcome could not be related to the therapy used.
 Of note, 3 patients developed coccidioidomycosis while receiving ketoconazole for other conditions.
