Possible transmission of serum hepatitis in liver surgery with the ultrasonic dissector.
 When the ultrasonic dissector is used during liver surgery, the possibility exists of the transmission of virus to the attending hospital personnel because of unavoidable splashing of the irrigating solution.
 It becomes apparent from this study that the titer of hepatitis B surface antigen in the aspirated irrigating solution is almost the same level as that in the serum.
 We therefore strongly recommend that eye shields should be used in hepatic surgery when the ultrasonic dissector is in use.
