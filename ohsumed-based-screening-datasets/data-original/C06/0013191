The intracolonic bypass tube for left colon and rectal trauma. The avoidance of a colostomy.
 Traumatic perforations of the left colon and rectum are most frequently managed by procedures that include the formation of a colostomy.
 Primary repair without colostomy is much less commonly employed.
 We report nine patients with traumatic perforations of the left colon and rectum treated with the intracolonic bypass tube (ICBT) without concomitant colostomy.
 In all these patients we believe the standard treatment would have included fecal diversion.
 Four patients sustained blunt trauma and five sustained penetrating trauma.
 Healing of the colonic anastomosis occurred in all cases, and the ICBTs were passed per rectum between the tenth and nineteenth days postoperatively.
 On the basis of this study, we conclude that the ICBT has a role in the treatment of selected injuries of the left colon and rectum as a safe means of avoiding a colostomy.
