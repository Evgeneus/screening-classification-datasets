The influence of contamination of culture medium with hepatitis B virus on the outcome of in vitro fertilization pregnancies.
 Heat-inactivated human serum is added to the culture medium used for in vitro fertilization and other forms of assisted conception.
 Because one batch of pooled serum contained hepatitis B virus, an epidemic occurred among women participating in the treatment program.
 Seventy-nine women had serologic proof of hepatitis B infection.
 This incident gave the opportunity to study the effect of hepatitis B virus on pregnancy outcome and the newborn.
 The situation is unique because the preimplantation embryo was exposed to hepatitis B virus or the pregnancy was complicated by a (sub)clinical infection.
 Twenty-four women were or became pregnant while having an acute hepatitis B infection.
 Five pregnancies ended in abortion.
 The remaining 19 pregnancies ended in the birth of 24 children.
 No evidence for any harmful effect of exposure to hepatitis B virus in the embryonic or fetal period on the newborn could be found.
