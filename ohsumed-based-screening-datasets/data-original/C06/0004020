Pain on common bile duct injection during ERCP: does it indicate sphincter of Oddi dysfunction?
 The reproduction of a patient's biliary-type pain upon initial injection of contrast material into the common bile duct during diagnostic ERCP is a dramatic experience for both patient and physician.
 The significance of this phenomenon is not clear, but it is touted by some to be a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
 Sphincter of Oddi manometry was performed on 224 consecutive patients referred over a 2-year period for evaluation of post-cholecystectomy syndrome and suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
 All patients received only intravenous diazepam as premedication for ERCP.
 Delayed drainage time (greater than 45 min), bile duct dilation (greater than or equal to 12 mm), and a basal sphincter of Oddi pressure of greater than 40 mm Hg (mean +/- 3 SD) were considered elevated.
 We observed a reproduction of pain in 15 of 224 patients (6.7%) immediately following contrast injection.
 There was no correlation between pain on contrast injection and elevated basal sphincter of Oddi pressure, delayed common bile duct drainage, bile duct dilation, or abnormal liver enzymes.
 Therefore, we feel that reproduction of the patient's biliary-type pain associated with contrast injection of ERCP is not a provocative test for sphincter of Oddi dysfunction.
