Repeat operation for failure of antireflux procedures.
 The majority of patients who receive modern antireflux operations obtain substantial long-term relief of their symptoms.
 About 10% to 15% will have persistent or recurrent problems, some severe enough to warrant reoperation for correction.
 With careful symptom review, barium study, endoscopy, and manometry, the mechanism of failure becomes evident, and remedial surgical treatment may proceed.
 The results at reoperation are not as good as those of the primary procedure, which emphasizes the need for proper diagnosis and choice of procedure and for reliable execution of technique at the initial treatment.
