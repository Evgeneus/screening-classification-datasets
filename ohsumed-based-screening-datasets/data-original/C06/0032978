Optimal technique for detection of gallstones at injection cholecystography: in vitro analysis.
 Injection cholecystography is often employed during invasive gallbladder procedures to determine the number of gallstones that are present.
 The authors undertook this study to define the optimal radiographic technique for performance of injection cholecystography.
 Condoms filled with 100 mL of contrast medium at four different iodine concentrations (30%, 15%, 7.5%, and 3.8% [wt/vol]) and containing up to five 4-mm-thick gallstones or a single 10-mm-thick gallstone were radiographed in a 20-cm-deep water bath by using four kilovolt peak settings (70, 80, 90, and 100 kVp).
 Images were read by three radiologists who were blinded to the radiographic technique.
 significantly (P less than .05) improved Decreasing iodine concentration significantly (P less than .05) improved detection of 4-mm-thick gallstones at a constant kilovolt peak setting.
 However, increasing the kilovolt peak setting while using the same concentration of contrast medium had no statistically significant influence on gallstone detectability, although radiologists did indicate a preference for the high-kilovolt peak technique.
 Results of the authors' experiments showed that for detection of small gallstones at injection cholecystography, use of a low-concentration contrast medium and a high kilovolt peak setting is the recommended radiographic technique.
