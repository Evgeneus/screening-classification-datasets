Natural history of congestive gastropathy in cirrhosis. The Liver Study Group of V. Cervello Hospital.
 In a prospective study of the natural history of congestive gastropathy, 212 consecutive cirrhotic patients (75 treated with sclerotherapy) were included.
 Mean follow-up was 46 months.
 Mild gastropathy (mosaiclike pattern) was found in 110 patients and severe gastropathy (granular mucosa with cherry spots) was found in 20.
 Prevalence of Helicobacter pylori, formerly Campylobacter pylori, was 50% in patients without, 43% in those with mild, and 28% in those with severe gastropathy.
 Congestive gastropathy was significantly more frequent in patients treated with sclerotherapy (83% vs.
 50%, P less than 10(-5)).
 Sixty-month actuarial proportions of patients free of anemia (in the absence of hematemesis or melena), were 17% with severe, 62% with mild, and 93% without gastropathy (P less than 10(-8].
 Corresponding figures for overt bleeding were 25%, 73%, and 87% (P less than 10(-7], whereas those for survival were 46%, 72%, and 85% (P = 0.0005), respectively.
 A multivariate regression analysis supported the following conclusions: (a) sclerotherapy and the presence of large esophageal varices significantly increase the risk of congestive gastropathy, which (b) is a significant risk indicator of both chronic and overt bleeding but does not independently affect survival.
