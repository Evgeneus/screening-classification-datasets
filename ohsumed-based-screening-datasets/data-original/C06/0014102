Antibodies in anti-HBe-positive patient sera bind to an HBe protein expressed on the cell surface of human hepatoma cells: implications for virus clearance.
 The relevance of the recently described membrane-bound form of the HBe protein for the antiviral immune response was examined.
 The data show that antibodies in anti-HBe, but not in anti-HBc-positive human sera efficiently bind to the membrane expressed HBe.
 No evidence was obtained that the HBc can reach the cell surface in a form that can be detected with human antibodies.
 The findings suggest that the decline of virus titer that is usually observed after seroconversion from HBe to anti-HBe might be the result of an antibody-mediated elimination of infected cells.
