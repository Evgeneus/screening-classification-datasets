Use of azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine in the treatment of Crohn's disease.
 The efficacy and safety of therapy with azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine was studied in 78 patients with Crohn's disease.
 Mean duration of therapy was 1.6 years; 52 patients were treated greater than or equal to 6 months.
 All patients were also on other antiinflammatory medications.
 Evaluations included self-assessment and physician's assessment of well-being, functional capacity, general clinical response, clinical activities indices (National Foundation for Ileitis and Colitis/International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Harvey-Bradshaw), and achievement of specific therapeutic goals.
 General clinical condition improved in 70% of the patients.
 Median response time was 3 months.
 The average Harvey-Bradshaw score decreased 37% with therapy, and a decrease of greater than or equal to 30% occurred in 66% of the subjects.
 An overall 72% achievement rate for specified therapeutic goals included controlling refractory disease, 73%; corticosteroid "sparing," 76%; and lessening fistulization, 63%.
 Nine patients got worse despite therapy.
 Adverse effects requiring discontinuation of therapy occurred in 10%, whereas dosages were briefly lowered for mild side effects in another 10%.
 This study demonstrates the effectiveness and safety of azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine in the majority of selected patients with chronic, unremitting, or steroid-requiring Crohn's disease.
