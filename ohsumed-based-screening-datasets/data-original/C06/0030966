Portal venous barium intravasation complicating barium enema examination.
 Venous intravasation of contrast is a potentially life-threatening complication of the barium enema examination.
 A patient in whom portal venous contrast intravasation was nearly fatal is presented, and the significant morbidity and mortality from this unusual event is reviewed.
 Since barium infiltration into the venous system almost always occurs in the setting of altered mucosal integrity, this examination should be used cautiously in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or diverticulitis.
 Prompt recognition and rapid resuscitation are critical to the survival of patients with contrast intravasation.
