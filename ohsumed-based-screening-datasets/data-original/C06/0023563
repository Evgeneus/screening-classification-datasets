Gastrointestinal complications after cardiac transplantation: a spectrum of diseases.
 Cardiac transplantation has become an accepted treatment modality for end-stage cardiac failure.
 The gastrointestinal (GI) tract represents a potential source of posttransplant morbidity and mortality.
 To define the scope of this problem, records of all patients undergoing cardiac transplantation at UCLA between January 1984 and July 1989 were reviewed.
 In all, there were 120 patients (90 males and 30 females) with a mean age of 45.4 yr.
 Among them, there were 61 patients (51%) who developed a total of 112 posttransplant GI complications.
 Of the entire 120 patients, 41 (34%) developed minor complications and 20 (17%) sustained major GI morbidity.
 Eighteen patients (15%) underwent either endoscopy or surgical intervention.
 These data suggest that most cardiac transplant recipients will experience some form of GI complication, although most are minor and can be managed conservatively.
 However, when major, life-threatening complications occur, evaluation and intervention should proceed expeditiously.
 The gastroenterologist and GI surgeon should play complimentary roles in the care of these complicated patients.
