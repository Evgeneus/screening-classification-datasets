Dietary adjustments and nutritional therapy during treatment for oral-pharyngeal dysphagia.
 Dietary adjustments are an important part of the therapy for dysphagia.
 Once dysphagia is diagnosed, the patient must be nourished safely while being taught therapeutic and compensatory strategies for dealing with the swallowing disorder.
 The patient's nutritional status must be maintained despite any limitations on oral intake.
 Liquids may be thickened and the consistency of solid foods may be adjusted to ensure an adequate diet that is safe for the patient.
 When the patient cannot eat safely or take adequate amounts of food orally, an alternative feeding method should be instituted.
