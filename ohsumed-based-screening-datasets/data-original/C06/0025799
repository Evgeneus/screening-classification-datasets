Transinguinal dissection of the femoral artery for aorto-bifemoral bypass.
 The authors report a surgical technique for high approach to the common femoral artery, just below the inguinal ligament, which can be useful in cases of difficult dissection of the femoral region or those with diffuse fibrosis or multiple scars.
 It is also useful when there is a concomitant inguinal hernia to repair.
