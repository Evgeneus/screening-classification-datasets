Long-term survival in patients operated on for benign peptic ulcer disease.
 Survival rate was analysed in a cohort of 6459 patients who had undergone partial gastrectomy for benign ulcer disease and who had survived the first year after operation.
 The cohort was followed for 27-35 years.
 There was a slight but significant decrease in relative survival rate to 92 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval 87-97 per cent) 35 years after operation.
 No decrease in relative survival rate was observed during the first 20 years after operation.
 There was no difference by gender or surgical procedure, but patients operated on for gastric ulcer, compared with duodenal ulcer, and patients operated on at younger ages had a poorer relative survival rate.
 The effects of partial gastrectomy on survival, both overall and by diagnosis or age at operation, are probably attributable to confounding factors linked with the peptic ulcer disease rather than to the surgical procedure itself.
 We conclude that partial gastrectomy seems to have very little impact on survival once the patient has survived the first year after operation.
