Gastric duplication cyst communicating with the pancreatic duct: a rare cause of recurrent abdominal pain.
 A 41-year-old woman with recurrent attacks of postprandial abdominal pain was found on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography and subsequent computed tomographic scan to have an enteric duplication within the substance of the pancreas with communication to the pancreatic duct.
 Celiotomy demonstrated a noncontiguous gastric duplication cyst.
 Internal drainage was curative.
