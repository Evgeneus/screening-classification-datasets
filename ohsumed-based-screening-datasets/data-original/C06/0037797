Diverticulitis of the duodenum: clinical and radiological manifestations of seven cases.
 Seven patients with duodenal diverticulitis were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and various other abdominal imaging techniques.
 The series included four men and three women who ranged in age from 47 to 84 yr (mean: 65 yr).
 They had presented with epigastric or periumbilical pain, low-grade fever, leukocytosis, and loss of appetite and weight due to postprandial cramps or vomiting.
 In each instance, the abdominal CT examination proved crucial in the diagnosis of duodenal diverticulitis, with contained perforation or inflammatory changes involving the adjacent structures.
 Five patients underwent laparotomy while two others were treated conservatively with antibiotics and/or percutaneous drainage of peridiverticular abscess.
 The clinical and radiological features of this uncommon entity are herein described, along with a brief review of the medical literature regarding the current approach to its diagnosis and management.
