Impaired efficacy of selective LDL-apheresis in primary biliary cirrhosis.
 Low-density lipoprotein apheresis (LDL-apheresis) was done with either cascade filtration (DF) or dextran sulfate cellulose adsorption (DSC) in a patient with primary biliary cirrhosis who developed severe dyslipidemia associated with cholestasis and accumulation of lipoprotein-X (LP-X).
 The extracorporeal treatment was initially performed weekly, and resulted in a sharp drop in total cholesterol from 1038 to 430 mg/dl.
 During the next four months the patient was treated every 10-15 days, and pre-apheresis cholesterol levels were maintained between 438 and 505 mg/dl, until an orthotopic liver transplantation was successfully performed.
 With semi-selective DF a mean 47.1% of total cholesterol was removed per procedure compared to 30.0% with DSC, although the volume of treated plasma was 38.0 vs 49.9 ml/kg body weight.
 The changes in plasma cholesterol levels during DSC and DF showed that the kinetics of cholesterol removal were similar with both techniques, but the efficacy differed; DF removed both LDL and LP-X from plasma, whereas DSC selectively lowered the LDL content.
 Cascade filtration may therefore be considered as a first-choice treatment for patients with LP-X accumulation due to cholestasis.
