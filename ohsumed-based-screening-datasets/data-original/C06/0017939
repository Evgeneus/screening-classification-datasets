A field study of the safety and efficacy of two candidate rotavirus vaccines in a Native American population.
 A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a rhesus rotavirus vaccine and RIT 4237, a bovine rotavirus vaccine, in a Navajo population.
 Infants aged 2-5 months were randomized to receive one dose of either 10(4) pfu of the rhesus rotavirus vaccine or 10(8) pfu of the RIT 4237 vaccine or placebo.
 Eleven (10.2%) of 108 infants in the rhesus vaccine group, 11 (10.4%) of 106 in the RIT 4237 group, and 9 (8.4%) of 107 in the placebo group experienced rotavirus diarrhea during the follow-up period of 17 months.
 Thus, in this population, neither vaccine was efficacious in preventing rotavirus diarrhea.
