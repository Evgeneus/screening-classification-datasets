Prevention of irradiation-induced bowel discomfort by sucralfate: a double-blind, placebo-controlled study when treating localized pelvic cancer.
 Sucralfate, an aluminum hydroxide complex of sulfated sucrose used in the treatment of gastric ulcer, was shown to prevent irradiation-induced diarrhea and bowel discomfort significantly in patients treated for pelvic cancer with external radiotherapy with intent to cure.
 The double-blind placebo-controlled study included 70 patients with carcinoma of the prostate and urinary bladder without distant metastasis (T1-4NO1xMO) and performance status of greater than or equal to 90% Karnofsky scale.
 Radiotherapy was administered in a conventional manner with MeV photons and a four-field technique.
 The total dose was 62-66 Gy and total treatment time of 6.5 weeks.
 Dose granules of sucralfate or placebo were dispensed to each patient 2 weeks after radiation started and continued for 6 weeks.
 All analyses were performed blindly.
 Seven of 34 evaluable patients in the placebo group and 18 of 32 evaluable patients in the sucralfate group did not present with diarrhea during the observation period.
 The frequency of defecation and stool consistency were significantly improved by sucralfate.
 Fourteen patients in the placebo group and only three in the sucralfate group required symptomatic therapy with loperamide.
 There was no evidence of adverse effects associated with the use of sucralfate.
 Sucralfate can be of beneficial value in diminishing the bowel discomfort during radiotherapy of pelvic malignancies, and the earlier proposed mechanisms of action (e.g., protection of denuded mucosa, cytoprotective properties, binding bile acids) can also be valid for the current effects of sucralfate.
