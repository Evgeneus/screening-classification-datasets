Recurrent pneumoperitoneum following vaginal insufflation.
 The authors report a case of a 24-year-old nulligravida woman who presented to the hospital with complaints of severe abdominal pain and radiographic evidence of pneumoperitoneum.
 She had two prior nondiagnostic laparotomies for similar complaints and radiographic findings.
 After a careful sexual history was taken the patient revealed that she had sexual intercourse preceding every similar episode including this one, during which her partner forcefully blew air into her vagina.
 Pneumoperitoneum associated with vaginal insufflation has been previously reported in two multigravida patients with and without anatomic abnormalities.
 When pneumoperitoneum is present in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms or trauma, a meticulous sexual history should be made to avoid unnecessary laparotomies.
