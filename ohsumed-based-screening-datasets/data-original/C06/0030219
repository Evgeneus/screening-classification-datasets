Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: results of an early experience.
 Ninety consecutive patients over a 6-month period with acute (31 patients) or chronic (59 patients) cholecystitis underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy on an ambulatory (49 patients), one-night (33 patients), or two-night (5 patients) basis.
 Three patients required open procedures for 1) perforated duodenal ulcer at 48 h, postoperatively, 2) a cholecystoduodenal fistula, and 3) Mirizzis syndrome with erosion of the common duct.
 The procedure is safe, efficacious, and should be offered to patients with acute and chronic biliary disease.
