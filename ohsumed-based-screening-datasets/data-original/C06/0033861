Percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy for common bile duct stones: experience in four high-risk patients.
 Choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy was applied through a percutaneous transhepatic approach in four high-risk patients with common bile duct stones that were not extractable by duodenoscopic means.
 All stones were fragmented and removed from three patients, but one patient died from bronchopneumonia before ductal clearance could be achieved.
 The procedure was well tolerated, without any complication.
 The major disadvantage is the multiple maneuvers required and the prolonged hospital stay.
 Percutaneous transhepatic choledochoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy provides a safe and effective alternative for nonoperative treatment of common bile duct stones in high-risk patients when the duodenoscopic approach fails.
