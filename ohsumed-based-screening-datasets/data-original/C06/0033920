Gastric duplication cyst. Endoscopic presentation as an ulcerated antral mass.
 A case of a 53-year-old man who presented with epigastric pain and weight loss is described.
 Endoscopy showed a smooth antral mass with what appeared to be a central overlying ulcer.
 Computerized tomography and upper gastrointestinal series confirmed the presence of a gastric mass.
 Laparotomy and local resection showed a gastric duplication comprised of two cysts, one with communication to the stomach lumen.
 Gastric duplication is a rare entity, especially in the adult.
 Though generally benign, local ulceration or fistula formation can cause symptoms and may suggest a more malignant process that warrants investigation.
