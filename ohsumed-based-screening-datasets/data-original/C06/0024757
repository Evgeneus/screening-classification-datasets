Risk of peritonitis and fatal septicaemia and the need to defunction the low anastomosis.
 The aim of this study was to investigate the need to defunction the low anastomosis after anterior resection of the rectum with total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer.
 Two hundred consecutive patients (125 defunctioned, 75 non-defunctioned) undergoing low anterior resection for carcinoma were included in the study.
 Peritonitis requiring emergency laparotomy occurred in 8 per cent of the patients who did not have a defunctioning stoma compared with less than 1 per cent of those patients who had a defunctioning stoma (P less than 0.01).
 There was no mortality related to closure of the stoma but seven patients developed a faecal fistula and ten developed an incisional hernia.
 Despite current trends to avoid the defunctioning stoma, these results suggest that after total mesorectal excision the faecal stream should be temporarily diverted away from the anastomosis that is 6 cm or less from the anal verge to protect against potentially life-threatening anastomotic leakage.
