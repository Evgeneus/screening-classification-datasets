Gallbladder wall thickening (congestive cholecystopathy) in chronic liver disease: a sign of portal hypertension.
 A thickened gallbladder wall is often seen with ultrasound in alcoholic cirrhosis.
 Hypoalbuminaemia is thought to be the cause since there is a strong association between bowel wall thickening and low serum albumin.
 To determine the role of portal hypertension in producing gallbladder wall thickening we studied 40 consecutive stable patients-37 with cirrhosis and three with portal hypertension due to primary biliary cirrhosis.
 Ultrasound assessment of the gallbladder wall was made after an overnight fast using a Technicare autosector.
 Wall thickness 4 mm or greater was considered abnormal.
 Twenty-seven patients had a thickened gallbladder wall and all had evidence of portal hypertension.
 Hypoalbuminaemia was not an important factor since it was only present in six cases with thickened walls.
 In two cases reduction in portal pressure with oral propranolol was associated with a decrease in gallbladder wall thickness.
 These results suggest that portal hypertension, not hypoalbuminaemia, is the dominant factor causing gallbladder wall thickening in cirrhosis.
 Ultrasound demonstration of gallbladder wall thickening in chronic liver disease should suggest the presence of portal hypertension.
