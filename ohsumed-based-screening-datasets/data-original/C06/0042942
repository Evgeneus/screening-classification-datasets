Air enema for diagnosis and reduction of intussusception: clinical experience and pressure correlates.
 Air enema was used for exclusion, diagnosis, initial movement, and complete reduction of intussusception in 186 pediatric patients.
 Average pressure needed for initial movement of intussusception was 56.5 mm Hg; average maximum pressure of 97.8 mm Hg was required for complete reduction.
 Average fluoroscopy time required for intussusception reduction was 94.8 seconds; an average of 41.8 seconds was required to exclude intussusception.
 Intussusception was diagnosed in 75 patients, and reduction was accomplished in 65 (87%).
 Of 100 consecutive patients that underwent hydrostatic reduction of intussusception at the authors' institution, reduction was successful in 55.
 Compared with hydrostatic enema, air enema involves shorter fluoroscopy time and lower radiation dose to the patient.
 Air enema is safe and effective for diagnosis and treatment of intussusception in infants and children and has replaced hydrostatic enema for such procedures at the authors' institution.
