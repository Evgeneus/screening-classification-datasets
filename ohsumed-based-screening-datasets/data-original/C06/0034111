Colon perforation during colonoscopy: surgical versus conservative management.
 A survey of endoscopy units in the West Midlands, UK, was undertaken to ascertain the management of colonic perforation during colonoscopy.
 Fifteen perforations were reported from a total of 17,500 colonoscopies performed in 14 units (a rate of 0.09 per cent).
 In seven patients the diagnosis was suspected or diagnosed immediately and in the remaining eight 2-72 h later.
 Four patients with associated pathology (carcinoma, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and a polyp) had resection and primary anastomosis.
 Seven patients had a simple oversew, four of these having had a delayed diagnosis.
 In four cases the site of perforation was not identified, but only one patient had conservative treatment.
 Three patients had drainage and a defunctioning colostomy.
 There was no significant morbidity following treatment.
 It is recommended that patients who have had a good bowel preparation should be treated conservatively unless there is a large perforation or an underlying carcinoma.
