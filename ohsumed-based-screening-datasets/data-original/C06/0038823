Results of surgical therapy for biliary dyskinesia.
 One hundred eighty-seven patients who presented with symptoms consistent with biliary colic but had no ultrasonic evidence of cholelithiasis were observed in an effort to identify those with a functional gallbladder disorder that might benefit from surgical intervention.
 All patients underwent quantitative evaluation of gallbladder emptying using cholecystokinin biliary scanning, and ejection fractions less than 35% were considered abnormal.
 One hundred twenty-nine patients (69%) had abnormal ejection fractions, and 88 (68%) of these subsequently underwent cholecystectomy.
 Sixty of the surgical specimens revealed pathologic changes.
 Eighty-four percent of patients successfully contacted for follow-up experienced complete relief, and another 13% had partial relief of preoperative symptoms.
 Only two patients reported no change in symptom complex.
 Twenty-nine patients with abnormal ejection fractions elected not to undergo surgery.
 Fifty-nine percent of these patients continued to experience symptoms of biliary colic at a mean follow-up of 22 months.
 Of the 44 patients with normal ejection fractions, 35 (80%) reported resolution of symptoms during follow-up of medical treatment.
 Cholecystokinin biliary scanning can help identify patients with acalculous, functional gallbladder disease who may benefit from cholecystectomy.
