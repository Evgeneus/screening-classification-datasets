Effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal repair in rats with experimental chronic diarrhea.
 Nucleic acid synthesis in tissues of rapid growth is preferentially done using dietary purines and pyrimidines via the salvage pathway.
 In the case of a low protein intake, dietary nucleotides may be semiessential for cell replication of gut, lymphocytes, and bone marrow, and especially in those intestinal diseases in which the mucosa is altered, dietary nucleotides may have a role in intestinal development.
 The effect of dietary nucleotides on intestinal weight and length, gut mucosal weight, intestinal protein and DNA contents, and lactase, maltase, and intestinal mucosal activities was assessed in a controlled way.
 Weanling (21-day-old) rats were separated into two groups of 36, each receiving blindly a basal diet containing glucose polymers (C) or a basal diet with lactose as the main carbohydrate (L) for 15 days.
 Those fed with L developed a syndrome of chronic diarrhea and malnutrition.
 Ten rats of each group were sacrificed at that time.
 The rest of the animals of each group were separated into two subgroups.
 The first was fed with the C diet and the second with the C diet supplemented with 50 mg/100 g of each of the following nucleotides: AMP, GMP, CMP, UMP, and IMP (CN).
 Thus the subgroups CC, CN, LC, and LN were formed.
 Rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks and gut separated into three segments corresponding to duodenum, jejunum, and ileum.
 Analysis of variance was used to compare the effect of diet or segments.
 DNA and lactase, maltase, and sucrase activities increased in the LN group with respect to LC especially in jejunum and ileum but there were not any differences between CC and CN.
