Anorectal function in incontinent patients with cerebrospinal disease.
 Anorectal manometry and the electrical activity of the external anal sphincter were measured in 20 patients with well-defined, incomplete spinal lesions who were referred because of fecal incontinence and in 30 normal subjects.
 Six patients had a high spinal lesion, 11 had a low spinal lesion, and 3 had mixed high and low spinal lesions.
 Patients with high spinal lesions had normal basal pressures but abnormally low squeeze pressures and impaired rectal sensation.
 Unlike normal subjects, there was no relationship between the depth of sphincter relaxation and the distention volumes.
 The external sphincter responses to rectal distention and increases in intraabdominal pressure were enhanced, and leakage of perfusion fluid was uncommon.
 Patients with low spinal lesions had abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, blunted rectal sensation, and showed impaired external anal sphincter responses to rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressures.
 Most of these patients leaked the infused fluid during these maneuvers.
 Sphincter function in patients with mixed lesions was more severely impaired than in patients with low and high spinal lesions.
 Patients with mixed lesions showed abnormally low basal and squeeze pressures, impaired rectal sensation, and no external anal sphincter responses to either rectal distention or increases in intraabdominal pressure.
 Leakage occurred during these maneuvers in all patients with mixed lesions.
