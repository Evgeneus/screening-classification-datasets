Endoscopic treatment of biliary tract strictures in sclerosing cholangitis: a larger series and recommendations for treatment.
 We report a group of 35 patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis who had long-term follow-up after endoscopic treatment of major ductal strictures in the primary or secondary biliary ducts.
 Our patients were all symptomatic with ascending cholangitis or jaundice.
 There was significant improvement as measured by clinical parameters of hospitalization rates and laboratory data and comparable radiography.
 Long-term follow-up averaged 24 (+/- 2.8 months).
 We believe endoscopic treatment of sclerosing cholangitis should be attempted in selected symptomatic cases with major ductal strictures before liver transplantation.
