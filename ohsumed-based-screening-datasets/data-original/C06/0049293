Flow characteristics of enteral feeding with psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid added.
 One therapy for managing diarrhea in patients in intensive care units who are receiving enteral nutrition is administration of psyllium hydrophilic mucilloid (PHM).
 This laboratory study was conducted to determine whether the addition of PHM (Metamucil) to enteral feeding formula (Entrition) adversely affected the flow characteristics of the feeding formula through a small-bore feeding tube.
 Descriptive data were obtained from 72 trials of feeding formula with varied infusion rates, formula osmolality and temperature, and PHM concentrations.
 Two thirds (n = 48) of the trials were successful (PHM did not clog the tubing and obstruct flow).
 The remaining one third of the trials (n = 24) were unsuccessful.
 Successful formula infusion was influenced by formula temperature and osmolality but not by infusion rate, PHM concentration, or flow interruption.
 If formula with PHM was followed by formula without PHM, the infusion was successful regardless of infusion rate or formula osmolality.
 Thus, the data from this laboratory study indicate that when therapeutic doses of PHM are prescribed, it is feasible for PHM to be mixed in room-temperature feeding formula and infused without clogging the feeding tube.
