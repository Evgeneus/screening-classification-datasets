Randomized controlled trial of prophylactic rifampin for peritoneal dialysis-related infections.
 Staphylococcal infections are a major cause of catheter infections and peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients.
 Since catheter-related infections are associated with nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus in this population, we studied the effect of intermittent rifampin, an antibiotic known to decrease S aureus nasal carriage, on catheter-related infections and peritonitis.
 We randomly assigned 64 patients to receive either rifampin 300 mg twice daily for 5 days every 3 months or no treatment.
 The rifampin-treated patients had a significant delay in time to first catheter-related infection (P less than 0.015) and significantly fewer catheter-related infections overall (P less than 0.001).
 The catheter-related infection rate in rifampin-treated patients was .26 per patient-year versus .93 per patient-year in untreated patients.
 Multivariate analysis defined baseline colonization of nares or catheter exit-site and prior renal transplant as risk factors for catheter-related infections.
 There was no significant difference in peritonitis rates between groups, although the trend was for a delayed time to first episodes and fewer episodes in rifampin-treated patients.
 Adverse effects necessitated withdrawal of rifampin in four patients.
 We conclude that intermittent rifampin administration is effective in decreasing catheter-related infections in a peritoneal dialysis population.
