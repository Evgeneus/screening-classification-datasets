Bleeding gastroesophageal varices: gastric vein embolization after partial portal decompression.
 Shunts that decompress the portal vein are effective in the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices.
 Use of large-caliber portacaval shunts, however, results in the complete decompression of the portal system and the risk of subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy.
 Use of small-caliber portacaval shunts results in mild portal hypertension and less frequent hepatic encephalopathy but may increase the risk of recurrent bleeding.
 Thirty-three patients underwent angiography after partial decompression portacaval shunting (median trans-shunt pressures, 8 mm Hg).
 Embolization of residual varices, noted in 13 patients, was performed.
 Results included one complication with no sequelae and no bleeding a mean of 13 months after the procedure was performed.
 Trans-shunt embolization of esophageal varices effectively prevents bleeding varices after partial portal decompression.
