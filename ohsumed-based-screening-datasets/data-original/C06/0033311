Transanal electrostimulation for fecal incontinence: clinical, psychologic, and manometric prospective study.
 A prospective study was carried out to analyze the clinical, psychologic, and manometric short-term results of transanal electrostimulation (TES) in the treatment of fecal incontinence.
 Fifteen patients underwent TES.
 An initial clinical and manometric assessment was carried out before and 1 month after the procedure.
 A psychologic evaluation was also performed by means of interviews and appropriate tests.
 Early improvement of symptoms was noted in 10 patients.
 The nonresponders were women with gross daily incontinence to solid stool.
 At anal manometry, resting tone and rectal sensation remained unchanged, whereas a significant increase of voluntary contraction was observed following TES (from 48 +/- 26 to 59 +/- 39 mm Hg, P = 0.03).
 Psychologically, TES led to a significant decrease of both latent and paranoid anxiety related to symptoms (P = 0.02).
 At a clinical reassessment 6 months later, one of the nonresponders became continent after a further course of TES.
 In conclusion, TES is well accepted by the patients, is followed by positive emotional response, and, by improving striated sphincter function, seems to be effective in the treatment of partial fecal incontinence.
