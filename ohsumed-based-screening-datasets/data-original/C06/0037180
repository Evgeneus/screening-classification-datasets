Vaccination for prevention of CAPD associated staphylococcal infection: results of a prospective multicentre clinical trial.
 124 stable CAPD patients from 8 Australian and 3 New Zealand centers were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion to one of two groups to study the effect of vaccination using commercial preparations consisting of a combined staphylococcus toxoid and whole killed staphylococci (SB) or normal saline solution (SS) on the incidence of peritonitis and exit site infection and S.
 aureus nasal carriage over a 12-month prospective period.
 In addition, levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 and C4 were monitored during the trial period in serum and dialysate; serum levels of anti-alpha hemolysin and dialysate levels of fibronectin and specific antistaphylococcal antibodies were also measured.
 Over the period, treatment with SB or SS did not affect the incidence of peritonitis, catheter-related infection or S.
 aureus nasal carriage.
 However, vaccination with SB elicited a significant increase in the level of serum anti-alpha hemolysin throughout the 12 month duration of the study, although the level of increase was unrelated to the subsequent rate of peritonitis.
 Vaccination with SB but not SS elicited a significant increase in the dialysate level of specific antibodies against S.
 aureus.
 Serum levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were within the normal range in the CAPD patients studied and remained unaffected by vaccination with SB.
 In addition, dialysate levels of IgG, IgA, IgM, complement C3 and C4 were 50-100 times lower than corresponding serum levels and remained unaffected by vaccination.
 In summary, immunisation with an anti-staphylococcal agent was not successful in reducing peritonitis or exit site infection in CAPD patients.
