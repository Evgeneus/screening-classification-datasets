Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy versus cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones.
 To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy vs.
 cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallstones, a model was constructed that projects charges and survival for both treatments.
 For a 45-year-old woman with one small stone, treatment with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy rather than cholecystectomy is projected to result in an average gain of only 3 days of life and an average increase in direct medical charges of $1729 over 5 years of follow-up.
 The resulting marginal cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy vs.
 cholecystectomy is $216,000 of extra charges per year of life gained with extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy.
 Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to be much more cost-effective for elderly than for young patients (10-20-fold difference), but considerably less cost-effective for multiple stones than a single stone (2-4-fold difference), and less cost-effective for women than men (twofold difference).
 Adjusting for effects of morbidity on quality of life, extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy is projected to have slightly better quality-adjusted survival than cholecystectomy for the small subset of patients with one stone (by 8 to 43 days at 5 years) but not for young patients with multiple stones.
 It is concluded that decisions about appropriate use of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy should consider the effects of patient characteristics on clinical and economic outcomes.
