Ultrasonic evaluation of gallbladder function prior to non-surgical treatment of gallstones.
 A comparative analysis of ultrasonic and oral cholecystographic assessment of gallbladder function in symptomatic patients with cholelithiasis is presented.
 Ultrasonic evaluation demonstrated non-contractile gallbladders in all but one patient with non-opacification during oral cholecystography, whereas all those opacifying on oral cholecystography contracted on ultrasonography.
 Both techniques showed similar abilities to quantify the size and number of biliary calculi within the limits necessary to determine suitability for treatment.
 Although computed tomography remains necessary to quantify gallstone density prior to non-surgical treatment, ultrasonography is a safe, acceptable, cheap and preferable alternative to oral cholecystography in assessing gallbladder function.
