Sclerotherapy of bleeding esophageal varices using a thrombogenic cocktail.
 The short- and long-term efficacy of a thrombogenic sclerosant (1% tetradecyl sulfate, thrombin, and cefazolin) was studied in 101 patients.
 The majority of patients had alcoholic cirrhosis with Child's C classification (84/101).
 Bleeding was controlled in 94 per cent of patients with the first sclerotherapy.
 In-hospital and early (within 6 weeks) mortality were 14 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively.
 There was a strong correlation with hospital mortality and the severity of hepatic disease.
 Long-term follow-up in 70 patients (mean of 16 months) showed that survival correlated with compliance to follow-up sclerotherapy and abstention from further alcohol intake.
 Mortality in patients compliant with follow-up was 5 per cent (1/19), as compared with 24 per cent (12/51) in patients who were not compliant with follow-up sclerotherapy.
 The mortality in alcoholic cirrhotic patients who abstained from further alcoholic intake was 6 per cent (1/17), as compared with 23 per cent (10/44) in those who continued to abuse alcohol.
 No systemic thrombotic or allergic events related to the use of bovine thrombin were noted during a total of 349 sclerotherapy sessions.
