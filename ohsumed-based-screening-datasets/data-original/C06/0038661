Abnormal esophageal transit in patients with typical reflux symptoms but normal endoscopic and pH profiles.
 There is a small, well-known cohort of patients who, despite classic reflux symptoms, have a normal esophageal pH profile and endoscopic picture.
 The treatment of these patients has proved problematic.
 In an attempt at determining the pathophysiology of this subgroup, we investigated the esophageal transit, using the radiolabeled solid bolus esophageal egg transit technique, in 58 such patients: 25 males, 33 females, mean age 39.5 years (range: 13 to 65 years).
 The egg transit was normal in 31 (53.4%) patients.
 In the remaining 27 (46.6%) patients, the condensed image analysis showed the following specific abnormal transit patterns: "step" delay pattern, demonstrating segmental hold-up in mid- or distal esophagus in 16 (59.3%); nonspecific delay in 6 (22.2%); oscillatory pattern in 3 (11.1%); and total nonclearance during the study period (4 minutes) in 2 (7.4%) patients.
 The patients with abnormal transit patterns had demographic parameters and symptom scores similar to those found in patients with normal transit.
 This study shows that almost 50% of patients with reflux symptoms and negative pH and endoscopy have abnormal esophageal transit, and almost two thirds of these patients display segmental transit delay in the lower half of the esophagus.
 The effect on symptomatology by prokinetic agents in the patient subgroup needs evaluation.
