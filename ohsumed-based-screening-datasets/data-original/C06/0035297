Detection of tissue injury after extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy of gallstones.
 We evaluated seven patients undergoing gallstone lithotripsy for evidence of hepatic or renal trauma after each of 10 lithotripsy treatments.
 Postlithotripsy magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sonography showed no evidence of hepatic or renal injury as compared with baseline studies.
 Four treatments resulted in sonographic evidence of gaseous hepatic microbubbles (analogous to "the bends") due to cavitation effects of the shockwaves.
 Three of these four treatments produced serum glutamicoxaloacetic transaminase and -pyruvic transaminase elevation.
 One patient had microscopic hematuria.
 Minimal tissue damage results from gallstone lithotripsy.
 MRI and ultrasound, performed after lithotripsy, appear to be less sensitive than transaminasemia in detecting this low-grade injury.
