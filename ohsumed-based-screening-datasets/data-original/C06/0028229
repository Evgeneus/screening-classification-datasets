Altered swallowing function in elderly patients without dysphagia: radiologic findings in 56 cases.
 Swallowing disorder is an increasing problem in our aging population.
 A majority of these patients have a functional abnormality of the oral, pharyngeal, and/or esophageal stage of swallowing.
 However, what constitutes normalcy is not well understood, and baseline swallowing in elderly persons without dysphagia has not been adequately described.
 We therefore evaluated 56 persons with a mean age of 83 years who had no symptoms of dysphagia or eating difficulty.
 Videofluoroscopy and radiographs with the subject erect and recumbent were obtained.
 Normal deglutition, as defined in young persons, was present in only 16%.
 Oral abnormalities (difficulty ingesting, controlling, and delivering bolus relative to swallowing initiation) were seen in 63%.
 Pharyngeal dysfunction (bolus retention and lingual propulsion or pharyngeal constrictor paresis) was seen in 25%.
 Pharyngoesophageal segment abnormalities were observed in 39% (mostly cricopharyngeal muscle dysfunction).
 Esophageal abnormalities (mostly motor in nature) were observed in 36%.
 What has been described as swallowing dysfunction in young persons may not be abnormal in very elderly persons.
 It is difficult to distinguish the effect of normal aging from the effects of specific diseases or gradual degenerative changes.
