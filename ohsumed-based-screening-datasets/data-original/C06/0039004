The detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in HBsAG negative individuals with primary liver cancer.
 The importance of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the development of primary liver cancer has been established by epidemiological studies.
 However, the evidence for a direct role of the virus in liver carcinogenesis is still tentative.
 In addition, the findings of HBV DNA sequences in HBsAg-negative subjects with liver cancer has been reported, although it is controversial.
 Here we report the use of the polymerase chain reaction to detect HBV DNA in the serum and liver of HBsAg-negative patients.
 This technique allows both for the detection and cloning of HBV variants.
 In addition, the demonstration of HBV DNA and RNA molecules in HCC of HBsAg-negative individuals as determined by standard techniques reinforces the role of HBV in the pathogenesis of this tumor.
