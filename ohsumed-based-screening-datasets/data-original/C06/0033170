Endoscopic contact Nd:YAG laser resectional vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) in advanced malignant obstruction of the esophagus.
 Malignant esophageal obstruction in patients with advanced and metastatic carcinoma is unsuitable for surgery.
 Palliative treatment must provide adequate swallowing with minimum complications in these often seriously ill patients.
 Twenty consecutive patients underwent endoscopic Nd:YAG contact laser resection and vaporization (ECLRV) and esophageal dilatation (ED) for advanced esophageal carcinoma since August, 1985.
 Average duration of the disease when first referred was 7.2 months.
 Tumor cell type was either squamous cell carcinoma (n = 11) or adenocarcinoma (n = 9).
 Tumor location was distal (n = 14), middle (n = 5), or upper (n = 2).
 Mean tumor length was 7.5 cm.
 Mean preoperative luminal diameter was 1 mm, with total obstruction in ten (50%) patients.
 The operative procedure in all patients was under general anesthesia with endotracheal tube intubation.
 Rigid and flexible endoscopes were both used as indicated.
 Mean postoperative luminal diameter was 15 mm.
 All but four were able to swallow fluids on the first postoperative day, followed by semisolids the next day without discomfort.
 Minor perforation was noted in three cases and managed in two conservatively.
 One more patient had difficulty in swallowing due to extra-esophageal compression, in spite of a technically successful laser therapy.
 Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) was carried out in eight cases.
 Eleven patients were retreated successfully for recurrent obstruction and two were treated more than twice, at a mean of six-week intervals.
 Endoscopic contact laser resectional vaporization with esophageal dilatation was relatively safe and provided an improved quality of life in this preliminary study group, providing a mean survival of 18.5 weeks (range 2-50 weeks).
