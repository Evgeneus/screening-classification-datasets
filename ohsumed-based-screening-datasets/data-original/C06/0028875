Human hepatocyte growth factor in blood of patients with fulminant hepatic failure. I. Clinical aspects.
 The levels of human hepatocyte growth factor (hHGF) in sera obtained from patients with various liver diseases were determined using adult rat hepatocytes maintained in primary culture.
 The mean hHGF activity for 22 patients with fulminant hepatic failure was about nine times greater than that found in normal human serum.
 The increase in serum hHGF activity seen in two patients with "acute-on-chronic" hepatitis was similar to that found in patients with fulminant hepatic failure.
 The serum level of hHGF from patients with acute hepatitis is related to the stage of their illness.
 The average value for 31 patients was about three times that of normal human serum.
 In some patients, the time course for the increase in serum hHGF activity was similar to that demonstrated for alpha-fetoprotein.
 The mean hHGF activity in serum for the 33 patients with chronic hepatitis and from 25 patients with liver cirrhosis was increased also compared with that of normal human serum.
 In addition, serum hHGF activity in three of seven patients studied after partial hepatectomy for a space-occupying lesion of the liver was increased.
 These data suggest that the increase in serum hHGF activity present in patients with various liver diseases reflects a self-defense mechanism that is involved in the process of liver cell regeneration.
