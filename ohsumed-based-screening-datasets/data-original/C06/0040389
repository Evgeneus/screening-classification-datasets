Root of the superior mesenteric artery in pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma: evaluation with CT 
 To determine if changes involving the root of the superior mesenteric artery are specific for neoplasm, the authors retrospectively reviewed 173 computed tomographic (CT) examinations of patients with proved pancreatitis (103 examinations) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (70 examinations).
 Streaky infiltration of the fat surrounding the root was seen in 27 of 56 examinations of acute pancreatitis, in four of 24 examinations of chronic pancreatitis, in 12 of 23 examinations of pancreatitis complicated by abscess, and in 25 of 70 examinations of pancreatic carcinoma.
 Periarterial lymph nodes were visible in 14 with acute pancreatitis, in three with chronic pancreatitis, in six with pancreatic abscess, and in 11 with pancreatic carcinoma.
 A focal mass extended to within 1 cm of the root in 10 with acute pancreatitis, in two with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, and in 24 with pancreatic carcinoma; the mass obliterated the periarterial fat in seven with acute pancreatitis, in one with pancreatic abscess, and in 18 with pancreatic carcinoma.
 Circumferential encasement occurred in one with chronic pancreatitis, in four with pancreatic abscess, in 14 with pancreatic carcinoma, and in none with acute pancreatitis; nearly all cases of encasement revealed loss of periarterial fat.
 Thus, these indicators are not specific for neoplasm.
