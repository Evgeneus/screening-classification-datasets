Unusual presentations of duodenal tuberculosis.
 Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is still rampant in underdeveloped countries and can mimic other gastrointestinal (GI) disorders.
 Herein we report four cases of isolated proximal duodenal tuberculosis, without involvement of other parts of the GI tract.
 The clinical presentation in three of them resembled that of peptic ulcer disease, and one had features of gastric outlet obstruction.
 On investigation, one of these patients had a pyeloduodenal fistula.
 The limitations of clinical evaluation, radiology, and endoscopy are stressed, and the value of surgical biopsy is highlighted.
