Radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility: results in 170 patients with chest pain.
 The role of radiologic evaluation of esophageal motility in patients with chest pain has been studied rarely.
 Consequently, we compared the results of radiologic and manometric examinations of the esophagus in 170 patients (106 women, 64 men; mean age, 53 years) with chest pain.
 Manometry, used as the standard, was normal in 114 (67%) patients, and showed the following abnormal diagnoses in the remaining 56 (33%): nonspecific esophageal motility disorder in 27 (48%), nutcracker esophagus in 16 (29%), diffuse esophageal spasm in 11 (20%), and achalasia in two (4%).
 Radiologic specificity was 93% (106/114) and overall sensitivity only 36% (20/56).
 Sensitivity increased to 50% by excluding those with nutcracker esophagus, a purely manometric diagnosis.
 Of the 20 patients in whom nonspecific esophageal motility disorder and diffuse esophageal spasm were undetected on radiologic examination, minimal manometric criteria for diagnosis were available in 18.
 Our results show that radiologic recognition of normal esophageal peristalsis is excellent.
 However, the vast majority of patients with chest pain do not appear to have abnormal esophageal motility on radiologic evaluation.
