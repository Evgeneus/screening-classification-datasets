Drug-induced esophagitis.
 Drug-induced esophagitis is being recognized increasingly in the past few years.
 We have reviewed 175 cases with a view to classifying this disease based on pathology.
 Drug-induced esophageal injury tends to occur at the anatomical site of narrowing, with the middle third behind the left atrium predominating.
 The disease is classified broadly into two groups.
 The first group is transient and self-limiting, as exemplified by tetracycline- and emepronium-induced injury (57.3%).
 The second is the persistent esophagitis group, often with stricture with two distinct entities: 1) patients on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents whose injury is aggravated by gastroesophageal reflux (26.2%) (reflux aggravated), and 2) patients with potassium chloride and quinidine sulfate-induced injury (16.2%) (persisting drug injury).
 We report a case that highlights the pathophysiology (delayed transit, persisting potassium within the stricture) of this type of injury which is not reflux aggravated.
