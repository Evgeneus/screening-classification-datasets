Duodenal obstruction by a nondeflating Foley catheter gastrostomy tube.
 We report the case of a 36-year-old mentally retarded man who presented to our emergency department after one day of vomiting and one episode of coffee-ground emesis.
 The Foley catheter used as his gastrostomy tube was found to be obstructing the duodenum, and the balloon could not be deflated.
 Removal was accomplished by rupturing the balloon by endoscopy.
 Our case illustrates one of many possible complications of feeding gastrostomy tubes.
