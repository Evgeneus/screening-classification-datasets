Mycotic aortic aneurysm infected by Clostridium septicum--a case history.
 The authors describe a sixty-seven-year-old hypertensive, diabetic man with a mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm infected with Clostridium septicum.
 The patient had colonic polyps but no malignant disease.
 They could find only one other report of a mycotic aneurysm infected with C.
 septicum.
 In that case, as in most other cases of C.
 septicum bacteremia, the patient had gastrointestinal cancer.
 Their case suggests that treatment for a clostridial infection should be considered in patients with known gastrointestinal disease, signs and symptoms of sepsis, and abdominal pain.
 Conversely, patients known to have a C.
 septicum infection should be evaluated for gastrointestinal lesions.
