Otolaryngologic manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux.
 The exact incidence of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is unknown, although it is estimated that at least 25% of patients with GER have head and neck symptoms alone.
 These symptoms may consist of one or more of the following: excess salivation, hoarseness, "post-nasal drip," voice change, persistent coughing, food sticking in the throat, globus hystericus, otalgia, throat clearing, neck pain, sore throats, the sensation of a lump in the throat, choking spells, and bronchospasm.
 Carcinoma of the larynx and upper aerodigestive tract may be a consequence of chronic reflux.
 GER, especially when the classic symptoms of reflux are absent, is frequently overlooked as a cause of these problems.
 This article reviews the symptoms and pathophysiology of these conditions.
 The diagnostic and therapeutic modalities available to us in managing these patients are also discussed.
