Small bowel length in Crohn's disease.
 The length of the small intestine in patients with Crohn's disease who are referred for surgery has not been well studied.
 In this report, 25 patients with Crohn's disease who were being operated on for the first time had their small intestine measured at the time of surgery.
 The mean length of small intestine in this group was 501 cm, which was not different from a group of patients without Crohn's disease who were being operated on for other problems.
 In the group of patients with Crohn's disease, as well as the entire group, there was a correlation between increasing height and longer small bowel length.
 No other parameters investigated, including weight, surface area, age, sex, and duration of disease, correlated with bowel length.
 The results of this study are somewhat encouraging to patients with Crohn's disease, since these patients do not start off with a shortened bowel prior to surgery.
