Viral hepatitis. The new ABC's.
 Hepatitis may be caused by hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus (classic non-A non-B viral hepatitis), hepatitis D virus (delta agent), and hepatitis E virus (epidemic non-A non-B viral hepatitis).
 Cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex virus may also occasionally cause hepatitis.
 Some forms of hepatitis carry the risks of chronic infection, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma.
 Treatment options for viral hepatitis are limited and, in many cases, still under investigation.
 Prophylaxis is available for many forms of hepatitis and should be offered to those at risk.
