Mucosal humoral immune response to Helicobacter pylori in patients with duodenitis.
 The humoral immune response to Helicobacter pylori infection in the duodenum has been investigated by short-term in vitro culture, ELISA, and immunoblotting techniques.
 H.
 pylori IgA secretion by duodenal bulb biopsies was significantly increased (P less than 0.001) in patients with duodenitis.
 The IgA response to H.
 pylori in patients with duodenitis was restricted to the first part of the duodenum; second part duodenal biopsies secreting significantly (P less than 0.001) less IgA during culture in vitro.
 H.
 pylori IgG antibody secretion by cultured biopsies was also significantly increased (P less than 0.01) in patients with duodenitis and those with gastric H.
 pylori infection but without duodenitis.
 Immunoblotting of duodenal bulb culture supernatants showed positive recognition by the mucosal IgA response of H.
 pylori antigens in the region of 120, 90, 61, and 31-26 kDa in patients with duodenitis.
 Serologically, such patients showed little evidence of IgA H.
 pylori antibodies by immunoblotting.
 These results demonstrate that the inflammatory response in the duodenal mucosa of patients with duodenitis represents a specific highly localized humoral response to H.
 pylori.
