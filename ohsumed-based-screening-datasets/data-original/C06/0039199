Characteristics of cirrhosis undiagnosed during life: a comparative analysis of 73 undiagnosed cases and 149 diagnosed cases of cirrhosis, detected in 4929 consecutive autopsies.
 In 4929 consecutive autopsies performed during a period of 4 years, 222 cases (4.5%) of cirrhosis were found, of which 149 (3%) were detected while the patients were alive (diagnosed cirrhosis) and 73 (1.5%) were not detected while the patients were living (undiagnosed cirrhosis).
 Fifty-three of the 73 undiagnosed patients appeared to be completely without signs of cirrhosis (silent cirrhosis).
 In the diagnosed group, 70% of patients died from hepatic causes, in contrast to 16% in the undiagnosed group.
 At autopsy, the following complications of cirrhosis were found more frequently in the diagnosed group than in the undiagnosed group: ascites (41% vs.
 8%), oesophageal varices (44% vs.
 10%), splenomegaly (52% vs.
 29%).
 The prevalence of hepatocellular carcinoma did not differ significantly in the two groups (12% vs.
 8%).
 It is concluded that cirrhosis without obvious signs occurs relatively frequently, and that no sensitive non-invasive screening methods are available at present.
