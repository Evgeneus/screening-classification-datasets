Genotyping study of alcohol dehydrogenase class I polymorphism in French patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The French Group for Research on Alcohol and Liver.
 Comparison of alcohol dehydrogenase polymorphism at the loci ADH2 and ADH3 is made in France between 46 alcoholic cirrhotic patients and 39 controls, by genotyping technique using polymerase chain reaction on blood microsample collected on blotting paper.
 The genotype distributions are similar, with low frequency of the ADH2(2) allele.
 Polymorphism at the ADH3 locus is not a genetic factor for alcoholic cirrhosis in France.
