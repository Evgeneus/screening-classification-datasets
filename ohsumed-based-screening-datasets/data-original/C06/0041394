Therapeutic advances in the prevention of hepatitis B: yeast-derived recombinant hepatitis B vaccines.
 Viral hepatitis is second to gonorrhea as the most commonly reported infectious disease in the US.
 Hepatitis B accounts for the majority of viral hepatitis cases.
 Fortunately, the disease is self-limiting and frequently resolves completely with minimal complications; however, a significant number of individuals may experience long-term sequelae.
 Research utilizing genetic engineering has led to the development of yeast-derived recombinant DNA (YDR) hepatitis vaccines--a significant advancement in the control and prevention of hepatitis B.
 The recombinant process allows production of unlimited quantities of vaccine at considerably lower cost and without the potential threat of blood-borne illness.
 Clinical trials in various high-risk populations have demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of YDR vaccines.
 However, questions regarding optimal regimen and the need for periodic revaccination remain unanswered.
 Persons at risk should be adequately vaccinated against hepatitis B.
