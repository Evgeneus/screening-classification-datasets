Helicobacter pylori infection induces antibodies cross-reacting with human gastric mucosa.
 The authors' previous observation that many of the monoclonal antibodies against Helicobacter pylori cross-react with the cells of the human gastric mucosa prompted them to investigate the possibility that gastric self-antigens cross-reacting with H.
 pylori could be involved in the immune response against this organism.
 It was found that three antibodies against H.
 pylori, CB-4, CB-10, and CB-14, that cross-react with the human gastric mucosa also intensely cross-reacted with murine gastric epithelial cells.
 A strong reaction against autologous mucosa was also evident in the sera of mice immunized with H.
 pylori but not with other bacteria.
 A serological study performed in a group of 82 patients undergoing gastroscopy showed that the presence of seropositivity against H.
 pylori was strongly correlated with the presence of autoantibodies against human antral gastric mucosa.
 This activity was neutralized after absorption of the sera with H.
 pylori but not with other gram-negative bacteria.
 The antibodies in the mouse and in the human did not react with other segments of the gastrointestinal tract or with most of the other organs.
 Mice bearing hybridomas secreting a cross-reacting antibody (CB-4) had histopathologic abnormalities in their stomachs.
 These lesions were absent in the stomachs of mice bearing hybridomas secreting a non-cross-reacting antibody (CB-26).
 It was concluded that H.
 pylori infection can stimulate antibodies cross-reacting with gastric autoantigens and that this immunologic mechanism may represent a pathogenic link between H.
 pylori and gastritis.
