Bronchobiliary fistula detected by cholescintigraphy.
 We present a case of a bronchobiliary fistula initially detected by hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
 The patient developed bilioptysis 18 mo after undergoing a right hepatic lobectomy and resection of the common bile duct for cholangiocarcinoma.
 The procedure was complicated by the development of a subphrenic abscess that required percutaneous biliary drainage.
