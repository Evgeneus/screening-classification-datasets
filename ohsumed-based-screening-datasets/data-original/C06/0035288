Preoperative diagnosis by enteroclysis of unsuspected closed loop obstruction in medically managed patients.
 Initial observation and evaluation of patient progress have reduced the number of operative interventions in the management of small intestinal obstruction.
 The differentiation of simple mechanical from strangulating obstructions has remained difficult.
 Strangulation is not an invariable component of a closed loop obstruction.
 We report 27 patients with small bowel obstruction initially managed nonsurgically, in whom enteroclysis 2-8 days after admission demonstrated unsuspected closed loop obstruction.
 In 25 of the 27 patients, subsequent surgery confirmed the radiologic diagnosis: all the obstructed loops were viable and there was no operative mortality.
 Our experience suggests that the early performance of enteroclysis should be considered in patients with small bowel obstruction undergoing a trial of nonoperative management.
