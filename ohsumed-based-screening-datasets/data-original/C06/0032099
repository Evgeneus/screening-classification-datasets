Use of social science research to improve epidemiologic studies of and interventions for diarrhea and dysentery.
 The significance of dysentery has not been recognized in community-based programs for the management of diarrhea.
 Culturally sensitive methods of classification and algorithms for treatment of these diseases must be developed.
 Considered in this article is the manner in which ethnographic studies of diarrhea can contribute to descriptive epidemiologic data on diarrhea and dysentery and to procedures of health education and evaluation of interventions for the diseases.
 Indigenous terms for bloody diarrhea exist in many cultures.
 Local use of such terms must be carefully examined before they are incorporated in health education efforts and epidemiologic surveillance programs.
