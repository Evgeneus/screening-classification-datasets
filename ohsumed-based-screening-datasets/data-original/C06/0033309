Intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis in nonelective colon resection.
 In selected individuals requiring emergency colon resection, intraoperative colonic lavage with primary anastomosis represents a safe alternative to staged reconstruction.
 This procedure achieves excellent mechanical preparation of the colon, facilitates safe anastomosis, and avoids the disadvantages associated with multistaged operations.
 At our institution, 25 patients requiring urgent segmental resection of the left colon have undergone intraoperative colonic lavage.
 Primary anastomosis without fecal diversion has been performed in 21 of these patients.
 Obstruction of the large intestine was the indication for operation in 56 percent of the patients in this series.
 Ten patients (40 percent) required laparotomy for an acute intra-abdominal inflammatory process.
 No post-operative deaths have occurred in our series, and no patient has sustained clinically evident anastomotic leakage.
 A pelvic abscess developed in one patient after sigmoid colectomy for diverticulitis.
 Three patients required treatment for wound infection.
 Based on our results, we recommend resection with intraoperative colonic lavage and primary anastomosis as the preferred treatment for the majority of patients requiring nonelective segmental left colon resection.
