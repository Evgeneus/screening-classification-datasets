Chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms in Holocaust survivors.
 In Nazi-occupied Europe (1939-1945), Jews were submitted to extreme mental and physical hardships (the Holocaust).
 This study was designed to investigate the impact of the severe protracted suffering on the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptoms.
 Thus, we studied 623 consecutive patients of Eastern European origin who had been admitted for nongastrointestinal complaints.
 They filled out detailed questionnaires, and were divided into the following two groups: A) Holocaust survivors [237 subjects who had been for at least 6 months in either German concentration/extermination camps (95 subjects), ghetto and/or underground movements (65 subjects), labor camps not directly supervised by Germans (79 subjects)], and B) a control group (384 subjects from the same demographic background, who had not been exposed to Nazi persecutions).
 The symptoms investigated were the following: abdominal pain, irregular bowel habits, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal distension, heartburn, flatulence, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, mucus in stool, tenesmus, and aerophagia.
 Patients were defined as having functional symptoms after these had been present for at least 5 yr and relevant organic disease had been excluded.
 The prevalence, duration of suffering, and frequency of appearance of most symptoms were significantly higher in the group of Holocaust survivors.
 This study supports the clinical observations that severe and protracted suffering contributes to the development of chronic functional gastrointestinal symptomatology.
