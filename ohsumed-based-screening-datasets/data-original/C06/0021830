Pelvic floor descent in women: dynamic evaluation with fast MR imaging and cinematic display.
 The authors present a new method for assessing pelvic prolapse with dynamic fast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
 Twenty-six women with signs and symptoms suggesting pelvic prolapse and 16 control subjects were studied with a series of fast (6-12-second) MR images.
 Sagittal and coronal images were obtained with graded increase in voluntary pelvic strain, allowing for dynamic display and quantification of the pelvic prolapse process.
 The distance from the pubococcygeal line was used as an internal reference for measurement of descent in the maximal strain position.
 With use of control results for normal limit values, prolapse involving the anterior pelvic compartment (cystocele), the middle compartment (vaginal prolapse, uterine prolapse, and enterocele), and the posterior compartment (rectocele) was easily demonstrated.
 Significant differences between control subjects and patients with prolapse were seen at maximal strain but not in the relaxed state.
 Quantification of the pelvic descent process with use of fast MR imaging may be of value in surgical planning and postsurgical follow-up.
