Longer relapse-free period after sucralfate than after H2-blocker treatment of duodenal and gastric ulcers.
 In a prospective investigation of 2,045 patients with recurrent peptic ulcer disease, the relapse-free period after acute treatment with sucralfate was evaluated over 1 year.
 This remission period was compared retrospectively with that achieved by previous treatment with a histamine-H2-blocker in the same patients.
 Only patients who had a symptomatic relapse within 1 year after H2-blocker therapy were included.
 Patients with no relapses within 1 year after sucralfate were assumed to have a relapse on day 366, in order to compare the two periods.
 In 73% of the evaluable 2,045 patients, remission after sucralfate was longer than after H2-blocker, and 23% of these patients had no symptomatic relapse at all within 1 year after sucralfate.
 The average relapse-free period after sucralfate was 212 days, as compared with 132 days after H2-blockers (difference = 80 days; p less than 0.0001).
 Elderly and nonsmoking patients and those experiencing their first recurrence, or who had a duodenal ulcer, benefited especially from acute treatment with sucralfate.
 It can be concluded that peptic ulcer patients with a relapse after treatment with an H2-blocker are suitable candidates for sucralfate therapy.
 There is a high probability that the relapse-free period after sucralfate is longer than after H2-blocker treatment in both gastric and duodenal ulcer patients.
