Assessment of the defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy.
 The defunctioning efficiency of the loop ileostomy has been assessed using a radioisotope and dye technique.
 The median defunctioning capacity in patients without episodes of fecal discharge per rectum (n = 18) was 99.99 percent and was not affected by body position or the formation of a dependent stoma.
 In patients (n = 4) who passed fecal material per rectum but who had no stomal retraction, the median defunctioning efficiency was 99.99 percent, and continued fecal discharge was considered to be due to mucopurulent secretion from active distal disease.
 In patients who passed fecal material per rectum and also had a retracted stoma (n = 4), the defunctioning efficiency was significantly reduced (median = 84.70 [31.2-99.10 percent; P less than 0.01]), owing to the overspill into the distal limb.
 Two patients underwent stomal revision, with an improvement in defunctioning efficiency to 99.99 percent.
