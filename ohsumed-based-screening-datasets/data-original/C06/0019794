Late arterial hemorrhage secondary to a Greenfield filter requiring operative intervention.
 Retroperitoneal hematomas associated with Greenfield filters have been described and are generally characterized as clinically insignificant.
 We report a retroperitoneal hematoma that was associated with a Greenfield filter and that required operative intervention because of hemodynamic instability.
 At operation a lumbar arterial laceration apparently caused by a protruding filter prong was identified and ligated.
 The implications of this occurrence for filter placement indications are discussed.
 The potential life-threatening severity of filter-associated hematomas is emphasized.
