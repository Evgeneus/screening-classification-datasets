Comparison of direct insertion of disposable and standard reusable laparoscopic trocars and previous pneumoperitoneum with Veress needle.
 A randomized prospective study was conducted to evaluate the ease of use and safety of direct insertion of laparoscopic trocars.
 Comparison of previous pneumoperitoneum by Veress needle insertion with direct insertion of the reusable conventional laparoscopic trocar and direct insertion of the disposable shielded trocar revealed minor complication rates of 22, 6 and 0%, respectively.
 No major complications occurred in this series of 200 patients.
