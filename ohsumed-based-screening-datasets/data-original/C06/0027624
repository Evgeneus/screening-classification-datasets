Pacemaker failure on induction of anaesthesia.
 A patient with a permanent pacemaker presented for repair of a strangulated hernia.
 During induction of anaesthesia, the pacemaker generator stopped discharging, thus causing cardiac arrest.
 The likely cause of the generator failure was inhibition by suxamethonium-induced muscle fasciculations.
 Following defibrillation, and increase in stimulation threshold necessitated urgent insertion of a transvenous pacing system.
 It is suggested that, when suxamethonium is to be used in a patient with a permanent pacemaker, consideration should be given to reprogramming the pacemaker to asynchronous mode before induction of anaesthesia.
 If a patient with a pacemaker requires defibrillation, an acute increase in stimulation threshold may result and cause loss of capture.
 Rapid insertion of a transvenous pacing system may be necessary.
