Cystic mesothelioma of the peritoneum. A report of three cases.
 Three cases of peritoneal cystic mesothelioma are reported.
 All patients were women who had undergone previous abdominal surgery for unrelated conditions.
 Tumors consisted of solitary and multiple cystic masses involving the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum.
 The cysts focally infiltrated the muscularis externa of the small intestine in case 1, the outer muscular layer of the uterus in case 2, and the omental tissue in case 3.
 These findings give morphologic support to the borderline clinical behavior of this tumor that often recurs and support the hypothesis that previous surgery may play a role in its pathogenesis.
