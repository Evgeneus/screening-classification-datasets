Blunt abdominal trauma resulting in intestinal obstruction: when to operate?
 The overall approach to blunt abdominal trauma resulting in hematoma and intestinal obstruction has been variable and controversial.
 Recent reports recommend conservative nonoperative management.
 We reviewed six cases of duodenal and jejunal hematomas resulting from blunt trauma of which five resolved with nasogastric decompression and parenteral nutrition.
 The average hospital stay was 16 days (10-23 days), and total parenteral nutrition days were 9 days (4-16 days).
 Upper gastrointestinal series (UGI) demonstrated partial bowel obstruction in all five cases.
 In contrast, the sixth case was a restrained passenger who had evidence of complete bowel obstruction on UGI series, which failed to resolve after 18 days of conservative management.
 Laparotomy revealed jejunal and colonic strictures with fibrosis, which were successfully resected.
 We recommend that based on radiologic documentation of persistent high-grade obstruction, as well as the clinical course, patients whose obstructions do not resolve by 10 to 14 days ought to be further investigated and operative intervention considered.
 This approach may facilitate an earlier diagnosis of complications, reduce length of hospitalization and days on parenteral nutrition, as well as to expedite the proper management.
