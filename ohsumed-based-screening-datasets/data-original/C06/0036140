Serum alpha-L-fucosidase. A more sensitive marker for hepatocellular carcinoma?
 Forty-nine liver disease patients (7 chronic persistent hepatitis, CPH; 10 chronic active hepatitis, CAH; 13 liver cirrhosis, LC; 9 primary hepatocellular carcinoma, PHC, without LC; and 10 PHC with associated LC) and 20 controls were assessed for their serum alpha-L-fucosidase (ALF) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and several routine liver injury parameters.
 Tumor diameter in those with hepatic cancer was assessed by angio-CT.
 Only ALF and AFP were significantly greater in patients with PHC and PHC + LC patients as compared to patients with LC alone.
 At an accepted cutoff level of 500 ng/ml, the AFP level provided 43% false negative tests.
 On the other hand, an ALF level exceeding 740 mumol/hr/ml provided a sensitivity of 84% with a specificity of 94%.
 No relationship between the ALF level and Child's criteria or with any liver injury parameter was evident.
 Considering all individual values, the ALF, rather than the AFP, correlated with tumor size.
 This finding suggests the ALF level may be of value in the early detection of PHC as well as in the follow-up of patients treated for PHC.
