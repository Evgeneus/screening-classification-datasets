Idiopathic colonic perforation in the neonate.
 We describe a premature infant in whom spontaneous perforation of the colon was initially detected on routine abdominal films.
 There was no clinical evidence of necrotizing enterocolitis, peritonitis, or bowel obstruction.
 Surgical and pathologic findings confirmed the diagnosis of idiopathic bowel perforation.
 Since spontaneous gastrointestinal perforation in the neonate is often difficult to diagnose clinically, radiographic evaluation may allow earlier diagnosis and prompt surgical treatment of this life-threatening condition.
