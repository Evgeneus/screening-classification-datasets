The Indian experience with hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.
 A study of 58 consecutive Indian infants operated for congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis revealed an accentuated male predominance in the incidence of the disease and far less preoperative hemetemesis as compared to that in their Western counterparts.
 'Pyloric tumor' was palpable in 89% of cases.
 Only 34.5% of these infants were first born.
 Postoperative vomiting occurred in 13.8% of patients and wound sepsis was not encountered.
 Air contrast radiography confirmed the diagnosis in clinically doubtful cases.
