Treatment of oesophageal perforation: a multivariate analysis.
 Perforation of the oesophagus was retrospectively analysed in 59 patients.
 Cause and extent of perforation, localization, quality of the oesophageal wall and therapeutic modes were subjected to univariate analysis.
 The perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus (39) were also subjected to multivariate analysis.
 Perforation of the cervical oesophagus is seldom lethal and can be adequately treated conservatively in the majority of cases.
 Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus can be divided into two groups, with or without simultaneous perforation of the parietal pleura.
 The optimal treatment for the group with pleural perforation seems to be resection of the oesophagus and secondary reconstruction, although primary closure is indicated in selected early cases.
 Perforations of the intrathoracic oesophagus confined to the mediastinum can be adequately treated conservatively in most patients.
 Perforation of the intra-abdominal oesophagus should be treated like any other intra-abdominal visceral perforation, by closure or diversion, even if this results in resection of the oesophagus.
