The clinical management of cirrhosis.
 The discipline of hepatology is being rapidly advanced by several methods of investigation, most notably those of molecular and genetic biology.
 The polymerase chain reaction holds very great promise in unraveling the implications of hepatic virus infections.
 At the present time, we have no method of reversing established cirrhosis, and those with life threatening impairment of liver function can only look to liver transplants for salvage.
 The clinician can therefore best serve by identifying liver disease before cirrhosis and its complications occur.
 With effective case finding, and the continued development of therapeutic interventions directed toward known or suspected etiologic and pathogenic factors, many productive, high-quality years can be added to the lifespans of many patients.
