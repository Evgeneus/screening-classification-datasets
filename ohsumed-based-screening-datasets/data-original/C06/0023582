Pancreatic ascites: treatment by continuous somatostatin infusion.
 Two male patients with recurrent acute pancreatitis due to alcohol abuse were admitted with pancreatic ascites (high concentration of amylase, raised protein concentration, no specific cytologic features).
 Ultrasound (US) and computed tomography (CT) confirmed gross ascites and inflammation of the pancreas in both patients, and a pseudocyst in the head of the pancreas in one of them.
 Treatment with total parenteral nutrition (TPN) and a H2-blocking agent was instituted and continued for 4 and 2 wk, respectively.
 Due to lack of improvement, somatostatin infusion (250 micrograms/h) was started.
 During the next few days, there was a rapid improvement of the clinical status, and the production of ascites ceased.
 We conclude that somatostatin infusion should be tried before any invasive diagnostic or therapeutic intervention in patients with pancreatic ascites.
