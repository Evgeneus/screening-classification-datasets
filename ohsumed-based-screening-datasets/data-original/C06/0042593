Image processing in swallowing and speech research.
 An image processing system for application to studies of the temporal and spatial parameters of movement during swallowing and speech is described.
 Image sequences from videotape are digitized for computerized manipulation and analysis in an attempt to improve on conventional visual inspection.
 The system is "interactive" or "event-driven": after executing a function, the computer waits for guidance from the user who controls the program through keyboard and mouse input, selecting options from menus and responding to prompts.
 The analyst alters image clarity by the application of filters and heightens contrast through video enhancement.
 A technique called "remapping" reduces head motion and provides uniform spatial scaling.
 Animated sequences of images are used, as opposed to frame-by-frame analysis, to preserve temporal context and increase efficiency of measurement.
 Low cost off-the-shelf personal computer hardware is used along with original software tailored to the application.
