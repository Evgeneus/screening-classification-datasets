Evaluation of diagnostic methods for Helicobacter pylori gastritis.
 The authors evaluated the use of direct Gram-stained smears, 1- and 24-hour urease broth tests, histologic examination, and culture to detect Helicobacter pylori in 100 gastric biopsy specimens from 97 patients with epigastric symptoms.
 Twenty-six patients had positive cultures and 27 had H.
 pylori identifiable in hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections.
 The gastric biopsy specimens from the 29 patients with culture and/or histologic findings positive for H.
 pylori showed active gastritis in 27 cases (93%), compared with 26 cases (37%) without H.
 pylori (P less than 0.0001).
 Chronic gastritis was present in 25 cases (86%) with H.
 pylori and 40 cases (56%) without H.
 pylori (P less than 0.01).
 Twenty patients had positive Gram-stained smears.
 Fifteen patients had positive 1-hour urease tests, and 3 had delayed positive 24-hour urease tests.
 There were no false-positive Gram's stain results, three false-positive 24-hour urease tests, two false-negative histologic results, and three false-negative cultures (one inadvertently incubated anaerobically).
 The sensitivities of the methods were as follows: 62% for the 24-hour urease test, 69% for direct Gram's stain, 90% for culture, and 93% for histologic examination.
 The authors conclude that the urease test used in this study has low sensitivity and limited specificity; that the direct Gram-stained smear is a useful, highly specific, rapid screening test; and that the lengthier methods of culture and histologic examination have comparably high sensitivity for the definitive diagnosis of H.
 pylori gastritis.
