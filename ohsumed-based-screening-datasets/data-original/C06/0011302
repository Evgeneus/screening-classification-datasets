Multifocal colitis associated with an epidemic of chronic diarrhea.
 An outbreak of a chronic diarrheal syndrome was detected between May and August 1987 in rural Henderson County, Illinois.
 Seventy-two individuals were affected.
 Epidemiological studies performed by the Center for Disease Control implicated the water of a local restaurant as the source of the outbreak.
 Five patients underwent a comprehensive evaluation.
 Their mean age was 51 years, and they had a mean of 12 watery stools daily (range, 6-40).
 Detailed microbiological evaluations failed to identify a pathological organism.
 Stool studies showed a mean stool weight of 392 g/24 h with a normal fat content.
 Results of all biochemical studies of serum were normal.
 Chemical analysis of stool water suggested a secretory diarrhea.
 Colonoscopy revealed patchy erythema, and light microscopic examination of colonic biopsy specimens revealed multifocal areas of acute inflammation in the superficial mucosa in 4 of 5 patients.
 Electron microscopy of the affected areas revealed no viral particles.
 After 2 years, all of our patients continued to experience chronic diarrhea.
 One patient agreed to a follow-up colonoscopy; histological abnormalities of the colonic mucosa persisted after 2 years.
 We speculate that an infectious process arising from a contaminated water system induced a chronic, secretory diarrhea characterized by multifocal colitis.
 This histological abnormality may serve as a marker of an infectious, chronic diarrhea.
