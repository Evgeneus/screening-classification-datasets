Combined evaluation of total and functional liver plasma flows and intrahepatic shunting 
 A diagnostic protocol was studied, designed to evaluate the main parameters of liver circulation in man.
 A water solution of D-sorbitol (S) and indocyanine green (ICG) was infused intravenously in six controls and nine cirrhotics.
 Steady-state renal and hepatic S clearances as well as hepatic ICG clearance were calculated.
 In controls the values (mean +/- SD) of the independent measurements of S and ICG hepatic clearance were 978 +/- 107 and 519 +/- 142 ml/min, respectively, while in cirrhotic patients they were 554 +/- 238 and 231 +/- 90 ml/min.
 Owing to the kinetic properties of S, its hepatic clearance may be regarded as a measure of functional liver plasma flow (FLPF).
 The total liver plasma flow (TLPF) values (mean +/- SD), calculated according to Fick's principle, were 1091 +/- 157 ml/min (S method) and 1033 +/- 153 ml/min (ICG method) in controls, and 1251 +/- 554 and 1284 +/- 677 ml/min in cirrhotics.
 In controls, FLPF was found to be very close to TLPF.
 In cirrhotic patients the difference between TLPF and FLPF (ranging from 169 to 2093 ml/min when measured by S method) was considered as an approximate estimate of intrahepatic shunting.
 The procedure is safe and simple and may add a new dimension to the investigation of hepatic circulation.
