Combined surgical and interventional radiological approach for complex benign biliary tract obstruction.
 In patients with complicated high benign biliary strictures surgical technique alone cannot exclude the possibility of recurrent problems, and hepatic atrophy/hypertrophy, portal hypertension and intrahepatic stones may all complicate surgical management.
 A multidisciplinary approach to these complex cases, which minimizes the need for repeated surgical interventions, has been pursued.
 Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy was performed and an extended limb of the jejunum brought to the abdominal wall to allow access for later radiological intervention.
 Over a 30-month period 58 biliary-enteric anastomoses for benign disease were performed.
 Seventeen of these 58 patients were managed using the combined approach.
 Ten of these 17 patients had complex postcholecystectomy strictures and seven had strictures resulting from inflammatory disease, hepatic resection or congenital problems.
 A new classification of results of management of bile duct strictures is proposed.
 Seven patients were classified as 'excellent', six 'good', two 'fair' and two 'poor'.
 Results were obtained at a mean follow-up of 16 months and it seems likely that in some patients major surgical reinterventions were avoided.
