Intraarterial portography with gadopentetate dimeglumine: improved liver-to-lesion contrast in MR imaging.
 Magnetic resonance imaging during arterial portography (MRAP) was performed by the authors in a selected group of 12 patients with hepatic lesions.
 A low dose of gadopentetate dimeglumine (4 mL of a 0.5-mol/L solution, corresponding to a dose of 0.05-0.07 mmol/kg) was injected into the superior mesenteric artery during acquisition of breath-holding gradient-echo or rapid acquisition spin-echo images.
 Images were always acquired during the first passage of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the liver parenchyma.
 An increase in liver-to-lesion contrast was obtained with MRAP imaging (contrast-to-noise ratio = 8 +/- 1.8 vs 19 +/- 2.7).
 Signal intensity enhancement of the liver was high (signal-to-noise ratio = 9.48 +/- 2.42), while the lesion presented no significant enhancement (signal-to-noise ratio = 0.55 +/- 0.22).
 Lobar portal vein thrombosis was detected in one patient owing to lack of enhancement of the left lobe of the liver.
 No side effects related to administration of iodinated and paramagnetic contrast agents were observed.
 This new technique provides specific enhancement of liver parenchyma with improved liver-to-lesion contrast.
