Microsurgical epididymovasostomy by tubule intussusception: a new technique in rat model.
 This experimental study on 15 adult male rats with bilateral epididymovasostomies evaluates a new technique of tubule intussusception as an improved form of end-to-end anastomosis.
 This paper describes in detail the steps in this technique and offers physiological, anatomical, and histological follow-up after 3 months.
 With this technique there is a 97% patency rate and a 23.3% incidence of macroscopic spermatic granuloma.
 Complications are discussed in detail.
