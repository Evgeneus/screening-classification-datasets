Scheduling of revaccination against hepatitis B virus 
 Studies have shown that to maintain protection against infection after a primary course of hepatitis B immunisation, revaccination can be scheduled on the basis of an anti-hepatitis B virus surface antigen (anti-HBs) titre obtained 1 month after the booster dose.
 However, schemes which require post-booster testing may present practical difficulties.
 We applied a random-effects regression model to data from 118 Senegalese infants given three injections of hepatitis B vaccine about 6 weeks apart and a booster injection at 13 months, and show that revaccination can be scheduled on the basis of an anti-HBs titre recorded at the time of the booster dose.
 We also show that titre-at-booster is no less accurate in predicting future titre than 1-month post-booster titre.
 In several other studies the post-booster decline in anti-HBs conforms to the same mathematical description, indicating the generality of our findings.
