Transvaginal approach for repair of rectovaginal fistulae complicating Crohn's disease.
 The management of rectovaginal fistulae complicating Crohn's disease is difficult and often unsatisfactory.
 Between December 1983 and November 1988, 13 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of rectovaginal fistulae via a transvaginal approach.
 All patients had a diverting intestinal stoma either as part of the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula.
 Each of the patients had low or mid septal fistulae; high fistulae generally are treated transabdominally and are not the focus of this discussion.
 Fistulae were eradicated in 12 of the 13 women and did not recur during the follow-up period, which averaged 50 months (range, 9 to 68 months).
 The only treatment failure was a patient who had a markedly diseased colon from the cecum to the rectum and a very low-lying fistula.
 It is concluded that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulae secondary to Crohn's disease.
