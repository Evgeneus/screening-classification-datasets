Treatment of bilateral intrahepatic stones with high duct strictures through selective central hepatic resection.
 Bilateral intrahepatic duct stones with strictures, more common in the Orient than elsewhere, are difficult to access surgically.
 The results of surgical procedures have not been generally successful and are attended by a high postoperative complication and recurrence rate.
 We report the treatment of 30 patients with intrahepatic calculi and high duct strictures by means of selective central hepatic resection without dissection of the major vessels at the hilum.
 Central hepatic resection provided satisfactory access to the primary and secondary confluences of the intrahepatic ducts, allowed removal of residual stones and ascariasis, and permitted correction of multiple strictures.
 Twenty-nine patients so treated were followed for a mean of 32 months after operation.
 No patients developed recurrent fever, biliary colic, or jaundice after the operation.
 The technique is therefore recommended as an effective alternative to extensive hepatic lobectomy in the treatment of the intrahepatic calculi with multiple strictures.
