Spectrum of intestinal failure in a specialised unit.
 300 consecutive admissions over 7 years to a purpose-built intestinal failure unit are reviewed.
 The commonest underlying condition was Crohn's disease (42%), and the commonest complication precipitating admission was intestinal fistula (42%).
 Total parenteral nutrition was used in 85% and surgery in 50%.
 A multidisciplinary approach to management gave a high success rate--90% of patients were discharged from hospital, although nearly 25% needed home parental nutrition.
 These results suggest that chronic intestinal failure should be managed in specialised units in the same manner as other types of organ failure.
