Treatment of severe acne with isotretinoin in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
 Four patients with inflammatory bowel disease and severe cystic acne were treated with isotretinoin.
 Two patients had a successful course of treatment without any gastrointestinal side-effects.
 One patient had two episodes of profuse rectal bleeding that were probably related to pre-existing haemorrhoids.
 The fourth patient had a flare-up of his Crohn's disease after starting isotretinoin.
