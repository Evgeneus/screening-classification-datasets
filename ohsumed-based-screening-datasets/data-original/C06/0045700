Choledochal cyst and biliary atresia in the neonate: imaging findings in five cases.
 The radiologic findings in five neonates with choledochal cyst associated with extra-hepatic biliary atresia are described.
 All five patients (age range, 13-72 days) presented with jaundice and acholic stools.
 In all four patients who underwent sonographic examination, a cystic structure separate from the gallbladder representing the choledochal cyst was shown.
 The diagnosis of atresia of the distal common bile duct was made preoperatively in all cases by hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
 Diagnosis was confirmed by surgical findings and was demonstrated by intraoperative cholangiography in four cases.
 All patients were successfully treated with surgical intervention within 1 month from the time of diagnosis.
 Early detection of this rare disorder, which may be distinct from choledochal cyst found in children and adults, is important to prevent fatal complications of biliary obstruction.
 The combined use of sonography and hepatobiliary scintigraphy can correctly identify this subset of patients with persistent neonatal jaundice and provide valuable information for prompt surgical management.
