Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer.
 PURPOSE PATIENTS AND METHODS: Helicobacter pylori (HP) is present in more than 90% of duodenal ulcers (DUs).
 To investigate the pathophysiology in those patients with DU who are HP-negative compared with those who are HP-positive, we interviewed consecutive patients prior to endoscopy regarding factors often associated with ulcer disease.
 At esophagogastroduodenoscopy, antral biopsy specimens were obtained for urease test, culture, and Warthin Starry staining for HP in all patients with DU who did not have active bleeding.
 RESULTS: Compared with HP-positive patients who had DU, HP-negative patients with DU were more likely to be aspirin users and less likely to have had prior ulcers.
 HP-positive patients with DU had more severe antral inflammation than HP-negative patients.
 Whites were more likely to be HP-negative than blacks.
 HP-negative patients with DU most commonly presented with bleeding, whereas HP-positive patients with DU presented with pain.
 CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a different mechanism for DUs in patients who are HP-positive versus those who are HP-negative, and this difference might have a bearing on treatment.
 The absence of HP should lead to a more thorough search for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug/aspirin use, Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, and other potential causes of DUs.
