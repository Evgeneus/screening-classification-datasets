Current and future drugs for acid-peptic disease: a plethora of opinions on possible mechanisms of action.
 Sixty-seven invited participants involved in the development, evaluation, and use of therapies for acid-peptic disorders participated in a meeting to discuss the scientific basis for healing actions of ulcer drugs and the prospects for future developments ("Realities of Mucosal Protection in the Upper Gastrointestinal Tract," Lausanne, Switzerland, November 8-10, 1987).
 Eighty-one key statements were prepared and subsequently analyzed on the basis of a voting system.
 Of the 45 statements that dealt with existing therapies, only 3 statements showed positive consensus (agreement of two-thirds or more of voters) about mechanisms of ulcer healing.
 Participants agreed that both (1) hydrogen/potassium adenosine triphosphatase inhibitors and (2) histamine H2 antagonists healed ulcers solely by acid inhibition, and (3) that sucralfate works by topical action.
 Substantial uncertainty about the mechanisms by which bismuth compounds and antacids heal ulcers was noted as well as their wide range of effects.
 The mechanism of ulcer healing by prostaglandins and the clinical relevance of antiulcer effects of drugs demonstrated in acute studies with animals were also controversial.
 There was greater agreement among participants about unexplored drug effects that might produce ulcer healing.
 Of the 36 such mechanisms surveyed, the most support went to therapies aimed at enhancement of mucosal blood flow, epithelial restitution, and mucosal alkaline secretion or inhibition of luminal pepsin activity.
 The diversity of opinions among participants suggests a high level of empiricism in the development of ulcer healing drugs apart from those that inhibit acid secretion.
 This empiricism probably arises from inadequate understanding of processes of mucosal injury and repair.
