The role of behavioral research in the prevention and management of invasive diarrheas.
 Reduction in the prevalence of invasive diarrheal diseases can be facilitated by the development of models for systematic examination of behavioral risk factors that are associated with these illnesses.
 These factors include insufficient use of health care services, noncompliance with treatment, unhygienic behaviors, employment of poor feeding practices for infants and young children, and inappropriate handling of foods.
 Information on conditions that facilitate or constrain appropriate behaviors will assist the development of programs for the prevention and management of invasive diarrheas.
