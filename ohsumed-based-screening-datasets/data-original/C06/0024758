Comparison of restorative proctocolectomy with and without covering ileostomy in ulcerative colitis.
 The experience of restorative proctocolectomy for ulcerative colitis is reported in 16 consecutive patients with no covering ileostomy (group 2) in comparison with 15 patients with a covering stoma (group 1); in each group a J pouch was constructed.
 All patients had pre- and postoperative clinical and manometric evaluations of the functional result up to 12 months.
 There were no deaths or permanent failures.
 The number of early complications was four in each group.
 Re-ileostomy was needed in one patient of group 1, and an ileostomy was constructed in three patients of group 2.
 At 1 year after operation the functional results did not differ between groups 1 and 2 in terms of daily frequency of defaecation (mean 5.6 and 5.4 in 24 h respectively), or in terms of anal basal or maximal squeeze pressures.
 There was a significant (P less than 0.01) saving in total hospital stay (median 11 days) and in operating theatre time (mean 41 min) in patients with no covering ileostomy.
 It is concluded that a covering ileostomy may be unnecessary in restorative proctocolectomy, at least in suitable cases with no technical difficulty at the time of operation.
