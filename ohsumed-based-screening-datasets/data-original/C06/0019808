Lymphoma of the gastric stump: report of a case.
 We report a case of primary lymphoma on a previously resected stomach in a 62-year-old man.
 The patient was treated 22 years earlier with a partial gastrectomy and Billroth II reconstruction for a benign gastric ulcer.
 The rarity of this entity and its possible relationship with pseudolymphoma or lymphoid nodular hyperplasia is discussed, and the literature is reviewed.
