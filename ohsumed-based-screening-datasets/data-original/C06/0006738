Gastroesophageal reflux and sclerotherapy strictures.
 The development of esophageal stricture is common following endoscopic variceal sclerotherapy (EVS).
 Gastroesophageal reflux may be at least partly responsible.
 Twelve randomly selected male patients underwent chronic EVS for the management of bleeding esophageal varices.
 Six patients developed strictures during or after EVS, six did not.
 There were no significant differences between stricture and nonstricture patients during 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring.
 Three of the six stricture patients and four of the six nonstricture patients had an abnormal amount of reflux.
 Gastroesophageal reflux occurs frequently in patients undergoing EVS, and it is not likely to play a major role in EVS stricture formation.
