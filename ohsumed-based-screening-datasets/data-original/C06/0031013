Argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions and alpha-fetoprotein in adenomatous hyperplasia in human cirrhotic livers.
 Recently, adenomatous hyperplasia (AH) of the liver has been suspected as a precancerous lesion in human hepatocarcinogenesis.
 The authors examined 75 cases of AH from 42 cirrhotic livers, using staining of argyrophilic nucleolar organizer regions (AgNORs).
 These reflect proliferative cell activity.
 Findings in AH were compared with those seen in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and other chronic liver diseases.
 Expression of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was also examined immunohistochemically.
 The authors classified AH into three types: ordinary (OAH), atypical (AAH), and AH with focal malignancy (FM).
 OAH implies a lack of atypia; AAH represents AH with structural and cellular atypia but without the features of overt carcinoma; and FM denotes AH with foci of overt HCC.
 Forty of the 75 cases of AH were categorized as OAH, 19 as AAH, and 16 as FM.
 The noncancerous areas of FM had features of AAH.
 The mean number of AgNORs in AH was intermediate between that seen in cirrhosis (2.93) and HCC (6.18) and showed a step-wise increase in the following order: OAH (2.95), AAH (3.89), noncancerous areas in FM (4.58), and malignant foci in FM (5.71).
 There was no significant difference in AgNOR counts between OAH and cirrhosis.
 AgNOR counts in AAH and FM were significantly higher than those of OAH, and lower than those of HCC.
 AFP was positive in 12 of 25 HCCs and in malignant foci of 3 FM lesions, but it was absent in OAH and AAH.
 These data suggest that OAH has a limited capacity for proliferation but that AAH and FM are much more replicative.
 The latter two conditions are probably preneoplastic lesions or early forms of HCC.
