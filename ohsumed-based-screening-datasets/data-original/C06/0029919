Bilateral gluteus maximus transposition for anal incontinence.
 Seven patients (five men and two women) ranging in age from 26 to 65 years (means = 44) underwent bilateral gluteus maximus transposition for complete anal incontinence.
 The indications for operation were sphincter destruction secondary to multiple fistulotomies (n = 4), bilateral pudendal nerve damage (n = 2), and high imperforate anus (n = 1).
 The procedure is performed without the use of a diverting colostomy.
 The inferior portion of the origin of each gluteus maximus is detached from the sacrum and coccyx, bifurcated, and tunneled subcutaneously to encircle the anus.
 The ends are then sutured together to form two opposing slings of voluntary muscle.
 Postoperatively, six patients regained continence to solid stool, two to liquid stool as well, and only one patient in this group was able to control flatus.
 Although resting pressures remained unchanged, voluntary squeeze pressures were restored by this operation.
 In addition, rectal sensation was markedly improved, which helps make this a worthwhile procedure for properly selected patients.
