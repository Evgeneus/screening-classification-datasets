Foreign body in the gastrointestinal tract: intraluminal migration of laparotomy sponge.
 We have reported a case of complete transluminal migration of a retained laparotomy sponge that caused repeated partial small bowel obstruction.
 Diagnosis was made when roentgenograms showed multiple positions of the laparotomy marker.
 The sponge was surgically removed.
 This is the 69th reported case of complete transluminal migration and distal movement of a laparotomy sponge.
