Osmotic diarrhea induced by sugar-free theophylline solution in critically ill patients.
 It is widely accepted that early enteral nutrition is beneficial to critically ill patients.
 Diarrhea is a common problem in this setting and is often erroneously ascribed to enteral feedings.
 More often medications cause the diarrhea.
 Multiple cases of severe diarrhea associated with the use of a sugar-free theophylline solution (SFTS) were discovered by a nutrition support team.
 SFTS may induce an osmotic diarrhea because it contains sorbitol.
 A 55-year-old man admitted for a dissecting aneurysm was started on isotonic formula enteral feedings and within a day of starting SFTS developed severe diarrhea.
 The sorbitol-induced osmotic diarrhea persisted for 36 of his 83 days of hospitalization with direct cost for the evaluation of this diarrhea being $4,250.
 His prolonged hospitalization cost $166,200.
 A retrospective review of 20 consecutive patients receiving SFTS revealed that 15 patients had diarrhea for 2 or more consecutive days compared with 20 patients receiving iv aminophylline, of whom only two patients had diarrhea.
 Furthermore, SFTS was administered to healthy volunteers and a prominent breath hydrogen response was noted.
 The polyalcohol sorbitol is used as a sweetner in "sugar-free" products and not quantified on labeling because it is considered an inactive ingredient.
 Nutritionists should be aware that medicinal solutions can contain enough sorbitol to create a laxative effect which is an easily reversible cause of diarrhea in enterally fed patients.
