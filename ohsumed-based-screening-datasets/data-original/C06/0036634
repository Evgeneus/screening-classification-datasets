Psychologic factors associated with peptic ulcer disease.
 Peptic ulcer disease provides an excellent model for the study of mind-body interactions in the pathogenesis and course of an illness.
 Early psychodynamic explanations of the role of personality factors in the evolution of peptic ulcer disease have been supplemented in recent years by more scientifically based studies on the role of stress and coping ability.
 Multiple psychosocial variables have confounded the outcome of many of these studies.
 Yet, a clear need and guidelines exist for the comprehensive medical and psychosocial evaluation and treatment of patients with peptic ulcer disease.
 Concomitant psychiatric assessment and management, including psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic approaches, for those patients with refractory symptoms or ongoing psychiatric symptoms carried out in close collaboration with primary caregivers will significantly decrease overall morbidity and mortality.
