Newborn behavioral performance in colic and noncolic infants.
 The specific purpose of this investigation was to examine the newborn performance of colic and noncolic infants on the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (BNBAS).
 The sample was composed of 119 firstborn infants from healthy, married, white couples.
 Data were collected prenatally, during the perinatal period, and postnatally from birth through four months of infant age.
 A total of 38 infants (32%) were believed to have colic.
 Colicky infants differed significantly from noncolicky infants on one of the seven item clusters, labeled the BNBAS Orientation cluster (p less than .05).
