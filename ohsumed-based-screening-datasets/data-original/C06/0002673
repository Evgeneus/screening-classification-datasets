Brain and liver dolichol in chronic alcoholism: a necropsy study.
 Cerebral gray and white matter and liver dolichol levels were measured in postmortem samples from chronic alcoholics and nonalcoholic controls following recent suggestions that dolichol levels may be used as a marker for alcoholism.
 No significant differences in brain dolichol were found between the control and alcoholic groups.
 A significant reduction in the liver dolichol was observed in the alcoholic group.
 This was most marked in those alcoholics with liver disease.
