Septic Streptococcus milleri spondylodiscitis.
 We describe 2 patients presenting lumbar spondylitis due to Streptococcus milleri.
 In both cases origin was related to preexistent intestinal pathology.
 Surgical drainage of a collection of pus was necessary in one case.
 Longterm antibiotic therapy led to full recovery.
 Despite confused nomenclature Streptococcus milleri must be considered a serious pathogen mainly associated with purulent infection with osteoarticular affinity.
