Preperitoneal approach for hernia repair: clinical application in pediatric urology.
 The preperitoneal approach for inguinal hernia repair rarely is indicated in children.
 However, we report on its clinical usefulness for children in whom the perivesical space must be exposed, such as during surgical repair of bladder exstrophy, ureterocele and ureteral reimplantation.
 This approach allows for a true high ligation of the hernia sac, and the repair is safe, fast and effective.
