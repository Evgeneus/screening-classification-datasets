Comparative study of sucralfate 2 grams twice daily versus sucralfate 1 gram four times daily in the treatment of benign gastric ulcers in outpatients.
 In a double-blind, randomized study, we compared the healing of gastric ulcer during a twice-daily regimen of 2 g sucralfate or sucralfate 1 g q.i.d.
 Patients receiving the former therapy received the tablets one-half hour before breakfast and at bedtime.
 Patients receiving sucralfate 1 g q.i.d.
 received their therapy 30 minutes before breakfast, lunch, and supper, and at bedtime.
 The study included 52 patients with endoscopically proven gastric ulcer; 41 patients completed the study.
 Healing was endoscopically assessed at 8 weeks and 12 weeks.
 After 8 and 12 weeks the healing rate for sucralfate 2 g b.i.d.
 was 67% and 92%, respectively; the healing rate of sucralfate 1 g q.i.d.
 was 59% and 71%, respectively.
 No statistically significant difference was found between the two regimens.
 The results suggest that 2 g sucralfate twice daily is as effective in the healing of gastric ulcer as 1 g sucralfate q.i.d.
