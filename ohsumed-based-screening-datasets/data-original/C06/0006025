Adenocarcinoma of the colon occurring with intussusception in an adolescent.
 Hydrostatic reduction of intussusception is definitive therapy in most infants with this abnormality.
 In the older child, adolescent, and adult, a polyp or tumor is often present.
 Operative intervention should be considered earlier in the clinical course both to relieve the intussusception and to define the nature of the lead point.
