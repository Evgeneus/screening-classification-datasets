Approaches to the patient with aspiration and swallowing disabilities.
 Aspiration, or soiling of the tracheobronchial tree, can produce life-threatening pulmonary disease.
 Intermittent or persistent aspiration may cause symptoms including cough, intermittent fever, recurrent tracheobronchitis, atelectasis, pneumonia, and/or empyema.
 The pulmonary disease may be associated with weight loss, cachexia, and dehydration.
 In many cases the aspiration is caused by laryngeal dysfunction, allowing pulmonary contamination by swallowed material.
 In other cases the aspiration is caused by a dysfunction of the oral, pharyngeal, or esophageal phases of swallowing.
 In some cases the aspiration is caused by a combination of laryngeal and swallowing dysfunction.
 Geriatric patients are more likely to experience aspiration, since muscle weakness causing mechanical disability and neurologic impairment are more common in this age group.
 Therefore, with the ever-increasing aging of our population, these disabilities will be on the rise, with an associated increase in pulmonary disease and death.
 The approach to evaluation and management of these disorders must be based on an understanding of the underlying functional impairment.
