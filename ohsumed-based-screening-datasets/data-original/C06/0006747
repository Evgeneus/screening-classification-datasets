Jejunal-rectal fistula as a complication of postoperative radiotherapy.
 We present the case of a patient with an unusual, complex enteric fistula with multiple tracts and associated abscesses.
 The fistula was a late complication of radiotherapy, administered three years earlier, after resection for carcinoma of the sigmoid colon.
 Most of the small bowel was involved in the radiation-induced disease.
 A wide resection was performed successfully.
 This report reviews current literature on intra-abdominal postradiotherapy injuries, particularly intestinal fistulae.
