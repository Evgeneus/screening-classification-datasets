Liver and pancreas: improved spin-echo T1 contrast by shorter echo time and fat suppression at 1.5 T.
 T1-weighted spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) images have had limited soft-tissue contrast at 1.5 T.
 The authors investigated the effects of echo-time (TE) minimization and fat suppression on MR images of the liver and pancreas.
 Two sets of MR images were obtained with identical repetition times and other parameters.
 In 10 subjects with seven liver lesions, images with TEs of 20 and 12 msec were compared.
 In 18 additional subjects with seven liver lesions and five pancreatic carcinomas, images with identical TEs but with and without fat suppression were compared.
 Contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) were greater with a TE of 12 msec than with a TE of 20 msec for liver versus spleen (7.6 vs 4.9, P = .014) and liver versus lesion (6.9 vs 3.9, P = .031).
 In patients without fatty liver, CNR for six lesions versus liver was greater (9.5 vs 6.0, P = .014) with fat suppression.
 CNR between glandular pancreas and cancer was most conspicuous with fat suppression, but fat planes were less distinct.
 Minimization of TE improves T1-weighted images significantly.
 Fat suppression also improves CNR, but the disadvantages of fat suppression do not allow elimination of conventional T1-weighted images.
