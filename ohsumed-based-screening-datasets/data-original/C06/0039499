Reperitonealization of the lesser curve in proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer.
 Ninety-six consecutive patients were operated upon with proximal gastric vagotomy for duodenal ulcer at our department during the two year period 1976 to 1978.
 These patients were prospectively randomized into two groups, one of which (45 patients) had reperitonealization of the lesser curve.
 These two groups are compared herein.
 Reperitonealization of the lesser curve was without benefit on long term clinical results, ulcer recurrence rate and gastric acid secretion.
 None of the patients had perforation of the lesser curve.
