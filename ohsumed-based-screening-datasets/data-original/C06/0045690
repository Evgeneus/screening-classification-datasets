Nonaspiration fine-needle cytology of the liver: a new technique for obtaining diagnostic samples.
 We studied a new method of obtaining diagnostic cytology samples from the liver that differs from fine-needle aspiration cytology in that no suction is used to obtain the sample.
 This method is simpler to perform than traditional aspiration biopsy and yields concentrated cell smears that are easier to interpret.
 The sample enters the needle because of capillary action, a physical property of fluid that causes it to flow into the lumen of a narrow channel.
 This nonaspiration technique was used in 40 consecutive patients undergoing fine-needle biopsy of mass lesions of the liver.
 A 22-gauge spinal needle was used in all procedures.
 The cytology smears obtained were prepared, stained, and interpreted by the same methods used for conventional fine-needle cytology specimens.
 Specific diagnoses were rendered in 36 patients (90%) and in 32 (94%) of those patients with malignant tumors.
 An average of 1.7 needle passes (range, 1-4) was needed per patient.
 We conclude that the results from nonaspiration fine-needle cytology of the liver are as good as those from conventional aspiration technique, and the nonaspiration technique is easier to perform and results in smears that are easier to interpret.
