Successful removal of massive intragastric gallstones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy and mechanical lithotripsy.
 We describe a case of massive gallstones discharged into the stomach through a cholecystoduodenal fistula and the successful removal of these stones by endoscopic electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EEHL) and endoscopic mechanical lithotripsy (EML) for the prevention of gallstone ileus.
 A 60-yr-old woman was admitted with epigastric pain and nausea.
 Upper gastrointestinal tract examination demonstrated backflow of contrast medium from the duodenal bulb into the gallbladder.
 Endoscopic examination revealed a large fistula on the anterior wall of the duodenal bulb, and two brown stones (about 3 cm in diameter) were found in the stomach.
 To prevent gallstone ileus, removal of these stones was attempted.
 They were broken into pieces by EEHL, then crushed into smaller pieces by EML and removed orally.
 Chemical analysis showed the composition of the gallstones to be at least 98% cholesterol.
 The patient was discharged one month after removal of the gallstones and has remained asymptomatic.
