Gastroesophageal reflux in the older child: presentation, response to treatment and long-term follow-up.
 Much attention has been focused on the natural history of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in neurologically normal infants which generally resolves by two years of age.
 In contrast, little is known of the outcome of GER diagnosed in normal older children.
 The charts of 32 children (21 males) without neurologic or esophageal anatomic abnormalities, age 3.5 to 16 years (mean = 9.8) at the time of diagnosis, were reviewed.
 Diagnosis was based on suggestive presenting symptoms and evaluation of prolonged intraesophageal pH monitoring.
 Esophagitis was diagnosed by histologic criteria in 16 of the 32 patients.
 Medical treatment consisted of prokinetic agents (metoclopramide, bethanechol) and H2-receptor antagonists.
 After a one to eight year follow-up period (mean +/- SD - 3.4 +/- 2.1), the symptoms in 13 children had resolved or were sufficiently improved to discontinue medication.
 In 13 patients, symptoms were improved but medication was required for adequate control.
 Four children were symptomatic without improvement in spite of medical therapy and two others required fundoplication for continued severe symptoms and refractory esophagitis.
 In summary, less than 50% of otherwise normal older children with GER undergo spontaneous resolution of marked improvement in symptoms and the remainder require continued long-term medical and/or surgical management.
