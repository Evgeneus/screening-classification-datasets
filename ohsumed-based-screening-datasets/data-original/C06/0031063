Chronic xerostomia increases esophageal acid exposure and is associated with esophageal injury.
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of chronic xerostomia on parameters of gastroesophageal reflux and esophagitis.
 DESIGN: Observational study of a cohort of male patients with xerostomia and age-matched control subjects.
 SETTING: Tertiary-care Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
 SUBJECTS: Sixteen male patients with chronic xerostomia secondary to radiation for head and neck cancers or medications.
 Nineteen age-matched male control subjects with comparable alcohol and smoking histories.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Esophageal motility was similar in patients with xerostomia and controls.
 Clearance of acid from the esophagus and 24-hour intraesophageal pH were markedly abnormal in patients with xerostomia.
 Symptoms and signs of esophagitis were significantly more frequent in subjects with xerostomia.
 CONCLUSIONS: Chronic xerostomia may predispose to esophageal injury, at least in part, by decreasing the clearance of acid from the esophagus and altering 24-hour intraesophageal pH.
 Esophageal injury is a previously unreported complication of long-term salivary deficiency.
