Endoscopic variceal ligation in patients who have failed endoscopic sclerotherapy.
 Endoscopic variceal ligation has been developed as an alternative to endoscopic sclerotherapy.
 We report a series of 12 men with a history of bleeding esophageal varices who were treated with endoscopic variceal ligation after they had failed sclerotherapy.
 Hemostasis was achieved in all 10 patients who were bleeding at the time of initial endoscopy and again in those who subsequently re-bled.
 Over a follow-up period of up to 22 months, varices have been and remain eradicated in five patients; in four others, a reduction in grade was noted before death (two patients), liver transplant, or loss to follow-up (one patient each); two patients died before they could be re-evaluated, while in the remaining patient, no reduction in variceal grade was noted before loss to follow-up.
 No complication was recorded after 35 endoscopic treatment sessions involving a total of 245 rubber band ligations.
 Our results indicate that endoscopic variceal ligation may be used with success in patients who fail sclerotherapy.
