Renal scintigraphy in the diagnosis and surgical management of a patient with caliceal colic: a case report.
 A patient with persistent renal colic and a caliceal stone is presented.
 Furosemide renography, commonly used to differentiate functional stasis from mechanical obstruction of an entire kidney or duplicated collecting system, can make this determination at the caliceal level.
 As in this case such determination can affect clinical management of the patient.
