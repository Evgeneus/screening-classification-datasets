Serum bupivacaine concentrations following wound infiltration in children undergoing inguinal herniotomy.
 Serum bupivacaine concentrations were measured in 12 children who underwent elective herniotomy and who received analgesia in the form of wound infiltration.
 Mean (SD) peak concentration was 0.36 (0.14) micrograms/ml and time to peak concentration was 14.6 (7.2) minutes after infiltration of 1.25 mg/kg of bupivacaine.
 These concentrations are lower than those associated with other local anaesthetic blocks and well below potentially toxic levels.
 Wound infiltration provides a simple, effective and safe method of providing postoperative analgesia for hernia repair in children.
