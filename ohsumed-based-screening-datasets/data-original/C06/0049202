Cell kinetics of gastrointestinal tumors after different nutritional regimens. A preliminary report.
 Forty-four cases of different untreated gastrointestinal tumors were studied with regard to cell kinetic activity.
 As a pilot experiment, we also determined the 3H-TdR Labeling Index (LI) in 28 patients in basal conditions and after 15 days of nutritional manipulation with prevalently lipid-based or glucose-based feeding to ascertain whether selective nutritional regimens could affect tumor proliferation.
 Preliminary results from this study indicate that a kinetic perturbation is induced in tumor cells by nutritional manipulation.
 Lipid-based feeding seems to produce effects similar to those of chemical or physical anticancer agents, thus suggesting a possible supporting role of nutritional manipulation in cancer treatment strategy.
