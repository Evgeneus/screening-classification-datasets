Reversal of intrapulmonary shunting in cirrhosis after liver transplantation demonstrated by perfusion lung scan.
 A young girl with biliary atresia leading to cirrhosis developed respiratory complications with hypoxemia.
 Intrapulmonary shunting was diagnosed with a 99mTc-MAA perfusion lung scan, which showed marked systemic activity.
 The shunting resolved after liver transplantation.
 The perfusion lung scan offers an efficient method to screen patients with cirrhosis in whom intrapulmonary shunts are suspected and to follow their progress.
