A prospective comparison of laser therapy and intubation in endoscopic palliation for malignant dysphagia.
 There is little objective long-term follow-up comparing laser therapy with intubation for palliation of malignant dysphagia.
 In a prospective, nonrandomized two-center trial 43 patients treated with the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser were compared with 30 patients treated by endoscopic intubation; the two groups were comparable for mean age and tumor position, length, and histology.
 Dysphagia was graded from 0 to 4 (0, normal swallowing; 4, dysphagia for liquids).
 Pretreatment mean dysphagia grades were similar: laser-treated group, 2.9 (SD, 0.6); intubated group, 3.2 (SD, 0.55).
 For thoracic esophageal tumors, the percentage of patients achieving an improvement in dysphagia grade by greater than or equal to 1 grade initially and over the long term was similar (laser, 95% and 77%; intubation, 100% and 86%).
 For tumors crossing the cardia, intubation was significantly better (laser, 59% and 50%; intubation, 100% and 92%, respectively; P less than 0.001).
 In patients palliated over a long period, however, the mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their mean dysphagia grade over the remainder of their lives (mean survival: laser, 6.1 months; intubation, 5.1 months) was better in the laser group (1.6 vs.
 2.0; P less than 0.01); 33% of laser-treated and 11% of intubated patients could eat most or all solids (P less than 0.05).
 For long-term palliation, laser-treated patients required on average more procedures (4.6 vs.
 1.4; P less than 0.05) and days in the hospital (14 vs.
 9; P less than 0.05).
 The perforation rate was lower in the laser-treated group (2% vs.
 13%; P less than 0.02); no treatment-related deaths occurred in either group.
 For individual patients, the best results are likely to be achieved when the two techniques are used in a complementary fashion in specialist centers.
