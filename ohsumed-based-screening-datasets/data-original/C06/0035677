Thermal ablation of the gallbladder.
 Gallbladder ablation by means of injection of hot contrast medium was attempted in 13 dogs.
 Room temperature contrast medium was injected into the gallbladders of two additional dogs (controls).
 After midline laparotomy was performed to expose the gallbladder, temperature probes were placed in the liver adjacent to the gallbladder, and on the surface and in the lumen of the gallbladder.
 A 7-F catheter with multiple side holes was placed into the gallbladder.
 The cystic duct was clamped during the procedure.
 After injection of boiling contrast medium, the mean temperature in the gallbladder lumen was 80 degrees C; in the adjacent liver, 43.5 degrees C; and on the gallbladder surface, 45.8 degrees C.
 After the procedure, the cystic duct was unclamped, temperature probes and catheter were removed, and the laparotomy was closed in standard fashion.
 In the hot contrast medium group, one dog each was sacrificed at 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks, and at 6 months.
 Six animals were sacrificed at 1 year.
 The gallbladder was completely ablated in 11 of 13 animals in the hot contrast medium group.
 One dog was sacrificed at 8 days because of bile leakage, and another was sacrificed at 17 days because of gallbladder rupture.
 The two control animals were sacrificed at 12 and 13 weeks, and their gallbladders were normal at that time.
