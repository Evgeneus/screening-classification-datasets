Hemobilia due to vasculitis of the gall bladder in a patient with mixed connective tissue disease.
 A 30-year-old woman with mixed connective tissue disease presented with acute abdominal pain and signs of blood loss.
 At cholecystectomy she appeared to have lost a considerable amount of blood into the biliary tract due to bleeding of the gall bladder.
 Microscopic examination showed vasculitis of the gall bladder wall.
 Hemobilia has not been described before as a complication in mixed connective tissue disease.
