Esophageal obstruction 14 years after treatment for Hodgkin's disease.
 The incidence of late radiation injury of the esophagus is not precisely determined but, overall, the occurrence of clinically apparent damage is infrequent.
 The authors report a complete esophageal obstruction in a 21-year-old man, 14 years after chemo-radiation therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Although endoscopy failed to demonstrate a gross morphologic abnormality, an esophagogram detected abnormal peristalsis and stricture, and esophageal manometry coupled with dynamic isotopic study clearly demonstrated a multilevel secondary neuronal damage.
 Data in the literature suggest that alteration in motility is by far the most frequent radiologic manifestation.
 Further prospective studies will probably clarify the actual incidence of late esophageal damage after chemo-radiation therapy.
