Appendicitis. Improvements in diagnosis and treatment.
 The results of therapy in cases of suspected acute appendicitis were reviewed in 844 consecutive cases of appendicitis occurring over a 3-year period.
 A diagnostic accuracy of 87.4 per cent was found as well as a perforation rate of 18.4 per cent.
 Complication rates varied with the clinical state of the appendix: 16 per cent in perforated, 5.6 per cent in nonperforated, and 11.3 per cent in normal appendices.
 Excellent results were routinely obtainable employing early operative intervention, perioperative antibiotics, and a systematic surgical approach.
