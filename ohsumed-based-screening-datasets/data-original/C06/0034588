Diarrhea in children newly enrolled in day-care centers in Houston.
 Diarrhea is a common illness among children in day-care centers (DCC).
 We hypothesized that the incidence of diarrhea was greater among children in their first 1 or 2 months after enrollment in a DCC than in any subsequent period in day care.
 We followed 442 children younger than 2 years of age enrolled in 13 randomly selected DCCs for the occurrence of diarrhea during a 14 1/2-month period.
 Parents completed standardized baseline questionnaires and research nurses visited the DCC twice weekly to record the occurrence of diarrhea and to collect stool specimens.
 Incidence rates, rate ratios, chi square statistics and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for crude and stratified analyses.
 The diarrheal incidence rate of 4.4 cases/child-year in the first 4 weeks in the centers was significantly (rate ratio, 1.6; confidence interval, 1.3 to 2.1; P less than 0.01) higher than the 2.7 cases/child-year incidence rate of diarrhea in subsequent weeks.
 The effects of gender, ethnicity, age, DCC size, previous DCC attendance and season were examined and did not account for the association observed between recent enrollement and risk of diarrheal illness.
 Rotavirus was identified in 18% of cases of diarrhea, but no association was seen with recent enrollment in DCC.
 A significantly higher incidence of diarrhea occurred in males compared with females (P less than 0.002) and in younger children (P less than 0.001) compared with older children.
 Diarrhea is common in children in DCCs and occurs significantly more frequently in children during their first 4 weeks in a DCC.
