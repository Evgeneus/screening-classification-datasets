Intraoperative evaluation of intestinal ischemia: a comparison of methods.
 Methods for evaluating intestinal ischemia include standard clinical criteria, Doppler ultrasonography, and intravenous fluorescein injection.
 Each has disadvantages, and a combination of methods is often used.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether surface oximetry could be used to assess perfusion in an animal whose intestinal diameter approximates that of infants.
 Reversible arterial, venous, and arteriovenous occlusion was studied in rabbit intestines.
 After 6 to 8 hours of occlusion, intestinal vascularity was evaluated by the four methods listed.
 Doppler ultrasonography and surface oximetry were found to be unreliable tools for assessing perfusion in this animal model.
 We conclude that standard clinical criteria and fluorescein remain the standards for intraoperative evaluation of intestinal perfusion.
