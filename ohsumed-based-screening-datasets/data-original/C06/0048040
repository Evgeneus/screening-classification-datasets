Stones and infection in renal caliceal diverticula: treatment with percutaneous procedures.
 Percutaneous treatment of symptomatic caliceal diverticula has expanded the application of uroradiologic intervention.
 To assess the safety and efficacy of these procedures, we have reviewed our experience with percutaneous management of 12 symptomatic caliceal diverticula, 10 with stones and two infected.
 Nine stone-bearing diverticula were punctured directly with subsequent tract dilatation, nephroscopic stone extraction, and cavity obliteration (six with fulguration and drainage and three with drainage alone).
 One case was approached indirectly by puncturing a distant calix, dilating the diverticular neck, and flushing the stones into the collecting system for extraction.
 This cavity was not treated.
 Two infected diverticula were punctured directly for drainage and obliteration (one by fulguration and one by tetracycline sclerosis).
 Complete stone extractions were accomplished in all 10 cases.
 In eight with clinical follow-up ranging from 4 months to 6 years, one stone has recurred and seven patients are asymptomatic.
 Follow-up urograms were available in eight of 10 patients in whom cavity obliteration was attempted; in six (75%) of eight, nonvisualization of the diverticulum indicated successful obliteration.
 Only one major complication (urinoma requiring drainage) occurred.
 We conclude that percutaneous procedures are safe and effective in treating infected or stone-bearing caliceal diverticula.
 Direct diverticular puncture for access and diverticular fulguration for cavity obliteration is our preferred technique.
