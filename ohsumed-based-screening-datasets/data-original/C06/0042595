Dysphagia after Nissen fundoplication.
 Nissen fundoplication is a commonly used antireflux operation.
 After this operation symptoms such as dysphagia, inability to belch and vomit, and gas bloating are frequently reported in the literature.
 In 32 patients who underwent Nissen fundoplication 3.5-18 years ago, postprocedure dysphagia was studied using conventional manometry and 24 h ambulatory pressure and pH recording.
 Our study indicates that dysphagia tends to decrease after surgery.
 Neither conventional nor ambulatory pressure recording revealed motor abnormalities that could be held responsible for the dysphagia.
 Therefore, the data do not support the concept that dysphagia is a major complication of Nissen fundoplication.
