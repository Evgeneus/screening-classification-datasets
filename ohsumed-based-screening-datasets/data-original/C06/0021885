Disorders of esophageal motility.
 Patients with esophageal motility disorders usually have dysphagia and many also have chest pain similar to angina.
 The diagnosis is suggested by the clinical presentation, and supporting evidence is often provided by contrast roentgenography.
 Esophageal manometry is usually necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
 Conservative therapy using pharmacologic agents is often useful as an initial trial, although many patients who continue to be symptomatic ultimately require surgical intervention.
