A new balanced operation for complex gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 Twenty-seven patients with advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease have been treated with combined transthoracic parietal cell vagotomy and Collis-Nissen fundoplication.
 Gastric acid analyses (n = 20) obtained preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively demonstrated a significant late reduction in gastric acid output.
 Twenty-six patients (96%) have experienced relief of gastroesophageal reflux disease at a mean of 13.3 months (range, 6 to 25 months) without postvagotomy symptoms.
 Transthoracic parietal cell vagotomy may be considered as an adjunct to mechanical surgical control of advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease.
