Colonoscopically guided tube decompression in Ogilvie's syndrome.
 Ogilvie's syndrome (pseudo-obstruction of the colon) may result in gangrene and perforation of the colon if not effectively treated.
 Colonoscopic decompression and endoscopically guided rectal tube placement were employed to treat five patients with this syndrome who had failed medical therapy.
 All patients tolerated the procedure well and required no further treatment.
