Serum hepatitis B virus DNA in hepatitis B virus seropositive and seronegative patients with normal liver function.
 The presence of hepatitis type B virus (HBV) DNA in serum specimens from 926 apparently healthy people with normal liver functions was determined by polymerase chain reaction; 41.2% of people with positive results for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) (94 of 228) and 95.2% of people with positive results for HBV e antigen (HBeAg) (60 of 63) were found to have positive results for serum HBV DNA.
 On the other hand, serum HBV DNA was found in 11.0% (77 of 698) of HBsAg-negative people and in 13% (69 of 530) of those who had positive results for serum antibodies directed against HBsAg.
 The results seem to suggest that HBV DNA can be found in a significant portion of apparently healthy people with normal liver function who are either seronegative for HBsAg or seropositive for antibodies directed against HBsAg.
