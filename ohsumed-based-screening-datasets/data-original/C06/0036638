Gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 Gastroesophageal reflux disease, usually manifested by frequent heartburn, occurs in approximately 10% of our adult population.
 The presence of a hiatal hernia is usually associated with, but does not necessarily cause, LES dysfunction, allowing acid reflux to produce esophageal and aerodigestive symptoms.
 The mucosa can be extensively damaged and, ultimately, a columnar lining, termed Barrett's esophagus, a premalignant condition, can develop.
 Treatment with H2-antagonists has been nirvana to some patients, but has proved only partially helpful to others.
 Adjunctive agents may increase relief and may help heal erosive esophagitis in some patients, but side effects and cost limit their use.
 Maintenance therapy with full doses is required, as the relapse rate for this chronic condition is high.
 Omeprazole temporarily heals almost everyone with otherwise resistant GERD, but it is currently used only on a short-term basis unless surgery, eminently successful in well-selected patients, is contraindicated.
