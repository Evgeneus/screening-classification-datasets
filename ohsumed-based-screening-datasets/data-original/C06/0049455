Review of duodenal diverticula.
 Duodenal diverticula occur in 2-5% of patients undergoing barium studies of the upper intestinal tract.
 Duodenal diverticula are classified into two types: extraluminal or intraluminal.
 Usually of little clinical significance, they can cause obstruction, cholelithiasis, ascending cholangitis, ulcers, and hemorrhage, and may perforate.
 Associated intestinal tract malformations have been reported in 40% of patients with intraluminal duodenal diverticula.
 Diagnosis is made by endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal series.
 In symptomatic cases, extraluminal diverticula are amenable to surgery, whereas intraluminal diverticula may be either surgically or endoscopically resected.
 Imaging of the biliary tree should be performed prior to any intervention.
