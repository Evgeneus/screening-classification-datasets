Effect of salbutamol on gastroesophageal reflux in healthy volunteers and patients with asthma.
 The aim of this work was to establish whether beta-adrenergic agonists promote or increase gastroesophageal reflux in patients with asthma.
 Ten healthy individuals and eight patients with asthma were studied on 2 different days.
 One day they received a placebo, and the other day they received 4 mg of salbutamol by mouth.
 Complete measurements of esophageal manometry were performed before and every 30 minutes for 210 minutes after the administration of the drugs.
 Esophageal pH was measured continuously for the duration of the experiment.
 The results demonstrate that (1) salbutamol had no effect on the lower esophageal sphincter pressure gradient, the peak esophageal contraction pressure, or the number and duration of reflux episodes in patients with asthma and normal individuals, and (2) patients with asthma have a resting lower esophageal sphincter pressure higher than healthy subjects.
 We conclude that the administration of salbutamol does not affect esophageal function.
