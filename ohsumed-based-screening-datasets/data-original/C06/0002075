Intra-abdominal palpation of a nasogastric tube in the stomach does not assure appropriate placement.
 Improperly placed nasogastric (NG) tubes have been associated with considerable morbidity.
 The only reliable indicator of correct NG tube placement appears to be the aspiration of gastric contents.
 We have reported a case of major morbidity from an improperly placed NG tube that perforated the cervical esophagus, dissected the mediastinum, and terminated in the omental bursa.
 No gastric aspirate was obtained by suctioning of the tube, but correct placement was presumed based upon the surgeon's direct intraoperative palpation of the tip of the tube.
 Failure to aspirate gastric contents should alert the practitioner to the possibility of improper NG tube placement.
