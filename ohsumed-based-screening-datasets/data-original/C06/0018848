Gaucher's disease complicated by bleeding esophageal varices and colonic infiltration by Gaucher cells.
 We report a 10-yr-old child with Gaucher's disease who developed upper gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices, as well as hemorrhage from a colonic polyp infiltrated with Gaucher cells.
 Both the varices and polyp were treated endoscopically, and the outcome was successful.
 Although gastrointestinal hemorrhage due to portal hypertension is considered a rare complication of Gaucher's disease, colonic infiltration with Gaucher cells has not been recognized previously.
