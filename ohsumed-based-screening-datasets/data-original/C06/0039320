Effect of a taurine-supplemented diet on conjugated bile acids in biliary surgical patients.
 The effect of a taurine-supplemented diet on the level of conjugated bile acids in postoperative patients was investigated during two consecutive 5-day period.
 Eighteen hepatobiliary patients with choledochostomies and a specific T-tube insertion were collected and divided randomly into two groups.
 In group 1, an ordinary postoperative soft diet was prescribed for the first 5 postoperative days and then followed with a taurine-supplemented soft diet (40 mumol/kg per day) for 5 consecutive days.
 In group 2, the taurine-supplemented diet was prescribed in reverse.
 At the end of the two periods, on days 5 and 10, bile was collected via a T-tube with an inflatable balloon and low-pressure motor suction.
 Analysis of conjugated bile acids was done by high-performance liquid chromatography.
 The results showed that a taurine-supplemented diet increased the concentration of taurocholic acid, glycocholic acid, taurochenodeoxycholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid, and total bile acid from 0.5, 1.9, 0.3, 1.4, and 4.7 mg/mL (on day 5) to 1.1, 3.5, 1.0, 2.6, and 8.9 mg/mL, respectively, on day 10 in group 1.
 Similar findings were noted in group 2.
 These results indicate that a taurine-supplemented diet may enhance the conjugation and secretion of bile acid in hepatobiliary patients.
