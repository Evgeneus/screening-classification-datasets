The role of endoscopic retrograde pancreatography (ERP) in blunt abdominal trauma.
 The diagnosis of pancreatic injury is often difficult because it lies retroperitoneally in a protected area.
 Delayed diagnosis and treatment of blunt pancreatic trauma can result in significant morbidity and mortality.
 Endoscopic Retrograde Pancreatography (ERP) is infrequently used in the diagnosis of pancreatic injury.
 We reviewed our experience with the use of ERP in patients with blunt pancreatic injury.
 Two stable patients with traumatic pancreatitis underwent ERP shortly after injury.
 CT scans revealed a transverse fracture of the distal pancrease in one and fluid accumulation in the other around the pancreas extending to the right kidney and left hepatic lobe.
 The absence of ductal disruption on ERP allowed nonoperative management of the pancreatitis.
 Resolution was documented by the absence of symptoms on regular oral intake, normal serum amylase levels, and normal follow-up CT scans.
 A third patient with persistent fistulae three months postinjury underwent preoperative ERP revealing ductal obstruction.
 This facilitated the planning of a distal pancreatectomy and subsequently the fistulae healed.
 A fourth patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy on the basis of clinical and CT scan findings that could have been circumvented with preoperative ERP.
 ERP in selected patients allows nonoperative treatment in the absence of ductal injury or earlier operative treatment of ductal injury.
 It also aids the treatment of late complications by delineating ductal anatomy.
