Inhibitors of hepatic DNA synthesis in fulminant hepatic failure.
 In certain etiological groups of patients with fulminant hepatic failure, poor survival may be due to lack of liver regeneration.
 In vitro experiments have shown that fulminant hepatic failure serum is cytotoxic to rabbit hepatocytes and inhibits DNA synthesis on short-term incubation with isolated regenerating rat hepatocytes.
 When fulminant hepatic failure serum is injected into partially hepatectomized rats at the time of maximal DNA synthesis, [3H]thymidine incorporation into hepatic DNA is reduced significantly.
 The effect is greater with sera obtained from patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to non-A, non-B hepatitis or an adverse drug reaction and is associated with a less than 10,000-dalton fraction.
 No stimulation of DNA synthesis is observed with injection of the greater than 10,000-dalton serum fraction into normal rats.
 In preliminary experiments, no increase in epidermal growth factor production has been found in liver failure.
 Overall, the substances present in fulminant hepatic failure serum appear to be inhibitory rather than stimulatory for liver cell regeneration.
