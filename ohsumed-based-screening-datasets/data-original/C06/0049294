Effect of a bulk-forming cathartic on diarrhea in tube-fed patients.
 Diarrhea is a significant complication for the patient being tube-fed.
 The purpose of this study was to observe whether giving a bulk-forming cathartic to patients receiving enteral nutrition via nasogastric or nasoduodenal tube would result in firmer stools for these patients.
 Forty-nine patients in a large medical center were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group.
 During the 6-day study period 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of psyllium preparation was administered through the feeding tube three times a day.
 Data were analyzed by using the Mann-Whitney U test for nonparametric data.
 The hypothesis that giving a bulk-forming cathartic would lead to firmer stools was supported at an alpha level of less than 0.01.
 The results of this study suggest that use of a bulk-forming cathartic in tube-fed patients will significantly reduce the diarrhea associated with this type of feeding.
