Does metoclopramide reduce the length of ileus after colorectal surgery? A prospective randomized trial.
 Between August 1988 and September 1989, 100 consecutive patients who underwent elective abdominal colorectal surgical procedures were prospectively randomized to receive or not to receive metoclopramide.
 Metoclopramide was intravenously administered every 8 hours from the completion of surgery until a solid food diet was able to be tolerated.
 Seven patients were not included in the final tabulations because of one death, one small bowel obstruction requiring laparotomy, one anastomotic leak requiring laparotomy, and four protocol violations.
 Ninety-three patients, 37 men and 56 women (mean age, 59.5; range, 14-89 years) underwent 40 segmental colectomies, 13 total abdominal colectomies, 8 abdominoperineal resections, 8 ileoanal pouch procedures, 7 small bowel resections, and 17 other colorectal procedures.
 The 40 patients who received postoperative metoclopramide were in Group 1, and the 53 who did not were in Group 2.
 The mean length of time between laparotomy and commencement of oral fluid and oral solid intake in Groups 1 and 2 were 3.5 and 4.8 days, and 3.5 and 5.0 days, respectively.
 These differences were not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05).
 Prolonged ileus was seen in seven patients in Group 1 and in eight patients in Group 2.
 These differences were also not statistically significant (P greater than 0.05).
 Prolonged ileus was defined as the need for nasogastric tube reinsertion or discontinuation of oral intake.
 We conclude that metoclopramide does not significantly alter the course of postoperative ileus.
