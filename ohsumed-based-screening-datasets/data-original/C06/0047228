Effect of sinorphan, an enkephalinase inhibitor, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor and sodium urinary excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
 We examined the acute effects of sinorphan, an inhibitor of enkephalinase, on plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and urinary sodium excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites.
 A single oral dose of sinorphan (100 or 30 mg in 11 and 5 patients, respectively) was administered against placebo according to a double blind cross-over protocol.
 Basal plasma ANF levels varied over a large range between 2.6-79 pmol/L.
 Sinorphan, at a dose of 100 mg, inhibited 70% of plasma enkephalinase activity 60 min after ingestion and elicited simultaneously an increase in plasma ANF and cGMP levels 1.8 and 1.5 times basal values, respectively.
 There was a transient increase in sodium urinary output without a change in creatinine clearance over the initial 2-h period following drug administration.
 An increase in urinary cGMP was also observed on a longer period of 6 h.
 Plasma aldosterone decreased significantly, but the lowest concentration was reached 1 h later than the peak of plasma ANF.
 Mean blood pressure and PRA were unmodified.
 The effects of 30 mg sinorphan on plasma ANF, cGMP, and aldosterone were also significant, but less marked than those of the higher dose.
 Therefore, enkephalinase inhibition transiently increases sodium urinary excretion in cirrhotic patients with ascites via a mechanism that is likely to imply reduction of ANF catabolism.
 These results suggest that ANF could play a role in the control of sodium homeostasis in liver cirrhosis with ascites.
