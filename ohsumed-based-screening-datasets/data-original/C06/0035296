Echo Doppler duplex scanner and color in the study of portal hypertension.
 In the present state of the art, the Doppler duplex scanner provides much information about portal hypertension and its associated pathology, liver cirrhosis, hepatic malformations, vascular or avascular structures, hepatic transplants, and ascites.
 Its usefulness for experimental studies, providing new insight into the pathophysiology of this disease, has been proven.
 It is limited by the subjectivity of the conclusions, and by its poor feasibility in fat patients and those with excessive abdominal gas.
 However, the noninvasive nature of Doppler and its relative low cost make it a useful first step in the evaluation of portal hypertension.
