Persistence of hepatitis B viral DNA after serological recovery from hepatitis B virus infection.
 Chronic hepatitis B virus infection is a major medical problem worldwide.
 Apart from HBsAg carriers, hepatitis B virus has also been identified in some HBsAg-individuals with or without antibodies to viral antigens.
 The molecular mechanisms underlying hepatitis B virus persistence in HBsAg-individuals are unresolved, however.
 To identify a possible genetic basis for viral persistence, we cloned the viral genome from the liver of a patient serologically immune to hepatitis B virus infection.
 DNA sequence analysis of the complete viral genome identified numerous mutations in all viral genes.
 Analysis of the biological effects of these mutations revealed three major findings: a low level of HBsAg synthesis, absence of HBeAg production and a defect terminating viral replication.
 These data suggest that mutations accumulating during the natural course of hepatitis B virus infection may be a mechanism underlying viral persistence in HBsAg-individuals, presumably through escape from immune surveillance.
