Penetration of the pericardium by a gastric ulcer--survival after pericardiocentesis.
 Elderly patients often have unusual manifestations of common illnesses.
 We describe a geriatric patient having a pneumopericardium from pericardial penetration by a gastric ulcer.
 Benign gastric ulceration causing perforation of the pericardium or other cardiac structures was recognized as early as 1854; however, until 1964, the condition was invariably fatal.
 Our patient survived the episode after early pericardiocentesis and medical treatment.
 Aspects of this uncommon clinical entity and a brief review of the literature are described.
