Irreducible inguinal hernia in children below two years of age 
 Eighty-five cases of irreducible inguinal hernia in children below 2 years of age were reviewed.
 Non-operative treatment was successful in 71 (84 per cent); 14 children required emergency surgery.
 The younger the child and the longer the duration of symptoms at presentation, the worse was the outcome of non-operative treatment.
 In 35 (41 per cent) children the diagnosis of inguinal hernia had been made before irreducibility.
 There is an increased incidence of postoperative complication associated with irreducibility, especially in preterm infants.
 Early diagnosis of inguinal hernia in young children and prompt referral for surgery is recommended.
