External annular prosthesis in repair of biliary tract stricture.
 A surgical technique for treatment of benign intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary stenosis is described.
 It is based on the use of annular prostheses of Teflon placed around the outside of the anastomotic line using appropriate surgical instruments.
 This procedure leaves the blood supply to the bile duct intact, achieves hermetic apposition of epithelia, and prevents leakage of bile.
 It eliminates the use of intraductal splints, avoids retraction of scar tissue around the anastomotic zone, and increases or maintains the internal diameter of the biliary duct on the anastomotic line.
 The technique has been used in 33 patients with follow-up from 1 to 10 years.
 Excellent results were achieved in 32 patients, with 1 patient having a poor result.
 The average postoperative hospital stay was only 6 days.
