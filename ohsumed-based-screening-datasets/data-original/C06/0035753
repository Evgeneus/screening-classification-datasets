Outpatient liver biopsy: one man's experience.
 As an academically based gastroenterologist, I performed 94 outpatient liver biopsies over a 42-month period, using the standard suction technique.
 Differential blood count and vital signs were monitored, with no statistically significant postbiopsy changes noted in the group at large.
 One patient required admission to the hospital for bleeding, and six patients required intramuscular analgesics for pain at the biopsy site.
 Four patients had bradycardia, and one of them required atropine for bradycardia and hypotension.
 Outpatient liver biopsy is a safe procedure with low morbidity and complication rate.
 It would appear that prolonged monitoring is not necessary.
