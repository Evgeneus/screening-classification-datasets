A controlled trial of beclomethasone versus betamethasone enemas in distal ulcerative colitis.
 Steroid enemas are widely used in distal inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
 They are partly absorbed and suppress adrenocortical function.
 Beclomethasone dipropionate (BD) is a topically active steroid that undergoes rapid first-pass inactivation in the liver and is practically devoid of systemic side effects.
 We treated 32 consecutive patients with active distal ulcerative colitis (40 attacks) with 0.5 mg BD and/or 5 mg betamethasone phosphate (BP) enemas for 28 days.
 Clinical, laboratory, sigmoidoscopic, and histologic data were recorded before, during, and after the trial.
 The clinical efficacy of both treatments was similar.
 Betamethasone was slightly more effective in relation to the histologic improvement and disappearance of blood from the stools.
 Clinical signs of steroid overdosage were noted in patients on BP but not in patients on BD.
 Mean fasting plasma cortisol at the end of the trial was 2.9 micrograms/dl in the BP group and 15.3 micrograms/dl in the BD group.
 The adrenocorticotropin test was markedly suppressed in the BP group but not in the BD group.
 The absence of systemic steroid side effects makes BD enemas a useful addition in the therapy of IBD.
 Its oral administration should also be considered.
