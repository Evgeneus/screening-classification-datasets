Bacteriologic findings with ectopic pregnancy.
 The fallopian tubes and peritoneum of 27 patients were cultured at the time of salpingotomy/salpingectomy to determine if active tubal infection was the cause of post-operative temperature elevations.
 Infection was documented in six patients (22%).
 Previous exposure to Chlamydia trachomatis was documented with 2 endocervical cultures and 17 serum specimens positive for IgG antibody.
 The culture results, however, did not correlate with the postoperative febrile morbidity.
