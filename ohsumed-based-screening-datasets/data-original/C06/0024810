Cytokine biology. Implications for transfusion medicine.
 The development and widespread availability of recombinant products will effect blood centers through reduced product use, replacement of current products, and novel applications of new products.
 The greatest amount of clinical experience to date has dealt with the use of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) in the treatment of anemia in end-stage renal failure.
 Data also support its use in anemia associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), cancer, and chronic inflammatory diseases.
 This article will focus on the effect of erythropoietin on the demand for erythrocyte use.
