Use of the ultrathin choledochoscope in cholecystectomy.
 Use of the ultrathin choledochoscope (2mm) was evaluated in 80 patients undergoing routine cholecystectomy.
 It was used successfully in 67 (84 per cent) patients.
 There were eight (12 per cent) explorations of the common bile duct and no negative explorations.
 The instrument was helpful in determining the nature of an equivocal on-table cholangiogram.
 The ultrathin choledochoscope may be useful in reducing the rate of negative common bile duct exploration.
