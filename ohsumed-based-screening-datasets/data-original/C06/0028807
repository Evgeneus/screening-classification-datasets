Adrenaline injection for endoscopic haemostasis in non-variceal upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage.
 Over a 30-month period, 53 patients with actively bleeding non-variceal lesions of the oesophagus, stomach or duodenum were treated by endoscopic injection of 1/10,000 adrenaline.
 Initial haemostasis was obtained in 50 cases, and permanent haemostasis in 44.
 Emergency surgery for bleeding was required in nine patients overall, and there were four deaths.
 All lesions requiring surgery were located on the posterior wall of the duodenum or the lesser curve of the stomach, and all but one had evidence of an exposed arterial vessel.
 Adrenaline injection is an effective, safe and simple method of endoscopic haemostasis.
