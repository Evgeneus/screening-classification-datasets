Persistent bile leak after liver transplantation: biloma drainage and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographic sphincterotomy.
 Persistent bile leaks after liver transplantation were successfully treated in three patients with percutaneous or surgical drainage of bilomas and endoscopic retrograde ampullary sphincterotomy.
 In all three patients, biliary anastomoses were achieved by means of choledochocholedochostomies, with a T-tube stent in the anastomosis.
 The bile leaks led to subhepatic bilomas that had persistently high catheter outputs (greater than 200 mL per 24 hours) for longer than 1 month.
 Biloma drainage decreased shortly after sphincterotomy.
