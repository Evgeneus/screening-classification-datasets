Population-based study of surgery in juvenile onset Crohn's disease.
 A geographically based cohort of 68 children with Crohn's disease was derived by sampling from Scottish Hospital In-patient Statistics.
 Surgical histories were examined and analysed by actuarial methods, and the nature of major operations performed was compared with operations for Crohn's disease in the Lothians' Surgical Audit.
 Fifty-four of the 68 patients were treated surgically, with a total of 135 operations (71 major, 64 minor).
 Fifty per cent of the cohort had a major operation within 5 years of onset of symptoms; median time to a second operation was 4 years.
 The types of major operation performed in juvenile onset patients differed significantly from those recorded in the Lothians' audit, with a high rate of exploratory laparotomy in younger patients (12 cases).
 With a mean follow-up of 7 years, 12 patients (18 per cent) have a permanent stoma.
 There were five deaths, three postoperative.
 This study highlights the frequency of surgical intervention in young people with Crohn's disease.
