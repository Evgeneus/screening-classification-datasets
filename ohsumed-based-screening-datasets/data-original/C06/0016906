Sexual behavior before AIDS: the hepatitis B studies of homosexual and bisexual men.
 Data on sexual practices, collected during studies of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in 1978 and 1979, were analyzed for 4910 homosexual and bisexual men from Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and St Louis.
 Data on sexual practices in 1978 showed that white participants had larger numbers of non-steady male sexual partners and engaged in oral-genital activities more frequently but were equally likely to engage in anal intercourse as black and Hispanic participants.
 San Francisco participants had more non-steady sex partners and were more likely to engage in receptive anal intercourse with non-steady partners than participants from all other sites.
 Analysis of data on 606 HBV-antibody-negative men interviewed on three occasions in 1978 and 1979 showed no changes in risk indices for insertive and receptive anal intercourse between these years, except in San Francisco where significant declines occurred in insertive anal intercourse and receptive anal intercourse without ejacultion in a small, highly select group of participants.
