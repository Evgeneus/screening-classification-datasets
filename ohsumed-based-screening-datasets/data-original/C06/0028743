No effect of zidovudine on hepatitis B virus replication in homosexual men with symptomatic HIV-1 infection.
 Zidovudine triphosphate inhibits the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA polymerase (DNAp) in vitro.
 Serial measurements of serum HBV DNAp activity and HBV DNA were made in 14 consecutive male homosexual patients starting zidovudine for symptomatic HIV-1 infection.
 Median duration of treatment was 15 weeks (range 2-72).
 In the 13 patients with detectable DNAp/DNA pre-treatment, no significant change in either measure of viral replication was observed during the first 16 weeks of treatment compared with the 13 weeks prior to treatment.
 The lack of response may be due to the opposing effect of immunosuppression, or to a failure of in vivo activity.
