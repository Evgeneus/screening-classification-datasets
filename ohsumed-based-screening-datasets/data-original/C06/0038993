A time-dependent study of passive esophageal wall properties and collagen content in rabbits with esophageal varices.
 The passive biomechanical wall properties of the esophagus were studied in rabbits with esophageal varices and controls using a four-electrode impedance technique.
 Stepwise pressure inflation and deflation was done for analysis of esophageal cross-sectional area, compliance, and hysteresis monthly during six months.
 At sacrifice, the esophageal collagen content was determined.
 A small but statistically insignificant increase in compliance was observed during the six-month observation period in both groups.
 No differences were observed between the groups (P greater than 0.3).
 No change in hysteresis was observed in either group.
 The group with esophageal varices had significantly higher collagen content in the distal esophagus when compared to controls (P less than 0.05).
 No difference was demonstrated in the proximal part.
 No correlation was demonstrated between the collagen content and esophageal compliance.
 The study demonstrated that the method allows measurement of luminal cross-sectional area and tissue elasticity.
 No relationship was found, however, between the collagen content and compliance of the rabbit esophagus.
