A preliminary report of ticarcillin and clavulanate versus triple antibiotic therapy in children with ruptured appendicitis.
 Standard therapy for childhood ruptured appendicitis includes combination antibiotic therapy with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin.
 Complicated dosing schedules and the possibility of aminoglycoside toxicity make alternatives desirable.
 One such alternative is Timentin (a combination agent of ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium).
 This agent has a more convenient dose schedule than standard therapy and eliminates the possibility of aminoglycoside ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity.
 It is active in vitro against most pathogens associated with ruptured appendicitis in children.
 The preliminary results of an ongoing prospective, open label, randomized trial comparing ticarcillin and clavulanate with ampicillin, gentamicin and clindamycin in childhood ruptured appendicitis are reported herein.
 While further evaluation is necessary, we have found single agent therapy with ticarcillin and clavulanate to be equivalent in safety and efficacy to standard combination therapy.
 Also discussed are the relative merits of immediate versus delayed primary closure of the abdominal wound after appendectomy.
