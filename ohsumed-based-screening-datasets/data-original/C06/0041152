Reductions in cirrhosis deaths in the United States: associations with per capita consumption and AA membership.
 Cirrhosis mortality and morbidity rates have declined in many jurisdictions, including the U.S., in recent years.
 Previous research in Canada and Europe suggests that these declines are linked to changes in per capita consumption of alcohol and changes in the availability and/or utilization of services to reduce abusive drinking (e.g., treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous).
 In this study, changes in cirrhosis death rates in the 50 U.S.
 states and the District of Columbia between 1974 and 1983 were regressed onto changes in per capita consumption (1974-83).
 AA membership (1974-83) and alcoholism treatment (1979-82).
 No significant relationship between treatment and cirrhosis changes was observed; however, the measure of change in treatment may not reflect the full extent of changes that occurred in the 1974-83 period.
 As predicted, decreases in per capita consumption and increases in AA membership were significantly associated with decreases in cirrhosis rates.
