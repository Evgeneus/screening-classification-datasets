Reoperation for recurrent peptic ulcer disease.
 The patient with recurrent peptic ulcer evidences failure of an initial operation to control the ulcer diathesis.
 A trial of aggressive medical therapy is warranted in elective presentations and has a moderate chance of success.
 Failing this, we believe that reoperation should be tailored to the patient's physiologic status and previous operation (Table 5).
 Nevertheless, in most cases, we believe that the second operation should be the final operation and should consist of the procedure with the lowest recurrence rates.
 Therefore, we believe that the assurance of an adequate antrectomy and complete vagal section is the preferred procedure for most patients with recurrent peptic ulcer.
