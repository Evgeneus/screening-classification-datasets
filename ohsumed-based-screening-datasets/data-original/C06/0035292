Crohn's disease associated with autoimmune neutropenia.
 We report a 29-year-old woman with a 20-year history of Crohn's disease and neutropenia.
 Because of repeated complications of Crohn's disease, she has undergone three intestinal resections and also has had recurrent skin abscesses, sinusitis, and pneumonia.
 Persistent neutropenia has been noted throughout the course of her disease, and antineutrophil antibodies have been detected in her serum and that of her younger brother, who also has Crohn's disease and neutropenia.
 We discuss autoimmune neutropenia in the context of other autoimmune manifestations of Crohn's disease and speculate as to its possible contributory role in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease.
