Prospective study of early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with cirrhosis.
 We prospectively monitored 140 cirrhotic patients for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma for 6 yr, using periodical screening by high-resolution convex-array ultrasonography and alpha-fetoprotein.
 Twenty-eight patients were positive for HBs antigen, 26 patients had received blood transfusions and were negative for HBs antigen and 26 patients had a history of heavy drinking.
 We detected hepatocellular carcinoma in 40 patients during this period.
 The overall cumulative incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in the 6 yr was 39%; the cumulative incidence was 59% in patients with HBsAg, 53% in patients who had had blood transfusions and were negative for HBsAg and 22% in patients who had a history of heavy drinking and who were without HBsAg.
 Detection of the carcinoma in 85% of these 40 patients was based on results of ultrasonography.
 Twenty-six of the patients (65%) had a small hepatocellular carcinoma of 2 cm or less.
 alpha-Fetoprotein levels were lower than 100 ng/ml in 56% of these 40 patients.
 Patients with cirrhosis are at high risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, especially patients with HBsAg or with a history of blood transfusion who are negative for HBsAg.
 Periodic monitoring by use of ultrasonography in particular is recommended for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma.
