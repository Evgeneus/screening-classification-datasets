Validation of in vivo receptor measurements via in vitro radioassay: technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin as prototype model 
 Hepatic binding protein (HBP) is a hepatocyte-specific receptor for serum asialoglycoproteins.
 The receptor also recognizes a synthetic glycoprotein that has been developed as a radiopharmaceutical, technetium-99m-galactosyl-neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA).
 This report describes the correlation between receptor parameters measured in vivo via kinetic modeling of 99mTc-NGA and those measured by in vitro radioassay of biopsied liver tissue.
 Eleven patients with diffuse hepatic disease underwent percutaneous liver biopsy followed by a 99mTc-NGA functional imaging study.
 In vivo measurements of HBP quantity Ro and forward binding rate constant kb obtained from the kinetic analysis of 99mTc-NGA liver and blood time-activity data were compared to total receptor quantity and the HBP-99mTc-NGA association constant KA as measured by Scatchard binding assay of the biopsied tissue.
 The correlation coefficients between in vivo and in vitro measurements were 0.73 (df = 8, p = 0.015) and 0.98 (df = 8, p less than 0.01) for Ro and kb, respectively.
 The in vivo measurements of HBP biochemistry via kinetic analysis of the radiopharmaceutical time-activity data reflect the average concentration and affinity of the receptor.
 This study further substantiates the validity of 99mTc-NGA as a quantitative probe for the HBP receptor.
