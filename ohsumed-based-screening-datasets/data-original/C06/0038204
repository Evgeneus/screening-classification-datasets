Minor contribution of hepatocytes to collagen production in normal and early fibrotic rat livers.
 Hepatocyte contribution to hepatic collagen production in vivo was estimated in rats, based on the fact that ornithine is used for protein synthesis in the liver as arginine after conversion by way of the urea cycle only by hepatocytes.
 From rats given a mixture of [14C] ornithine and [3H]arginine, hepatic collagen and serum albumin were obtained.
 The hepatocyte contribution was calculated from the 14C and 3H in arginine purified from collagen and albumin by high performance liquid chromatography.
 The contribution was less than 10% of total collagen production in normal and early fibrotic livers induced by a single dose of carbon tetrachloride or dimethylnitrosamine.
 We conclude that hepatocytes may play a minor role in collagen production in normal and early fibrotic rat livers.
