Comparative efficacy of cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine, and mylanta in postoperative stress ulcers. Gastric pH control and ulcer prevention in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
 To determine the comparative efficacy of several histamine (H2)-receptor antagonists (cimetidine, famotidine, and ranitidine) and the antacid Mylanta-II (Stuart Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE) in gastric pH control and the prevention of postoperative stress ulceration, a prospective, randomized study was performed in a homogeneous population of patients with elective coronary artery bypass.
 None of the 57 patients in the study population had a documented history of ulcer disease.
 There were four treatment groups, each with similar demographics (age and sex).
 Cimetidine-treated group consisted of 15, famotidine-treated group of 18, ranitidine-treated group of 19, and antacid-treated group of 5 patients.
 There was no hemodynamically significant postoperative gastrointestinal bleeding in any of the patients.
 When the agents were compared for efficacy of gastric pH control, statistically better pH control was found in the famotidine- and ranitidine-treated groups (P less than 0.003) than in the cimetidine-treated group (pH less than or equal to 4.0) during the 20-hour observation period.
 Side effects (hematologic and neurological) were noted only in the cimetidine-treated group.
 The results of this study indicate that in patients in postoperative intensive care, better gastric pH control, and thus prevention of gastric stress ulcers, is achieved with either famotidine or ranitidine rather than cimetidine or antacid.
