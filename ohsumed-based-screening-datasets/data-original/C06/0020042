Cross-national changes in the effects of peptic ulcer disease.
 OBJECTIVE: To describe and to analyze the changing effects of peptic ulcer disease over time.
 DESIGN: Variables relating to peptic ulcer disease from 1970-1986 were compared.
 The variables included rates of mortality, hospitalizations, operations, physician visits, and endoscopies, and the amount of disability-related loss of work and early retirement in six countries (Belgium, England and Wales, the Federal Republic of Germany, The Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States).
 MEASUREMENTS: Nonparametric epidemiologic time-trend analysis.
 MAIN RESULTS: The historic, slow, declining trend in mortality and hospitalization rates continued.
 The rate of operations for peptic ulcer disease exhibited a large, one-time reduction, then returned to a parallel declining trend, but at a lower level.
 The rate of physician visits declined by 50%.
 The greatest changes were found in the rate of endoscopy use and in disability-related loss of work and early retirement, where increasing trends were quickly followed by decreasing trends.
 The elderly, especially women, generally did not share many of these benefits.
 CONCLUSIONS: The effects of new interventions can be understood more fully by examining several variables in many countries over a long time.
 Contrary to expectations, the effects of the widespread use of histamine H2 antagonists have been more indirect (affecting work loss and disability retirement more) than direct (affecting high-cost medical service use and mortality less).
