Roles of deoxycholate and arachidonate in pathogenesis of cholesterol gallstones in obese patients during rapid loss of weight.
 Our aim was to examine the relationship between biliary deoxycholate and arachidonate in obese patients and the relationship of deoxycholate and arachidonate to the stimulation of biliary mucous glycoprotein among obese patients predisposed to cholesterol gallstones.
 Thirty-four obese patients predisposed to cholesterol gallstones by a weight-reducing diet (520 kcal/day) received placebo, ursodiol (1200 mg/day), or aspirin (1300 mg/day).
 Duodenal bile was collected prior to beginning the diet and at four weeks.
 There was no correlation between deoxycholate and arachidonate among the 34 patients before beginning the diet.
 With placebo, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate and glycoprotein increased.
 With ursodiol, deoxycholate decreased while arachidonate decreased and glycoprotein did not change.
 With aspirin, there was no change in deoxycholate but a decrease in arachidonate and no change in glycoprotein.
 Our data do not support a role for biliary deoxycholate in the regulation of biliary arachidonate.
 Our data do support a role for arachidonate, but not deoxycholate, in the regulation of biliary glycoprotein during the formation of cholesterol gallstones.
