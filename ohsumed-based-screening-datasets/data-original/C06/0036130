Double-blind randomized multicenter study comparing Maalox TC tablets and ranitidine in healing of duodenal ulcers.
 The efficacy of ranitidine 150 mg twice daily and Maalox TC three tablets four times daily were compared in patients with endoscopically confirmed duodenal ulcer.
 Seventy-nine patients were randomly allocated to double-blind, double-dummy treatment, stratified for smokers.
 Endoscopy was repeated after four weeks.
 Those unhealed continued treatment for a further two weeks before final endoscopy.
 Per protocol analysis in 53 patients showed ulcer healing rates at week 4 and at weeks 4 and 6 combined of 78 and 89% on Maalox TC, and of 81 and 91% on ranitidine, respectively.
 The same analysis gave overall healing rates of 81% in smokers and 100% in nonsmokers, irrespective of treatment.
 Both treatments provided early ulcer pain relief.
 Diarrhea was a commoner side effect in patients on Maalox TC.
 The study showed Maalox TC and ranitidine were equally effective in healing duodenal ulceration.
