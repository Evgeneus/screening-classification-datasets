Psychiatric disorders in patients with esophageal disease.
 Psychiatric disorders have potentially important roles in the manifestations of esophageal disease.
 A primary causative role for psychiatric factors in the common motility disorders associated with chest pain (esophageal spasm and the nonspecific motor disorders) remains unproven, but psychiatric disorders appear particularly prevalent in this group.
 In most other esophageal diseases, psychiatric factors interact through recognized psychophysiologic or behavioral mechanisms to affect the clinical presentation.
 Recognizing the possible levels of interaction has significant therapeutic implications.
