Secretory diarrhea following a dog bite.
 Overwhelming sepsis is rarely complicated by secretory diarrhea.
 We present a case of fulminant sepsis associated with dermatologic manifestations, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and a severe secretory diarrhea that has not previously been described.
 This followed a dog bite, and the patient was otherwise healthy.
 The combination of septic shock, skin lesions, and DIC occurring after a dog bite has been attributed to dysgonic fermentor 2 organisms, now called Capnocytophaga canimorsus, but none were cultured in this case (7).
 Dysgonic fermentor-2 may be a new cause of secretory diarrhea and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of overwhelming sepsis associated with diarrhea.
