Decrease in resting metabolic rate during abstinence from bulimic behavior.
 Among eight normal-weight bulimic women studied during 1 week of binge eating and vomiting and 7 weeks of abstinence without weight loss, resting metabolic rate and T3 and T4 levels fell significantly during abstinence.
 These data suggest that a physiological consequence of binge eating and vomiting is an increase in metabolic rate, in part due to increased thyroid hormone activity.
