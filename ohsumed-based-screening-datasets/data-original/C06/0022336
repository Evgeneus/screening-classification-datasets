Glucose polymers as an alternative to glucose in oral rehydration solutions.
 Several issues involving glucose-based oral rehydration therapy may limit its acceptability and sustained use.
 Our studies suggest that defined short-chain glucose polymers (2 to 9 glucose units) are hydrolyzed and absorbed faster than isocaloric solutions of D-glucose in the small intestine of the rat.
 Glucose polymers, primarily from rice-based solutions, have been shown to be as effective as glucose-based solutions.
 They offer additional advantages in reducing the amount and duration of diarrhea with lesser volumes of solution, thereby reducing the costs of treatment.
 Rice-based solutions provide high caloric density and increase the absorption of sodium without an osmotic overload.
 The result is increased net absorption of glucose, sodium, and water.
 Glucose polymers from rice or other starches in oral rehydration solutions may be effective, inexpensive, easily used, and safe treatments for acute diarrhea.
