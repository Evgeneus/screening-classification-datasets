Effects of aging on the swallowing mechanism.
 Normal swallow involves a number of closely coordinated neuromuscular events.
 Investigators have identified some small temporal changes in the swallow of older adults as compared with young adults.
 Further research is needed to define completely the primary effects of aging on deglutition.
 Many medical conditions that commonly affect the elderly can cause dysphagia.
 These are discussed in terms of their effects on swallow physiology.
 Diagnosis and treatment of dysphagia in the elderly should be pursued as aggressively as in the younger adult.
