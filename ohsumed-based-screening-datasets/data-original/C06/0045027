Volunteer participation in feeding residents: training and supervision in a long-term care facility.
 The increasing number of residents in long-term care facilities who require full and partial assistance during meals has created a need for volunteer support to enhance the quality of life for residents.
 The correlation between dependence in eating and the existence of swallowing disorders and the risk of aspiration in persons with swallowing disorders suggests that training must be given to volunteers who feed residents.
 A formalized program for volunteer training and supervision was implemented at Coler Memorial Hospital, a long-term care facility.
 The program's development and benefits are outlined.
 Implementation of this program resulted in better training of volunteers, increased socialization, communication, and safety for patients during meals.
