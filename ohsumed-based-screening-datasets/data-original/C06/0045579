Recommendations for collection of laboratory specimens associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis.
 Recent discoveries have implicated a number of "new" (i.e., previously unrecognized) infectious agents as important causes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis.
 Unfortunately, the ability to detect these agents in an outbreak can be limited by two factors: 1) the lack of appropriate assays-many of which are still in developmental stages and are not readily available to clinical laboratories, and 2) inadequately or improperly collected specimens.
 At CDC, many newly developed assays are being used for research and for outbreak investigations.
 The information in this report is especially intended for public health agencies that collaborate with CDC in investigating outbreaks of gastroenteritis.
 The report provides an update on guidelines and recommendations for the proper collection of specimens to be sent to CDC, gives general background information concerning some recently discovered pathogens, lists some of the tests available at CDC, and provides a list of CDC contacts.
 The guidelines and the general information provided on causes of outbreaks of gastroenteritis can be also used by public health workers for investigations when specific testing is available and appropriate.
