Transduodenal sphincteroplasty with transampullary septectomy for stenosing papillitis.
 The papilla of Vater and its sphincter of Oddi, lying at the confluence of the bile and pancreatic ducts in man, have long been suspected as a source of upper abdominal pain.
 Enlarging the opening of the transpapillary segment of the bile and major pancreatic ducts by using a transduodenal sphincteroplasty with transampullary septectomy resulted in death in a patient with a peripapillary diverticulum and pancreas divisum.
 Eight-six patients followed for 1 to 10 years experienced a 75% success rate.
 Thirty-six patients had a marked stenosis of their duct of Wirsung, suggesting that their pain was primarily from the pancreas.
 The remainder had either a generalized narrowing (40 patients) or a normal (7 patients) papilla.
 Pain was not satisfactorily resolved in patients with an associated pancreas divisum, chronic pancreatitis, and recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis with alcoholism.
