Peritoneal adhesion formation after lysis: inhibition by polyethylene glycol 4000.
 Peritoneal adhesions cause much long-term postoperative morbidity.
 This study evaluates the efficacy of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 in reducing adhesion reformation after lysis.
 Adhesions were induced, by abrasion, in 111 Sprague-Dawley rats at a first laparotomy.
 At a second operation, 10 days later, these adhesions were graded and lysed, after which the animals received one of the following solutions intraperitoneally: 5 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 21), 25 per cent PEG 4000 (n = 23), 32 per cent dextran 70 (n = 22) or isotonic saline (n = 25), or were left as an untreated control group (n = 20).
 When the reformed adhesions were graded after a further 10 days 5 per cent PEG 4000 was found to be the only solution that inhibited adhesion reformation.
 The adhesions that reformed in the other four test groups were significantly worse than when they were first graded (P less than or equal to 0.033 for all groups).
 Therefore 5 per cent PEG 4000 may be useful in clinical practice for the reduction of adhesion formation after lysis.
