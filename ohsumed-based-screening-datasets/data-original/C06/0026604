Survival after resection of carcinoma of the splenic flexure.
 Nine hundred ten patients undergoing colectomy for colon cancer were studied retrospectively.
 Seventy-four cancers (8 percent) were located at the splenic flexure.
 The stage at presentation was no different between splenic flexure cancers and colon carcinomas at other sites.
 Although splenic flexure cancers had twice the incidence of obstruction as did other colon cancers and obstruction in the overall series adversely affected survival, there was no difference in survival between splenic flexure cancer patients and patients with other colon cancers.
