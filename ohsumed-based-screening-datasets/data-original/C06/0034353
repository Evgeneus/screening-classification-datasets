Azathioprine induced liver disease: nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver and perivenous fibrosis in a patient treated for multiple sclerosis.
 Azathioprine hepatotoxicity has been described mainly in renal transplant recipients.
 Most reported cases are related to lesions of the venous system of the liver: peliosis hepatis, veno-occlusive disease of the liver, perisinusoidal fibrosis, and nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver.
 The most common clinical manifestation of these hepatic vascular lesions is portal hypertension.
 We present a case of nodular regenerative hyperplasia and perivenous fibrosis in a patient receiving azathioprine for multiple sclerosis.
 Histological abnormalities were similar to those described in renal transplant patients, and azathioprine was the only potential hepatotoxic agent present.
