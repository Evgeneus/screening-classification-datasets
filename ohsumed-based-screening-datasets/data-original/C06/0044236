A quantitative approach to radiography of the lower limb. Principles and applications.
 A method is described which provides standardised reproducible radiographic images of the lower limb.
 Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs are digitised and processed by computer to provide graphic/numeric displays of angles and linear measurements, relating the centre points of the hip, knee, and ankle.
 Two cases illustrate how surgical planning is facilitated when standardised data are available.
 These data confirm the close relationship between postoperative limb alignment and positioning of prosthetic elements.
