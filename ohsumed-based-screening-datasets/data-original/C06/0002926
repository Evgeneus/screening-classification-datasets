The role of prostanoids in the production of acute acalculous cholecystitis by platelet-activating factor.
 Gallbladder tissue from patients with acute acalculous cholecystitis contains increased amounts of prostanoids when compared to normal gallbladder tissue.
 Platelet-activating factor (PAF) is a potent stimulus of eicosanoid formation.
 It has been implicated as a mediator of acute inflammatory processes and systemic responses to shock.
 In this study the role of PAF in acute acalculous cholecystitis was evaluated.
 Anesthetized cats underwent gallbladder perfusion with a physiologic buffer solution containing [14C]polyethylene glycol as a nonabsorbable tracer to quantitate mucosal water absorption.
 Platelet-activating factor was infused into the hepatic artery for 2 hours.
 Control experiments were performed when vehicle alone was infused.
 Experiments also were performed when indomethacin was administered intravenously and when indomethacin and PAF were administered.
 Gallbladder mucosal absorption/secretion and perfusate and tissue prostaglandin E (PGE) and 6 keto prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto PGF1 alpha) levels were evaluated.
 Gallbladder inflammation was evaluated by beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase tissue concentrations and by a histologic scoring system.
 Platelet-activating factor eliminated gallbladder absorption and produced net fluid secretion associated with dose-related increases in perfusate PGE concentrations and gallbladder tissue PGE and 6 keto PGF1 alpha levels when compared to control values.
 Platelet-activating factor produced significant inflammation in the gallbladder with increases in the histologic score of inflammation and tissue lysosomal enzyme activities.
 Indomethacin significantly decreased the fluid secretion, prostanoid levels, and inflammation produced by PAF.
 The results suggest that PAF may induce acute gallbladder inflammation associated with systemic stress through a prostanoid-mediated mechanism.
