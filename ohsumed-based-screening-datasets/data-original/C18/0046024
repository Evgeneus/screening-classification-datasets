Desmopressin and indomethacin therapy for nephrogenic diabetes insipidus in patients receiving lithium carbonate.
 Individuals receiving lithium carbonate commonly have nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.
 There is no effective and practical treatment for this condition.
 We have found that large doses of desmopressin (DDAVP) may provide effective therapy without adverse effects.
 A recent report showed that indomethacin improved nephrogenic diabetes insipidus that had persisted after the lithium therapy was discontinued.
 We have provided additional evidence that indomethacin may be effective, even when treatment with lithium is continued.
 We also have shown that indomethacin together with desmopressin can markedly decrease polyuria, though indomethacin must be used with care because it may impair renal function.
