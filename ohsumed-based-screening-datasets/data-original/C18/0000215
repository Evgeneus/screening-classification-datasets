Radiographic microcalcification and parenchymal patterns as indicators of histologic "high-risk" benign breast disease.
 Breast tissue from a forensic autopsy series of 486 women (15 to 98 years of age) was studied radiographically and by histologic sampling.
 Prevalence of Wolfe P2/Dy parenchymal patterns decreased with age.
 Radiographic nonvascular microcalcification and histologic presence of marked ductal epithelial hyperplasia and lobular microcalcification increased with age.
 Both of these histologic parameters of increased risk for breast cancer correlated with the presence of radiographic microcalcification and Wolfe P2/Dy parenchymal pattern.
 The predictive value of the radiographic parameters for presence of "high-risk" proliferative fibrocystic change increased with age.
