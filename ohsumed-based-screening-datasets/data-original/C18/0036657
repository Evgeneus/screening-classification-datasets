Prolonged QT interval and risk of sudden death in South-East Asian men.
 Sudden death in sleep occurs in substantial numbers among young men in South-East Asia.
 The frequencies of electrocardiographic abnormalities were measured in groups with varying risks of such sudden death.
 The mean heart-rate-corrected QT interval (QTc) was significantly (p less than 0.05) greater among 123 Laotian refugees in Thailand at high risk (405 [95% confidence interval 397-413] ms) than in 77 Laotian refugees in the United States at lower risk (364 [359-369] ms) and 199 non-Asian US residents at negligible risk (358 [354-362] ms).
 Among refugees in Thailand, prolonged QTc interval was associated with poor thiamine status and a history of seizure-like episodes in sleep.
 Thiamine deficiency may be a cause of prolonged QT interval and sudden death in this region.
