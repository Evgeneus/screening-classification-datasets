Neuropathology of bovine beta-mannosidosis.
 beta-Mannosidosis, an inherited defect of glycoprotein catabolism previously identified in goats and humans, has been recently diagnosed in Salers cattle.
 This disorder is associated with deficiency of lysosomal beta-mannosidase and accumulation of oligosaccharides.
 Analysis of bovine beta-mannosidosis neuropathology was initiated to determine whether independently arising gene defects in cattle and goats result in expression of similar lesions.
 Brain, spinal cord, and selected peripheral nerves from seven affected newborn Salers calves and three normal newborn calves were available for gross, light microscopic, and electron microscopic analysis.
 Gross examination revealed hydrocephalus of variable severity and myelin deficiency in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, and brainstem.
 Microscopic examination revealed cytoplasmic vacuolation, myelin deficiency, and axonal spheroids of similar type and distribution to that reported in affected goats.
 Cytoplasmic vacuolation resulting from lysosomal storage showed consistent variation among cell types.
 Myelin deficits were more severe in the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum than in the spinal cord.
 Axonal spheroids occurred in the cerebrum, brainstem, cerebellum, and trigeminal nerve endings.
 The presence of similar lesions in bovine and caprine beta-mannosidosis supports a direct relationship with the gene defect.
