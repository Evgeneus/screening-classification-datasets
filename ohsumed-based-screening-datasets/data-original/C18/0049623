Plasma concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide in fluid overload.
 To investigate the hypothesis that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), a potent vasodilator, is an important physiological defence against fluid overload, plasma CGRP concentrations were measured in various degrees of fluid overload in 26 haemodialysis patients, for whom diuresis, mediated by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), is not a possible defence mechanism.
 Plasma CGRP concentrations were positively correlated with the degree of fluid excess (r = 0.815, p = 0.0001) and were significantly higher in 5 patients with severe fluid overload than in those less severely affected (143 [SE 14] vs 52 [11] pmol/l; p less than 0.001).
 CGRP may be an effective defence against complications of fluid overload since it can increase capitance by vasodilatation.
