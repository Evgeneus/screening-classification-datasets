Metabolite and hormonal profiles in heat stroke patients at Mecca pilgrimage.
 Sera obtained during the Hajj seasons of 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1988 from 125 heat stroke patients were collected and subjected to chemical analysis which included determination of glucose, lactate, cholesterol, and triglycerides, as well as assay of T3, T4, TSH and cortisol.
 Hyperglycaemia and lactic acidaemia were found to be the most frequent metabolic abnormalities.
 The changes in cholesterol did not exhibit a specific pattern.
 Triglycerides were significantly elevated in only 6% of patients.
 Cortisol levels were very significantly elevated in precooled patients.
 Although the mean T3 levels remained within the normal range, the mean concentration on admission was significantly higher than the post-cooling mean.
 TSH and T4 levels did not show significant changes.
