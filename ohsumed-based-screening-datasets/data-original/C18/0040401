Water intoxication: a complication of pelvic US in a patient with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.
 A woman was first seen with water intoxication caused by the voluntary ingestion of water in an attempt to fill her bladder before undergoing pelvic ultrasound (US).
 As in two other reported cases, this woman was receiving medication that causes the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.
 A patient undergoing transabdominal pelvic US who is receiving these medications and whose bladder is not full should undergo examination by means of a transvaginal or endorectal route.
