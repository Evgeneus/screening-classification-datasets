Sexual dimorphism in insulin sensitivity in adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 Sex-related differences in insulin sensitivity were evaluated in male and female adolescents with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).
 They were matched for age, pubertal staging, body mass index, and glycohemoglobin levels.
 During a 1.7 mU/kg.min hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, the insulin-mediated glucose disposal rate was lower (26.9 +/- 2.1 vs.
 47.1 +/- 3.7 mumol/kg.min; P less than 0.001), and GH levels were higher (6.5 +/- 1.2 vs.
 2.9 +/- 0.8 micrograms/L; P = 0.03) in females than in males.
 Plasma glucagon, cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine levels during the clamp were similar in the two sexes, except for pancreatic polypeptide, which showed a tendency to be higher in females (19 +/- 4 vs.
 11 +/- 1 pmol/L; P = 0.07).
 During insulin-induced hypoglycemia, the rate of drop in plasma glucose was faster (0.16 +/- 0.01 vs.
 0.11 +/- 0.01 mmol/L.min; P = 0.001), and the rate of glucose recovery was slower in males than in females (0.04 +/- 0.01 vs.
 0.06 +/- 0.01 mmol/L.min; P = 0.05).
 Plasma glucose concentrations were lower in males than in females (glucose nadir, 2.3 +/- 0.2 vs.
 3.3 +/- 0.2 mmol/L; P = 0.002; glucose peak, 3.7 +/- 0.2 vs.
 5.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/L; P = 0.002), with similar plasma free insulin concentrations.
 Despite a greater degree of hypoglycemia, GH responses were lower in males than in females.
 The remaining counterregulatory hormone responses were similar in both sexes.
 We conclude that there is a distinct sexual dimorphism in insulin sensitivity in adolescents with IDDM.
 This is likely to be due to sex-related differences in GH levels.
 Furthermore, male patients with IDDM are apt to develop greater degrees of hypoglycemia accompanied by lower GH responses.
