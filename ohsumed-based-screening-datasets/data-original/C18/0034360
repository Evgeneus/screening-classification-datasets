Encapsulated hepatocytes for controlling hyperbilirubinemia in Gunn rats.
 Hepatocytes encapsulated in an alginate-polylysine-membrane were used to lower bilirubin levels in hyperbilirubinemia.
 The animal model was the Gunn rat.
 The microencapsulated hepatocytes were implanted intraperitoneally.
 15 x 16(6) microencapsulated hepatocytes from Wistar rats lowered the bilirubin from 14 mg/100 ml to 6 mg/100 ml after 20 days.
 15 x 10(6) microencapsulated hepatocytes from Sprague-Dawley rats lowered the bilirubin levels from 8 mg/100 ml to 5 mg/100 ml.
 They were as effective as free Sprague-Dawley hepatocytes.
 12 x 10(6) Guinea pig hepatocytes, whether encapsulated or free, lowered the bilirubin from 9.36 mg/100 ml to 4.37 mg/100 ml.
