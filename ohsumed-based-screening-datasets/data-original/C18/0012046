Cholesterol and lipid disturbances in renal disease: the natural history of uremic dyslipidemia and the impact of hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 Lipid abnormalities have been postulated to contribute to renal insufficiency by a mechanism that is analogous to atherogenesis.
 The majority of patients treated for chronic renal failure die of cardiovascular complications.
 Lipid abnormalities in this group are thought to contribute to this high mortality.
 Proving a causal association between dyslipidemia and accelerated atherosclerosis in the end-stage renal disease population has been confounded by the presence of other pro-atherogenic conditions in this population.
 The current study compiles the lipid data we have accumulated from our renal population for the years 1987 to 1989.
 The report is divided into three main parts: The first is a survey of lipid levels and atherogenicity indicators in groups with different types of renal disease or modalities of treatment.
 The second is a multivariate analysis of the relationship of clinical and biochemical variables (and their interactions) to the serum lipid and apolipoprotein levels and their ratios and their change over time in a large dialysis population.
 In the third study, we quantitate the peritoneal clearances of apolipoproteins A-I and B in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and assess the relationship of these clearances to serum lipid and lipoprotein levels and risk ratios.
