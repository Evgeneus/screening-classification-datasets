Hypersecretion of islet amyloid polypeptide from pancreatic islets of ventromedial hypothalamic-lesioned rats and obese Zucker rats.
 To investigate the possible role of islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) in the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus, we examined the IAPP content and secretion in pancreatic islets isolated from ventromedial hypothalamic (VMH)-lesioned rats and genetically obese Zucker rats, using a specific RIA for IAPP.
 Obesity and hyperinsulinemia were observed in rats 21 days after VMH lesioning.
 IAPP content was increased in the islets of VMH-lesioned rats compared with findings in the sham-operated controls (100.9 +/- 6.6 vs.
 72.8 +/- 3.85 fmol/islet; P less than 0.01).
 Isolated islets of VMH-lesioned rats secreted larger amounts of IAPP in the presence of 2.8 mM and 16.7 mM glucose (2.99 +/- 0.98 and 11.2 +/- 1.29 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1) than was noted in sham-operated rats (ND and 6.65 +/- 0.78 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1).
 In the obese Zucker rats, aged 14 weeks, IAPP concentrations in the islets were elevated compared with lean rats (133.3 +/- 10.6 vs.
 84.4 +/- 8.5 fmol/islet; P less than 0.01).
 The isolated islets secreted larger amounts of IAPP in response to 2.8 mM and 16.7 mM glucose (2.83 +/- 0.88 and 15.81 +/- 1.35 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1) than did those from lean control rats (0.36 +/- 0.19 and 12.49 +/- 1.20 fmol.islet(-1).3 h-1).
 These results strongly suggest that overproduction and hypersecretion of IAPP occur in animals with obesity and hyperinsulinemia.
