Impact of dietary fatty acid supplementation on renal injury in obese Zucker rats.
 We previously reported that renal injury in hyperlipidemic, obese Zucker rats was associated with a relative deficiency of tissue polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA).
 In the present study 10-week-old obese Zucker rats were pair fed regular chow or chow containing either 20% sunflower oil rich in n-6 PUFA, fish oil rich in n-3 PUFA, coconut oil medium-chain saturated fatty acid, or beef tallow long-chain saturated fatty acid.
 At 34 weeks of age there were comparable reductions in albuminuria, mesangial matrix expansion, and glomerulosclerosis in the fish oil and sunflower oil groups.
 While both fish oil and sunflower oil reduced serum triglycerides, and improved the composition of triglyceride-enriched lipoproteins, only fish oil decreased serum cholesterol.
 The effect of the dietary fatty acid supplementation on fatty acid profiles were similar in isolated glomeruli and cortical tissue.
 In general, the amelioration in injury in the fish oil and sunflower oil fed rats was most closely linked to glomerular levels of PUFA, either n-6 or n-3.
 These data suggest that hyperlipidemia and abnormalities in tissue FA are closely linked, and that dietary supplementation with PUFA may ameliorate chronic, progressive renal injury.
