Vitamin B-6 requirements of elderly men and women.
 The vitamin B-6 requirements of 12 men and women over 60 y old were studied.
 The protocol consisted of a 5-d baseline period and four experimental periods during which the subjects successively received 0.003, 0.015, 0.0225 and 0.03375 mg of vitamin B-6/(kg body wt.d).
 Dietary protein was 1.2 or 0.8 g/(kg body wt.d).
 At 5- or 6-d intervals, xanthurenic acid (XA) after a 5-g L-tryptophan load and 4-pyridoxic acid (4-PA) in 24-h urine, erythrocyte aspartate aminotransferase activity coefficient (EAST-AC) and plasma pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) were measured.
 These measurements were abnormal during vitamin B-6 depletion but returned to normal during repletion.
 Men who ingested approximately 120 g protein/d required 1.96 +/- 0.11 mg of vitamin B-6 to normalize XA; women who ingested 78 g protein/d required 1.90 +/- 0.18 mg of vitamin B-6 to normalize XA.
 To attain normal levels of EAST-AC and 4-PA in men, 2.88 +/- 0.17 mg of vitamin B-6 were needed; to normalize PLP, 1.96 +/- 0.11 mg of vitamin B-6 were required.
 Women required 1.90 +/- 0.18 mg or more of vitamin B-6 to normalize these measurements.
 Vitamin B-6 requirements were not decreased in two of three subjects who ingested 54 g of protein daily.
 Thus, vitamin B-6 requirements of elderly men and women are about 1.96 and 1.90 mg/d, respectively.
