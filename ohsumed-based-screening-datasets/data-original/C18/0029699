Monitoring of irrigating fluid absorption during transurethral prostatectomy. A study in anaesthetised patients using a 1% ethanol tag solution.
 A simple, reliable method to detect absorption of irrigating fluid during transurethral prostatectomy is to tag irrigating fluids with 1% ethanol and monitor expired breath ethanol concentrations.
 This method correlated well (n = 0.79) with other existing methods of absorption monitoring in 20 anaesthetised patients.
 Ethanol (1%) tagging does not alter the optical quality of the irrigating fluid and is harmless to the patient.
 The technique is non-invasive, repeatable, cheap and gives instant results.
 It can be used in anaesthetised or awake patients and can detect absorption of as little as 100-150 ml in any 10-minute period.
