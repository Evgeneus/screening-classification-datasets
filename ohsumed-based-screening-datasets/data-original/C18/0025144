Treatment for obesity: a nutrient balance/nutrient partition approach.
 This paper examines the treatment of obesity, using a feedback model of nutrient regulation.
 A feedback model contains afferent signals and a central controller that transduces afferent information into efferent signals that modulate the controlled system.
 Using this model and the receptor hypothesis for drug action, a variety of current and potential therapeutic approaches are discussed.
 Among the more promising approaches would be cholecystokinin agonists, small molecules that mimic ketoacids, agonists to corticotropin-releasing hormone, beta-3 agonists, antagonists to opioid peptides, antagonists to neuropeptide Y, glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, and growth hormone agonists.
 Since a number of mechanisms can influence body fat and nutrient partitioning, it is likely that optimal therapy will involve use of more than one pharmacologic agent.
