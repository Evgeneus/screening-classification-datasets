Community-based exercise and weight control: diabetes risk reduction and glycemic control in Zuni Indians.
 Cardiovascular disease is a significant health problem for the Zuni Indians of southwest New Mexico, in part because of high rates of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
 The Zuni Diabetes Project was initiated in July 1983 to reduce rates of obesity and provide primary and secondary prevention of NIDDM.
 Two studies of the project's activities have been carried out to date.
 After 2 y of follow-up, diabetic participants in an exercise program compared with diabetic nonparticipants experienced weight loss, a drop in fasting blood glucose values, and reductions in the use of hypoglycemic medications.
 In a weight-loss competition, 45% (122/271) of the enrollees finished and lost greater than or equal to 2.3 kg.
 The results of these two studies demonstrate that 1) participation in a community-based exercise program can produce significant weight loss and improvement in glycemic control in Zuni Indians with NIDDM and 2) weight-loss competitions appear to be an important public health model for health-behavior change in communities similar to that of Zuni, NM.
