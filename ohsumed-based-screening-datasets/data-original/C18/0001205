HMPAO-SPECT imaging resembling Alzheimer-type dementia in mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).
 Single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) of the brain using hexamethyl propylene amine oxime (HMPAO) was performed in a 37-year-old patient suffering from mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS).
 Reduced blood flow was observed bilaterally in the parieto-occipital regions (resembling Alzheimer type dementia) and in the right parietal lobe.
