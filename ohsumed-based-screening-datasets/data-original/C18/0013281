Use of aminohydroxypropylidene bisphosphonate (AHPrBP, "APD") for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with renal impairment.
 Aminohydroxypropylidene bisphosphonate (AHPrBP, "APD") is a relatively new bisphosphonate which has been shown to be effective for control of hypercalcemia due to a variety of causes.
 Renal impairment has been reported following the use of other bisphosphonates and pre-existing renal impairment has been regarded as a contraindication to the use of AHPrBP.
 We report the successful use of intravenous AHPrBP to control hypercalcemia in three patients with renal impairment, one of whom was dialysis-dependent.
 No significant side effects were noted; in particular, there was no further deterioration in renal function.
 Intravenous AHPrBP may be a safe and effective agent for the control of hypercalcemia in patients with renal impairment.
