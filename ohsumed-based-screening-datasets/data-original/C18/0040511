Current status of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type II): management with gliclazide.
 Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with a prevalence of 3-7% in most Western countries.
 Decreased insulin secretion and diminished tissue insulin sensitivity are both implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease; both may be exacerbated by persistent hyperglycemia and improved by normalization of blood sugar levels.
 Measures to control hyperglycemia, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia are important in the management of NIDDM and prevention of its long-term complications.
 The effects of dietary modification, exercise, and antihypertensive and antiplatelet therapy, as well as of pharmacologic control of blood sugar, on the vascular and renal complications of NIDDM have been investigated.
 Gliclazide is a second-generation sulfonylurea drug whose efficacy in the treatment of NIDDM, alone or in combination with insulin, has been widely demonstrated.
 Studies of the use of gliclazide, reported at recent symposia, are summarized in this review.
