Independent effects of cyclosporine and prednisone on posttransplant hypercholesterolemia.
 To clarify the relative influences of cyclosporine (CsA) therapy, corticosteroid therapy, and other clinical variables on posttransplant hypercholesterolemia, total serum cholesterol levels were measured in 107 renal transplant recipients receiving one of three immunosuppression regimens: CsA and azathioprine (AZA) (group I); CsA, AZA, and prednisone (group II); or AZA and prednisone (group III).
 Multivariate analysis demonstrated that prednisone therapy, CsA therapy, patient age, and pretransplant cholesterol levels correlated independently with posttransplant cholesterol levels at last follow-up (ranging from 13 to 84 months after transplantation).
 In 32 patients successfully withdrawn from corticosteroid therapy and maintained on AZA and stable doses of CsA, serum cholesterol decreased from 6.55 +/- 1.1 mmol/L (253.5 +/- 43.1 mg/dL) to 5.27 +/- 1.2 mmol/L (203.9 +/- 45.6 mg/dL).
 Results of this analysis indicate that prednisone and CsA are independent factors in the pathogenesis of posttransplant hypercholesterolemia.
 Complete withdrawal of corticosteroids partially corrects hypercholesterolemia in CsA-treated renal transplant recipients.
