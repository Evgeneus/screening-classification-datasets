Calcifications of the breast after reduction mammoplasty.
 Mammograms of 152 patients after mammoplasty were studied and 37 patients were noted to have calcifications.
 The pattern of these calcifications was studied to determine if specific characteristics could be identified.
 The calcifications were found to occur within the skin of the breast, mainly at a periareolar location.
 The ability to identify these benign calcifications further aids in reliably monitoring patients by mammography after reduction mammoplasty.
