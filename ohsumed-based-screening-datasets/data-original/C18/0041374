Hypoglycemias.
 Low plasma glucose concentrations that may or may not be sufficiently low to result in symptoms can be observed as a concomitant of several diverse diseases.
 Treatment of the primary underlying disorder usually alleviates the hypoglycemia.
 For patients whose primary symptom is that of hypoglycemia, it is essential to confirm that the plasma glucose concentration is low during the occurrence of symptoms.
 Symptoms that occur after meals usually are mild and rarely signify serious disease.
 With rare exceptions, hypoglycemia resulting in major symptoms occurs in the food-deprived state.
 Lower concentrations of plasma insulin and C-peptide and a concomitant low plasma glucose are major clues to a correct diagnosis.
