Weight control and exercise.
 Obesity in the United States can truly be called a national epidemic.
 The associated health risks and diseases present a tremendous drain to the economy.
 The most effective program to lose and maintain a desirable body weight incorporates a combination of restriction in caloric intake with an increase in caloric expenditure through exercise.
 A gradual approach of losing 1 or 2 pounds per week has proved to be the most effective.
 Men should strive to maintain approximately 15% body fat and women 25% body fat.
 Weight-reduction programs that demonstrate phenomenal weight loss in a short period will not work over the long term and may represent a significant health risk.
 The ability to lose fat and maintain a desirable body weight is not easy but can be attained through a firm commitment to a healthy life style.
