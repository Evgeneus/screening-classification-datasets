Disassociation between glomerular hyperfiltration and extracellular volume in diabetic rats.
 The relationship of the development of glomerular hyperfiltration in diabetes to changes in extracellular fluid volume has not been previously examined.
 To accomplish this task, male Wistar rats were chronically cannulated in the bladder, femoral artery and vein.
 Control measurements of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), renal plasma flow (RPF), extracellular fluid volume (ECF), and urinary sodium excretion were performed on two separate days prior to infusion of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg body wt i.v.).
 After infusion of streptozotocin, the IDDM rats were separated into two groups: untreated IDDM group of rats and IDDM rats treated with insulin at doses sufficient to normalize blood glucose (Ultralente, 2 to 8 IU/day).
 A third group of normal non-diabetic rats served as time controls.
 Measurements of renal function occurred at 1, 4, 7, 11, and 15 days after infusion of streptozotocin.
 Blood glucose in the non-diabetic measurement period averaged 137 +/- 30 mg/dl and increased from 412 +/- 55 after 24 hours in the untreated diabetic rats to 533 +/- 33 mg/dl after 15 days of IDDM.
 The time controls and the insulin-treated diabetic rats did not differ in blood glucose values at the time measurements were performed.
 Glomerular filtration rate increased from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 1.7 +/- 0.1 ml/min/100 g body wt by day 15 in the untreated diabetic rats with significant increases in GFR within 24 hours.
 GFR of both time controls and the insulin-treated IDDM rats did not significantly vary during the time of the study.
 The increase in GFR in the untreated IDDM group was associated with a concomitant increase in RPF.
