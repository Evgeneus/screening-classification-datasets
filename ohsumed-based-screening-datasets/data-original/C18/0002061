Anxiety levels and cancer fear in patients admitted for elective operations.
 Patients who are to have elective operations project varying degrees of anxiety, and many spontaneously express fear (without basis) that their operation involves a diagnosis of malignancy.
 To measure total, covert, and overt anxiety objectively, we gave the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing anxiety test to 125 consecutive patients admitted for elective general surgical procedures.
 A simple survey of cancer fear was also completed.
 Chi-square and Fisher's exact test were used to compare categoric data, and linear regression and analysis of variance were used where appropriate.
 Total anxiety scores were in the upper quartile compared to the general population.
 Scores indicating fear of cancer were elevated in 75% of patients who had no history of or reason to suspect malignancy.
 Covert anxiety scores correlated with cancer fear scores, and both significantly decreased as age increased (P less than .05).
 Also, as age increased, the cancer fear scores decreased (P less than .002).
 Obese patients had higher scores of cancer fear than all other patients (P less than .0001).
