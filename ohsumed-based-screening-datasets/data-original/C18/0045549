Total peripheral parenteral nutrition in pregnancy.
 Twenty pregnant patients needing nutritional support for various indications received hypercaloric, hyperosmotic, "3 in 1," peripheral parenteral nutrition as a bridge to enteral therapy.
 This system, named total peripheral parenteral nutrition, was evaluated as to tolerance and efficacy in pregnant patients.
 Patients were in various stages of pregnancy and had an average weight loss of 10.4 pounds prior to admission.
 Patients were maintained on total peripheral parenteral nutrition for an average of 5 days and gained an average of 4.1 pounds.
 Good tolerance with minimal side effects of the treatment was noted.
 Intravenous sites were changed an average of 1.1 times per patient during the course of therapy and only one serious complication was noted in 20 patients.
 Patients were followed through delivery and this information is presented.
 Total peripheral parenteral nutrition appears to be an acceptable alternative to conventional total parenteral nutrition to pregnant patients needing nutritional support.
 These hypertonic solutions can supply total caloric/metabolic needs without unacceptable side effects.
