Genetic analysis of diabetes in the nonobese diabetic mouse. I. MHC and T cell receptor beta gene expression.
 Backcross nonobese diabetic (NOD) ((NOD x SWr)F1 x NOD) mice (108 females and 105 males) were typed for MHC, TCR V beta, and monitored for 350 days for the onset of diabetes.
 The presence of "antipolar" antibodies in the sera and the occurrence of insulitis was examined in a proportion of these backcross mice.
 There was no difference in the incidence of diabetes in mice heterozygous for TCR V beta b/a vs those homozygous for TCR V beta b/b.
 Among the 17 diabetics (all female) detected in this backcross, 14/17 were H-2nod/nod but 3/17 were H-2nod/q.
 This supports a previous observation suggesting that the MHC-linked diabetogenic gene originally thought to be recessive may rather be dominant but have a low penetrance in the heterozygous state.
 Antipolar autoantibodies were found in both female and male backcross mice, and were similarly distributed in diabetic and nondiabetic mice.
 There appeared to be no correlation between the level of these auto-antibodies and development of diabetes.
 The incidence and severity of insulitis was linked to MHC but no influence of TCR genes on insulitis nor an association between insulitis and antipolar antibodies could be demonstrated in this study.
 Further analyses of H-2nod/nod intercross mice homozygous for TCR V beta a or TCR V beta b are currently underway.
