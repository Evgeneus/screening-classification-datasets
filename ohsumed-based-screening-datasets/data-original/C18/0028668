Weight-loss practices of overweight adults.
 Data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 1985-1988, were used to assess differences in weight-loss practices of overweight adults by sex and race.
 Data were available for 112,108 respondents from 21 states, aged greater than or equal to 18 y.
 Overweight was defined as body mass index greater than or equal to 27.3 for women and greater than or equal to 27.8 for men.
 Weight-loss practices were defined as increasing physical activity only, eating fewer calories only, increasing physical activity and eating fewer calories only, increasing physical activity and eating fewer calories, and not trying to lose weight.
 The weight-loss practice most frequently reported by overweight women was increasing physical activity and eating fewer calories (blacks, 32%; whites, 33%).
 Overweight men most frequently reported not trying to lose weight (blacks, 55%; whites, 49%).
 Although the prevalence of overweight for black women was twice that for white women, weight-loss practices were similar for both groups.
 Prevalence of overweight was similar for black and white men but weight-loss practices differed slightly.
