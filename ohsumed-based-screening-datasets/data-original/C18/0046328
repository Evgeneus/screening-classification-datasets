A frameshift mutation in the human apolipoprotein A-I gene causes high density lipoprotein deficiency, partial lecithin: cholesterol-acyltransferase deficiency, and corneal opacities.
 Epidemiologic data of recent years have identified an important role of HDL deficiency in the etiology of atherosclerosis.
 Biochemical data suggest that some of these deficiencies may be a consequence of defects in the structural genes of HDL apolipoproteins or of plasma enzymes that modify HDL.
 We analyzed the genetic defect in a 42-yr-old patient suffering from corneal opacities and complete absence of HDL cholesterol but not of coronary artery disease, thus clinically resembling fish eye disease.
 The observation of an abnormal immunoblot banding pattern of apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and of reduced lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity in plasma led to sequence analysis of the genes for apo A-I and LCAT in this patient and his family.
 Direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA segments containing the exons of the candidate genes, resulted in the identification of a frameshift mutation in apo A-I while the LCAT sequence was identical to the wild type.
 The apo A-I mutation was predictive for an extensive alteration of the COOH-terminal sequence of the encoded protein.
 Evidence for the release of this mutant protein into the plasma compartment and for the absence of normal apo A-I was derived from ultraviolet laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry analysis.
 Our results suggest that a defective apo A-I is the causative defect in this case of HDL deficiency with corneal opacities.
