Calcification of the ligamentum arteriosum in children: a normal finding on CT.
 Calcification of the ligamentum arteriosum is a rare finding on plain radiographs.
 We commonly have seen the calcification on unenhanced CT scans of the chest, a finding not previously reported.
 A retrospective review of unenhanced CT scans of the chest was undertaken to determine the frequency of the described finding.
 Seven (13%) of 53 patients had a well-demarcated focus of calcification in the region of the ligamentum arteriosum.
 None of these patients had evidence of a patent ductus arteriosum.
 Calcification within the ligamentum arteriosum was seen in 13% of routine CT examinations of the chest in children and should not be confused with a pathologic process producing mediastinal calcifications.
