Parenchymal versus reticuloendothelial iron overload in the liver: distinction with MR imaging 
 Parenchymal iron deposition occurs in hemochromatosis, while iron is deposited in reticuloendothelial (RE) cells after blood transfusions or rhabdomyolysis.
 Magnetic resonance images of patients with decreased liver signal intensity on T2-weighted images at 1.5 T were blindly compared in an effort to distinguish these conditions.
 In each of five patients with hemochromatosis, the pancreas had low signal intensity, but splenic signal intensity was decreased in only one.
 In contrast, only three of the 16 patients with RE iron overload had low pancreatic signal intensity, while all of these patients either had low splenic signal intensity (n = 14) or previously underwent splenectomy (n = 2).
 Distinction among these causes of iron deposition is clinically important because parenchymal iron overload from hemochromatosis may produce significant tissue damage, while the RE iron of transfusions and rhabdomyolysis is of little clinical consequence.
