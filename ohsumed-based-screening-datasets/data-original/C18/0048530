The inhibition of metabolic oxalate production by sulfhydryl compounds.
 A number of sulfhydryl compounds were shown to inhibit CO2 and oxalate formation from glyoxylate by rat liver homogenates and hepatocytes.
 The most significant inhibition occurred with cysteine and this inhibition was concentration-dependent.
 In rats made hyperoxaluric by administering ethylene glycol in their drinking water, daily intraperitoneal injections of cysteine caused a rapid and marked decrease in urinary oxalate excretion which was maintained over the duration of the treatment (28 days).
 Over this time period, the level of urinary oxalate excretion in these ethylene glycol-treated rats was reduced to that of the controls.
 It is postulated that the decrease is due to the formation of a cysteine-glyoxylate adduct, 2-carboxy-4-thiazolidine carboxylate, which prevents glyoxylate being further oxidized to oxalate.
 Cysteine or similar sulphydryl compounds may therefore have potential as therapeutic agents in the prevention of renal stones.
