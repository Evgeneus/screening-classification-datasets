Management of hyponatremic seizures in children with hypertonic saline: a safe and effective strategy.
 OBJECTIVE: To study efficacy and safety of hypertonic saline administration in the management of hyponatremic seizures.
 DESIGN: Retrospective, observational, cross-sectional study with factorial design.
 SETTING: In-patient population in a university hospital.
 PATIENTS: All children admitted with serum sodium concentrations less than 125 mmol/L.
 Sixty-nine episodes of severe hyponatremia in 60 children were reviewed.
 Forty-one of these children presented with seizures.
 INTERVENTIONS: Twenty-five of 41 seizure patients received an iv bolus of 4 to 6 mL/kg body weight of 3% saline.
 Twenty-eight patients were treated with a benzodiazepine and/or phenobarbital with or without the subsequent administration of hypertonic saline.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirteen treatment failures and ten instances of apnea occurred among the 28 patients treated with benzodiazepine/phenobarbital.
 Administration of hypertonic saline resulted in resolution of seizures and apnea in all cases.
 Those patients receiving 3% saline had a higher serum sodium increase rate from 0 to 4 hrs than the remaining patients (3.1 +/- 1.3 vs.
 1.7 +/- 1.2 mmol/L.hr, p less than .01).
 None developed subsequent neurologic deterioration or clinical manifestations of osmotic demyelination syndrome.
 CONCLUSION: Treatment of hyponatremic seizures with routine anticonvulsants may be ineffective and is associated with a considerable incidence of apnea.
 A rapid increase in the serum sodium concentration by 3 to 5 mmol/L with the use of hypertonic saline is safe and efficacious in managing acute symptomatic hyponatremia.
