Normalization of Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in isolated membrane fraction from sciatic nerves of streptozocin-induced diabetic rats by dietary myo-inositol supplementation in vivo or protein kinase C agonists in vitro.
 A myo-inositol-related defect in nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in experimental diabetes has been invoked in the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy, but the mechanism linking altered myo-inositol metabolism and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase regulation in diabetic nerve is uncertain.
 Decreased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in diabetic rat nerve is normalized by aldose reductase inhibitors or dietary myo-inositol, which preserve normal nerve myo-inositol content in vivo.
 Decreased Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in diabetic rabbit nerve is acutely reversed by exposure to protein kinase C agonists in vitro.
 This study explored the relationship between the myo-inositol-sensitive and protein kinase C-agonist-sensitive Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase defects in diabetic rat nerve.
 Ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity was measured in an enriched membrane fraction isolated from nondiabetic, streptozocin-induced diabetic, and myo-inositol-supplemented streptozocin-induced diabetic rats before and after the membranes were exposed to protein kinase C agonists in vitro.
 The decreased ouabain-sensitive ATPase activity in plasma membranes from untreated diabetic rats was increased after exposure to two structurally unrelated protein kinase C agonists; the normal ouabain-sensitive ATPase in plasma membranes from myo-inositol-supplemented diabetic rats was unaffected by protein kinase C agonists.
 The nonadditivity and implied equivalence of the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase defect corrected by myo-inositol in vivo and by protein kinase C agonists in vitro are consistent with the postulated existence of a deficient myo-inositol-dependent phospholipid-derived protein kinase C agonist (presumably diacylglycerol) in diabetic nerve that regulates nerve Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase either directly or via a protein kinase C mechanism.
