Atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with diabetes mellitus type I. Effects on systemic and renal hemodynamics and renal excretory function.
 In the present study the effects of 1 h intravenous infusion of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (24 ng/min/kg) on systemic and renal hemodynamics and on renal excretory function were studied in six insulin-treated and metabolically well-controlled patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) type I and in six healthy control subjects (C).
 Basal plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) concentration was 14.6 +/- 2.0 in DM patients and 14.9 +/- 1.3 pmol/L in C and rose similarly in both groups to 87.1 +/- 22.1 and to 86.9 +/- 11.1 pmol/L, respectively, during alpha-hANP infusion (P less than .05).
 Maximal effects of alpha-hANP occurred between 30 and 60 min after the start of the infusion.
 Mean arterial pressure (MAP) (83 +/- 5 v 81 +/- 3 mm Hg), heart rate (HR) (63 +/- 2 v 64 +/- 4/min) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) (11 +/- 1 v 10 +/- 1 mm Hg.min/L) remained unaltered in patients with DM.
 In contrast, in C MAP and TPR decreased from 83 +/- 3 to 77 +/- 2 mm Hg and from 12 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 1 1 mm Hg.min/L, respectively (P less than .05), whereas HR increased from 53 +/- 2 to 59 +/- 3 beats/min (P less than .05).
 Cardiac output (CO) rose initially by 11% and by 9% in DM and C, respectively.
 Urine flow increased from 4.1 +/- 0.9 to 11.3 +/- 1.5 mL/min in DM patients and from 3.9 +/- 1.0 to 8.4 +/- 0.8 mL/min in C (P less than .05).
