Type 2 diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease.
 The relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and periodontal disease was evaluated in 2,878 Pima Indians of the southwestern United States.
 Two independent measures of periodontal disease, probing attachment loss and radiographic bone loss, were used to compare prevalence and severity of periodontal disease in diabetic and nondiabetic subjects.
 In all age groups studied, subjects with diabetes had a higher prevalence of periodontal disease, indicating that diabetes may be a risk factor for periodontal disease.
