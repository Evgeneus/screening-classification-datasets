Effects of a very-low-calorie diet and physical-training regimens on body composition and resting metabolic rate in obese females.
 Sixty-nine obese females received 90 d of a liquid diet providing 2184 kJ/d in clinical trials.
 Groups were diet only (C), diet plus endurance exercise (EE), diet plus weight training (WT), or diet plus endurance exercise and weight training (EEWT).
 Changes in body weight, percent fat, fat weight, and fat-free mass were not different between groups.
 Declines in resting metabolic rate (RMR) were approximately 7% to approximately 12% of baseline values with no differences among groups.
 A significant increase in work capacity (approximately 16%) was shown for EEWT.
 Strength index showed declines of approximately 6% for C and EE and gains of approximately 3% and approximately 10% for EEWT and WT, respectively.
 These clinical trials did not show advantages of any exercise regimen over diet alone for weight loss, body-composition changes, or declines in RMR.
 Improvements in work capacity were limited and strength improved in groups that participated in strength training.
