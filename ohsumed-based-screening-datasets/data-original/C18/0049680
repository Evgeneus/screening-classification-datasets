Abnormal regulation of IFN-gamma secretion in vitamin A deficiency.
 T lymphocytes from vitamin A-deficient (A-) mice show a decreased ability to stimulate B lymphocytes for Ag-specific secondary IgG1 responses in vivo and in vitro.
 Experiments reported here traced the molecular basis for this functional defect to an overproduction of IFN-gamma by A- CD4+ T cells compared with cells from A-sufficient (A+) mice.
 Secretion of IL-2 and IL-4 by cells from A- and A+ mice was equivalent.
 Retinoic acid supplementation in vitro decreased IFN-gamma secretion from A- T cells, indicating that IFN-gamma production is retinoid-responsive.
 Adding IFN-gamma neutralizing antibodies to cultures established with cells from immune A- mice substantially increased IgG1 production, whereas IL-4 addition moderately increased IgG1 production.
 Adding retinoic acid to the cultures either at initiation, or 48 h later, fully restored IgG1 production by A- cultures to the level of A+ control cultures.
 These results are consistent with a role for vitamin A in negatively regulating IFN-gamma secretion.
