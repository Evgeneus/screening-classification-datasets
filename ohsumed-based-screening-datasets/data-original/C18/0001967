Natural history and cardiac manifestations of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia.
 Forty-nine patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (diagnosed on the basis of family history, xanthomatosis, total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein receptor status) were studied over a period of 13 years, and underwent cardiovascular assessment.
 Eleven died, nine of myocardial infarction.
 Seven underwent coronary artery bypass, and another five had surgery to relieve supravalvular and valvular aortic stenosis.
 A distinctive pattern of disease was noted.
 Coronary ostial stenosis (four patients) and aortic root stenosis (six patients), both consequences of aortic root cholesterol deposition, were the typical manifestations of heart disease in childhood and adolescence.
 Adults developed severe coronary artery disease with a high incidence of main stem lesions (four of five patients).
 Surgery provided effective treatment for coronary artery disease and aortic outflow tract stenosis.
 Overall survival appeared to be better than reported in other studies which may reflect the 'receptor-defective' status of this group of patients.
