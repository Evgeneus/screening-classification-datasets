Elevated cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity in IDDM men who smoke. Possible factor for unfavorable lipoprotein profile.
 OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of cigarette smoking on the activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and high-density (HDL), low-density (LDL), and very-low-density (VLDL) lipoproteins in insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) men with microvascular complications.
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study in a referral-based diabetes clinic on a sequential sample of 9 cigarette-smoking and 12 nonsmoking IDDM men with microvascular complications and 12 nonsmoking control men.
 CETP activity was determined in each serum with an isotope assay with exogenous cholesteryl ester-labeled LDL and HDL.
 The method is independent of the endogenous lipoprotein present in serum.
 RESULTS: The HDL-cholesterol (VLDL and LDL) ratio was lower in the smoking diabetic men than in the other groups (P less than 0.05 vs.
 the nonsmoking diabetic men and P less than 0.01 vs.
 the control subjects).
 CETP activity was 70% higher in the smoking diabetic men than in the control subjects (P less than 0.01) and 30% higher than in the nonsmoking diabetic men (P less than 0.05).
 The HDL-cholesterol (VLDL and LDL) ratio and the apolipoprotein A-I-B ratio were inversely correlated to CETP activity in the diabetic patients (r = -0.52, P less than 0.02 and r = -0.45, P less than 0.05, respectively).
 CONCLUSIONS: CETP activity is increased in cigarette-smoking IDDM men with microvascular complications.
 High CETP activity may contribute to the unfavorable lipoprotein profile in these patients.
