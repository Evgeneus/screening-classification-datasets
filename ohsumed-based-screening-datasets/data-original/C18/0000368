Peripheral venous monitoring with acute blood volume alteration: cuff-occluded rate of rise of peripheral venous pressure.
 We investigated the use of a new peripheral hemodynamic monitoring technique, the cuff-occluded rate of rise of peripheral venous pressure (CORRP), in the assessment of volume status in fluid overload.
 Seven adult mongrel dogs were given a general anesthetic, and monitoring lines were inserted.
 The animals were then subjected to an incremental volume overload of approximately 13% of estimated initial blood volume at 5-min intervals until a total volume infusion nearly equal to the animal's initial blood volume was reached.
 Comparison of the various monitoring techniques (e.g., cardiac output, CVP, systemic BP, pulmonary wedge pressure) demonstrated that the peripheral measurement of CORRP had better correlation with known administered volume (r = .96) than any of the other variables.
 The sensitivity of each of the variables in assessing small amounts of volume overload was also studied.
 The volume of crystalloid infusion necessary to cause a clinically significant change (defined as greater than 2 SD above the baseline mean) was compared for each of the monitoring variables.
 CORRP was equivalent to the other variables in sensing early volume overload.
 In summary, in the anesthetized animal model CORRP appears to be a sensitive, minimally invasive method of assessing volume status in acute volume overload.
 The efficacy of CORRP in a canine hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion model had previously been demonstrated.
 This technique could be clinically applicable in situations such as trauma with hemorrhagic shock, intraoperative volume changes, and in the assessment of intravascular volume after resuscitation.
