Increased serum osteocalcin levels in patients with lactase deficiency.
 Serum levels of osteocalcin, a noncollagenous bone matrix protein, have been found to be a specific biochemical parameter of bone formation.
 In the literature in subjects with osteoporosis, an increased incidence of lactase deficiency has been described.
 We therefore determined the serum levels of osteocalcin in 10 patients with lactase deficiency and in 20 control subjects by radioimmunoassay.
 The patients with lactase deficiency were dietary treated and had a very low daily calcium intake.
 Serum osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in the patients with lactase deficiency than in the control subjects.
 In contrast, serum levels of parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, calcium, and phosphorus were not statistically different in the two groups.
 Our data suggest an increased rate of bone turnover in patients with lactase deficiency on a low calcium diet; possibly calcium supplementation is indicated in dietary-treated patients with lactase deficiency.
