Chronic calcific pancreatitis in a patient with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.
 We report on a patient with chronic calcific pancreatitis associated with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia, and we have hypothesized a possible relationship between these two entities.
 The hyperviscosity of serum in Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia may be associated with a viscous pancreatic juice that leads to stone formation.
