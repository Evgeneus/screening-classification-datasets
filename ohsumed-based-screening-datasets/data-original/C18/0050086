Screening recommendations for gestational diabetes mellitus.
 As a result of extensive experiences in multiple centers and a review of the current literature, we conclude that a plasma glucose level obtained 1 hour after a 50 gm oral glucose challenge is the "best" gestational diabetes mellitus screening test.
 This universal screening is performed at least once during pregnancy.
 The screening threshold should be no higher than 140 mg/dl, or an unacceptable loss in sensitivity occurs.
 Universal screening for gestational diabetes mellitus is justified by morbidity reduction, cost, and protocol simplicity and ease.
