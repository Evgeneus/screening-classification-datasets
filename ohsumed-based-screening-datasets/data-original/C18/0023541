Lowering of serum cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic humans by tocotrienols (palmvitee).
 A double-blind, crossover, 8-wk study was conducted to compare effects of the tocotrienol-enriched fraction of palm oil (200 mg palmvitee capsules/day) with those of 300 mg corn oil/d on serum lipids of hypercholesterolemic human subjects (serum cholesterol 6.21-8.02 mmol/L).
 Concentrations of serum total cholesterol (-15%), LDL cholesterol (-8%), Apo B (-10%), thromboxane (-25%), platelet factor 4 (-16%), and glucose (-12%) decreased significantly only in the 15 subjects given palmvitee during the initial 4 wk.
 The crossover confirmed these actions of palmvitee.
 There was a carry over effect of palmvitee.
 Serum cholesterol concentrations of seven hypercholesterolemic subjects (greater than 7.84 mmol/L) decreased 31% during a 4-wk period in which they were given 200 mg gamma-tocotrienol/d.
 This indicates that gamma-tocotrienol may be the most potent cholesterol inhibitor in palmvitee capsules.
 The results of this pilot study are very encouraging.
