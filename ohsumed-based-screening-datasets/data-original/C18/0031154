Echographic diagnosis of anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation.
 High-resolution contact B-scan echographic imaging of the ciliary body and peripheral retina was performed on five eyes with anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation and media opacity by means of a wide (58 degrees) scanning arc.
 This technique determined the circumferential and anteroposterior extent of peripheral traction retinal detachment associated with anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation, which correlated highly with findings at subsequent vitrectomy.
 Final visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in the two eyes (50%) with more limited peripheral traction detachment.
 In the presence of media opacity, anterior echographic imaging may allow early detection of traction retinal detachment associated with anterior hyaloidal fibrovascular proliferation and may be useful in characterizing the severity of this condition.
