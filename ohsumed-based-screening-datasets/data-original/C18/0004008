Adaptive hyperphagia in patients with postsurgical malabsorption.
 The specific nutritional consequences of malabsorption after small-bowel surgery were studied in a consecutive series of 48 ambulatory patients who had had small-bowel resection (n = 43) or bypass (n = 5) and in 10 patients who had an ileal pouch (n = 10).
 The patients received a 3-day standardized oral regimen providing daily 30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight (IBW).
 Throughout the study, 41 patients had malabsorption (fecal fat greater than 5%); 17 had fecal fat less than 5% and served as controls.
 The malabsorption patients absorbed 70% of protein and 71% of fat.
 Twenty-one were normonourished and 20 had features of mild energy malnutrition, vs.
 15 and 2 controls, respectively.
 Compared with controls, malabsorption patients had decreased body weight and triceps skin-fold but no features of protein malnutrition.
 their mean daily food intake at home was significantly enhanced (39.6 +/- 13.1 kcal/IBW kg) vs.
 controls (28.8 +/- 5.8 kcal/IBW kg, P less than 0.001).
 In the malabsorption group, caloric intake was higher in the normonourished patients than in those with mild malnutrition.
 This study shows that a chronic malabsorption has limited nutritional consequences.
 The patients compensate for their absorptive handicap by increasing their oral intake.
