Telematic transmission of computerized blood glucose profiles for IDDM patients.
 OBJECTIVE: To improve the analysis of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) and its communication between patients and physicians by a telematic transmission of computerized SMBG and to study the consequences of its use on glucose control of insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients.
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective randomized crossover trial with two 3-mo periods, one with SMBG recorded on traditional booklets (booklet period) and another with computerized SMBG transmitted to a central data base through a telematic network (telematic period), comprised the study.
 During the latter phase, patients could receive computerized SMBG analysis on individual terminals connected to the telephone network (Minitel system).
 Blood glucose recordings and HbA1c were measured at inclusion and end of each period.
 Eleven pairs of IDDM patients on intensified insulin therapy were randomized within each pair to start with the telematic period (group A) or the booklet period (group B).
 RESULTS: Telematic transmissions were successful (less than 1% failure rate).
 Although initial HbA1c was low (6.7%), it declined during the telematic period (delta = -0.41%) compared with the booklet period (delta = +0.37%, P = 0.05).
 The percentage of low (less than 3.3 mM) blood glucose values correlated with HbA1c changes during the telematic period (r = 0.714, P = 0.0014) but not the booklet period.
 The patients favored the telematic tool to analyze SMBG.
 CONCLUSIONS: Telematic transmission of SMBG is feasible.
 It can improve SMBG analysis and perhaps glucose control, therefore offering a new way of communication between diabetic patients and their physicians.
