Nutrition and somatomedin. XXVII. Total and free IGF-I and IGF binding proteins in rats with streptozocin-induced diabetes.
 Impaired growth in diabetic humans occurs despite increased growth hormone and normal insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I).
 Because IGF-I circulates complexed to binding proteins (BPs), we asked whether diabetes-related changes in IGF BPs could be associated with alterations in free unbound IGF-I--presumably the active form.
 Rats were given streptozocin (STZ) in increasing doses to produce graded severity of diabetes.
 IGF BP-1 and BP-3 were measured by ligand blotting, total IGF-I was determined by radioimmunoassay after separation from BPs by isocratic high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) at pH 3.9, and free IGF-I was estimated operationally as immunoreactivity with molecular weight equal to native IGF-I after HPLC at pH 7.
 Animals given 36 mg/kg STZ exhibited a glucose level of 9.74 mM and impaired weight gain, with little alteration in IGF BPs or total or free IGF-I.
 In contrast, animals given 72 mg/kg STZ (glucose level 24.64 mM and weight loss) had insignificant changes in total IGF-I and BP-3 but a 300% increase in BP-1 and a 50% fall in free IGF-I (both P less than 0.005).
 With 144 and 288 mg/kg STZ, animals had further metabolic decompensation and weight loss, with progressive fall in BP-3 and rise in BP-1; total and free IGF-I fell to 10-20% of control (both P less than 0.001).
