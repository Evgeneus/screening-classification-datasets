Lambert Eaton syndrome: autonomic neuropathy and inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in a patient with small cell carcinoma of the lung.
 A patient with small cell carcinoma of the lung developed asymptomatic autonomic neuropathy, inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion and Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome.
 The autonomic neuropathy and inappropriate ADH secretion were present at the time of diagnosis of the tumour.
 Following chemotherapy these resolved, but 5 months later the patient developed Lambert Eaton syndrome which responded to 3,4-diaminopyridine.
 This sequence of changes appears to be unique.
