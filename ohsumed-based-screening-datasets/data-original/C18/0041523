Vasopressin levels in infants during the course of aseptic and bacterial meningitis.
 We measured urine vasopressin (VP) once daily on days 1 through 3 in 18 patients hospitalized with meningitis.
 Urine VP values were 215 +/- 100, 116 +/- 44, and 69 +/- 23 pg/mL on days 1 through 3, respectively, for children with bacterial meningitis and 34 +/- 14, 20 +/- 4, and 15 +/- 4 pg/mL for those with aseptic meningitis.
 Urinary VP levels of infants with bacterial meningitis were significantly greater than those of healthy ambulatory subjects (n = 18) on all three study days; VP values of infants with bacterial meningitis were also greater than those of infants with aseptic meningitis on study days 2 and 3.
 The VP levels for the subjects with aseptic meningitis were significantly greater than those of the controls on day 1 only.
 None of the infants exhibited the clinical syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.
