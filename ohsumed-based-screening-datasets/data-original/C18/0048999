The function but not the expression of rat liver inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein is altered in streptozotocin-induced diabetes.
 Adenylate cyclase activity was examined as a measure of inhibitory guanine nucleotide binding protein (Gi) function in liver plasma membranes from rats made chemically diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ) treatment.
 Clonidine activation of the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor, which activates Gi, inhibited forskolin--stimulated adenylate cyclase activity in control membranes.
 However, there was no effect on adenylate cyclase activity in membranes from STZ diabetic animals.
 Also, a polyclonal antipeptide antibody was raised to a highly conserved segment of the Gi alpha 2 subunit.
 This antibody specifically recognizes a 41 kilodalton protein, is blocked by an excess of peptide, does not recognize the alpha-subunit of transducin, and immunoprecipitates a 41 kilodalton protein which was ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin.
 Immunoblots using this antibody detect no difference between normal and STZ diabetic animals in the level of liver plasma membrane Gi expression.
 Therefore, STZ-induced diabetes altered the function of Gi but had no effect on Gi expression.
