Role of intrarenal angiotensin II and alpha-adrenoceptors in renal vasoconstriction with acute hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis in conscious dogs.
 To evaluate our previous observation of renal vasoconstriction during combined acute hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis preceded by acute hypoxemia, we studied 13 conscious mongrel uninephrectomized dogs with chronic renal catheters and controlled sodium intake (80 meq/day for 4 days).
 Five dogs were studied during combined acute hypoxemia (PaO2, 37 +/- 1 mm Hg) and hypercapnic acidosis (PaCO2, 59 +/- 1 mm Hg; pH 7.20 +/- 0.01).
 Each dog was studied during infusion of 1) the intrarenal vehicle (n = 5), 2) the intrarenal alpha 1-antagonist prazosin (0.2 micrograms.kg-1.min-1, n = 5), 3) intrarenal [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (70 ng.kg-1.min-1, n = 5), and 4) intrarenal prazosin and [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II (n = 4).
 Immediate induction of combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis after control measurements during intrarenal vehicle infusion resulted in a decrease in effective renal plasma flow and glomerular filtration rate, increase in renal vascular resistance, and decrease in filtered sodium load in the first 20 minutes of the blood gas derangement.
 Intrarenal administration of [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II failed to reverse the effects of the combined blood gas derangement on renal function.
 In contrast, intrarenal prazosin administration either alone or in combination with [Sar1,Ala8]angiotensin II abrogated the increase in renal vascular resistance, decrease in glomerular filtration rate, and fall in filtered sodium load.
 These studies identify a major role for alpha 1-adrenoceptors in the renal vasoconstriction during combined hypoxemia and hypercapnic acidosis.
