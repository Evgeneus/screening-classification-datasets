Hypercalcemia of advanced malignancy: decision making and the quality of death.
 Hypercalcemia is a common complication of certain advanced malignancies and although not therapeutically difficult, its presence raises complex ethical issues.
 Treatment of this condition is most easily justified when the patient is not terminal, the benefits are tangible, and the patient agrees with therapy.
 Withholding treatment is defensible medically, legally, and morally when a terminal situation is present, when drawbacks exceed the benefits, and when an informed patient declines therapy.
 Hypercalcemia is one of a number of conditions of dying that can be controlled by the physician.
 The physician's decision to treat such a condition, in part, depends upon his or her view of a good death.
 Further study is needed to clarify and avoid those situations of dying which involve suffering.
 Physicians must begin this difficult analysis and dialogue if they are to fulfill their obligation to minimize suffering in all patients.
