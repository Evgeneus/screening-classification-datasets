Large asymptomatic antrolith of the maxillary sinus. Report of a case.
 A case of an unusually large antrolith of the maxillary sinus is presented.
 Because of the size of the mass, benign neoplasms were considered in the differential diagnosis.
 Surgery was the treatment of choice, and recurrence of the lesion is not expected.
