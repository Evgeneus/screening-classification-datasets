Low serum calcium and high parathyroid hormone levels in neonates fed 'humanized' cow's milk-based formula.
 We previously suggested that "late" neonatal hypocalcemia is related to a low calcium-phosphorus ratio of current cow's milk-based formula compared with human milk.
 However, there are no longitudinal studies of ionized calcium and parathyroid hormone concentrations in neonates receiving formulas with varying Ca/P ratios.
 Sixty-nine term neonates were studied through 2 weeks of age, and formula-fed neonates were randomized at birth to receive formula with molar ratios of 0.9, 1.2, or 1.4.
 Serum phosphate concentrations on days 2 and 6 of age were higher, and ionized calcium levels lower on days 6 and 14, in formula-fed vs human milk-fed neonates.
 Serum intact parathyroid hormone level increased between days 2 and 6 in formula-fed neonates compared with a decrease in human milk-fed neonates.
 Serum parathyroid hormone level on day 6 correlated with phosphorus intake among formula-fed neonates.
 No differences were noted in serum mineral or hormone levels among formula-fed groups.
 We speculate that the lowering of serum ionized calcium concentrations in neonates fed a modern "humanized" cow's milk formula may be a factor in late neonatal hypocalcemia.
