Mutations in the arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency allele causing metachromatic leukodystrophy.
 We identified a patient suffering from late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy who genetically seemed to be homozygous for the mutations signifying the arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency allele.
 Homozygosity for the pseudodeficiency allele is associated with low arylsulfatase A activity but does not cause a disease.
 Analysis of the arylsulfatase A gene in this patient revealed a C----T transition in exon 2, causing a Ser 96----Phe substitution in addition to the sequence alterations causing arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency.
 Although this mutation was found only in 1 of 78 metachromatic leukodystrophy patients tested, five more patients were identified who seemed hetero- or homozygous for the pseudodeficiency allele.
 The existence of nonfunctional arylsulfatase A alleles derived from the pseudodeficiency allele calls for caution when the diagnosis of arylsulfatase A pseudodeficiency is based solely on the identification of the mutations characterizing the pseudodeficiency allele.
