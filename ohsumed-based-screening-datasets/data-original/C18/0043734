Peripheral odontogenic fibroma: a clinicopathologic study.
 The clinicopathologic features of 30 cases of peripheral odontogenic fibroma are reviewed.
 The age distribution is wide (11 to 76 years), and there is a slight predilection for males.
 The majority of the lesions (93%) occurred in blacks on the attached gingiva, and with equal frequency in the maxilla and mandible.
 Size varied between 1 and 3 cm in diameter.
 One case recurred after 14 months.
 Histologically, the lesions are nonencapsulated and poorly delineated.
 The amount of odontogenic epithelium varies considerably and consists usually of small islands or strands, although larger follicles are sometimes present.
 In one case the epithelial cells had a clear cytoplasm, whereas in another it was granular and eosinophilic.
 Origin from the surface oral mucosa can sometimes be seen.
 The connective tissue component is usually cellular, but collagenous, myxomatous, and mixed forms occur.
 Calcifications were present in 22 cases and consisted of tissue interpreted as either dentinoid, cementum, bone, or dystrophic calcific material.
