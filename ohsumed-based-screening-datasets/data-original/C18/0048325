Effects of insulin on blood, plasma, and brain glucose in hyperglycemic diabetic rats.
 This study, in biologically bred hyperglycemic diabetic rats, examined the effect of a intravenous insulin infusion (1.5 units.hr-1) on blood, plasma, and brain glucose concentrations to determine their relationship during decreasing blood and plasma glucose levels.
 The data were compared to saline-treated diabetic rats and saline-treated nondiabetic littermates.
 The volume and duration of the treatment infusion were similar in all groups.
 Insulin infusion in diabetic rats produced the expected reduction in blood and plasma glucose, and normoglycemia was produced within 78 +/- 37 minutes (mean +/- SD).
 However, once normoglycemia was achieved, brain glucose was still significantly greater by 44% than in nondiabetic rats (p = 0.015).
 Moreover, the ratio of brain to plasma glucose was more than 50% greater in diabetic than nondiabetic rats, irrespective of whether or not they received insulin (p less than 0.01).
 We conclude that measurement of blood or plasma glucose in diabetic subjects will tend to underestimate the amount of glucose in the brain and that this relationship is not influenced by acute insulin therapy.
