Choice enhances performance in non-insulin dependent diabetics and controls.
 Cognitive performance on a number of tasks is poorer in individuals with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) than in age-matched nondiabetics.
 In this study, diabetic and nondiabetic individuals, 55-74 years of age, learned target words, half of which were self-chosen and the remainder assigned.
 To evaluate susceptibility to background interference, each target was accompanied by one or more unrelated background words.
 On a recognition test, susceptibility to background interference appeared to be greater in diabetic individuals.
 The allocation of processing resources to target and background stimuli was more uniform in diabetic than in nondiabetic individuals.
 While choice improved recognition of target and background words for both groups, its effectiveness was attenuated in NIDDM.
 Choice facilitates the differentiation of target from background stimuli--a process that may reduce interference from background stimuli.
