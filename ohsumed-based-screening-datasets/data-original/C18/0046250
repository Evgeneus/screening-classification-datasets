Health and nutritional status of Liberian refugee children--Guinea, 1990.
 Since December 1989, civil strife in Liberia has caused mass displacement of persons to neighboring Guinea and Ivory Coast (Figure 1).
 Liberian refugees initially settled in the Forest Region of Guinea and shared food and shelter with members of the same ethnic groups (mainly Gio and Mano) already residing in the area.
 The number of refugees overwhelmed the capacity of affected villages to provide basic needs, and camp-like settlements were established that received substantial external relief.
 In May 1990, to determine appropriate priorities for relief assistance, the health and nutritional status of Liberian refugees in the Forest Region of Guinea was assessed by CDC for the U.S.
 Department of State's Bureau for Refugee Programs.
 In May, an estimated 80,000 refugees were in the area; by December the number had increased to an estimated 400,000.
 This report summarizes findings of the health and nutritional assessment of Liberian refugee children.
