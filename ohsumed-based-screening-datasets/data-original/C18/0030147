Combined vitrectomy, cataract extraction, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in diabetic patients.
 Combined extracapsular cataract extraction, pars plana vitrectomy, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed in six eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
 These eyes all had minimal iris vascular changes and were at reasonably low risk for developing intraoperative and postoperative complications.
 The surgery must be relatively brief and the endophotocoagulation accurate.
 Initial visual acuities ranged from light perception to 4/200.
 With an average follow-up of 9.7 months, final acuities ranged from 4/200 to 20/40.
