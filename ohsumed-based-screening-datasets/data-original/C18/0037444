Lipoprotein composition and HDL particle size distribution in women with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and the effects of probucol treatment.
 To further characterize the spectrum of potentially atherogenic disturbances in lipoprotein composition in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), we have studied a subset of women with NIDDM before and after treatment with the lipophilic lipid-lowering drug probucol (1 gm day), which we have shown corrects certain compositional abnormalities these women share with subjects who have hypercholesterolemia.
 Before treatment, the NIDDM group had a somewhat higher plasma triglyceride level (154 +/- 58.3 mg/dl, vs control, 80.0 +/- 21 mg/dl [mean +/- SD]; p less than 0.025) than controls but their cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels did not differ from control levels.
 A number of significant disturbances, however, were present in the surface and core lipid composition of their lipoproteins.
 Although the cholesterol content of NIDDM low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was similar to that of controls, its content of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylinositol plus phosphatidylserine and sphingomyelin-to-lecithin ratio all were significantly reduced.
 Moreover, their very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and HDL2 tended to have reduced amounts of free (unesterified) cholesterol (FC) relative to lecithin, and their HDL2 and HDL3 tended to be triglyceride enriched.
 Probucol therapy resulted in significant decreases in total plasma cholesterol (-15%), FC (-28%), HDL-C (-22%), and triglyceride (-16%) and in apoproteins A-I, B, and E (apo A-I, B, and E), without changing diabetic control (before probucol: hemoglobin A1, cholesterol, 10.7% +/- 2.7%; after probucol: 10.9% +/- 3.0%).
