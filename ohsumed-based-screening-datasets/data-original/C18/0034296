Differential effect of diabetes education on self-regulation and life-style behaviors.
 OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of diabetes education on self-regulation and life-style behaviors.
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Participants in an outpatient diabetes education program completed a protocol measuring several self-care behaviors and glycemic control at entry (n = 165) and 6 (n = 124) and 12 (n = 89) mo after the program.
 RESULTS: Improvement was noted at 6 mo for most self-care behaviors and glycemic control.
 At 12 mo, lower glycosylated hemoglobin levels were maintained (P less than 0.001) without increases in perceived hypoglycemia.
 Improvement was not maintained for those self-care behaviors that require change in life-style, i.e., diet and exercise.
 However, self-care behaviors that allow patients to self-regulate their glycemic control--self-monitoring of blood glucose and insulin dose self-adjustment--were improved at 12 mo over preprogram levels (P less than 0.001).
 Frequency of insulin self-adjustment continued to increase during the period between follow-ups.
 CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that diabetes education is effective in promoting self-regulation behaviors, although it has less effect on traditional regimen behaviors such as diet and exercise.
