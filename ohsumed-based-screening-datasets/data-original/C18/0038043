Increased prevalence of hereditary metabolic diseases among native Indians in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario.
 OBJECTIVE: To compare the prevalence of hereditary metabolic diseases in the native and non-native populations of Manitoba and northwestern Ontario.
 DESIGN: Retrospective analysis.
 SETTING: Children's Hospital, Winnipeg.
 PATIENTS: Patients were selected by three methods: laboratory tests designed to screen patients suspected of having a metabolic disease, laboratory investigation of newborn infants with abnormalities detected through screening, and investigation of near relatives of probands with disease.
 RESULTS: A total of 138 patients with organic acid, amino acid and carbohydrate disorders were seen from 1960 to 1990.
 Of these, 49 (36%) were native Indians (Algonkian linguistic group).
 This was in sharp contrast to the proportion of native Indians in the total study population (5.8%).
 Congenital lactic acidosis due to pyruvate carboxylase deficiency (13 patients), glutaric aciduria type I (14 patients) and primary hyperoxaluria type II (8 patients) were the most common disorders detected.
 Other rare disorders included glutaric aciduria type II (one patient), 2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria (one patient) and sarcosinemia (one patient).
 Underreporting, especially of glutaric aciduria type I and hyperoxaluria type II, was likely in the native population.
 CONCLUSIONS: Hereditary metabolic diseases are greatly overrepresented in the native population of Manitoba and northwestern Ontario.
 We recommend that native children who present with illnesses involving disturbances of acid-base balance or with neurologic, renal or liver disease of unknown cause by investigated for a possible metabolic disorder.
