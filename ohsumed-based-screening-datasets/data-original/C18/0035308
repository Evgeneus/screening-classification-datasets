Functional, biochemical, and histopathologic consequences of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in rats.
 A variety of side effects have been reported with the use of interleukin-2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells in patients with disseminated neoplasms.
 The present study was undertaken to determine the effects of high-dose interleukin-2 administration in normal rats.
 Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with intravenous recombinant interleukin-2 (900,000 IU/kg/day) for 9 consecutive days.
 Animals were placed in individual metabolic cages, and arterial blood pressure, food intake, body weight, and urine output were monitored.
 On day 10, animals were killed by exsanguination, various tissues were harvested, and a variety of hematologic and chemical assays were performed.
 The results were compared with those of placebo-injected normal control and pair-fed groups.
 The interleukin-2-treated group exhibited anorexia, weight loss, hypotension, anemia, leukocytosis, lymphocytosis, eosinophilia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, and a marked urinary concentration defect.
 Histologic examination of various tissues revealed widespread infiltration with mono-nuclear cells and eosinophils in most organs, especially in the lungs and liver of interleukin-2-treated animals.
 Other abnormalities included severe panlobular hepatitis, hepatocellular necrosis, and thymic involution.
 Renal involvement was mild and consisted of focal interstitial infiltration by mononuclear cells.
 According to these observations, administration of high-dose interleukin-2 in normal rats results in a score of significant functional, biochemical, and histologic abnormalities.
