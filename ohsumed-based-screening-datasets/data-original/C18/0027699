Insulin action and metabolism in patients with head and neck cancer.
 Cachexia is a phenomenon commonly observed in patients with cancer, but its etiology is poorly understood.
 Abnormalities of insulin action and metabolism that have been hypothesized to promote cancer cachexia were investigated in this study using a computerized euglycemic clamp and modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) in a group of malnourished patients with localized head and neck cancer, and in healthy, well-nourished, age- and, sex-matched controls.
 Glucose disposal rates, determined by the euglycemic clamp at three different rates of insulin infusion did not differ significantly between the two groups.
 However, mean plasma insulin concentrations at each level of insulin infused were significantly lower in the patients with cancer than in the control subjects resulting in unexpectedly higher calculated insulin metabolic clearance rate in the patients with cancer.
 Peripheral insulin sensitivity calculated from the slope of glucose disposal versus plasma insulin concentration did not differ between the two groups.
 Results from the FSIGT demonstrated no difference in insulin sensitivity or insulin-independent glucose disappearance between the two groups.
 However, whole body glucose appearance was significantly elevated in the patients with cancer.
 Thus, increased whole body glucose utilization in the absence of insulin resistance or increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal was observed.
 These data are consistent with the concept of a localized tumor acting as a glucose drain in which case increased glucose appearance and increased insulin clearance would defend against hypoglycemia.
