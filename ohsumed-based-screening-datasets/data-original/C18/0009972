Unresectable calcified bladder tumor: hemiacidrin irrigation as an adjunct to resection.
 Radiographic calcification of urothelial malignancies is an uncommon finding.
 To our knowledge, calcification of transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder preventing transurethral resection has not been reported previously.
 We report a case of an initially unresectable radiopaque bladder tumor and discuss the successful, conservative management with continuous bladder irrigation with hemiacidrin followed by complete transurethral resection.
