Chronic sialadenitis with psammoma bodies mimicking neoplasia in a fine-needle aspiration specimen from the submandibular gland.
 A 65-year-old woman with a submandibular gland nodule had a fine-needle aspiration specimen that contained groups of duct-type cells and a psammoma body, suggestive of adenocarcinoma.
 The resected gland showed chronic sialadenitis with sialolithiasis and psammoma bodies.
 In a series of 81 resected nonneoplastic submandibular glands from 72 patients, psammoma bodies, nonlaminated microcalcifications, or both were found in 46 (57%).
 They were located most commonly just outside of striated or intercalated ducts.
 When examining fine-needle aspiration specimens from the submandibular gland, it is important that one be aware that psammoma bodies may occur in normal, inflamed, irradiated, and neoplastic conditions.
