Lovastatin therapy in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemic patients: effect on blood rheology and fibrinogen levels.
 Thirteen heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemic patients were treated with lovastatin for 1 year, and were investigated for the effect on lipid profile, blood rheology and fibrinogen levels.
 A significant dose-dependent reduction in serum levels of total and LDL-cholesterol, Apo B and the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol was noted.
 Improvement in red blood cell filterability and an increase in fibrinogen levels were also observed.
 We conclude that the hypocholesterolaemic effect of lovastatin in familial hypercholesterolaemia is accompanied by changes in blood rheology.
 While some of these haemorheological changes may be considered beneficial, others may be regarded as unfavourable.
 The net effect of lovastatin therapy on the coronary risk of familial hypercholesterolaemic patients warrants further investigation.
