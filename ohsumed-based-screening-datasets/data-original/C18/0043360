A mutation in the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor associated with insulin resistance in an obese woman.
 Insulin resistance is frequently associated with acanthosis nigricans and hyperandrogenism.
 In patients with type A insulin resistance, this has been shown to be due to genetic defects in insulin receptor function.
 However, other patients with a similar clinical syndrome have been reported to have a variant of this syndrome, in which assays of insulin receptor function were normal.
 We have sequenced a portion of the insulin receptor gene in one such patient, a 29-yr-old woman with obesity and insulin resistance.
 The patient is heterozygous for a mutation substituting isoleucine for methionine at position 1153.
 Met1153 is located in the intracellular domain of the receptor near the cluster of tyrosine phosphorylation sites at positions 1158, 1162, and 1163.
 Studies of the mutant receptor expressed in NIH-3T3 cells demonstrated that the Ile1153-mutation impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate autophosphorylation of solubilized insulin receptors.
 In addition, the mutation impairs the ability of insulin to stimulate receptor tyrosine kinase activity to phosphorylate an artificial substrate [poly(Glu-Tyr)].
 It seems likely that this defect in receptor tyrosine kinase activity explains the defect in the ability of the patient's insulin receptors to mediate insulin action in vivo.
 Furthermore, this patient provides a paradigm in which genetic factors act in concert with other risk factors, such as obesity, to cause clinically important insulin resistance.
