Growth in adulthood after liver transplantation for glycogen storage disease type I.
 Continuation of linear growth late into the third decade of life is rarely observed.
 This report describes a 27-year-old man with delayed growth and sexual maturation secondary to glycogen storage disease type I who grew 5.3 cm after orthotopic liver transplantation.
 Sequential improvement in selected measures of metabolic control (blood glucose, lactate, and bicarbonate concentrations) and growth-promoting peptides (testosterone and insulinlike growth factor I) were documented after transplantation and before the increase in height.
 Potential increases in final stature may be present in adult patients with underlying metabolic disease and delayed skeletal maturation.
