Introduction: obesity: diet composition, energy expenditure, and treatment of the obese patient.
 The association of obesity with increased risks for developing hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer has made it a complex health problem.
 Exacerbating the problem is the realization that there are multiple factors, both physiological and psychological, that interact to induce obesity, as well as a myriad of components that may be useful in the curtailment of obesity.
 The aim of this symposium is to provide a wider understanding of the elements behind the development and reduction of obesity.
