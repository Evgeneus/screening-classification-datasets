Posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation in eyes with inactive and active proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
 We reviewed the records of 2,100 consecutive eyes that had undergone extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation between January 1981 and December 1989.
 Of these eyes, 21 had inactive and four had active proliferative diabetic retinopathy at the time of cataract extraction.
 Twenty-one eyes with inactive proliferative diabetic retinopathy received extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation, and four eyes with active proliferative diabetic retinopathy had both extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and pars plana vitrectomy with endophotocoagulation.
 The mean follow-up period was 27 months.
 Final visual acuity was 20/40 or better in 12 of 25 eyes (48%).
 Of 25 eyes, five (20%) showed progression of the retinopathy after the operation, and two (8%) developed macular edema.
 Extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was well tolerated in most eyes.
