An evaluation of long-term glycemic control in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: the relevance of glycated hemoglobin.
 Thirty-six patients were admitted to an open study designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy of gliclazide in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.
 Results from 27 of these patients were analyzed at 36 months, 21 at 48 months, and 16 at 60 months of follow-up.
 An overall reduction in fasting and postprandial blood sugar was observed (p less than 0.001).
 Total glycated hemoglobin (HbA1) fell significantly (p less than 0.001), to revert to values within the reference range in over 80% of cases.
 Body weight remained stable over a period of observation ranging from 36 to 60 months.
 The incidence of subsequent failure of oral treatment was 2% per annum.
 These results show that long-term treatment of type II diabetes with gliclazide leads to satisfactory results, with practically no side effects.
