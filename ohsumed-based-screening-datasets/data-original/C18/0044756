Magnetic-resonance imaging used for determining fat distribution in obesity and diabetes.
 Computed-tomography scanning and magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) have been used to quantify intraabdominal and subcutaneous fat depots.
 In this study MRI was used to define fat-distribution patterns in 24 obese females with non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) and 12 females with simple obesity.
 Subjects had anthropometric measurements and single-slice abdominal scans performed at the umbilicus.
 In addition, in 10 of the nondiabetic females, measurements were repeated after 10 wk of a very-low-calorie diet.
 Nondiabetic females had significantly less intraabdominal fat (P less than 0.01) than did the diabetics but had equivalent subcutaneous fat.
 There was no significant relationship between waist-to-hip ratio and intraabdominal fat, subcutaneous fat, or their ratio.
 After a weight loss of 10.6 +/- 3.8 kg there were significant decreases in both intraabdominal and subcutaneous fat (P less than 0.01).
 Weight loss is associated with decreases in fat in both depots.
