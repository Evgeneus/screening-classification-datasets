Amino acids in surgical nutrition. Principles and practice.
 Amino acids will always be an integral part of nutritional support in all patients.
 The use of specific amino acids in pharmacologic doses may be beneficial to certain critically ill patients, indicating that such compounds are conditionally essential.
 As our knowledge of the altered regulation of amino acid metabolism in surgical patients improves, the design of more effective feeding regimens will follow.
 The goal should be to provide the best nutrition to all patients at all times.
