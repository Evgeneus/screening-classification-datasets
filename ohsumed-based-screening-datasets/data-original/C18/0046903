Increased apo A-I and apo A-II fractional catabolic rate in patients with low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels with or without hypertriglyceridemia.
 Low HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels may elevate atherosclerosis risk, and often associate with hypertriglyceridemia (HTG); however, the metabolic causes of low HDL-C levels with or without HTG are poorly understood.
 We studied the turnover of radioiodinated HDL apolipoproteins, apo A-I and apo A-II, in 15 human subjects with low HDL-C, six with normal plasma TG levels (group 1) and nine with high TG (group 2), and compared them to 13 control subjects with normal HDL-C and TG levels (group 3).
 The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was equally elevated in groups 1 and 2 vs.
 group 3 for both apo A-I (0.313 +/- 0.052 and 0.323 +/- 0.063 vs.
 0.245 +/- 0.043 pools/d, P = 0.003) and apo A-II (0.213 +/- 0.036 and 0.239 +/- 0.037 vs.
 0.185 +/- 0.031 pools/d, P = 0.006).
 Thus, high FCR characterized low HDL-C regardless of the presence or absence of HTG.
 In contrast, transport rate (TR) of apo A-I did not differ significantly among the groups and the apo A-II TR differed only between groups 2 and 3 (2.15 +/- 0.57, 2.50 +/- 0.39, and 1.83 +/- 0.48 mg/kg per d for groups 1 to 3, respectively, P = 0.016).
 Several HDL-related factors were similar in groups 1 and 2 but differed in group 3, as with FCR, including the ratio of lipoprotein lipase to hepatic lipase activity (LPL/HL) in post-heparin plasma, the ratio of the HDL-C to apo A-I plus apo A-II levels, and the percent of tracer in the d greater than 1.21 fraction.
 In linear regression analysis HDL-C levels correlated inversely with the FCR of apo A-I and apo A-II (r = -0.74, P less than 0.0001 for both).
 Major correlates of FCR were HDL-C/apo A-I + apo A-II, LPL/HL, and plasma TG levels.
 We hypothesize that lipase activity and plasma TG affect HDL composition which modulates FCR, which in turn regulates HDL-C.
 Thus, HTG is only one of several factors which may contribute to elevated FCR and low HDL-C.
 Given the relationship of altered HDL composition with high FCR and low HDL-C levels, factors affecting HDL composition may increase atherosclerosis susceptibility.
