Reproducibility of glucose and insulin responses to mixed meal in type II diabetic patients.
 OBJECTIVE: The reproducibility of glucose and insulin responses to a mixed meal were studied in 24 consecutive non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetic patients, the diet of which matched the tested diet.
 Patients received their usual treatment throughout the study.
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A standardized diet was followed for 3 days, and responses were measured on the 2nd and 3rd days.
 Glucose and insulin responses were studied after lunches with the 180-min positive area under the curve, and were analyzed with paired t test and Pearson's linear regression.
 RESULTS: Glucose responses did not vary (217 +/- 50 vs.
 217 +/- 38 min x mM, NS) and were significantly correlated (r = 0.64, P less than 0.01).
 Insulin responses did not vary (35,224 +/- 5768 vs.
 35,305 +/- 7779 min x pM, NS) and were strongly correlated (r = 0.83, P less than 0.001).
 CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that glucose and insulin responses to a test meal are reproducible in type II diabetic patients.
