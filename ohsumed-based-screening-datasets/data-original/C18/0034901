Serum glucose after intraperitoneal infusion of 5% dextrose solution.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the use of intraperitoneal (IP) glucose infusion as a therapy for hypoglycemia.
 DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design, with each animal serving as its own control.
 SETTING: Laboratory investigation.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Seven female New Zealand White rabbits with a mean weight of 3.7 kg.
 INTERVENTIONS: Each animal was subjected to three experiments separated by a four-day period.
 After baseline measurements, the following interventions were undertaken: Control day, no treatment; placebo day, 10 mL/kg 0.9% normal saline solution IP; and treatment day, 10 mL/kg 5% dextrose solution IP.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Serial serum glucose levels were obtained.
 Compared with control and placebo, the mean absolute serum glucose value of the treatment group was significantly higher beginning at ten minutes after intervention and continuing until conclusion of the study at 30 minutes.
 For these time points, the mean increase in serum glucose levels (percent change) of the treatment group compared with the control group was as follows: ten minutes, 15.5 mg/dL (0.86 mmol/L) (11%), P less than .01; 15 minutes, 20.6 mg/dL (1.14 mmol/L) (14%), P less than .01; 20 minutes, 36.5 mg/dL (2.03 mmol/L) (26%), P less than .001; and 30 minutes, 34.7 mg/dL (1.93 mmol/L) (24%), P less than .001.
 CONCLUSION: Glucose instilled into the peritoneal cavity of rabbits is absorbed rapidly into the systemic circulation.
