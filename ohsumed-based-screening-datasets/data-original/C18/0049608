Energy expenditure and substrate utilization in the course of renutrition of malnourished children.
 Energy expenditure (EE) and substrate utilization in the course of renutrition of malnourished children is not well understood in children receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
 The aim of this study was to evaluate, during protein-glucose renutrition, EE and substrate utilization and the relationship between EE and growth and/or protein metabolism.
 Seven malnourished children were studied during the first 3 weeks of TPN.
 Weight-for-height = 81.4 +/- 8.0%, with an initial weight of 4.5 +/- 3.3 kg.
 Caloric support was progressively increased according to a preestablished protocol.
 Every 7 days the following were determined: (1) EE at 3 different 3-hour intervals per day using an open circuit indirect calorimetric system, (2) anthropometrically defined fat free mass (FFM), and (3) 24-hour urinary 3-methylhistidine (3-M-His) and protein balance.
 Compared to initial values, EE increased 13% at day 7 and 36% at day 14.
 A negative relationship was found between the amount of perfused glucose and lipid utilization (r = -0.82; p less than 0.0001).
 EE per kilogram of total body FFM changes during renutrition were more than EE changes per kilogram of total body weight.
 There was a relationship between EE and weight gain (r = 0.62; p less than 0.005) and a positive relationship between EE and protein gain (r = 0.48; p = 0.012) and 3-M-His excretion (r = 0.51; p less than 0.026).
