Hypercalcemia in infants presenting with apnea.
 To our knowledge apnea in infants has not been associated with hypercalcemia.
 We describe seven hypercalcemic infants aged 2 days to 3 months who had presented with apnea; six of the seven were otherwise healthy.
 The apneic attacks were brief, and normal breathing was restored spontaneously or after tactile stimulation.
 The attacks stopped and the apnea monitoring was discontinued when the children were 1 month to 2 years of age.
 The only abnormal finding common to all of the patients was hypercalcemia.
 Idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia was diagnosed in six of the patients and familial benign hypercalcemia in one.
 Our findings suggest that determination of the plasma calcium level be included in the investigation of apnea in infancy.
