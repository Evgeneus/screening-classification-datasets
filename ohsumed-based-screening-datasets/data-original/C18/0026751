Changes in lipoprotein concentrations during the development of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in obese rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta).
 Abnormalities in plasma lipoprotein concentrations commonly found in subjects with noninsulin-dependent diabetes may be related to insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia, or other metabolic defects.
 The middle-aged obese rhesus monkey is an animal model in which these defects can be separated in time during the development of diabetes.
 It is, therefore, a model system for examining the sequence of metabolic changes which occur before and after the onset of diabetes.
 This sequence of changes was used in the present study to determine if lipoprotein changes occur in association with the development of diabetes in the rhesus monkey.
 Increases in plasma triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglyceride, and VLDL cholesterol, and decreases in high density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed across previously identified groups ranging from normal to diabetic.
 Plasma triglycerides increased from 0.54 +/- 0.09 (normal) to 1.27 +/- 0.50, 1.93 +/- 0.79, and 4.28 +/- 2.24 in three intermediate groups with progressive hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, to 7.59 +/- 2.73 mmol/L in the diabetic monkeys.
 Increases in VLDL triglyceride and VLDL cholesterol paralleled the plasma triglyceride increases.
 High density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased across the groups from 2.33 +/- 0.16 (normal) to 1.72 +/- 0.20, 1.17 +/- 0.13, and 1.09 +/- 0.20 mmol/L in the intermediate groups, and was lowest in the diabetic monkeys, 1.00 +/- 0.21.
 The obese rhesus monkey can therefore be used to study lipoprotein abnormalities as they occur both before and in noninsulin-dependent diabetes.
