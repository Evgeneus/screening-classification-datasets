Dietary treatment for familial hypercholesterolemia--differential effects of dietary soy protein according to the apolipoprotein E phenotypes.
 Familial hypercholesterolemia, one form of type IIa hyperlipidemia, usually responds poorly to standard low-lipid diets.
 To define the responsiveness to a soy-protein diet in this disease, one homozygous and twenty heterozygous type IIa patients were submitted to a 4-wk traditional hypocholesterolemic diet followed by 4 wk in which animal protein was substituted with texturized soy protein.
 Soy was then withdrawn for a further 4 wk.
 No significant changes in plasma lipids were observed during low-lipid diets.
 The soy diet, however, caused a marked decrease in total (-20.8%) and low-density-lipoprotein (-25.8%) cholesterol and in apolipoprotein B (-14.1%).
 The plasma cholesterol reduction was higher in patients with apolipoprotein E3/E3 or E3/E4 vs an almost negligible effect on E3/E2.
 These results confirm that soy-protein diets can lower cholesterol in type IIa patients with familial disease.
 Data on the sensitivity of patients with different apo-E isoforms agree with recent hypotheses suggesting that soy proteins may activate B,E receptors.
