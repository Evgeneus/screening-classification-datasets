Rhabdomyolysis following total hip arthroplasty.
 We report six cases of contralateral limb involvement during total hip arthroplasty including swelling of the gluteal muscle compartments, rhabdomyolysis, myoglobinuria, and sciatic nerve palsy.
 The risk factors for such complications include obesity, prolonged operative time, and positioning in the lateral decubitus position.
 The laboratory and clinical findings are consistent with a gluteal muscle crush-injury with consequent compartment syndrome.
 The patients should be treated conservatively as symptoms can be expected to resolve.
