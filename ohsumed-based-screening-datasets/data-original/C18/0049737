Effects of sulfonylureas on adipocyte and skeletal muscle insulin action in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 The effect of glibenclamide treatment on insulin action in isolated fat cells was studied in eight moderately obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM).
 Insulin receptor binding and the effect of insulin on glucose transport and lipogenesis were determined before and after 3 months of glibenclamide therapy.
 At the end of the treatment period, mean daytime plasma glucose concentrations were reduced (10.8 +/- 0.4 versus 7.0 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, p less than 0.001) whereas mean daytime plasma insulin level was increased (40 +/- 12 versus 71 +/- 9 mU/L, p less than 0.001).
 Adipocyte insulin receptor binding as well as basal glucose transport and metabolism were unaffected by drug treatment.
 In contrast, insulin-stimulated glucose transport and lipogenesis were both significantly enhanced (p less than 0.05).
 These findings are comparable to those of another study involving seven moderately obese subjects with NIDDM who had biopsies of the lateral vastus muscle taken for measurement of insulin receptor function and glycogen synthase activity before and during 2 months of gliclazide treatment.
 In that study insulin receptors purified with wheatgerm agglutinin showed unchanged insulin binding and receptor kinase activity.
 Moreover, gliclazide had no impact on maximal glycogen synthase activity.
 However, under physiologic hyperinsulinemic conditions gliclazide therapy was associated with an increased sensitivity of glycogen synthase for its allosteric activation by glucose-6-phosphatase (p less than 0.04).
 In conclusion, sulfonylurea treatment of NIDDM enhances insulin-stimulated peripheral glucose utilization in part through a potentiation of insulin action on adipose tissue glucose transport and lipogenesis and skeletal muscle glycogen synthase.
