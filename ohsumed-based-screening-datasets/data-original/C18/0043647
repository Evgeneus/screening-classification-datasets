Inherited protein C deficiency and nonhemorrhagic arterial stroke in young adults.
 Out of a consecutive series of 50 young people less than 45 years old with nonhemorrhagic arterial stroke, three patients had inherited protein C deficiency.
 CT revealed hypodense areas consistent with the clinical picture, and angiography showed occlusion of some intracranial arterial vessels.
 Other possible associated causes of stroke were ruled out.
 One patient had a transient ischemic attack and a peripheral venous thrombosis prior to the actual stroke, whereas the others were completely asymptomatic, as were relatives with the same deficiency.
 We suggest determining protein C in ischemic stroke of all young adults, especially when major risk factors are excluded.
