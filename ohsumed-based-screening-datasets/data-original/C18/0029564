Changes in abdominal and gluteal adipose-tissue fatty acid compositions in obese subjects after weight gain and weight loss.
 The fatty acid compositions of abdominal and gluteal subcutaneous adipose tissues of eight obese subjects were measured after an initial 5-10-wk period of weight maintenance on a liquid-formula diet (40% of calories as corn oil, 45% as carbohydrate, and 15% as protein), after a 10% increase in weight (11-20 kg) on a solid-food diet of each subject's choice (n = 5) or after a 20% decrease in weight (26-37 kg) on 800 kcal/d of the same corn-oil-formula diet (n = 5).
 After weight gain or weight loss, all subjects maintained their new weights for 2-10 wk on the same corn-oil-formula diet.
 As hypothesized, there were minimal changes in the concentrations of 41 fatty acids identified in both abdominal and gluteal tissues after all dietary phases, and small site-specific differences in the levels of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids were not altered.
 The largest change was a 15% decrease (P less than 0.05) in 18:3n-3 in both abdominal and gluteal tissues during weight loss, despite higher levels in the diet than in the baseline adipose tissue.
 This decrease occurred without coexisting decreases in 22:5n-3 and 22:6n-3, two elongase-desaturase products of 18:3n-3 that were not detectable in the diet.
