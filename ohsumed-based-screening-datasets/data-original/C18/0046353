Automatic end-expiratory air sampling device for breath hydrogen test in infants.
 An automatic electronically operated end-expiratory air sampler has been developed for use in small infants.
 Upon expiration, which is detected by a hot-wire sensor, a small portion of the end-expiratory air is automatically collected into a syringe mounted on a syringe driver.
 The sampler obtained 87% of the end-expiratory air sample.
 Additionally, highly reproducible and consistent results were obtained for the respiratory gases (O2, N2, CO2).
 The sampler has been applied for studying breath hydrogen excretion to detect lactose malabsorption.
 It may also be applicable to study other expiratory gases in infants.
