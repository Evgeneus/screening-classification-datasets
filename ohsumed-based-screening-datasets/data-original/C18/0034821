Complementation and maternal effect in insulin-dependent diabetes.
 The marker association segregation chi-square (MASC) method was applied to a sample of 416 Caucasians affected with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), for which information on the parental and sibship status was available, as well as HLA typing.
 We show that the model which best explains all the observations assumes a cis or trans complementation of two tightly linked genes within the HLA region, an additional maternal effect, and other familial factors.
 The HLA molecule corresponding to the complementation of Arg52(+) and Asp57(-) has been recently proposed as explaining susceptibility to IDDM.
 However, this hypothesis does not account for the overall observations made on the HLA marker in IDDM patients and their relatives.
 The MASC method may also be applied to evaluate the risk for relatives of an affected individual (the "index").
 For example, the risk for a sib depends not only on the parental status and on the number of HLA haplotypes he shares with the index, but also on which haplotype the index himself inherited from his mother and father.
