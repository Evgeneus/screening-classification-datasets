Screening for haemochromatosis: prevalence among Danish blood donors.
 Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease that is genetically expressed by excessive accumulation of iron in the tissues, resulting in cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, cardiomyopathy and hypogonadism.
 As the disease may be diagnosed before the appearance of symptoms, and prevented by repeated phlebotomies, there are strong implications for adoption of a screening procedure.
 Determinations of transferrin saturation (TS) and serum ferritin concentration (SF) were used to screen 4302 blood donors, who were selected for follow-up studies if they fulfilled any of the following three criteria: (i) TS greater than or equal to 0.7; (ii) TS greater than or equal to 0.5 together with SF greater than or equal to 150 micrograms l-1; (iii) SF greater than or equal to 300 micrograms l-1.
 A total of 58 subjects who fulfilled at least one of these criteria were reinvestigated, after which 18 individuals still fulfilled at least one criterion.
 Fifteen subjects having SF greater than or equal to 300 micrograms l-1 were offered liver biopsy and thirteen of these accepted.
 In one individual, no stainable iron was detected, and two subjects did not fulfil the previously established diagnostic criteria for the diagnosis of hereditary haemochromatosis.
 Ten subjects who had a high TS and liver iron grade 2-4 according to Bassett were classified accordingly as homozygotes.
 On the basis of these results, the prevalence of haemochromatosis in Denmark was estimated to be 0.0037-0.0046.
