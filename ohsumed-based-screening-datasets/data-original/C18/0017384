Juvenile intervertebral disc calcification: recognition, management, and pathogenesis.
 Juvenile intervertebral disc calcification is an uncommon disorder of childhood, characterized by calcification of the nucleus pulposus of one or more intervertebral discs.
 Calcification may remain dormant or subsequently become symptomatic.
 The symptoms include fever, malaise, and neck pain and are associated with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and, occasionally, leukocytosis.
 Although disc protrusion occurs in 38% of patients, neurological signs are distinctly uncommon.
 We report the case of a patient with a herniated T2-T3 calcified intervertebral disc and compressive myelopathy.
 Juvenile intervertebral disc calcification is generally a self-limiting disease that seldom requires an operation.
 The symptoms are transient, and resorption of the disc calcification is the rule once symptoms occur.
 Neither the cause of the disc calcification nor the trigger for the onset of symptoms is known.
 An inflammatory response within the disc appears to give rise to clinical symptoms and is associated with eventual resorption of the disc calcification.
