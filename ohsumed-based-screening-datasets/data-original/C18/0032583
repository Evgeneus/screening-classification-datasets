Chick nutritional encephalomalacia and prostanoid formation.
 Nutritional encephalomalacia (NE) was induced in young chicks using a diet low in vitamin E and containing 8% ethyl esters derived from safflower oil fatty acids (S-E group).
 The same diet with added alpha-tocopheryl acetate (S+E) failed to produce the pathology, and chicks receiving aerated linseed oil--high in alpha-linolenic acid and low in alpha-tocopherol (L-E)--did not develop symptoms.
 Formation of metabolites from labeled arachidonic acid (AA) by thrombocytes was similar in the S+E and S-E groups, yielding thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and hydroxy fatty acids as the major products.
 Collagen-induced thrombocyte aggregation and TXB2 production were not significantly different in the S-E and S+E groups, but aggregation values and TXB2 synthesis were significantly less in the L-E group than in the ataxic S-E chicks.
 Prostaglandin E2 production by aortal rings was significantly influenced by the diet; S-E yielded the highest value and L-E the lowest.
 These results show that alpha-linolenic acid causes alterations in the AA metabolism and thrombocyte function in young chicks.
