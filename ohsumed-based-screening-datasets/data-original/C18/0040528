Changes in lipids and lipoproteins with long-term estrogen deficiency and hormone replacement therapy.
 Cross-sectional data of the long-term effects of estrogens, androgens, and progestogens on lipids and lipoproteins were obtained in 556 postmenopausal women aged 24 to 85 years with follow-up for 1 to 44 years.
 Baseline values were obtained in 155 women from less than 1 year up to 30 years after menopause.
 Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol tended to rise during the early postmenopausal years while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not change.
 Triglycerides were related to weight and were significantly different only between untreated women of normal weight (128.3 +/- 7.80 mg/dl) and hormone users weighing greater than 200 pounds (252.9 +/- 9.44 mg/dl), p less than or equal to 0.001.
 Although mean high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was lower with both C-21 progestogens (64.5 +/- 4.16 mg/dl) and C-19 progestogens (61.9 +/- 3.84 mg/dl), there were no statistically significant differences on comparison with levels in the unopposed estrogen users (67.0 +/- 3.94 mg/dl).
 Smoking significantly depressed high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both hormone users (p less than or equal to 0.001) and untreated women (p less than or equal to 0.001).
 Added progestogens do not adversely affect lipids and lipoproteins over the long term when adequate dosages of estrogens are used.
