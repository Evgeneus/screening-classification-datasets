A defect in insulin release in women at risk of future non-insulin-dependent diabetes.
 1.
 A study on seven Caucasian glucose-tolerant women with previous gestational diabetes and seven matched control subjects is presented.
 The insulin response to oral glucose, insulin sensitivity and fasting glucose production rates were measured by using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test, an insulin tolerance test and a non-radioactive tracer, [6,6-2H]glucose, respectively.
 2.
 Fasting plasma glucose levels were similar between the women with previous gestational diabetes and the control subjects (4.8 +/- 0.3 versus 4.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/l), as were fasting plasma insulin levels (median 4 m-units/l, range 1-13 m-units/l versus median 4 m-units/l, range 1-24 m-units/l).
 After oral glucose the 60 min plasma glucose levels in the women with previous gestational diabetes were significantly higher (8.5 +/- 0.6 versus 6.7 +/- 0.8 mmol/l, P less than 0.05), whereas the plasma insulin level was significantly lower at both 30 min (median 23 m-units/l, range 4-47 m-units/l versus median 55 m-units/l, range 23-100 m-units/l, P less than 0.02) and at 60 min (median 23 m-units/l, range 4-43 m-units/l versus median 60 m-units/l, range 16-126 m-units/l, P less than 0.02).
 3.
 Insulin sensitivity, expressed as the slope of the regression line of plasma glucose level against time after intravenous infusion of insulin (0.05 unit/kg), was similar in the women with previous gestational diabetes and the control subjects (mean slope, -0.17 +/- 0.01 versus -0.17 +/- 0.01).
 4.
 Fasting glucose production rates were similar in the women with previous gestational diabetes and the control subjects (2.2 +/- 0.3 versus 1.9 +/- 0.1 mg min-1 kg-1).
