Nutritional assessment and indications for nutritional support.
 The goal of nutritional assessment is to identify prospectively all those patients who would develop a nutrition-related complication.
 In practical terms, there is no single test capable of achieving this goal.
 At present, the best method of nutritional assessment is an organized step-by-step multifactorial approach.
 This involves assessment of the primary illness, the patient history, and the prognosis.
 A nutritional status examination is done, and the current intake is compared with the nutritional goals.
 A decision is then made whether to force feed.
 If forced feeding is initiated, the effectiveness of the therapy must be monitored frequently until the patient recovers and is able to be sustained by volitional oral intake.
