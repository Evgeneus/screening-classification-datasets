Relationship between blood pressure and urinary albumin excretion in development of microalbuminuria.
 Two hundred nine consecutive normotensive insulin-dependent diabetic (IDDM) patients were followed prospectively from November 1982 to January 1988.
 Patient urinary albumin excretion rate (UAE) had to be normal (less than 30 mg/24 h) on at least two occasions before inclusion in the study.
 Patients were aged 18-50 yr with a duration of diabetes of 10-30 yr.
 UAE was measured every 4 mo, and supine blood pressure was measured annually.
 Two hundred five patients completed the study.
 Five years later, 15 patients had developed persistent microalbuminuria with median UAE greater than 30 mg/24 h for at least 2 yr (group 2), and 190 patients stayed normoalbuminuric (group 1).
 Although within normal range, initial UAE was significantly elevated in group 2 compared with group 1 (mean 19 mg/24 h [range 15-23 mg/24 h] vs.
 11 mg/24 h [10-12], 95% confidence interval [CI], P less than 0.001).
 Initially, there was no difference in blood pressure between group 2 (mean systolic 122 mmHg [117-127], diastolic 80 mmHg [76-84]) and group 1 (mean 126 mmHg [124-128], 79 mmHg [78-80], 95% CI), and a significant increase in diastolic blood pressure could first be detected during the 3rd yr of persistent microalbuminuria (mean systolic 132 mmHg [124-140], diastolic 85 mmHg [81-89] vs.
 128 mmHg [126-130], 79 mmHg [78-80], P less than 0.05).
 Initial hemoglobin A1c was significantly elevated in group 2 compared with group 1 (9.6% [8.8-10.4] vs.
 8.5% [8.3-8.7], P less than 0.01).
