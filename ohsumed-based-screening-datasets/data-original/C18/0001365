Trigger finger in young patients with insulin dependent diabetes.
 Two-hundred-and-fifty patients with juvenile diabetes mellitus aged 3-38 years, were examined for trigger finger.
 Thirteen patients (5%) were found to have trigger finger--10 women and 3 men aged 14-38 years (mean 26 years).
 The ring, middle fingers, and thumb were the most affected.
 Two patients had bilateral trigger finger.
 There was a significant correlation between duration of diabetes and trigger finger (p less than 0.001) but no correlation with the control of diabetes.
 Our work indicates for the first time the prevalence of trigger finger in young patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
