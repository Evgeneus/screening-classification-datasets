Effect of blood glucose level in acute cerebral ischemia in spontaneously hypertensive rats--survival and brain pathology.
 The present study was designed to examine the effect of blood glucose level on survival and pathologic changes of the cortical neuronal cells during and after three-hour incomplete cerebral ischemia, which was induced by bilateral carotid artery ligation in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs).
 Blood glucose levels were varied by intraperitoneal infusion of 50% glucose (hyperglycemia) or insulin with hypertonic saline (hypoglycemia) or hypertonic saline (normoglycemia).
 None of the hyperglycemic or normoglycemic animals died during three-hour ischemia, whereas 45% of hypoglycemic animals died (p greater than 0.001).
 The survival rate for twenty-four hours after recirculation was in the following ascending order: hypoglycemia, normoglycemia, and hyperglycemia.
 Neither hypoglycemia nor hyperglycemia (38-392 mg/dL) in nonischemic animals developed any morphologic changes in the cerebral cortex.
 However, both the ischemic and recirculated brains showed various degrees of histologic changes such as shrinkage of the neuronal cells with cytoplasmic vacuoles, perineuronal edema, and swelling of neuropils.
 Such ischemic damage of the brain was more marked in hypoglycemic animals than in hyperglycemic or normoglycemic ones during ischemia, as well as one hour after recirculation.
 The results suggest that cerebral ischemia and its outcome become more deleterious in hypoglycemic than in normoglycemic and hyperglycemic states.
 On the other hand, hyperglycemia is not necessarily a disadvantage in acute cerebral ischemia with or without reperfusion in this model.
