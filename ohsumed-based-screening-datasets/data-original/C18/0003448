Death at cardiac catheterization: coronary artery embolization of calcium debris from Ionescu-Shiley bioprosthesis.
 The case described is a death due to embolization of calcium debris from a bioprosthesis, dislodged at cardiac catheterization.
 As more bioprosthetic valves are implanted, and more of them fail long-term with calcification, such complications of the invasive study of these valves may be expected.
