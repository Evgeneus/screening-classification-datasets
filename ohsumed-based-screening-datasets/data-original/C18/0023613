Simultaneous development of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and alopecia areata universalis.
 Alopecia areata universalis developed gradually over nine months in a 25-year-old woman.
 When her scalp hairs were totally lost and other body hair began to fall out, the symptoms of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, an organ-specific autoimmune disease, developed rapidly and progressed to diabetic coma.
 Alopecia did not regress after the metabolic state improved following insulin therapy.
 Biopsy of the scalp skin revealed significant reduction of the total number of hair bulbs and prominent lymphocyte infiltration into the remaining hair follicles.
 Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and alopecia areata universalis are both thought to be related to the autoimmune mechanism and sometimes coexist.
 However, simultaneous development of these two disorders is extremely rare.
