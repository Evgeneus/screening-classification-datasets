Oral contraceptives in women with diabetes.
 We evaluated the association of oral contraceptive use with the presence and severity of diabetic retinopathy, hypertension, and glycosylated hemoglobin in women of childbearing age who have diabetes.
 Neither current or past use nor number of years of use of oral contraceptives was associated with severity of retinopathy, hypertension, or current glycosylated hemoglobin.
 In conclusion, further study of various birth control methods in young women of childbearing age should be considered.
