Calcium oxalate microcalcifications in the breast.
 Calcium oxalate calcifications can be difficult to detect with routine histologic procedures.
 In the reported case, microcalcifications that were evident with radiography of the specimen and of the paraffin blocks could not be detected with light microscopy.
 Polarized light microscopy, however, revealed the calcifications to be calcium oxalate crystals.
 Use of polarized light microscopy may resolve radiologic-pathologic discrepancies in such cases.
