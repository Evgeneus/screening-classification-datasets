Normal coding sequence of insulin gene in Pima Indians and Nauruans, two groups with highest prevalence of type II diabetes.
 The nucleotide sequence of the insulin gene was determined in American Pima Indians and Micronesian Nauruans, two populations in whom the prevalence of non-insulin-dependent (type II) diabetes mellitus is the highest in the world.
 The insulin gene was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction to generate single-stranded DNA suitable for direct sequencing.
 The nucleotide sequences of the coding and adjacent regions of the insulin gene in six Pima Indians and two Nauruans with type II diabetes were identical to previously published insulin gene sequences of nondiabetic subjects.
