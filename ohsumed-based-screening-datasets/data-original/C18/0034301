Controlled study of biofeedback-assisted relaxation in type I diabetes.
 OBJECTIVE: The effect of biofeedback-assisted relaxation was tested in a randomized trial in 18 adults with insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes.
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Pretreatment and posttreatment blood glucose values and insulin dosages in the group trained for 10 wk in biofeedback-assisted relaxation were compared with those in the untrained group.
 RESULTS: Significantly lower average blood glucose levels, percentage of fasting blood glucose levels at target, and percentage of glucose values greater than 11.2 mM were observed in the trained group at posttest compared with the untrained group.
 CONCLUSIONS: These differences could not be explained by increases in insulin.
 It is suggested that stress management be considered as an adjunct to the medical management of people with type I diabetes.
