New approaches to improve diabetes control 
 Knowledge about diabetes mellitus and its management has steadily increased since the discovery of insulin in 1921.
 Specific therapies for both type I and type II diabetes have resulted in greater normalization of plasma glucose levels.
 Information obtained from self-monitoring of blood glucose levels has given physicians a firmer base on which to make management decisions concerning the safe control of diabetes.
