Prevalence of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency in the Diourbel, Fatick, and Kaolack regions of Senegal: a controlled study.
 Two hundred and six Senegalese preschool children included in an epidemiological study were selected by their results from impression cytology with transfer (ICT) for assessment of their nutritional state by means of biological variables and for assessment of the diagnostic values of the ICT.
 A problem of protein-calorie malnutrition existed (transthyretin and retinol-binding protein concentrations were low) associated with vitamin A deficiency (retinol concentrations were low).
 The sensitivity and specificity of the ICT defined with respect to retinol (threshold fixed at 0.35 mumol/L) varied with the classification criteria of ICT and seemed to be fairly insensitive but specific.
