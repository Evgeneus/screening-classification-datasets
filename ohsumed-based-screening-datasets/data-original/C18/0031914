T-cell reactivity to 38 kD insulin-secretory-granule protein in patients with recent-onset type 1 diabetes.
 Type 1 diabetes seems to be an autoimmune disease in which T cells have a substantial role.
 A possible target antigen was suggested by the proliferation of CD4 T cells from a newly diagnosed patient in response to a 38 kD polypeptide of the insulin-secretory-granule membrane.
 To see whether this reactivity is widespread at disease onset, we have generated T-cell lines in vitro from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of nineteen children of caucasoid origin with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and sixteen healthy controls matched for age and HLA antigens.
 The procedure involved two cycles of incubation with a rat beta-cell tumour subcellular fraction enriched in secretory granules and plasma membrane components, followed by a proliferation assay.
 Fourteen (74% [95% confidence interval 49-91%]) of the patients' cell lines showed a positive proliferative response on subsequent exposure to the islet-cell antigen preparation compared with only two (13% [2-38%]) of the controls (p = 3 x 10(-4); difference 61% [44-87%]).
 Two subjects who had high titres of islet-cell autoantibodies (ICA) without clinical diabetes produced responsive T-cell lines.
 Reactivity towards the 38 kD fraction of insulin-secretory-granule membranes was found only in patients (eight of ten responders tested; 95% CI 44-98%) and one ICA-positive non-diabetic subject.
 Detection of an ongoing autoimmune T-cell response might be useful diagnostically and could lead to prevention of diabetes through specific immunotherapy.
