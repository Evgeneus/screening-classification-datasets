Growth hormone-dependent and -independent regulation of cytochrome P-450 isozyme expression in streptozotocin-diabetic rats.
 The sexually dimorphic GH secretory pattern is thought to be the major factor regulating constitutive expression of hepatic P450IIC11 (P-450h) and P450IIC12 (P-450i).
 In this study we investigated whether factors other than the diabetes-induced decrease in GH secretion contribute to alterations in P-450 isozyme expression in streptozotocin (STZ)-diabetic rats.
 In male rats, hepatic P-450h apoprotein and mRNA decreased to 13% and 24% of control male levels, respectively, within 14 days of STZ injection.
 STZ-diabetes had little effect on expression of P-450i in females.
 Treatment of diabetic male rats with GH did not reverse the suppression of P-450h.
 STZ treatment also suppressed P-450h expression in GH-treated hypophysectomized (Hx) male rats, but incompletely.
 Thus, GH can partially reverse diabetic suppression of P-450h.
 However, in Hx male rats without GH supplementation, STZ treatment suppressed P-450h apoprotein and mRNA expression to 16% and 6% of nondiabetic Hx male levels, respectively, demonstrating the existence of GH-independent regulation of P-450h expression.
 In Hx female rats, P-450h apoprotein levels were 40% of those in intact control males and were not significantly decreased by STZ.
 Concomitantly, STZ produced a greater decrease in serum insulin levels and a greater increase in serum glucagon in Hx male rats than in Hx females.
 The results provide evidence for the existence of STZ-sensitive GH-independent expression of P-450h and further document the gender differences in STZ sensitivity.
