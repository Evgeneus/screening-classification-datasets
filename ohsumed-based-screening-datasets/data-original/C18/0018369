Nutrition and bronchopulmonary dysplasia 
 Twenty two babies who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia were compared with 22 babies matched for gestational age who did not.
 Those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia weighed less at birth and had lower energy intakes from day 7 to day 56.
 Undernutrition before and after birth is a major problem in babies who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
