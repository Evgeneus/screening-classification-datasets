Carbohydrate metabolism during intense exercise when hyperglycemic.
 The effects of hyperglycemia on muscle glycogen use and carbohydrate metabolism were evaluated in eight well-trained cyclists (average maximal O2 consumption 4.5 +/- 0.1 l/min) during 2 h of exercise at 73 +/- 2% of maximal O2 consumption.
 During the control trial (CT), plasma glucose concentration averaged 4.2 +/- 0.2 mM and plasma insulin remained between 6 and 9 microU/ml.
 During the hyperglycemic trial (HT), 20 g of glucose were infused intravenously after 8 min of exercise, after which a variable-rate infusion of 18% glucose was used to maintain plasma glucose at 10.8 +/- 0.4 mM throughout exercise.
 Plasma insulin remained low during the 1st h of HT, yet it increased significantly (to 16-24 microU/ml; P less than 0.05) during the 2nd h.
 The amount of muscle glycogen utilized in the vastus lateralis during exercise was similar during HT and CT (75 +/- 8 and 76 +/- 7 mmol/kg, respectively).
 As exercise duration increased, carbohydrate oxidation declined during CT but increased during HT.
 Consequently, after 2 h of exercise, carbohydrate oxidation was 40% higher during HT than during CT (P less than 0.01).
 The rate of glucose infusion required to maintain hyperglycemia (10 mM) remained very stable at 1.6 +/- 0.1 g/min during the 1st h.
 However, during the 2nd h of exercise, the rate of glucose infusion increased (P less than 0.01) to 2.6 +/- 0.1 g/min (37 mg.kg body wt-1.min-1) during the final 20 min of exercise.
 We conclude that hyperglycemia (i.e., 10 mM) in humans does not alter muscle glycogen use during 2 h of intense cycling.
