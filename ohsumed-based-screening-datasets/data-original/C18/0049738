Increased fibrinolytic potential induced by gliclazide in types I and II diabetic patients.
 This study examined the effect of gliclazide on tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA)-related fibrinolysis in 23 Type I diabetic patients without residual beta-cell function and 17 Type II diabetic patients initially treated with tolbutamide.
 The Type I diabetic patients received gliclazide for a period of 6 months; the Type II diabetic patients were shifted from tolbutamide to gliclazide.
 In Type I diabetic patients, after 2-3 months of treatment with gliclazide, we observed a significant increase in plasma concentrations of total t-PA antigen that remained stable until discontinuation of the drug (p less than 0.0002), whereas the plasma concentrations of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) did not change significantly during the study.
 Next, we investigated the possibility of gliclazide inducing t-PA-related fibrinolysis in a subset of Type II diabetics without detectable concentrations of t-PA during treatment with tolbutamide.
 The concentrations of active t-PA increased significantly 3 months after a change in treatment to gliclazide, and active t-PA again decreased in one patient to undetectable levels after 12 months with gliclazide.
 Moreover, the plasma concentrations of total t-PA antigen increased significantly (p less than 0.02) in this group of diabetic patients while PAI remained unchanged.
 The changes in t-PA-related fibrinolysis could not be related in either Type I or Type II diabetics to changes in metabolic state evaluated by blood glucose, HbA1c, cholesterol, triglycerides, or apolipoproteins A and B.
 We conclude that gliclazide has the potential to exert extrametabolic non-insulin-mediated effects on t-PA-related fibrinolysis in diabetic patients.
