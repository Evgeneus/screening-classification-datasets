Respiration-deficient cells are caused by a single point mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA-Leu (UUR) gene in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS).
 MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes) is a major subgroup of heterogeneous mitochondrial diseases.
 For identifying a mutation in the mitochondrial gene, we isolated, from the same muscle tissue from a patient with MELAS, cell lines with distinctly different phenotypes: one was respiration-deficient, and the other was apparently normal.
 Compared with the normal cells, only one A-to-G nucleotide transition at nucleotide 3243 in the tRNA-Leu (UUR) gene was found in whole mtDNA of the respiration-deficient cells.
 This mutation was also found in eight patients, from unrelated families, who had MELAS in a heteroplasmic manner but was not found in control individuals.
 Therefore, the single point mutation causes the functional abnormality in the respiratory chain of mitochondria.
