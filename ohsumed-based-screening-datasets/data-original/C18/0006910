Easy dissection of hard and thickened pericardium on constrictive pericarditis.
 The keys to successful pericardiectomy for constrictive pericarditis are early operation and as complete a pericardiectomy as possible.
 With the high-speed burr it is easy and safe to dissect the calcified pericardium and define the epicardium even in a small operative field such as the inferior or posterior portion of the heart.
 This method has the important ability to perform very complete pericardiectomy.
