Effect of restricting dietary protein on the progression of renal failure in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus 
 BACKGROUND.
 Restriction of dietary protein may slow the progression of renal failure in diverse renal diseases, but the extent to which such a diet is beneficial in patients with diabetic nephropathy is uncertain.
 METHODS.
 We studied the effect of reduced intake of protein and phosphorus on the progression of renal disease in 35 patients with insulin-dependent (Type I) diabetes mellitus and clinically evident nephropathy.
 The low-protein, low-phosphorus diet contained 0.6 g of protein per kilogram of ideal body weight per day, 500 to 1000 mg of phosphorus, and 2000 mg of sodium.
 The control diet consisted of the patient's prestudy diet with the stipulation that it contain 2000 mg of sodium and at least 1 g of protein per kilogram per day and 1000 mg of phosphorus.
 Renal function was assessed by measurement of iothalamate and creatinine clearances at intervals of 3 to 6 months, and the patients were followed for a minimum of 12 months (mean, 34.7).
 The declines in mean glomerular filtration rates were compared between groups by linear-regression analysis of the glomerular filtration rate as a function of time.
 RESULTS.
 The patients who followed the study diet for a mean of 37.1 months had declines in iothalamate clearance of 0.0043 ml per second per month and in creatinine clearance of 0.0055 ml per second per month.
 The comparable values in the control group were 0.0168 and 0.0135, respectively (P less than 0.05).
 Blood pressure was well controlled, and the degree of glycemic control was comparable in both groups.
 CONCLUSION.
 Dietary restriction of protein and phosphorus can retard the progression of renal failure in patients with Type I diabetes mellitus who have nephropathy.
 We believe that wider use of this treatment is indicated.
