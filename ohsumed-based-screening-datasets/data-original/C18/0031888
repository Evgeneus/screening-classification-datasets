Physiopathology of plasma lipoprotein metabolism.
 The metabolism of plasma lipoproteins is under the regulation of several factors which involve apolipoproteins, lipid-modifying enzymes, lipid transfer proteins, and cell membrane receptors.
 The genes of most of these proteins have been defined and several mutants of these proteins also identified.
 Studies of these mutants have provided important new insights into the molecular basis of the abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism and also a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in secondary dyslipoproteinemias inclusive of those occurring in renal disorders.
