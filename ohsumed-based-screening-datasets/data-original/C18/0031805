Nuclear imaging analysis of human low-density lipoprotein biodistribution in rabbits and monkeys.
 We have evaluated the biodistribution of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) radiolabeled with 99mTc or with 123I-tyramine cellobiose in rabbits and in rhesus monkeys.
 Biodistribution was assessed after intravenous injection of radiolabeled LDL by quantitative analysis of scintigrams, counting of excreta, and counting of tissues at necropsy.
 Both rabbits and monkeys showed lower renal uptake (123I:99mTc approximately 1:3, as regional percent injected activity corrected for physical decay) and excretion (1:2 to 1:4), but higher hepatic (1.5:1 to 2:1) and cardiac (1.7:1 to 4:1) uptake of 123I than of 99mTc.
 Adrenals were visualized in normolipemic animals with 123I-tyramine cellobiose-LDL but not with 99mTc-LDL.
 Hyperlipemic animals showed increased cardiac (up to six-fold) and decreased hepatic activity (by 50%-60%) of both radionuclides.
 We conclude that 123I-tyramine cellobiose-LDL is better suited than 99mTc-LDL for dynamic studies of LDL metabolism in vivo.
