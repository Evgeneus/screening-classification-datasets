Electroencephalographic changes and periodontal status during short-term vitamin B-6 depletion of young, nonpregnant women.
 As part of a larger investigation to determine the effect of animal vs.
 plant proteins on the vitamin B-6 requirement of young women, clinical changes during vitamin B-6 depletion were documented.
 Eight healthy young women were confined to a metabolic unit and fed a defined formula diet nearly devoid of vitamin B-6 (less than 0.05 mg/d).
 Serial electroencephalographic (EEG) tracings, peripheral nervous system tests, periodontal evaluations, and biochemical measures of vitamin B-6 status were conducted.
 Within 12 d on the depletion diet, two of the eight women exhibited abnormal EEG tracings.
 These changes were readily reversed by repletion of vitamin B-6 at the 0.5-mg/d level.
 Biochemical measures reflected lowered vitamin B-6 status but were not predictive of the onset of EEG changes.
 No detectable alterations in oral or periodontal status were found, nor did plaque flora change markedly.
 This study is the first report of EEG changes occurring in women undergoing vitamin B-6 depletion and the first report to document EEG changes in adults within 12 d on a vitamin B-6-depletion regimen.
