Evaluation of renal function and fluid homeostasis during recovery from exercise-induced hyponatremia.
 Renal function including fluid and electrolyte balance was studied during recovery in eight subjects who developed symptomatic hyponatremia (HN; plasma sodium concentration less than 130 mM) during an 88-km ultramarathon footrace and compared with results for normonatremic runners [NN; n = 18, mean postrace plasma sodium concentration, 138.2 +/- 1.2 (SE) mM].
 Estimated fluid intake during the race for HN was 12.5 +/- 1.6 (SE) liters over 9 h 41 min (+/- 28 min).
 HN excreted a net fluid excess of 2.95 +/- 0.56 (range 1.2-5.9) liters compared with a fluid deficit of 2.7 +/- 0.3% body weight in NN.
 The sodium deficit was 153 +/- 35 mmol in HN and 187 +/- 37 mmol in NN.
 Despite the fluid overload, plasma volume was decreased by 24.1 +/- 5.0% in HN compared with 8.2 +/- 2.6% in NN.
 Serum renin activity (5.1 +/- 2.0 ng.ml-1.h-1), aldosterone concentrations (410 +/- 34 ng/l), creatinine clearances (174.8 +/- 28.2 ml/min), and urine output (6.4 +/- 1.0 ml/min) were markedly elevated in HN during recovery.
 Thus the hyponatremia of exercise results from fluid retention in subjects who ingest abnormally large fluid volumes during prolonged exercise.
