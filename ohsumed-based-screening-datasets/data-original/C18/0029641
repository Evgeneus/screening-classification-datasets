The clinical utility of maternal body mass index in pregnancy.
 To describe maternal body mass index and to compare the use of maternal weight and body mass index for risk assessment at the initial prenatal visit, 6270 gravid women who were consecutively delivered of infants were studied.
 Body mass index increased with advancing maternal age, parity, and advancing gestational age and was significantly greater in black women than in nonblack women.
 Risks for the development of adverse outcome associated with maternal obesity, including development of gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, fetal macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia, were comparably predicted by either maternal weight or body mass index greater than 90th percentile.
 Maternal weight was as predictive of preeclampsia, macrosomia, and shoulder dystocia as was body mass index when these factors were analyzed as continuous variables, whereas increasing body mass index was more predictive of gestational diabetes.
 The prediction of factors associated with low maternal weights, small-for-gestational-age birth, prematurity, low birth weight, and perinatal death was equivalent for maternal weight and body mass index that was less than 10th percentile.
 This study indicates that in the initial risk assessment of outcomes related to maternal weight, the calculation of maternal body mass index offers no advantage over simply weighing the patient.
 This finding contrasts with results in nonpregnant women.
