Increased calcium influx in caudal artery of rats made hypertensive with pyridoxine deficiency.
 Moderate pyridoxine deficiency in rats has been shown to induce hypertension, which can be corrected by pyridoxine supplementation.
 In this study, calcium handling by isolated caudal arteries from pyridoxine-deficient and age-matched control rats was evaluated.
 We found 45Ca influx into the intracellular compartment to be significantly elevated in deficient rats.
 This increased influx could be attenuated with nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker, in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting alterations in the calcium channels that would make them leaky.
 The pyridoxine-deficient arterial segments maintained a higher resting tone; removal of extracellular calcium by EGTA or entry blockade by nifedipine decreased the tone significantly in the deficient arteries, compared with little or no effect in controls.
