Body fat and obesity in Japanese Americans.
 In 1965 a prospective study of greater than 12,000 Japanese men 45-69 y old and living in Japan, Hawaii, and California was initiated.
 Among the factors measured were height, weight, skinfold thicknesses, and 24-h dietary recall.
 The mean body mass index (BMI) was substantially lower for Japanese men in Japan than for Japanese men in California or Hawaii for each 5-y age group.
 Mean BMIs in Hawaii and California were similar.
 Values for subscapular skinfold thickness were also lower in Japan than in Hawaii or California in all age groups.
 Although total caloric intake was not greatly different between Japan and Hawaii, the percent caloric intake as fat was two times greater in Hawaii.
 Thus, these largely first- and second-generation immigrants exhibit increases in body weight that could be expected to significantly affect cardiovascular risk factor levels and endpoints.
