Nutritional problems of developing countries.
 The nutritional problems of developing countries are conditioned by poverty, near exclusive reliance on plant sources of nutrients, and high rates of infections.
 Common deficiency diseases include protein-energy malnutrition, nutritional anemias, vitamin A deficiency, iodine deficiency, and possibly others.
 Population subgroups at particularly high risk are the children and women of poor families.
 Control of these nutritional diseases requires systematic diagnosis of the existing situation and appropriate intervention strategies such as targeted food and specific micronutrient supplementation, food fortification, nutrition education, and reductions in infections as well as general improvements in economic conditions and social equity.
