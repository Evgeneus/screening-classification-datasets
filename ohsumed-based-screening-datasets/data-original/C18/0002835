Branch retinal vein occlusion: the pathogenetic role of blood viscosity.
 The pathogenesis of branch retinal vein occlusion has not been completely clarified.
 The role of abnormal blood viscosity in the appearance and evolution of the disease has recently been advocated.
 We studied 54 patients with long-standing branch retinal vein occlusion from a hemorrheologic point of view.
 Depending on the extension of retinal ischemia, two subgroups were identified.
 Hematocrit, blood and plasma viscosity, whole blood filterability, cell deformability, and fibrinogen levels were investigated.
 Thirty-five subjects of similar age, sex, and risk factors of diabetes and hypertension served as controls.
 Our results showed that blood viscosity is higher in patients with occlusion and particularly in those with severe retinal ischemia.
 Statistical analysis showed a direct correlation between blood viscosity and hematocrit.
