Abnormalities of the breast caused by biopsy: spectrum of mammographic findings.
 It is important for radiologists to be familiar with the spectrum of mammographic abnormalities caused by postbiopsy changes in the breast.
 Although many breast biopsies leave no residual abnormality, occasionally an atypical manifestation of a biopsy scar may produce a radiologic finding suspicious enough to mandate a biopsy.
 Problem-solving maneuvers recommended to increase confidence that a change is related to a recent biopsy include (1) skin markers; (2) comparison with preoperative films; (3) correlation with physical examination; (4) tailored mammographic views, including focal spot compression, magnification, and tangential views; and (5) postoperative and follow-up mammograms.
