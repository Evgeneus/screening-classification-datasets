Substrate utilization during acute exercise in obese Zucker rats.
 The purpose of the present study was to compare the carbohydrate use of insulin-resistant obese Zucker rats with that of their lean littermates during steady-state exercise.
 Obese and lean rats were randomly assigned to a sedentary group or to a run group in which rats ran at 72-73% of their maximal O2 consumption, with the duration of exercise set to require an energy expenditure of 2.1-2.2 kcal.
 During the run the respiratory exchange ratio was significantly higher in the obese than in the lean rats [0.94 +/- 0.01 (SE) and 0.86 +/- 0.01, respectively], which indicate that the obese rats required 54% more carbohydrate than the lean rats.
 Total muscle glycogen utilization in the soleus, plantaris, and red and white gastrocnemius was not different between groups.
 Obese rats had total liver glycogen values five times greater than those of lean rats (833.38 +/- 101.4 and 152.8 +/- 37.5 mg, respectively) and utilized twice as much liver glycogen as their lean littermates (193.5 and 90.4 mg, respectively).
 The obese rats exhibited higher blood glucose and insulin concentrations than the lean rats during the run.
 These findings indicate that, despite their characteristic insulin resistance, the obese Zucker rats had a greater dependency on carbohydrate as a substrate during exercise than their lean littermates and that the major source of this carbohydrate was liver glycogen.
