T-lymphocyte changes linked to autoantibodies. Association of insulin autoantibodies with CD4+CD45R+ lymphocyte subpopulation in prediabetic subjects.
 The onset of insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes is predictable before hyperglycemia by the presence of islet cell autoantibodies (ICAs) and competitive insulin autoantibodies (CIAAs).
 CIAA+ICA+ first-degree relatives of individuals with type I diabetes have increased numbers of CD4 cells bearing the CD45R antigen and reciprocal depressions of the CD4 cells bearing the CD29 determinant.
 In addition, depressed CD4/CD8 ratios are present.
 In this study, we investigated the correlation between autoantibody levels and T-lymphocyte changes in the prediabetic state.
 The data demonstrate a clear linear relationship between rising CIAA levels, a marker of disease rate, and rising elevations in the CD4+CD45R+/CD4+CD29+ ratio in 37 CIAA+ICA+ and CIAA+ICA- relatives (r = 0.93).
 In marked contrast, the degree of CD4/CD8 depression found in individuals with prediabetes or long-term diabetes failed to correlate with either CIAA (r = 0.32) or ICA (r = 0.29) levels.
 The investigation of T-lymphocyte changes in siblings of individuals with type I diabetes with different stable autoantibody patterns (CIAAs and/or ICAs), and thus varying risks for diabetes, revealed differences in the prediabetic groups.
 Fifteen CIAA+ICA- relatives with high CIAA levels (greater than 80 nU/ml) had high CD4+CD45R+/CD4+CD29+ ratios (P = 0.03) and depressed CD4/CD8 ratios (P = 0.008).
 In contrast, CIAA+ICA- relatives with low CIAA levels (39-80 nU/ml), and thus low risk of diabetes, had no alteration in their CD4/CD8 ratio (P = 0.75) or CD4+CD45R+/CD4+CD29+ ratio (P = 0.33).
 Nineteen CIAA-ICA+ siblings with a predicted intermediate risk for diabetes showed heterogeneity in the presence of T-lymphocyte abnormalities.
