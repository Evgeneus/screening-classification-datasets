Effect of supplementary feeding on recovery from mild to moderate wasting in preschool children.
 Three-month recovery rates from moderate wasting (less than 90% weight-for-length) were compared in 6-24-mo-old children in four Guatemalan villages that had been randomly assigned to receive a moderate (Atole) or low (Fresco) energy supplement.
 The recovery rate (Rr) in the Atole villages was 12% higher than in the Fresco villages (P less than 0.05).
 This effect was above all due to the children in the Atole villages who consumed greater than or equal to 10% of the daily recommended dietary intake of energy (RDI) from the supplement (high-Atole group) and whose total energy intake (including home diet) was 10.5% of the RDI higher than a comparable high-Fresco group with low supplemental energy intake.
 All those in the high-Atole group whose wasting was due to malnutrition recovered.
 Much of this recovery (range 29-52%) was due to the increased supplementation.
 This proportion rose after potential confounding variables were controlled for.
