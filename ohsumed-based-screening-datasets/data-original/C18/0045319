Esophagobronchial fistula and mediastinal tuberculosis.
 A 59-year-old man was seen with what preoperatively was thought to be an acquired esophagobronchial fistula secondary to an old burned-out infection with tuberculosis.
 At operation the gross and microscopic findings were most compatible with a congenital H-shaped esophagobronchial fistula.
 However, cultures of calcified lymph nodes grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
 The need for culturing calcified tissue to assure proper treatment is emphasized.
