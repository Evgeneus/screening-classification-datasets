Fatty infiltration: another restrictive cardiomyopathic pattern.
 Restrictive cardiomyopathies have been shown to occur as result of infiltrative processes from a variety of sources.
 The current report describes an obese male, who was found to have hemodynamic evidence of a restrictive cardiac process.
 His pericardium was proven to be normal and an incisional biopsy obtained of the myocardium during coronary artery bypass surgery demonstrated histologic evidence of fatty infiltration of myocardium.
 Review of the restrictive and pathology literature is discussed and indicates that this is the first report to demonstrate the association between fatty infiltration and hemodynamic findings consistent with a restrictive cardiomyopathy.
