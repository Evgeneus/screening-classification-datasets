Response of vitamin B-6 content of muscle to changes in vitamin B-6 intake in men.
 Previous reports indicated that in growing rats the vitamin B-6 pool in muscle was relatively stable during deficiency but increased in response to increased vitamin B-6 intake.
 To determine whether human muscle would show a similar response 10 college-aged males received a low vitamin B-6 diet (1.76 mumol/d) for 6 wk followed by 6 wk on a self-selected diet supplemented with 0.98 mmol pyridoxine HCl/d.
 During depletion, excretion of pyridoxic acid rapidly adjusted to approximate the intake.
 Plasma pyridoxal phosphate concentrations at the end of the baseline, depletion, and supplementation periods were 81 +/- 51, 9 +/- 3, and 455 +/- 129 nmol/L, respectively, whereas muscle concentrations were 21 +/- 9, 20 +/- 4, and 25 +/- 7 nmol/g, respectively and total vitamin B-6 in muscle was 28 +/- 10, 27 +/- 4, and 35 +/- 10 nmol/g, respectively.
 These data provide further confirmation that the vitamin B-6 pools in skeletal muscle are resistant to depletion.
 They also demonstrate that in humans with constant body weight, vitamin B-6 supplementation is not associated with marked increases in vitamin B-6 in muscle.
