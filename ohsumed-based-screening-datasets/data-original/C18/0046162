Prevalence of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency in the Diourbel, Fatick, and Kaolack regions of Senegal: epidemiological study.
 The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence of protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM), ocular diseases, and vitamin A deficiency in preschool children selected at random in a rural zone of the groundnut belt of Senegal.
 The prevalence of PCM was 37.1% (95% CI 33.8-40.2%) according to the Waterlow classification, with a majority of stunting, and prevalence of hypovitaminosis A was estimated to be 11.4% (95% CI 9.3-13.5%) by using impression cytology.
 Furthermore, 19.4% (95% CI 15.8-22.0%) of the children might be defined at risk of deficiency.
 The prevalence of Bitot's spots was equal to 0.2% (95% CI 0.03-0.9%).
 A problem of PCM associated with a health-endangering vitamin A deficiency existed.
