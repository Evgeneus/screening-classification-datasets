Water and electrolyte balance in the vascular space during graded exercise in humans.
 We analyzed the changes in water content and electrolyte concentrations in the vascular space during graded exercise of short duration.
 Six male volunteers exercised on a cycle ergometer at 20 degrees C (relative humidity = 30%) as exercise intensity was increased stepwise until voluntary exhaustion.
 Blood samples were collected at exercise intensities of 29, 56, 70, and 95% of maximum aerobic power (VO2max).
 A curvilinear relationship between exercise intensity and Na+ concentration in plasma ([Na+]p) was observed.
 [Na+]p significantly increased at 70% VO2max and at 95% VO2max was approximately 8 meq/kgH2O higher than control.
 The change in lactate concentration in plasma ([Lac-]p) was closely correlated with the change in [Na+]p (delta[Na+]p = 0.687 delta[Lac-]p + 1.79, r = 0.99).
 The change in [Lac-]p was also inversely correlated with the change in HCO3- concentration in plasma (delta[HCO3-]p = -0.761 delta[Lac-]p + 0.22, r = -1.00).
 At an exercise intensity of 95% VO2max, 60% of the increase in plasma osmolality (Posmol) was accounted for by an increase in [Na+]p.
 These results suggest that lactic acid released into the vascular space from active skeletal muscles reacts with [HCO3-]p to produce CO2 gas and Lac-.
 The data raise the intriguing notion that increase in [Na+]p during exercise may be caused by elevated Lac-.
