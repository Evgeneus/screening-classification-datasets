Idiopathic sclerochoroidal calcification.
 Idiopathic sclerochoroidal calcification is a disorder that is often overlooked, occurring at the level of the posterior sclera and choroid in older patients.
 Clinically, it may be confused with choroidal osteoma, choroidal metastasis, amelanotic choroidal nevus, or choroiditis.
 The authors present seven cases of this unusual entity.
 The patients ranged in age from 58 to 80 years.
 In all cases, the yellow lesions were clinically estimated to be at the level of the choroid and sclera, and they were usually located superior to the superotemporal retinal vascular arcade.
 Systemic investigation of calcium and phosphate metabolism was normal in all patients.
 The classic clinical manifestations and differentiation of this unusual entity from other similar fundus lesions is discussed.
