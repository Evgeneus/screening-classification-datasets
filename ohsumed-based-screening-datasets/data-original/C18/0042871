Effects of exercise training on glucose control, lipid metabolism, and insulin sensitivity in hypertriglyceridemia and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
 Exercise training has potential benefits for patients with hyperlipidemia and/or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
 In nondiabetic, nonobese subjects with hypertriglyceridemia, exercise training alone increased insulin sensitivity, improved glucose tolerance, and lowered serum triglyceride and cholesterol levels.
 These improvements did not occur when exercise training alone was given to similar patients with impaired glucose tolerance.
 In severely obese (X = 125 kg) subjects without diabetes melitus, a 600 calorie diet alone decreased glucose and insulin concentrations and improved glucose tolerance but did not increase insulin sensitivity.
 The addition of exercise training improved insulin sensitivity.
 Obese, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus subjects on sulfonylurea therapy alone increased insulin levels but failed to improve insulin sensitivity or glucose levels.
 In contrast, the addition of exercise training to this medication resulted in improved insulin sensitivity and lowered glucose levels.
 We conclude that exercise training has major effects on lowering triglyceride levels in hyperlipidemic subjects and can potentiate the effect of diet or drug therapy on glucose metabolism in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.
