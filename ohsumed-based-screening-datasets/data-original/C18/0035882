Ultrasonic decalcification of the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement.
 Aortic valve replacement for calcifica aortic stenosis requires meticulous debridement of the aortic annulus to effect optimal valve seating.
 Since 1987, we have used ultrasonic energy to debride the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement in 56 patients.
 In our experience, ultrasonic debridement of the annulus is superior to traditional methods of debridement, affords improved seating of the valve, and may allow placement of a larger valve.
 Our follow-up ranges from 2 to 32 months (mean follow-up, 13 +/- 9 months) with 0% incidence of paravalvular leak or valve failure.
 We advocate the use of ultrasonic debridement as an adjunctive tool in aortic valve replacement.
