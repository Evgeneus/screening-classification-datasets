Fifteen-year argon laser and xenon photocoagulation results of Bascom Palmer Eye Institute's patients participating in the diabetic retinopathy study.
 Fifteen years after panretinal photocoagulation in the Diabetic Retinopathy Study, 86 (57%) patients had died, 14 (9%) could not be located, and 51 (34%) of 151 patients were examined to determine the long-term treatment effects.
 Of the eyes randomized to photocoagulation only 1 (5%) of 19 argon-treated and 1 (3%) of 32 xenon-treated eyes had received additional laser treatment, but 8 argon-treated and 7 xenon-treated eyes had had cataract removal.
 Eleven (58%) of the initially argon-treated and 13 (41%) of the initially xenon-treated eyes had 20/40 or better acuity, and 18 (95%) of the initially argon-treated and 26 (82%) of the initially xenon-treated eyes had 20/200 or better acuity.
 Of the control eyes 17 (33%) had 20/40 or better, and 30 (58%) had 20/200 or better acuity.
 Argon and xenon panretinal photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy provide good results for at least 15 years.
