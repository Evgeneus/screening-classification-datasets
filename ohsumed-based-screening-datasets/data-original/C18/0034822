DRB genotyping supports recessive inheritance of DR3-associated susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 The mode of inheritance of HLA-associated susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was investigated by the antigen genotype frequency among patients method in a white Caucasian population and a North Indian Asian population.
 DR genotypes were determined by DRB/DQB RFLP analysis.
 In white Caucasians, simple recessive and simple additive inheritance of a single HLA-associated disease susceptibility allele were rejected (P less than .025 and P less than 10(-6), respectively).
 The data were compatible with a three-allele model of disease susceptibility.
 In North Indian Asians, simple additive inheritance was rejected (P less than 10(-6)).
 The observed genotype frequencies were compatible with a single DR3-associated disease susceptibility allele which is inherited recessively.
 These data show that study of DR genotypes in populations of different ethnic origins may further the understanding of inherited susceptibility to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
