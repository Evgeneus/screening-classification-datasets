Parathyroid hormone secretion and target organ response in experimental acute pancreatitis.
 To determine changes in parathyroid hormone secretion and target organ response caused by acute pancreatitis before the development of systemic toxic conditions, experimental acute pancreatitis was induced in rats with a choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet.
 After 7 days, the rats were weighed and bled, and one kidney was assayed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D1 hydroxylase activity.
 Several manifestations of pancreatitis were observed in rats given the diet: weight loss (from 29.6 to 26.3 g vs that for control rats, from 29 to 52.8 g) and lower dietary intake (15.5 vs 47 g per rat per 7 days).
 Serum amylase levels fell from 1794 to 350 U/L in rats given the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet compared with levels of 1800 to 2100 U/L in control rats.
 The pancreases of rats given the choline-deficient, ethionine-supplemented diet showed degeneration, necrosis, and hemorrhaging.
 Serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, chloride, and parathyroid hormone did not change significantly throughout the experiment.
 Renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D1 hydroxylase activity was higher than in control rats (8.9 +/- 0.8 vs 7.6 +/- 0.6 fmol/mg of kidney per minute).
 Acute pancreatitis in this experimental animal model does not alter serum levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone or reduce target organ responsiveness to the hormone.
