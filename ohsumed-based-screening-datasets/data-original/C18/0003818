Alcoholic ketoacidosis.
 Alcoholic ketoacidosis is characterized by a metabolic acidosis with an elevated anion gap.
 It generally is seen in the chronic alcoholic patient who has recently gone on a "binge" that was terminated because of complaints such as nausea, vomiting or abdominal pain.
 Caloric intake is diminished.
 Treatment includes volume repletion and glucose administration.
 Morbidity and mortality usually result from intercurrent illness.
