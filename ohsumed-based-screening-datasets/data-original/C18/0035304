Continuous subcutaneous octreotide infusion: dose-response relationships between metabolic effects and octreotide clearance in patients with insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes.
 Octreotide (Sandostatin), a potent and long-acting octapeptide analogue of somatostatin, exhibits variable metabolic effects in type 1 diabetes.
 We have postulated that interindividual variability in octreotide metabolism could be responsible in part for the differences in metabolic responses reported in previous clinical studies.
 To this end, we determined plasma levels and MCR of octreotide during 24-hour continuous SC infusion (low dose, 200 micrograms; high dose, 400 micrograms) in nine female, C peptide-negative patients with type 1 diabetes.
 The metabolic effects of the analogue were assessed by measuring serum glucose, free insulin, glucagon, GH, and PP levels before and at 1- to 2-hour intervals during each dose of the analogue or control (0.9% saline solution) infusion in a single-blind randomized manner.
 Mean daytime (0800-0000 hours) and bedtime (0000-0800 hours) serum glucose levels decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 to 0.02) during analogue therapy compared with control.
 Mean serum free insulin levels were significantly (p less than 0.02) greater during octreotide infusion compared with control, despite the similar daily insulin requirements.
 Both doses of the analogue effectively suppressed 24-hour GH by 50%, glucagon by 50%, and PP by 80%.
 Steady-state octreotide levels varied considerably among patients (low, mean +/- SEM), 1000 +/- 101, range 638 to 1375 pg/ml; high, mean 1940 +/- 147, range 1032 to 2462 pg/ml).
 Although mean MCR values were similar with both doses, we observed greater interindividual variability (low, mean 2.45 +/- 0.30, range 1.31 to 3.78 ml/kg/min; high, mean 2.36 +/- 0.19, range 1.68 to 3.48 ml/kg/min).
