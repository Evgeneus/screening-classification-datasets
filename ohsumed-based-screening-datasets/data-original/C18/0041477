Energy requirements of a postobese man reporting a low energy intake at weight maintenance.
 Three experiments were performed to test the validity of the low reported energy intake of weight maintenance in a postobese man.
 In the first experiment the subject reported a mean energy intake of 8008 kJ/d during 16 d and he maintained a stable body weight.
 This finding was not reproduced in the second experiment, which consisted of a 6-d inpatient study during which the subject was confined to a whole-body calorimeter for 5 d.
 Indeed, he lost weight when fed a controlled energy intake of 7950 kJ/d.
 Moreover, this experiment showed that direct and indirect calorimetry provided comparable energy-expenditure measurements during this period.
 Finally, when the subject was refed a controlled energy intake of 7950 kJ/d for 21 d, body weight and fat losses were observed.
 Therefore, these observations do not support the validity of the low energy intake that may be reported by people predisposed to obesity.
