Survival after neonatal myocardial infarction.
 These are case reports of two children with structurally normal hearts and with normal coronary arteries, who survived myocardial infarction in the early neonatal period.
 They are only the third and fourth reported survivors of neonatal myocardial infarction and the first in which hypercholesterolemia is postulated to have played an important role.
 The most likely cause of the myocardial infarction was thrombosis or thromboembolism.
 Changes in hemostatic function associated with hypercholesterolemia may be relevant.
