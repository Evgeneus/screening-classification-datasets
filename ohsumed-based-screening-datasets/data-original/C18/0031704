Left ventricular function and wall thickness in long-term insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: an echocardiographic study.
 Left ventricular function and wall thickness were evaluated in 111 type I diabetic subjects (mean age 25.5 +/- 9 years, mean duration of diabetes 13.4 +/- 6.2 years), using 2-D-derived M-mode echocardiography.
 Patients were carefully selected for the absence of major coronary risk factors or manifest cardiac disorders, and compared with 91 age- and sex-matched control subjects.
 Fractional shortening and the maximal velocity of cirumferential fibre shortening did not differ significantly between the two groups.
 Furthermore, no differences were found in the diastolic functional parameter of velocity of circumferential fibre extension.
 Posterior wall thickness was significantly increased in the diabetic patients compared to the controls (9.5 +/- 1.8 mm vs.
 8.4 +/- 1.3 mm.
 P less than 0.01).
 As the thickness of the interventricular septum was also moderately increased (9.2 +/- 2.2 mm vs.
 8.9 +/- 1.7 mm, NS), these findings provide evidence for an early structural change of the myocardium in young diabetic patients without clinically relevant functional consequences.
