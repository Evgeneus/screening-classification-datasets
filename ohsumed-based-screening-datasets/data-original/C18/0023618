Loss of contrast sensitivity in cystic fibrosis.
 We measured the contrast sensitivity function in a 16-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis, before and during vitamin A supplementation.
 Before vitamin A supplementation, serum levels of vitamin A were abnormally low, the electroretinogram was reduced, and contrast sensitivity was abnormally low at all spatial frequencies.
 During vitamin A supplementation (25,000 IU/day), serum levels of vitamin A became low normal, the electroretinogram returned to normal, and the overall contrast sensitivity function improved by 94%.
 We propose that the contrast sensitivity function may be abnormal in patients with cystic fibrosis who have reduced retinal function secondary to vitamin A deficiency.
