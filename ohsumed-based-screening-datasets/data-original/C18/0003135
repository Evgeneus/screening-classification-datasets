Effects of felodipine on urinary albumin excretion and metabolic control in hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetics.
 The effect of a blood pressure reduction by 10 mg extended release felodipine once daily on urinary albumin excretion (UAE) as well as the possible diabetogenic effect of felodipine was studied.
 A 2 X 12 week placebo-controlled double-blind crossover study was performed in 12 hypertensive non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) patients without nephropathy on concomitant treatment with beta-blocker and/or a diuretic agent.
 Metabolic control as estimated by fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c and fasting plasma C-peptide was unaltered after felodipine.
 Blood pressure was significantly reduced by felodipine: systolic 166 +/- 26 mm Hg (placebo) v 153 +/- 26 mm Hg (felodipine) (P less than .05) and diastolic 95 +/- 7 mm Hg v 90 +/- 8 mm Hg (P less than .05).
 Heart rate was unchanged.
 There was no correlation between blood pressure and UAE, but the relative change in UAE expressed as UAE placebo/UAE felodipine was significantly correlated to the fall in systolic blood pressure (r = 0.64, P = .03) and mean blood pressure (r = 0.66, P = .02).
 Since microalbuminuria predicts proteinuria and reduced survival, early antihypertensive treatment may be beneficial in NIDDM as it is in IDDM.
 Long-term consequences on kidney function and mortality remains, however, to be elucidated.
