Total parenteral nutrition in the pediatric patient.
 Over the past 50 years, tremendous advances have been made in the management of children who cannot receive enteral nutrition.
 Challenges for the future include devising techniques to decrease catheter sepsis, particularly in children with a short bowel, who have a disproportionate number of septic episodes, possibly related to bacterial translocation.
 The delineation of risk factors for cholestasis associated with total parenteral nutrition and refinement of administration of such nutrition in premature neonates to decrease the incidence of this complication, as well as the morbidity of osteopenia, will extend our ability to help these children.
