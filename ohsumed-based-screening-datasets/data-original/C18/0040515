Development of macroangiopathy in sand rats (Psammomys obesus), an animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: effect of gliclazide.
 The risk of developing macroangiopathy associated with diabetes led us to study in sand rats the long-term consequences of non-insulin-dependent diabetes on the development of arterial lesions promoted by feeding a high-cholesterol diet.
 Gliclazide, an agent whose preventive effect has previously been suggested in other experimental models of atheroma, was also investigated in these diabetic and hypercholesterolemic animals.
 Sand rats were fed a natural diet (ND group), a standard laboratory feed (StD group), or a high-cholesterol feed (HCD group) for 15 months.
 Biologic parameters were monitored throughout the period of the study, and histologic and histochemical examinations were conducted when the animals were killed (month 15).
 One StD group and one HCD group were treated with gliclazide from month 3 to month 15.
 The StD group developed a syndrome of obesity, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and triglyceridemia.
 The high cholesterol feed further increased hypercholesterolemia.
 These biologic abnormalities were accompanied by arterial lesions (thickening of the intima, deposition of glycosaminoglycans).
 Foam cells were seen in the intima, and microthrombi were present in the lumen of the arteries of animals in the HCD group.
 Long-term gliclazide medication at doses that normalized serum glucose levels also reduced the obesity, hyperinsulinemia, lipid disorders, and it prevented or retarded the appearance of arterial lesions.
