The influence of renal function on diabetic foot ulceration.
 We examined the effect of renal function on the formation, severity, and outcome of diabetic foot lesions.
 Information was collected from a retrospective hospital chart survey and analyzed by univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis.
 Creatinine clearance, peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease were all found to be independently associated with formation of foot lesions, indicating that each of these acts by distinct biologic mechanisms.
 Renal function had no bearing on the severity of lesions or on their eventual healing.
 We conclude that foot ulcers are more likely to develop in diabetic patients who also suffer from renal impairment, but they are no less likely to heal than are those in patients with normal renal function.
 We further conclude that attempts to preserve functional limbs in these patients are justified.
