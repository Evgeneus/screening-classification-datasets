Prevalence of overweight and obesity in US Hispanic populations.
 Previous studies showed that Hispanics have higher levels of overweight and obesity than do US whites.
 The Hispanic Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (1982-1984) provides the basis for examining the physical characteristics of this population on a wider scale than previously possible.
 Data for body mass index (BMI; weight/height2) and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses were examined for the 7052 Mexican Americans, 1307 Cubans, and 2690 Puerto Ricans for whom each of these measurements were available.
 Prevalence of obesity and overweight was defined as BMI in excess of the 95th and 85th percentiles, respectively, of US reference standards.
 In male adults prevalence values were, respectively, 10.6% and 33.5% for Mexican Americans, 9.6% and 31.3% for Puerto Ricans, and 9.0% and 34.0% for Cubans.
 In female adults prevalence values were, respectively, 15.1% and 42.3% for Mexican Americans, 7.8% and 40.7% for Puerto Ricans, and 15.0% and 38.2% for Cubans.
 Skinfold-thickness data for these populations indicate a centralized distribution of adipose tissue, especially in males, and increased subscapular skinfold thicknesses in older women.
