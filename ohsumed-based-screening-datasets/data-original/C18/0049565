Hurler syndrome with special reference to histologic abnormalities of the growth plate.
 Hurler syndrome is a mucopolysaccharide disorder resulting from an heritable deficiency in alpha-L-iduronidase, an enzyme required in the catabolism of heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan (GAGs).
 The resultant intracellular accumulation of GAG leads to disruption of the intracellular and extracellular environment and dysfunction of multiple organ systems.
 Among the most noted manifestations of this disease is disproportionate short trunk dwarfism, which develops during the first years of life.
 Histochemical and electron-microscopic observations on a 30-month-old child with Hurler syndrome showed marked irregularities in chondrocyte orientation within the growth plate, along with disruption of the normal columnar architecture.
 Vacuolization with enlargement of the cellular border was the characteristic ultrastructural finding.
 An heritable abnormality in the enzymatic degradation of structural glycosaminoglycans leads to profound disruption of the normal mechanisms of growth and development.
