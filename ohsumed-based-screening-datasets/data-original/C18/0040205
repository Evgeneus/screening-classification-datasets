Hypercalcemic crisis in pregnancy associated with excessive ingestion of calcium carbonate antacid (milk-alkali syndrome): successful treatment with hemodialysis.
 Severe hypercalcemia, a potentially life-threatening condition, has been reported rarely during pregnancy.
 A patient with hypercalcemic crisis associated with excessive ingestion of absorbable calcium antacid was treated successfully with hemodialysis as well as other therapeutic measures, such as saline diuresis.
 This acute therapy resulted in long-term normalization of maternal calcium levels.
 The fetus, who exhibited a low biophysical score during the initial admission, was delivered a month later and had an uncomplicated neonatal course.
 Acute hemodialysis can be an effective, rapid, and safe method of lowering serum calcium levels in pregnant patients with severe hypercalcemia unresponsive to other medical therapies.
