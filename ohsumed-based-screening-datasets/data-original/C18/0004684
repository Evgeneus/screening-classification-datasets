Deposits of crystalline material containing silicon in surgically excised human valves.
 Ninety-seven surgically excised natural cardiac valves were examined by scanning electron microscopy and x-ray energy spectroscopy to assess the occurrence of crystalline deposits that contain the element silicon.
 Valves examined included 33 mitral valves, 63 aortic valves, and 1 tricuspid valve.
 To reduce the possibility of surface contamination, the deep layers of some valves were examined after exposure by fracture of the valve.
 Crystalline material containing silicon was observed in the deep tissue.
 Such crystalline material was sometimes entwined within subendothelial fibers.
 Crystalline deposits that contained silicon were associated with 34 of 97 of these valves (35%).
 Among the 34 valves that showed silicon, 24 (71%) also showed microdeposits of calcific material.
 In view of evidence that silicon may participate in the calcification of bone, and is found in the intima of arteries, a role for this element in ectopic calcification of valves may exist.
