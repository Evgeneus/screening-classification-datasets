Benign intrinsic tectal "tumors" in children.
 A specific group of intrinsic dorsal midbrain tumors was identified in six children by computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
 Each patient presented with raised intracranial pressure as a result of hydrocephalus due to obstruction of the sylvian aqueduct.
 No patient had brain-stem signs referable to the tectal tumor initially or subsequently.
 All six children underwent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversionary procedures.
 The radiological features were consistent and specific, with all patients showing tectal calcification or primary increased attenuation of the tectal plate on CT scans.
 In addition, lack of contrast enhancement was noted initially in four patients and eventually in all six patients.
 In all patients MR imaging showed a focal tectal tumor distorting the collicular plate with no cystic component and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images.
 There has been no evidence of progression in these six patients in the follow-up period ranging from 8 months to 17 years (8 months and 2 1/2, 4 1/2, 8, and 17 years).
 Diversion of CSF has been the only surgical treatment and no patient underwent deep x-ray therapy.
 Five patients have had normal intellectual development.
 In contrast to the majority of previously described periaqueductal and tectal tumors, this group of lesions appeared to be truly benign.
 The authors suggest that patients presenting with these clinical and radiological features may be managed by CSF diversion, serial examination, and MR imaging.
