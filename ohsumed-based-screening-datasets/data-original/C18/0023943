Hypertension in Hispanics, Asians and Pacific-Islanders, and Native Americans.
 There is a paucity of information about hypertension and its risk factors, prevalence, morbidity, and mortality in many racial minorities in the United States.
 Most of the population groups discussed in this section are composed of several subgroups that differ culturally, socioeconomically, educationally, and ethnically.
 This fact, however, does not lessen the need for more information about the extent of hypertension and risk factors in these groups.
 Moreover, a bonus from expanded research in these areas will be new information useful to the general population.
