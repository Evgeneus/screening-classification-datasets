Variable phenotypes in a family kindred with adrenoleukodystrophy.
 Adrenoleukodystrophy, an X-linked recessive disorder characterized by progressive demyelination of the central nervous system and adrenal insufficiency, usually manifests at 4-8 years of age.
 We report a 20-month-old male who presented with the sudden onset of status epilepticus and cortical blindness; initially, he had complete resolution of these findings, but experienced a relapse 3 months later.
 The initial computed tomographic scans depicted cerebral edema and possible "watershed infarcts:" however, over the next 2 weeks before discharge from the hospital, the cortical blindness and ataxia both resolved.
 During the next 2 months, he exhibited no symptoms: he had no seizures and his neurologic examinations were normal.
 Three months after the initial hospitalization, he developed what the mother believed was "a weakness on his right side." Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed severe white matter disease.
 Adrenoleukodystrophy was clinically suspected and an assay of plasma levels confirmed an elevation of C26 long-chain saturated fatty acid levels.
 After the patient's diagnosis of adrenoleukodystrophy was confirmed, long-chain fatty acid levels were obtained on his 5-year-old brother and his mother.
 This child had the earliest known onset of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.
