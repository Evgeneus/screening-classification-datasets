Risk factors and early extracoronary atherosclerotic plaques detected by three-site ultrasound imaging in hypercholesterolemic men. Prevention Cardio-vasculaire en Medecine du Travail METRA Group.
 Ultrasonic detection of atherosclerotic plaque of carotid abdominal aortic and femoral arteries and evaluation of risk factors were performed in 208 hypercholesterolemic men without cardiovascular disease.
 Twenty-six percent of them had no plaque.
 Plaque at the carotid, aortic, and femoral sites was found in 37%, 48%, and 53% of subjects, respectively.
 Plaque was associated (1) in carotid arteries with increased total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; (2) in the aorta with increased age, pressure, glycemia, and smoking; and (3) in femoral arteries with increased age, systolic pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and smoking.
 Multiple regression analysis showed correlations between carotid plaque and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; aortic plaque and age, smoking, glycemia, and pressure; femoral plaque and age, smoking, and pressure.
 This suggests that multiple risk factors influence lesions, and risk profile differs according to atherosis site.
