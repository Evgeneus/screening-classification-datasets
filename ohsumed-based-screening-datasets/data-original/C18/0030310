Marginal ulcer following gastric bypass for morbid obesity.
 Four hundred twelve patients underwent gastric bypass for treatment of morbid obesity between 1981 and 1985 at the University of Florida Affiliated Hospitals.
 Thirty-four patients (8.2%) developed marginal ulcers, considerably higher than the 0-3 per cent ulcer occurrence commonly reported in the literature.
 Factors predisposing to ulcer formation include: (1) a large gastric pouch; (2) a vertically oriented pouch; and (3) staple-line dehiscence.
 Twenty-two of 34 patients (65%) with symptomatic marginal ulcers were noted to have staple-line disruption.
 Twenty-one of these patients (95%) eventually required operative therapy for their ulcers compared with four of 12 patients (33%) with an intact gastric staple line.
 Surgical therapy consisted of takedown of the Roux-en-Y limb with resection of the ulcer and gastrogastrostomy.
 Staple-line dehiscence is a significant etiologic factor in the development of marginal ulcer following gastric bypass and when present constitutes an indication for reoperation.
