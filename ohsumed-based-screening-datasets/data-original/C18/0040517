Diabetic retinopathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients: the role of gliclazide.
 Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of human blindness between the ages of 30 and 67 in the industrialized world.
 Retinopathy has a multifactorial etiology.
 Standard treatment has aimed at correcting only disturbed glucose metabolism, but this may lead only to the partial amelioration of certain hemobiologic factors.
 In addition to its metabolic action, gliclazide has been shown to have specific hemobiologic properties; studies with gliclazide in animals and humans have shown significant improvements of platelet abnormalities, stimulation of prostaglandin I2 synthesis, and enhancement of fibrinolytic activity.
 In humans, open-label studies have shown that gliclazide treatment leads to stabilization of background retinopathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetics and, more recently, these beneficial effects have been confirmed in controlled studies lasting up to 37 months in which other sulfonylureas were used.
 The Japanese Diabetic Retinopathy Program studied the progression of retinopathy over a 5-year period, comparing gliclazide with other sulfonylureas and with placebo.
 This study showed that, with equivalent metabolic control, there was a trend toward a lower rate of deterioration and a significantly lower incidence of preproliferative retinopathy in the group receiving gliclazide compared with those receiving other sulfonylureas.
 Overall, the specific hemobiologic actions of gliclazide appear to offset or retard the progression of diabetic retinopathy and may have the advantage of lowering the incidence of preproliferative retinopathy.
