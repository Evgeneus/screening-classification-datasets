Niacin revisited. A randomized, controlled trial of wax-matrix sustained-release niacin in hypercholesterolemia.
 Two hundred one male and female subjects, aged 20 to 70 years, with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values (in the 75th to 95th percentiles), participated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind study using a new form of niacin (Enduracin), which employs a wax-matrix vehicle for sustained release.
 Four niacin treatment groups (daily doses of 2000, 1500, 1250, and 1000 mg) were compared with placebo- and diet-treated controls to determine side-effect profile and optimal range of efficacy.
 The groups given 2000 and 1500 mg demonstrated significant reductions in values of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-26% and -19.3%, respectively), total cholesterol (-18.4% and -13.3%), and total cholesterol-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (-20.4% and -19.4%) when compared with diet- and placebo-treated controls.
 Smaller improvements were seen in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
 Blood chemistry monitoring indicated that reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level strongly correlated with an increase in baseline levels of some enzymes for niacin-treated subjects.
 The improved side-effect profile of the wax-matrix form of niacin was particularly notable.
 The dropout rate due to side effects was only 3.4% and was coupled with good medication compliance.
