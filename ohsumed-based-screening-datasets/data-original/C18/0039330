Factors which regulate net hepatic glucose uptake in vivo.
 The regulation of net hepatic glucose uptake in vivo occurs by way of the hormonal milieu (insulin and glucagon), the glucose level, and the route of glucose delivery.
 Hyperglycemia in the absence of changes in pancreatic hormones (i.e., increased insulin and/or decreased glucagon) does not elicit significant glucose uptake by the liver.
 Net hepatic glucose uptake is augmented in a dose-dependent manner by a rise in insulin and is further stimulated by the presence of a "portal signal." The presence of coordinated changes in insulin, glucagon, and the glucose level in combination with the "portal signal" ensures adequate glucose uptake by the liver in response to a meal.
