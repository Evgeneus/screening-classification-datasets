Cytokine gene expression in the islets of the diabetic Biobreeding/Worcester rat.
 The Biobreeding Worcester rat provides one of the best models of autoimmune diabetes.
 Immunopathologic studies of acute diabetes show that the islets are infiltrated by T cells and macrophages.
 It has been hypothesized that the islets are damaged by the secretion of cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF-alpha and that their function may be altered by IL-6.
 In this study, we utilized in situ hybridization to determine the expression of the IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 genes within the pancreas of the acute diabetic Biobreeding Worcester rat.
 These studies showed that cells expressing IL-1, TNF, and IL-6 were present within the islets and in the exocrine pancreas surrounding islets, ducts, and vessels and in an interstitial location.
 Cells expressing TNF and IL-1 mRNA were present in about 20% of the islets, whereas cells expressing IL-6 were present in about 4% of the islets.
 Islets containing TNF- or IL-1-positive cells contained about three positive cells per islet whereas only about one IL-6-positive cell was present per islet.
 In 26% of the islets peri-insular TNF-positive cells were found.
 Peri-insular IL-1 positive cells were seen in 14% of the islets and 8% showed peri-insular IL-6 positive cells.
 In nondiabetic 30-day old DP or 90-day-old DR rats intra-islet cytokine gene expression was not seen.
 Our studies support the view that cytokines are important in beta cell destruction.
