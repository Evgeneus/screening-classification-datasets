Responsiveness to phenobarbital in an adult with Crigler-Najjar disease associated with neurological involvement and skin hyperextensibility.
 We present the case of a 23-yr-old man who had had since birth marked and sustained unconjugated non-hemolytic hyperbilirubinemia and who had had several attacks of grand mal seizures.
 Analysis of serum bilirubin by diazoreactive methods showed serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin as high as 445 mumol/L that were not affected by phenobarbital administration.
 However, analysis of serum bile pigments by high-pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated marked decrease of unconjugated bilirubin after phenobarbital treatment (from 432.4 mumol/L to 291.0 mumol/L) associated with slight increase of bilirubin monoconjugates and disconjugates (from 0.25 mumol/L to 0.42 mumol/L).
 Furthermore, in the past few years the patient had exhibited striking skin hyperextensibility and diaphragm eventration.
 This case confirms that alkaline methanolysis-high-pressure liquid chromatography is the most reliable method for assessment of serum fraction bilirubin levels; that clinical parameters such as neurological signs do not unequivocally discriminate between type I and II Crigler-Najjar disease and that response to phenobarbital treatment remains the main diagnostic tool.
