Inhibition of diabetes-associated complications by nucleophilic compounds.
 Mono- and diaminoguanidine inhibited ambient glucose-induced glycosylated end product formation of albumin and collagen 125I-labeled albumin covalent binding in vitro.
 Diaminoguanidine was a stronger inhibitor than monoaminoguanidine.
 These compounds also inhibited rat eye lens aldose reductase activity in vitro noncompetitively with respect to NADPH with Ki = 30.6 mM for monoaminoguanidine and Ki = 12.5 mM for diaminoguanidine.
 When administered daily for 98 days at a dose of 25 mg/kg body wt i.p., both compounds lowered eye lens sorbitol and aldose reductase activity in normoglycemic and alloxan-induced diabetic rats.
 Again, diaminoguanidine was a better inhibitor.
 Daily long-term administration of mono- and diaminoguanidine (25 mg/kg body wt i.p.) inhibited and prevented experimental diabetes-induced lens opacity in rats, respectively.
 It appears that diaminoguanidine has a better therapeutic potential in controlling diabetic complications.
