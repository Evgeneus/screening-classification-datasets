Potential role of insulin in the clearance of remnant lipoproteins in dysbetalipoproteinaemia.
 Dysbetalipoproteinaemia is a genetic disorder characterized by accumulation of lipoprotein remnant particles in the plasma, accelerated atherosclerosis, and the abnormal apoprotein E2.
 Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus can aggravate the hyperlipidaemia associated with this disorder, presumably by increasing triglyceride synthesis and reducing very low density lipoprotein catabolism by lipoprotein lipase.
 This report documents the gradual amelioration of dysbetalipoproteinaemia in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus following therapy with exogenous insulin alone.
 Although the beneficial effects of insulin therapy in this patient may include inhibition of triglyceride synthesis and improved triglyceride catabolism, we propose that insulin may also stimulate clearance of atherogenic remnant lipoprotein particles.
