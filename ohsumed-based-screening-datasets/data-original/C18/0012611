Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella enteritidis in cirrhotic ascites.
 Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis due to Salmonella is uncommon.
 We report three patients with ascites infected by Salmonella.
 All three patients had advanced chronic liver disease, typically cirrhosis with portal hypertension.
 Salmonella enteritidis grew in the ascite fluid culture of the three patients.
 There was no clinical or microbiological evidence of Salmonella infection other than in the ascitic fluid.
 One patient died before antibiotic treatment was started, but the other two were treated with different combinations of antimicrobial drugs.
 One of them died on the fourteenth day of hospitalization, and the other survived.
