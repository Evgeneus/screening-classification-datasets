Pancreatic islet cell carcinoma with hypercalcemia: complete remission 5 years after surgical excision and chemotherapy.
 A 45-yr-old man who presented with hypercalcemia was found to have an abdominal mass that was a pancreatic islet cell carcinoma.
 Although clinical features were suggestive of primary hyperparathyroidism, his parathyroid hormone level was not elevated.
 The patient underwent a radical resection of the pancreatic neoplasm which was situated in the tail of the gland.
 After surgery, the serum calcium fell within the normal range, suggesting that the tumor was responsible for production of a parathyroid hormone-like substance.
 Because of malignant histologic features of the lesion, a chemotherapeutic regimen including 5-fluorouracil and streptozotocin was indicated.
 Five years later, the tumor has remained in total remission.
