Postpartum hypercalcemia in a patient with medullary sponge kidneys.
 Previous associations of primary hyperparathyroidism-induced hypercalcemia and medullary sponge kidney (MSK) have been reported.
 In this report, we describe a lactating woman MSK noted to be hypercalcemic throughout lactation, without evidence of hyperparathyroidism.
 After the baby was weaned, the serum calcium returned to normal.
 A bone biopsy performed while the patient was hypercalcemic was consistent with hyperparathyroidism, suggesting the presence of a parathyroid-like protein produced during lactation.
