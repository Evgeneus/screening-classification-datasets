Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and cataract of patients in northern Sardinia.
 We determined the activity level of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase in 467 patients with cataract from northern Sardinia.
 Of 226 men, 18 (8%) had glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
 Of 241 women, 30 (12%) were heterozygous and two (1%) were homozygous for glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
 These prevalences were not significantly different from those expected in the general population.
 We concluded that patients with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency do not have a higher risk of developing cataract.
