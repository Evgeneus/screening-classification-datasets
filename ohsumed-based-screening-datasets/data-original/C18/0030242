Impact of age, race, and obesity on hypertensive mechanisms and therapy.
 Despite the demonstrated efficacy of traditional antihypertensive therapy in reducing blood pressure, hypertension continues to be a major cause of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.
 Stepped-care therapy is a nonphysiologic approach that, due to potential metabolic derangements and stimulation of undesirable reflex responses, may not substantially reduce the cardiovascular and renal complications associated with hypertension or improve long-term survival in many hypertensive patients.
 Because of fundamental hemodynamic differences related to the age, race, and weight of hypertensive patients, drug treatment often elicits varying responses.
 Certain classes of drugs are not only more effective but also more appropriate from a physiologic standpoint in specific types of patients.
 Therapy selection based in part on hemodynamic mechanisms and demographic patterns is a more rational approach to patient management and may contribute to a better overall outcome than has been observed with conventional treatment.
