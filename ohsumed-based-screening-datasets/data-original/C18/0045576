Nutrition and immune function.
 Despite provision of adequate calories and nitrogen, patients receiving current nutrition support formulations often have suppression of immune function.
 Certain nutrients may act pharmacologically on the immune system.
 The choice of nutrients appropriate for a given disease state must take into consideration the nutritional status of the subject, presence of infection, injury or hypermetabolism, and the specific immune defect.
 Nutritional therapy specific for certain disease states is complex and in its infancy but may hold promise for improved patient outcome.
 Randomized prospective trials to evaluate efficacy are mandatory.
 Continued research into individual nutrients to elucidate mechanisms of immunomodulation must follow.
 In the meantime, broad application of products shown to be effective for a specific indication is inappropriate.
