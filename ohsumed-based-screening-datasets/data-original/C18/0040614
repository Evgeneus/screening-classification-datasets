Hemochromatosis, iron and septicemia caused by Vibrio vulnificus.
 Vibrio vulnificus is killed by normal human blood but grows rapidly in blood from patients with hemochromatosis.
 It also grows in normal blood if the saturation of the transferrin is increased or if hematin, which contains iron, is added.
 It is suggested that the increased availability of iron in the blood of patients with chronic iron overload is responsible for their enhanced susceptibility to infection with V vulnificus.
