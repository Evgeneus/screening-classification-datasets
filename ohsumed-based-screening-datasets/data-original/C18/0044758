Taste preferences in human obesity: environmental and familial factors.
 Taste-response profiles influence food selection and may help distinguish among potential subgroups of obese individuals.
 A representative community-based sample of 61 obese and 31 lean adults tasted five sucrose solutions and nine fat-containing solid stimuli resembling cake icings.
 Solid stimuli contained 15-35% fat and 20-70% sucrose (by weight).
 No significant differences in taste responsiveness were observed between obese and lean groups.
 Obese subjects were then divided into subgroups based on age at onset of obesity and past fluctuations in body weight.
 Obese subjects characterized by large weight fluctuations showed elevated preferences for sugar and fat mixtures compared with the stable subgroup.
 In contrast, early age at onset of obesity (less than 10 y), thought to be a measure of familial risk, had no significant effects on taste preferences.
 Environmental as opposed to familial factors may be more immediate determinants of taste preferences and food choice.
