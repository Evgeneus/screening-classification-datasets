Effects of bicarbonate supplementation on urinary mineral excretion during very low energy diets.
 Metabolic acidosis is associated with increased calciuria and ammoniagenesis.
 This study evaluated the effects of oral sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) or combined potassium bicarbonate-calcium carbonate supplementation on urinary mineral excretion during the ketoacidosis of a very-low-energy protein diet.
 Seventeen healthy obese subjects (BMI: 37.5 +/- 3.2 kg/m2, weight: 100 +/- 3 kg) were given a 1.72 MJ all protein (93 g) liquid formula and a multivitamin-mineral supplement daily for 3 weeks.
 Subjects in groups 1 (n = 6) and 2 (n = 5) received 16 mmol KCl.
 In addition, subjects in group 1 received 60 mmol Na+ daily as sodium chloride, subjects in group 2, 60 mmol Na+ as NaHCO3.
 The subjects in group 3 (n = 6) were given 32 mmol K+ as bicarbonate and 16 mmol Ca++ as carbonate daily.
 Metabolic acidosis was prevented in groups 2 and 3 with bicarbonate and bicarbonate-carbonate administration.
 This was reflected in significant curtailment of the augmented ammonium nitrogen excretion found in group 1.
 The additional oral K+ in group 3 improved K+ balance and probably also inhibited ammoniagenesis.
 Urine calcium was greater (p less than 0.04) in group 1 subjects, but similar in groups 2 and 3, despite higher calcium intake in group 3.
 Urinary phosphorus decreased with time in all groups, but more so in the group 2 subjects who received NaHCO3.
 Acidosis was associated with the reverse effect on urinary magnesium, which decreased in group 1 subjects.
