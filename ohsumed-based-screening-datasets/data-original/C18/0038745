Subcutaneous or intramuscular insulin injections.
 To find out whether diabetic children may inject their insulin intramuscularly rather than subcutaneously, a random sample of 32 patients aged 4.3-17.9 (median 11.3) years was studied.
 Distance from skin to muscle fascia was measured by ultrasonography at standard injection sites on the outer arm, anterior and lateral thigh, abdomen, buttock, and calf.
 Distances were greater in girls (n = 15) than in boys (n = 17).
 Whereas in most boys the distances were less than the length of the needle (12.5 mm) at all sites except the buttock, in most girls, the distances were greater than 12.5 mm except over the calf.
 Over the fascial plane just lateral to the rectus muscle the distance from skin to peritoneum was less than 12.5 mm in 14 of the 17 boys and one of the 15 girls.
 Twenty five of the 32 children injected at an angle of 90 degrees, and 24 children raised a skinfold before injecting.
 By raising a skinfold over the anterior thigh, the distance from skin to muscle fascia was increased by 19% (range 0-38%).
 We conclude that most boys and some girls who use the perpendicular injection technique may often inject insulin into muscle, and perhaps on occasions into the peritoneal cavity.
