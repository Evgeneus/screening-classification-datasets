Nutritional consequences of major gastrointestinal surgery. Patient outcome and starvation.
 Advances in major gastrointestinal surgery and the existence of a significant number of high-risk patients necessitate a detailed knowledge of the metabolic response to surgery and the need for adjunctive nutritional therapy.
 Such surgery has the potential to cause significant nutritional consequences affecting patient outcome.
 Often, patients present malnourished preoperatively because of their chronic gastrointestinal disease, advanced age, or comorbidity.
 Still others are at great risk for developing malnutrition postoperatively secondary to the hypercatabolism of prolonged illness or postoperative complications.
 In addition, the surgical alterations of the gastrointestinal tract might disrupt normal function sufficiently to result in chronic nutritional deficiencies.
 Because starvation is no longer an acceptable condition, these concerns need to be recognized prior to surgery, and if indicated, nutritional support must be initiated preoperatively.
 Placement of feeding jejunostomy catheters for early enteral support should be considered for all high-risk patients.
 Equally important, surgeons should maintain a watch for future nutritional innovations that will improve their ability to meet patients' nutritional requirements.
