Recurrent hypoglycemia secondary to drug-dispensing error.
 We present three patients who developed hypoglycemia due to inadvertent dispensing of sulfonylurea drugs.
 Each patient had a similar clinical course characterized by hypoglycemia that remitted during hospitalization and recurred after discharge.
 The cause of the hypoglycemia was determined only after close inspection of the patients' medications, not the label on the container.
 Our experience suggests that hypoglycemia due to drug-dispensing error may be more common than is generally recognized.
