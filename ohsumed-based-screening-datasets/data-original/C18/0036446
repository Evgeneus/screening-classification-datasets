Ifosfamide, Fanconi's syndrome, and rickets.
 Three of 218 children treated with ifosfamide plus the uroprotectant mesna, in single- or combination-agent protocols, have developed Fanconi's renal syndrome, all of whom were in a subgroup of 86 children who had also received cisplatin or carboplatin therapy.
 Patients receiving ifosfamide who have received prior cisplatin (or carboplatin) are at significantly higher risk of developing Fanconi's syndrome than are those who have received no prior nephrotoxic therapy (P = .04).
 The role of prior nephrotoxic therapy, including cisplatin and its derivatives, and the total dose of ifosfamide should be considered in the assessment of this rare but serious and apparently irreversible side effect.
