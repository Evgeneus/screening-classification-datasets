Ascorbic acid requirements for smokers: analysis of a population survey.
 The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of ascorbic acid for smokers was recently increased from 60 to 100 mg.
 To determine whether this new RDA for smokers is sufficient to reduce the risk of low serum ascorbic acid (AA) concentrations (LoC) to the same concentration as nonsmokers, we analyzed the dietary intakes and serum concentrations of AA in 11,582 adult respondents in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1976-1980).
 Serum AA concentrations and the risk of LoC (serum ascorbic acid levels less than 23 mumol/L) for smokers consuming different amounts of AA were compared with those for nonsmokers whose AA intake exceeded the RDA (60 mg).
 Serum AA concentrations were reduced, and risk of LoC increased, in smokers maintaining AA intakes greater than 60, 100, and 150 mg.
 Only smokers consuming greater than 200 mg AA/d had serum ascorbate concentrations and risk of LoC equivalent to nonsmokers meeting the RDA.
