Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate responses to parathyroid hormone, prostaglandin E2, and isoproterenol in dermal fibroblasts from patients with familial benign hypercalcemia.
 Plasma concentrations of PTH are much lower for a given calcium or phosphorus level in patients with familial benign hypercalcemia (FBH, or familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia) than in those with primary hyperparathyroidism; these and other data suggest that there might be tissue hypersensitivity to PTH in FBH.
 To test this hypothesis, we have used cultured dermal fibroblasts from abdominal skin biopsies of six patients with FBH and six age- and sex-matched controls as surrogate PTH-responsive tissues.
 Cells in 24-well plastic plates were exposed to vehicle, human PTH-(1-34) (10(-10)-10(-7) M), prostaglandin E2 (10(-6) M), or isoproterenol (10(-4) M) for 10 min in the presence of isobutylmethylxanthine, and cellular cAMP was determined by RIA.
 All cells responded to PTH with dose-dependent increases in cAMP, and all responded strongly to prostaglandin E2 and isoproterenol.
 There were no consistent or significant differences between control and FBH fibroblasts in maximal responses to the three agonists, and half-maximal stimulation was achieved with about 10(-9) M PTH in both normal and FBH cells.
 These data are not consistent with increased tissue sensitivity to PTH in FBH.
