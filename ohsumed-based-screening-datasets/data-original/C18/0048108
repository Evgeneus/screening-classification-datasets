Study of parameters involved in specific immunoadsorption of apolipoprotein B.
 A therapeutic immunoadsorption system on immobilized and anti-apolipoprotein B as a plasma cholesterol lowering procedure was optimized.
 Several antibodies were compared and highest adsorption capacity was obtained with goat polyclonal antibodies.
 Optimum quantities of antibodies to be immobilized on the gel and quantities of apo-B to be applied to columns were determined.
 The amount of antibodies released from immunoadsorbents can be minimized by treatment with a 0.005% glutaraldehyde solution with an acceptable reduction rate of adsorption capacity.
 Each phase, adsorption and desorption respectively, were well-defined and synchronized so two columns could be used in parallel in an automated procedure.
 In these conditions, the immunoadsorption system can efficiently, specifically and safely remove cholesterol and has to be subjected to clinical trials.
