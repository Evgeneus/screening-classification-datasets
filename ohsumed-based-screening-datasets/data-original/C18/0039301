Diabetes insipidus secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis: report and review of the literature.
 We describe a 51-year-old woman with Wegener's granulomatosis who developed diabetes insipidus 7 months after the onset of her granulomatous disease and despite apparently good clinical response to prednisone and trimethoprim-sulphametoxazole treatment.
 A brain computerized tomographic scan taken soon after the onset of polyuria disclosed an enlarged pituitary gland that completely returned to its normal size after 5 months of cyclophosphamide therapy.
 We review 6 other published cases of diabetes insipidus secondary to Wegener's granulomatosis and discuss the potential pathogenetic mechanisms of this rare combination.
