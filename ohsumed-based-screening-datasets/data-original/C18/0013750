Etiologic, clinical, and pathologic analysis of 31 fatal cases of acute respiratory tract infection in Argentinian children under 5 years of age.
 During a 3-year survey of 805 children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) who were admitted to three hospitals in Buenos Aires, 31 fatal cases were recorded--a fatality rate of 3.8%.
 Of the 31 children who died, 77% were less than 1 year of age, 48% were boys, 58% were malnourished, 29% had previous respiratory disease, and 22% had previous congenital disease.
 All children who died had clinical diagnoses of pneumonia (71%) or bronchiolitis (29%).
 Autopsies were performed in 14 of the cases.
 Viral etiology was determined by both cell culture and indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) assay of either nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) or lung tissue and bacterial etiology was determined by isolation of organisms from blood, lung tissue, and/or pleural fluid.
 NPA was examined for Bordetella pertussis by IIF.
 Pathogens were identified in 65% of fatal cases.
 Seven cases were bacterial; seven cases were viral; and six cases resulted from mixed infections.
 Lung tissue yielded positive etiologic results in 10 of 13 cases.
 Histopathologic examination performed on specimens from the 14 autopsied children revealed necrotizing bronchiolitis with intranuclear inclusions (n = 5) and multifocal pneumonia (n = 9).
