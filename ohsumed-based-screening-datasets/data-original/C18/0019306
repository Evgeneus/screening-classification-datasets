Infantile form of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency with hepatomuscular symptoms and sudden death. Physiopathological approach to carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiencies.
 Reported cases of carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) deficiency are characterized only by a muscular symptomatology in young adults although the defect is expressed in extra-muscular tissues as well as in skeletal muscle.
 We describe here a CPT II deficiency associating hypoketotic hypoglycemia, high plasma creatine kinase level, heart beat disorders, and sudden death in a 3-mo-old boy.
 CPT II defect (-90%) diagnosed in fibroblasts is qualitatively similar to that (-75%) of two "classical" CPT II-deficient patients previously studied: It resulted from a decreased amount of CPT II probably arising from its reduced biosynthesis.
 Consequences of CPT II deficiency studied in fibroblasts differed in both sets of patients.
 An impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids was found in the proband but not in patients with the "classical" form of the deficiency.
 The metabolic and clinical consequences of CPT II deficiency might depend, in part, on the magnitude of residual CPT II activity.
 With 25% residual activity CPT II would become rate limiting in skeletal muscle but not in liver, heart, and fibroblasts.
 As observed in the patient described herein, CPT II activity ought to be more reduced to induce an impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids in these tissues.
