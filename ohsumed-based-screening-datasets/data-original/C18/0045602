Labyrinthine ossification after meningitis: its implications for cochlear implantation.
 Labyrinthine ossification can be found in a high percentage of patients with profound deafness resulting from bacterial meningitis.
 Radiographic evidence of ossification can be found as early as 2 months after the acute infection, indicating that the intracochlear process probably begins much earlier.
 If long, intracochlear cochlear implants are to be most successfully used in these patients, an aggressive approach to clinical management following the meningitis should be taken.
 Illustrative case reports and suggested guidelines for evaluation and treatment are given.
