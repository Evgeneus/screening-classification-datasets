Idiopathic hemochromatosis.
 Hemochromatosis is a rare disorder in which about four times the normal amount of iron is absorbed in the intestine, resulting in the accumulation of iron in the skin, liver, pancreas and heart.
 Radiographic features may include a small liver on plain abdominal films, increased hepatic density on computed tomographic imaging, and loss of liver signal on magnetic resonance imaging as a result of the strong paramagnetic effect of iron.
 Management includes phlebotomy and supportive treatment of damaged organs.
