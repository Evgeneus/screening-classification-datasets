A prospective, randomized evaluation of intrapartum amnioinfusion. Fetal acid-base status and cesarean delivery.
 Pregnancies with decreased amniotic fluid volume are prediposed to umbilical cord compression and variable fetal heart rate declerations.
 Intrapartum amnioinfusion has been utilized in an effort to reduce cord compression.
 Previous studies suggested that amnioinfusion may improve the fetal metabolic state and reduce the incidence of cesarean delivery in selected patients.
 In this study the hypothesis was tested that intrapartum amnioinfusion will relieve cord compression in pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios and will result in a reduced incidence of fetal intolerance to labor as well as improved fetal acid-base status at delivery.
 Thirty-five patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria were randomized to either the control (n = 16) or amnioinfusion treatment group (n = 19).
 Analysis of the data suggested that the two groups were similar for the perinatal parameters evaluated.
 No differences were observed in the umbilical artery blood gas analysis or incidence of cesarean section between the two groups.
 Intrapartum amnioinfusion does not appear to improve the perinatal outcome in pregnancies with oligohydramnios.
