Seasonal fluctuations in parathyroid hormone in relation to vitamin D intake of postmenopausal women.
 Vitamin D deficiency in elderly living at northern latitudes results in increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels after winter.
 Sunlight exposure and/or vitamin D supplements can prevent the PTH changes and possibly reduce PTH-mediated bone loss.
