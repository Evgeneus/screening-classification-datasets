Reduced plasma noradrenaline concentrations in simple-obese and diabetic obese patients.
 1.
 Obesity may be associated with a decreased activity of the sympathetic nervous system and also with a deficiency of the response to stimuli activating the sympathetic nervous system.
 As insulin activates the sympathetic nervous system, the present study was undertaken to measure the plasma noradrenaline concentration in the fasting state and after 75 g of oral glucose in simple-obese patients (n = 13), in non-insulin-dependent (type 2) diabetic patients (n = 37) and in normal control subjects (n = 12).
 2.
 The fasting plasma noradrenaline concentration was similarly reduced in the simple-obese group and in the diabetic obese group compared with the control group (P = 0.005).
 The glucose-induced increase in plasma noradrenaline concentration was normal in the simple-obese group, but was abolished in the obese diabetic patients (P = 0.008).
 3.
 Step-wise regression analysis indicated that independent effects on the fasting plasma noradrenaline concentration were exerted by age (r = +0.32, P = 0.002), glucose concentration (r = -0.32, P = 0.02) and the degree of obesity (r = -0.37, P = 0.007), but not by plasma insulin concentration.
 4.
 These results show that obese patients have a reduced fasting plasma noradrenaline concentration independently of accompanying diabetes, but that the response of noradrenaline to oral glucose is only abolished in the obese diabetic patients.
