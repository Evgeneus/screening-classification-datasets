Cervical paraspinal calcification in collagen vascular diseases.
 Although soft-tissue calcification is common in collagen vascular disease, paraspinal calcification in the cervical spine has not been described before.
 We studied five women with large, lobulated, predominantly homogeneous calcific masses centered on synovial articulations in the neck.
 Changes consisting of either osteolysis or erosions were evident.
 All patients had radiculopathy, focal pain, or stiffness.
 In two patients, the presence of hydroxyapatite crystals was confirmed on biopsy.
 Symptomatic cervical paraspinal calcifications in patients with collagen vascular disease cause large soft-tissue masses that mimic tumoral calcinosis.
