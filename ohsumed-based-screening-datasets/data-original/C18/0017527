Evolving natural history of coronary artery disease in diabetes mellitus.
 White diabetic patients are at high risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD).
 The natural history of CAD in insulin-dependent (ID) and noninsulin-dependent (NID) diabetes mellitus (DM) is reviewed to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of premature or accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic patients.
 In both IDDM and NIDDM, the risk of CAD increases with lengthening duration of diabetes; the risk, however, does not grow as a constant multiple of the nondiabetic risk of CAD, suggesting that the cumulative exposure to diabetes plays a significant role as a risk factor for CAD only in a subset of patients.
 This is consistent with the hypothesis that the diabetic milieu has an impact on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions but not on their initiation.
 This hypothesis is corroborated further by the observation that CAD does not occur in diabetic patients in populations with a low risk of CAD among nondiabetic patients.
 The component of the diabetic milieu responsible for promotion of atherosclerotic lesions is unknown.
 There is evidence, however, of a direct or indirect role of hyperinsulinemia in this process.
