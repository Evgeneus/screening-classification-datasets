Lipid-lowering diets in patients taking pravastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor: compliance and adequacy.
 We examined seven 1-d diet records kept during 1 y by 272 men and women instructed to follow a lipid-lowering diet while participating in a clinical trial of pravastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor.
 The mean percentage of calories from total fat and saturated, unsaturated, and monounsaturated fatty acids was similar throughout the year even though the patients knew they were taking an effective lipid-lowering agent.
 However, the diets of greater than 40% of women included less than two-thirds of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of folic acid, vitamins B-6 and D, and calcium and zinc; in men, folic acid and zinc intakes were low.
 We conclude that patients comply with lipid-lowering diets even when they know that they are receiving an effective serum lipid-lowering agent.
 However, for both men and women special attention should be given to the intake of several nutrients.
