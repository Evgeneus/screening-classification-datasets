Modification of serum and membrane lipid composition induced by diet in patients with chronic renal failure.
 Disorders of lipid metabolism during chronic renal failure (CRF) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of early cardiovascular complication of this syndrome.
 In addition, some experimental evidence suggests that hyperlipidemia may accelerate progression of renal disease.
 We have studied 65 patients with CRF (S-creatinine 1.5-9.0 mg/dl), 52.3% of whom were hypertensive.
 Patients were divided in 2 groups matched for age, sex and degree of renal failure: group 1 was kept for 36 +/- 8 months on a free diet; group 2 was kept for 39 +/- 6 months on a low-protein diet with an elevated polyunsaturated/saturated fatty acid (PUFA/SFA) ratio.
 We found significantly higher levels of triglycerides (TG) and lower levels of esterified cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) in group 1 than in group 2.
 Patients on the diet had a lower percentage of membrane SFA and a higher percentage of PUFA than patients on free diet.
 Only in group 1 a direct correlation between cholesterol/phospholipid (Chol/P) ratio and age was observed; in group 2, a negative correlation between levels of PUFA and TG and between linoleic/oleic (Lin/Ol) ratio and serum Chol was shown.
 S-creatinine levels were directly correlated with Chol/P ratio in group 1 and indirectly with Lin/Ol ratio and PUFA in group 2.
 These data show that a low-protein diet, containing an elevated PUFA/SFA ratio, is able to counteract lipid abnormalities in patients with CRF and the normalization of this pattern is associated with significant improvement of membrane lipid composition and, presumably, of "functional" activity of cell membranes with a better control of supposed "renal lipoprotein toxicity".
