Hypothermia in the summer.
 We have presented two cases of hypothermia associated with altered mental status occurring during the summer in the sunbelt.
 Both cases represent nonexposure hypothermia of multifactorial origin requiring prompt aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic intervention.
 The effects of phenothiazines, alcoholism, Wernicke's encephalopathy, Parkinson's disease, and altered mental status contributed to the development of hypothermia in these instances.
 Although both patients survived and were discharged from the hospital, it is likely that hypothermia in such situations has a higher mortality.
 Awareness of the broad differential of predisposing conditions is mandatory in treating such patients in a timely fashion.
