The influence of osteophytes and aortic calcification on spinal mineral density in postmenopausal women.
 The assessment of vertebral bone mineral density (BMD) in the anterio-posterior projection has become widely used in the management and prevention of osteoporosis.
 Recently, it has been demonstrated that the presence of spinal osteophytes has a major impact on measured BMD in men, thus casting doubt on the value of these BMD measurements.
 We have assessed the impact of osteophytic and aortic calcification on spinal and femoral BMD measurements in 130 normal postmenopausal women, aged 45-71 yr.
 Lateral lumbar spine radiographs were obtained in all subjects and graded separately (0-3) for osteophytes and aortic calcification.
 Both forms of calcification increased with age, and BMD of all sites was correlated positively with body weight and negatively with age.
 The correlation coefficients between BMD and calcification scores were nonsignificant.
 Multiple regression analysis, including weight, age, and calcification scores, demonstrated a small but significant effect of osteophyte score on lumbar BMD (partial r2 = 0.04; P = 0.012) and a similar trend for Ward's triangle and the trochanteric region (partial r2 = 0.02; P less than 0.06).
 The aortic calcification score remained nonsignificant.
 It is concluded that the influence of spinal osteophytes on lumbar BMD in postmenopausal women is substantially less than that in men and is, therefore, unlikely to interfere with BMD estimation in most subjects.
 The relationship between proximal femoral BMD and osteophyte score suggests a real relationship between skeletal density and degenerative joint disease, as has been demonstrated by others.
