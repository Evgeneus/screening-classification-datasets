Development of a wearable glucose sensor; studies in healthy volunteers and in diabetic patients.
 A glucose sensor with a subcutaneous dialysis system was tested in six healthy volunteers during an oral glucose tolerance test and in ten diabetic patients with hyperglycemia during rapid decline of blood glucose levels.
 There was a good correlation between sensor and blood glucose values.
 During oral glucose tolerance tests in the volunteers, there was a mean delay of 4.4 minutes in the rise of the value registered subcutaneously and of 8.2 minutes in the fall of the curves.
 In the diabetic patients the maximum delay was 22 minutes.
 Nine days after insertion of the dialysis system it was still functioning well.
