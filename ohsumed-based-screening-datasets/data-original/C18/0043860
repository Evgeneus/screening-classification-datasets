Significance of silent myocardial ischemia during exercise testing in patients with diabetes mellitus: a report from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study (CASS) Registry.
 To evaluate the significance of ischemic ST depression without anginal chest pain during exercise testing among patients with diabetes mellitus, the data on 45 such patients from the Coronary Artery Surgery Study registry were analyzed.
 These patients (group 1, silent ischemia) were compared with 37 diabetic patients with both ischemic ST depression and chest pain (group 2, symptomatic ischemia), with 31 diabetic patients without ischemic ST depression or chest pain (group 3, no ischemia), and with 429 patients without diabetes who had silent ischemia during exercise testing.
 All patients had documented coronary artery disease (CAD) (greater than 70% diameter narrowing).
 The 6-year survival among patients with silent ischemia was worse in diabetic than nondiabetic patients (59 vs 82%, respectively, p less than 0.001).
 By contrast, the 6-year survival among patients without ischemia was similar among diabetic and nondiabetic patients (93 vs 85%, respectively, p = 0.476).
 Among diabetic patients, survival at 6 years with medical treatment was 59% for group 1, 66% for group 2 and 93% for group 3 (p = 0.008).
 Survival among subsets of patients with diabetes and silent ischemia (group 1) based on the extent of CAD and left ventricular function ranged from 100 to 32% (p = 0.093).
 The survival of the 45 patients with diabetes mellitus and silent ischemia (group 1) treated medically was compared with that of 28 patients receiving coronary artery graft bypass surgery.
