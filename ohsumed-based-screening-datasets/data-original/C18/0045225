Lipid results of partial ileal bypass in patients with heterozygous, type II-A hyperlipoproteinemia. Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias.
 Although reduction in total plasma cholesterol has yet to be shown to have a beneficial effect on overall mortality, the weight of experimental and epidemiologic evidence supports efforts to lower total plasma cholesterol levels to reduce the risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD).
 This is especially true in patients with heterozygous, type II-A hyperlipoproteinemia, whose total plasma cholesterol levels above the 90th percentile for age and sex place them at markedly increased risk of death from CHD.
 The lipid results of partial ileal bypass (PIB) were assessed in 110 patients with heterozygous, type II-A hyperlipoproteinemia in the Program on the Surgical Control of the Hyperlipidemias, a randomized, prospective clinical trial assessing the effects of cholesterol reduction on overall mortality and the course of CHD.
 Compared with dietary control (n = 52), PIB (n = 58) reduced total plasma cholesterol levels 24% +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM), reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels 34% +/- 3%, and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels 5% +/- 5% 5 years after surgery.
 Very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 28% +/- 21% higher and plasma triglyceride levels were 24% +/- 11% higher in the surgical group.
 The HDL cholesterol/total plasma cholesterol and HDL cholesterol/LDL cholesterol ratios were significantly higher after PIB.
 Apolipoprotein A-I and HDL subfraction 2 levels were significantly higher and apolipoprotein B-100 levels were significantly lower in the surgical group.
 PIB successfully lowered mean total plasma cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels below the limits recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program to minimize the risk of death from CHD.
 These results confirm the efficacy and support the role of PIB in the management of patients with marked hypercholesterolemia.
