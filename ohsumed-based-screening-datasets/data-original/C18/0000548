Actions of novel antidiabetic agent englitazone in hyperglycemic hyperinsulinemic ob/ob mice.
 The effects of CP 68722 (racemic englitazone) were examined in ob/ob mice, in adipocytes and soleus muscles from ob/ob mice, and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.
 Administration of englitazone at 5-50 mg.kg-1.day-1 lowered plasma glucose and insulin dose dependently without producing frank hypoglycemia in either the diabetic or nondiabetic lean animals.
 The glucose-lowering effect in ob/ob mice preceded the reduction in hyperinsulinemia.
 On cessation of drug, plasma insulin returned to untreated levels within 48 h, whereas plasma glucose rose slowly over 5 days.
 Englitazone (50 mg/kg) for 11 days lowered plasma glucose (22.2 +/- 1.4 to 14.0 +/- 1.9 mM), insulin (7.57 +/- 0.67 to 1.64 +/- 0.60 nM), nonesterified fatty acids (1813 +/- 86 to 914 +/- 88 microM), glycerol (9.20 +/- 0.98 to 4.94 +/- 0.03 mM), triglycerides (1.99 +/- 0.25 to 1.03 +/- 0.11 g/L), and cholesterol (6.27 +/- 0.96 to 3.87 +/- 0.57 mM), but no effects were observed 3 h after a single dose.
 Basal and insulin-stimulated lipogenesis were enhanced in adipocytes from ob/ob mice treated with 50 mg/kg englitazone for 11 days compared with lipogenesis in cells from vehicle-treated controls.
 Treatment of ob/ob mice with 50 mg/kg englitazone reversed the defects in insulin-stimulated glycolysis (from [3-3H]glucose) and glycogenesis and basal glucose oxidation (from [1-14C]glucose) in isolated soleus muscles.
 Englitazone (30 microM) stimulated 2-deoxy-D-glucose transport in 3T3-L1 adipocytes from 0.37 +/- 0.03 to 0.65 +/- 0.06 and 1.53 nmol.min-1.mg-1 protein at 24 and 48 h, respectively.
 Thus, englitazone has 1) insulinomimetic and insulin-enhancing actions in vitro and 2) glucose-, insulin-, triglyceride-, and cholesterol-lowering properties in an animal model of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in which sulfonylureas have little or no effect.
 Thus, this new agent may have beneficial effects including a reduced risk of hypoglycemia in patients with NIDDM.
