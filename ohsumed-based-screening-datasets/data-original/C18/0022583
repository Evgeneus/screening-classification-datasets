Changes in vitamin and mineral intakes and serum concentrations among free-living men on cholesterol-lowering diets: the Dietary Alternatives Study.
 Nutritional adequacy of diets with 18-30% of calories from fat was investigated in men with elevated serum cholesterol (n = 396) at the end of diet classes and 1 and 2 y later.
 On 4-d food records, intakes of vitamin A, beta-carotene, folate, vitamin C, magnesium, vitamin B-6, iron, thiamin, and riboflavin increased from baseline whereas niacin, selenium, vitamin E, and zinc decreased.
 Median zinc intake, 80% of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) at baseline, decreased to approximately 75% of the RDA, most markedly when intakes of meat, fish, and poultry were limited to 85 g/d.
 Nutrient densities generally increased.
 Of the serum nutrients measured, median beta-carotene and vitamin C increased, whereas vitamin B-6, iron, and zinc were unchanged.
 Below-normal values were fewer for vitamin C and magnesium.
 Diets similar to the National Cholesterol Education Program Step-Two Diet [less than 7% saturated fatty acids, less than 200 mg cholesterol/d] appeared to provide increased levels of most micronutrients both short and long term to men receiving comprehensive dietary counseling.
