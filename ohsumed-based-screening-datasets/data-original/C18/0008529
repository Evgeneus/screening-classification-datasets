The relation of serum cholesterol to risk of coronary heart disease: implications for the elderly.
 Elevated cholesterol is a known risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) in young and middle-aged persons.
 Because of the high prevalence of CHD in a growing elderly population, physicians must decide whether to devote clinical attention to this condition in older patients.
 Longitudinal cohort studies show that while the association between serum cholesterol and CHD decreases after age 55 years, it still persists.
 Primary prevention trials performed mostly on middle-aged men have reduced the incidence rate of CHD through cholesterol lowering but they have yet to show a reduction in overall mortality.
 Secondary prevention studies of lipid alteration have reported decreased mortality and slowed progression of coronary stenoses, again in predominantly male subjects aged less than 60 years.
 Implications of these findings for care of older patients are discussed along with recommendations for clinical management and future research.
