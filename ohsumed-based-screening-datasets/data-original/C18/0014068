Esophageal perforation during pneumatic dilatation for achalasia: a possible association with malnutrition.
 Pneumatic balloon dilatation of the lower esophageal sphincter is commonly utilized as primary therapy for achalasia.
 Perforation related to pneumatic dilatation is uncommon (2-6%) but may result in severe morbidity.
 Factors associated with risk of perforation are not well defined.
 We noted perforation in three patients undergoing forceful balloon dilatation.
 All these patients had clinical evidence of significant malnutrition (recent marked weight loss and severe hypoalbuminemia).
 Malnutrition may be a causal factor for perforation in patients with achalasia undergoing dilatation.
