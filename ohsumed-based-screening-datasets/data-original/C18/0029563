Energy cost of physical activity on a metabolic ward in relationship to obesity.
 The energy cost of physical activity on a metabolic ward was derived from the difference between the energy requirement to maintain body weight on a metabolic ward and sedentary 24-h energy expenditure measured in a respiratory chamber in 56 nondiabetic male subjects.
 The cost of physical activity was negatively correlated with body weight (r = -0.67, P less than 0.0001) and with percent body fat (r = -0.48, P less than 0.0005).
 In a subgroup of 15 subjects selected for strict weight stability (rate of daily weight change less than +/- 35 g/d), similar negative correlations were observed between energy cost of activity and body weight (r = -0.61, P less than 0.01) and percent body fat (r = -0.51, P = 0.05).
 The ratio of active to sedentary energy expenditure, an index of physical activity, was also negatively correlated with body weight and percent body fat (r = -0.74, P less than 0.002 and r = -0.61, P less than 0.02, respectively).
 These results suggest that heavier subjects on a metabolic ward are less active and expend less energy in physical activity than do lighter subjects.
