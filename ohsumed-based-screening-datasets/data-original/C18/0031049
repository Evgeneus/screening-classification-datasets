The role of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I in experimental renal growth and scarring.
 Recent evidence suggests a causal link between early renal/glomerular hypertrophy and late kidney scarring and glomerular sclerosis.
 Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a growth-promoting peptide likely to play a role in the development of kidney growth.
 We observed an increased renal IGF-I content in two experimental models of accelerated kidney growth in the rat.
 By contrast, diabetic renal hypertrophy is abolished in the absence of growth hormone (GH).
 Dietary protein manipulations affect the expression of compensatory renal growth (CRG), as well as renal IGF-I content.
 The renotrophic effect of a high-protein diet on CRG seems GH-dependent and IGF-I-mediated.
 GH also appears to have a permissive role on the development of progressive renal scarring following extensive renal ablation in rats, as dwarf rats seem somewhat resistant to the development of accelerated scarring and renal failure.
