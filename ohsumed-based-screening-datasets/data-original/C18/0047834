Effectiveness of glibenclamide on myocardial ischemic ventricular arrhythmias in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 Glibenclamide, a hypoglycemic sulfonylurea, is a blocker of the adenosine triphosphatase-modulated potassium ion channels.
 The opening of these channels in the myocardial cells, induced by acute myocardial hypoxia, can be responsible for ischemic ventricular arrhythmias.
 To evaluate the antiarrhythmic effects of this drug 19 non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients were selected.
 They had coronary artery disease and evidence on Holter monitoring of ventricular premature complexes or nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or both, induced by transient myocardial ischemia.
 In all patients, 24-hour electrocardiographic monitoring was performed to evaluate the number and duration of myocardial ischemic events, the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia per minute of ischemia and the percentage of ventricular premature complexes versus total ischemic beats.
 Selected patients were classified in 2 groups: group A (9 patients) received metformin (placebo) and group B (10 patients) was treated with glibenclamide.
 On the fourteenth day patients underwent 24-hour control monitoring.
 Then a crossover between the 2 groups was made and a new Holter monitoring sequence was performed at the end of the second phase.
 Results indicate that glibenclamide significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced both the frequency of ventricular premature complexes and the episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during transient myocardial ischemia, but did not change the number and duration of acute myocardial ischemic attacks and did not reduce the spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias.
 Thus, glibenclamide appears to have an antiarrhythmic effect in preventing ventricular arrhythmias induced by transient myocardial ischemia.
