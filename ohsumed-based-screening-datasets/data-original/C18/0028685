Obesity prevention.
 Given the increased risk of overweight and the fact that many weight-related behaviors acquired during childhood and adolescence are likely to be maintained into adulthood, minority teen-agers are a key group to target for obesity-prevention efforts.
 This paper reflects on three theoretical elements of behavior change in relation to obesity-related knowledge, attitudes, and food behaviors of minority groups in the United States, and it summarizes the status of individual-, family-, school-, and environment-based efforts to prevent or treat obesity in minority adolescents.
