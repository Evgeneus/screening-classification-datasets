Contribution to postprandial hyperglycemia and effect on initial splanchnic glucose clearance of hepatic glucose cycling in glucose-intolerant or NIDDM patients.
 Excessive amounts of glucose enter the systemic circulation when patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) eat a carbohydrate-containing meal.
 To determine the contribution of hepatic glucose cycling (defined as the net effect of glucose/glucose-6-phosphate cycling and uptake and release of glucose from hepatic glycogen) to postprandial hyperglycemia, diabetic, glucose-intolerant, and nondiabetic subjects were fed mixed meals.
 The meal contained both [2-3H]glucose (an isotope that is extensively detritiated during hepatic glucose cycling) and [6-3H]glucose (an isotope that is not detritiated during hepatic glucose cycling).
 Of the 50 g of carbohydrate contained in the meal, approximately 4-8 g underwent hepatic glucose cycling.
 Although total cycling of ingested glucose did not differ between diabetic, glucose-intolerant, and nondiabetic subjects (361 +/- 67 vs.
 494 +/- 106 vs.
 322 +/- 44 mumol.kg-1.5 h-1, respectively), the data suggested that hepatic cycling was increased in the diabetic and glucose-intolerant individuals but not in the nondiabetic subjects during the first 2 h after eating.
 Hepatic cycling during the first 2 h after eating was correlated with the prevailing glucagon concentration (r = 0.6, P less than 0.01) and increased (P less than 0.05) as hepatic glucose release increased.
 Hepatic glucose cycling had a marked effect on the measurement of so-called initial splanchnic glucose uptake.
 Nevertheless, however measured, initial splanchnic glucose uptake was not decreased and, if anything, was increased in diabetic and glucose-intolerant patients.
 Integrated postprandial hepatic glucose release increased (r less than 0.01) with the severity of fasting hyperglycemia.
