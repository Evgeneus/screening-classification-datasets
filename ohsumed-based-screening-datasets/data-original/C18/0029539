Oxygen utilization, carbon dioxide elimination and ventilation during recovery from supine bicycle exercise 6 to 8 weeks after acute myocardial infarction.
 The pattern of oxygen (O2) consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide (CO2) production (VCO2), ventilatory and metabolic responses during and in recovery from supine bicycle exercise was examined in 18 patients with recent myocardial infarction.
 An increase in VO2 with increasing work load was accomplished by proportional increases in both cardiac output and the arteriovenous O2 difference.
 During recovery, however, the arteriovenous O2 difference rapidly decreased below levels at rest, whereas VO2 and cardiac output remained elevated, indicating that VO2 during recovery further depended on relatively high cardiac output.
 The ratio of VCO2 to VO2 further increased after exercise, suggesting that such cardiac output contributed to the remaining high CO2 flow to the lung and therefore enhanced ventilation.
 Increased arterial catecholamines during exercise remained elevated for the first 5 minutes of recovery.
 Arterial lactate during this period continued to increase and resulted in profound metabolic acidosis, causing alveolar hyperventilation after exercise.
 These results suggest that during recovery from exercise, cardiopulmonary responses remain enhanced because of continuing high cardiac output, resulting in subsequent high CO2 flow to the lung and metabolic acidosis, and that this may be associated with profound fatigue or dyspnea after exercise.
