Metabolic effects of isradipine versus hydrochlorothiazide in diabetes mellitus [published erratum appears in Hypertension 1991 May;17(5):722]
 Most antihypertensive drugs have negative effects on metabolic control in diabetic patients.
 Calcium antagonists have been widely used in antihypertensive treatment of diabetics, although a possible influence on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin action is unknown.
 Therefore, the effect of the calcium antagonist isradipine on glucose tolerance and insulin secretion (75 g oral glucose tolerance test) and on peripheral and hepatic insulin action (euglycemic clamp) was evaluated in 11 type II diabetic patients.
 All patients were treated with placebo or isradipine for 8 weeks (double-blind, crossover design).
 A second group of six diabetic patients received a thiazide diuretic, hydrochlorothiazide, according to the same protocol.
 Systolic blood pressure was significantly lowered after isradipine and hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo (127 +/- 3 versus 139 +/- 6 mm Hg and 129 +/- 4 versus 142 +/- 4, respectively; p less than 0.05).
 Fasting blood glucose (190 +/- 21 versus 152 +/- 15 mg/dl; p less than 0.01), glucose levels, basal and glucose-stimulated insulin levels were significantly higher after hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo but remained unchanged after calcium antagonist treatment.
 Basal hepatic glucose production and peripheral insulin resistance were significantly elevated after hydrochlorothiazide compared with placebo or calcium antagonist therapy.
 These data indicate that the calcium antagonist isradipine has no effect on glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and insulin action in type II diabetic patients and might therefore be a useful drug for antihypertensive treatment in diabetes mellitus.
 However, diuretic treatment can lead to impairment of metabolic control and reduction of insulin action in type II diabetes mellitus.
