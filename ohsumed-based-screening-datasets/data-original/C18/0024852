Importance of hepatic glucoreceptors in sympathoadrenal response to hypoglycemia.
 To ascertain whether hepatic glucoreceptors are important to hypoglycemic counterregulation, a localized euglycemic clamp was employed across the liver during general hypoglycemia.
 Dogs were infused peripherally with insulin (18-21 pmol.kg-1.min-1) for 150 min to induce systemic hypoglycemia.
 During the liver-clamp (LC) protocol, glucose was infused via the portal vein to maintain euglycemia at the liver.
 In control experiments, i.e., matched infusion (MI), glucose was infused peripherally at a rate determined to yield similar arterial glycemia levels in the two protocols.
 Arterial glucose concentrations were not different between protocols during the final hour of insulin infusion (3.26 +/- 0.21 and 3.25 +/- 0.21 mM during LC and MI, respectively; P = 0.91).
 Calculated hepatic glucose concentrations during the same period were significantly higher for LC (5.22 +/- 0.23 mM) than for MI (3.25 +/- 0.21 mM).
 During MI, both epinephrine and norepinephrine rose significantly from basal values of 562 +/- 87 pM and 1.21 +/- 0.19 nM to plateaus of 3691 +/- 1097 pM (P = 0.0001) and 2.38 +/- 0.35 nM (P = 0.0002), respectively.
 However, during LC, the elevation in epinephrine was suppressed by 42 +/- 8% (P = 0.015) relative to MI.
 Six of seven animals demonstrated a suppression in the norepinephrine response, averaging 32 +/- 13% (NS, P = 0.068).
 The glucagon response to hypoglycemia was unaffected by the level of hepatic glycemia.
 Hepatic hypoglycemia is essential to produce the full sympathoadrenal response to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
