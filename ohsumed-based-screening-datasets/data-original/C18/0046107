Primary hypoadrenalism in a patient with the lupus anticoagulant.
 A 68-year-old man known to have the lupus anticoagulant presented with adrenal failure several weeks after undergoing a surgical procedure.
 Computerized tomography initially showed bilateral enlargement of the adrenal glands, but subsequently demonstrated adrenal atrophy and calcification.
 It is suggested that thrombosis of the adrenal vessels due to the presence of the lupus anticoagulant may have occurred.
 In unexplained primary hypoadrenalism with enlargement of the adrenal glands, the presence of the lupus anticoagulant should be excluded.
