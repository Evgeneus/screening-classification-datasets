Obesity in minority populations: policy implications of research.
 Obesity is a major health problem for many Americans, with an overall prevalence for adults of approximately 25% and a range for specific subgroups of 24-75%.
 This range is striking and reflects many factors shown to influence the development and maintenance of obesity, including physical activity, diet, ethnicity, income, education, and genetic susceptibility.
 Many minority populations have higher prevalences of obesity and, thus, experience its adverse health consequences disproportionately.
 Research in diverse populations indicates that the relative importance of risk factors for cardiovascular disease varies in many populations.
 Data characterizing the profile of risk factors, including obesity and physical activity, for various special populations are limited and some, such as obesity, are based on standards developed in the general population.
 For public health policy and interventions to succeed, they must address the needs of special populations and of the overall population.
 This paper discusses some of the relevant broader social and research issues.
