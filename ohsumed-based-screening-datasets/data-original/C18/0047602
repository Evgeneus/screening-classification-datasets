Nutritional assessment of children in drought-affected areas--Haiti, 1990.
 From January through June 1990, a drought occurred in the Caribbean nation of Haiti.
 To determine whether the nutritional status of young children had been affected by drought-related reductions in food supply, in September 1990 a nutrition survey was conducted in the five departments most affected (Nord-Ouest, Nord, Nord-Est, Artibonite, and Centre) of Haiti's nine departments.
