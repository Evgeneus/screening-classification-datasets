Rice solution and World Health Organization solution by gastric infusion for high stool output diarrhea.
 We sought to determine the efficacy of three different types of treatment in children with acute diarrhea who, during the oral rehydration period, had high stool output (greater than 10 mL/kg per hour).
 Sixty-six children, aged 1 to 18 months, with an average stool output of 22.6 mL/kg per hour were randomly distributed into three groups: group 1 received a rice flour solution, group 2 received the World Health Organization rehydration solution by gastric infusion, and group 3 continued to receive this solution orally.
 In all three groups, a decrease in stool output was observed, with the higher decrease observed in group 1 patients.
 Such a decrease facilitated rehydration of all 22 patients in group 1 (100%) in 3.3 +/- 1.5 hours, 16 (73%) in group 2 in 4.3 +/- 2.1 hours, and 15 (69%) in group 3 in 4.9 +/- 2.0 hours.
 No complications were observed.
 These data indicate that the rice flour solution is effective in children with high stool output diarrhea.
