Exclusive expression of MHC class II proteins on CD45+ cells in pancreatic islets of NOD mice.
 The expression of MHC class II molecules on beta-cells of the pancreatic islet has been proposed to play a role in the genesis of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in the NOD mouse.
 We investigated this by immunofluorescent double labeling of islet cells with anti-MHC and anti-CD45 to identify cells of hematopoietic origin.
 MHC class I expression increased with age on CD45- islet cells.
 MHC class II expression was not observed on CD45- islet cells at any age; the only cells in the islet that were MHC class II positive were also CD45+.
 This indicates that all MHC class II-positive cells in the islet are lymphoid cells that infiltrate the islet, whereas the islet endocrine cells express no MHC class II molecules.
 However, an increase in MHC class I expression occurred on beta-cells, and this may play a role in immunopathogenesis.
