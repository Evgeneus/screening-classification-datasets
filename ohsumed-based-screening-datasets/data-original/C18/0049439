Immunosuppressive mechanisms in protein-calorie malnutrition.
 Protein-calorie malnutrition (PCM) induces immunosuppression leading to increased mortality rates.
 Impaired macrophage respiratory burst activity (superoxide anion [O2-] generation) occurs in PCM, but cellular mechanisms are unclear.
 The major pathway resulting in O2- production involves inositol lipid-dependent signal transduction.
 This study examined the effect of mild versus severe PCM on macrophage O2- generating signal transduction pathways specific for responses to Candida albicans.
 Mice (CFW/Swiss Webster: n = 300) were randomized to either control or low protein diets for 3 or 8 weeks.
 Peritoneal macrophages were harvested for O2- production, mannose-fucose receptor (MFR) expression, membrane phospholipid analysis, arachidonic acid (AA) content, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production, and protein kinase C levels.
 O2- release was impaired in both mild and severe PCM.
 MFR expression was also decreased at these time points.
 Inositol lipid content was significantly lower at the 8-week time point only, although PGE2 and AA were significantly higher in the low protein diet group at 3 weeks.
 Protein kinase C levels were unchanged by PCM.
 Thus, mild PCM significantly increases macrophage-PGE2 production secondary to increased AA phospholipid content, with subsequent inhibition of O2- and MFR expression.
 Severe PCM inhibits macrophage (O2-) through depletion of critical membrane phospholipid components with subsequent impairment in signal transduction.
