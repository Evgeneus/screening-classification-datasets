Laser photocoagulation control of diabetic macular oedema without fluorescein angiography.
 This study included 40 eyes in 22 diabetic patients with focal macular oedema.
 Laser photocoagulation was directed at decompensated or leaking microvascular lesions clinically detected without using pretreatment fluorescein angiograms.
 Post-treatment fluorescein angiograms performed after adequate clinical control of disease showed complete resolution of the macular oedema in 25 eyes (62.5%), whereas persistent leakage from microvascular lesions closer than 500 microns from the centre of the foveola was noted in 15 eyes (37.5%).
 These were clinically detected during the pretreatment examination and were found not to impair or threaten the patient's vision.
 Our data confirm the clinical impression that fluorescein angiography is not necessary for effective treatment and should be used only if necessary.
