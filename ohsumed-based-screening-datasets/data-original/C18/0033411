Changes in insulin response to glucose after exercise training in partially pancreatectomized rats.
 The effects of exercise training on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) were studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats made mildly to severely diabetic by partial pancreatectomy.
 Exercise trained (10 wk treadmill; T) and untrained (Unt) rats were grouped according to posttraining fed-state hyperglycemia as follows: T less than 200 and Unt less than 200 (glucose concn less than 200 mg/dl), T 200-300 and Unt 200-300 (glucose concn 200-300 mg/dl), and T greater than 300 and Unt greater than 300 (glucose concn greater than 300 mg/dl).
 After exercise training, hyperglycemic glucose clamps were performed in awake rats by elevation of arterial blood glucose concentration 126 mg/dl above fasting basal levels for 90 min.
 Exercise training significantly increased muscle citrate synthase activity.
 Prevailing hyperglycemia was reduced during the 10-wk exercise training period in all T rats with fed-state glucose concentrations less than 300, and only 53% of Unt rats in these groups had reduced glycemia.
 GSIS was significantly higher in T less than 200 [2.4 +/- 0.7 (SD) ng/ml at 90 min] than in Unt less than 200 (1.5 +/- 0.3).
 A similar response was found for T 200-300 (1.1 +/- 0.3 ng/dl) vs.
 Unt 200-300 (0.7 +/- 0.1) but not T greater than 300 (0.36 +/- 0.2) vs Unt greater than 300 (0.44 +/- 0.05).
 Sham-operated control rats had insulin concentrations of 6.6 +/- 1.6 ng/ml at the 90th min of the clamp.
 Acute exercise reduced fed-state glycemia in rats with mild-to-moderate (less than 300 mg/dl) diabetes.
