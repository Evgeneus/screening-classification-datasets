Megaduodenum due to hollow visceral myopathy successfully managed by duodenoplasty and feeding jejunostomy.
 A 29 year old man with a history of childhood polymyositis developed insulin dependent diabetes and was found coincidentally to have chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction due to visceral myopathy.
 Multiple full thickness biopsy specimens showed severe disease in the duodenum and the proximal jejunum only, with less involvement distally.
 Total parenteral nutrition has been avoided for more than a year by enteral feeding through a fine bore jejunostomy catheter positioned with its tip in the distal jejunum.
