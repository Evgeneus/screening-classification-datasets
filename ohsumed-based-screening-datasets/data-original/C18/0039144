Relationship between apolipoprotein(a) phenotype, lipoprotein(a) concentration in plasma, and low density lipoprotein receptor function in a large kindred with familial hypercholesterolemia due to the pro664----leu mutation in the LDL receptor gene.
 In a large kindred of 66 individuals, 22 were identified as heterozygous and 3 as homozygous for a mutation (pro664----leu) in the LDL-receptor gene that gives rise to familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH).
 All the heterozygotes had a raised level of plasma total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, but were remarkably free from premature coronary disease.
 Determination of apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)) phenotype and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) concentration in plasma revealed that in many instances, involving individuals with various apo(a) phenotypes, there was no difference in plasma Lp(a) concentration between an FH heterozygote and an unaffected sibling with the same apo(a) phenotype.
 No significant difference in Lp(a) concentration was observed between groups of FH and non-FH of the same apo(a) phenotype, although in each case the mean value for the FH group was greater than that for the non-FH group.
 There was also evidence for an inherited trait that markedly increased Lp(a) concentration, which did not segregate with apo(a) phenotype or the defective LDL-receptor allele.
 The data provide no evidence for a strong multiplicative interaction between the gene loci for apo(a) and the LDL receptor.
