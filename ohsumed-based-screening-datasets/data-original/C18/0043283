Renal changes associated with cyclosporine in recent type I diabetes mellitus.
 The effects of cyclosporine A treatment on arterial pressure and renal function were assessed in 11 young patients with type I diabetes of short duration.
 Cyclosporine was started at 7.5 mg/kg/day, progressively decreased to 6.3 mg/kg/day at 6 months, and then continued at a lower dose (4.1 mg/kg/day) for an additional 3 months in patients in whom remission of insulin dependency was obtained (n = 6).
 After 3 months of cyclosporine, a slight but significant increase in arterial pressure (+5.2 +/- 1.5 mm Hg), a rise in renal vascular resistance (approximately 20%), a decrease in glomerular filtration rate (approximately 25%), and a fall in filtration fraction were observed.
 Such changes were sustained after 6 and eventually 9 months of therapy.
 The decrease in glomerular filtration rate observed during cyclosporine treatment contrasted with the lack of change in simultaneously estimated creatinine clearance; in fact, the creatinine clearance/glomerular filtration ratio increased from 1.07 +/- 0.05% to 1.33 +/- 0.09% within 3 months of cyclosporine therapy, thus suggesting an enhanced tubular secretion of creatinine.
 Plasma renin activity and urinary excretion of kallikrein decreased significantly (approximately 50%), whereas plasma aldosterone concentration remained unaltered and plasma concentration of potassium increased during cyclosporine therapy.
 These changes were observed in the presence of a constant urinary excretion of sodium and potassium and a constant body weight.
 All parameters returned to pretreatment values within 3 months after cessation of cyclosporine.
 These results indicate that cyclosporine given for 6-9 months at a moderate dose causes a deleterious but reversible effect on arterial pressure and renal function in young diabetic patients.
