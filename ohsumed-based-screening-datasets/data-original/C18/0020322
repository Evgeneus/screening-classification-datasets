Weight reduction in obese hypertensive patients.
 This study tested the feasibility of a low-technology office-based approach to weight reduction in obese hypertensive patients.
 Family practice residents were randomly assigned to either an experimental or a control group.
 Physicians in the experimental group were instructed in methods of weight reduction, which they then passed on to their patients.
 Patients of experimental physicians were seen monthly, their diets were discussed, and improvements were suggested.
 The control group patients received their usual care.
 After six months the experimental patients had lost significantly more weight than the controls and had significantly reduced the number of antihypertensive drugs while maintaining blood pressure control.
 After 12 months there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to weight loss, blood pressure, or number of antihypertensive drugs.
 Experimental and control patients who lost weight had visited their physicians more frequently than those who did not and had reduced the number of antihypertensive medications they were taking.
 This educationally oriented intervention trial is an example of the type of research that is practical to perform in a family practice center and is applicable in family physicians' offices.
