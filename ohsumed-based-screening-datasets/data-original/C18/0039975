Family-oriented nutrition intervention for a lipid clinic population.
 We have developed a unique, family-oriented approach to lowering plasma cholesterol concentrations in persons with familial hyperlipidemias.
 The approach includes individual clinic visits and group nutrition classes and uses dietary goals outlined in The New American Diet.
 A series of 13 nutrition classes is presented to small groups, usually composed of relatives from pedigrees with familial hypercholesterolemia or other familial hyperlipidemias.
 Dietary action goals, cooking demonstrations, food tasting, and finger-stick plasma cholesterol determinations are important components of the classes.
 Problem-solving discussion is encouraged in the group.
 Over the past 4 years, 143 hyperlipidemic individuals, along with at least 94 unaffected family members, have participated in 31 groups, which have met for at least six classes.
 Many clinic participants lower plasma cholesterol by 20% or more.
 Keys to the success of this program include emphasizing dietary therapy, using the family setting for nutrition intervention, providing hands-on experience with food and recipes, promoting problem solving for dietary action goals, measuring blood cholesterol during classes, and encouraging long-term follow-up for participants with physicians and dietitians.
