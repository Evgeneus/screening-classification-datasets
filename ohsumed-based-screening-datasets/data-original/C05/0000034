Osteoma of the middle ear. Report of a case.
 Osteomas of the middle ear are rare.
 We report a case of a 7-year-old boy with osteoma originating from the pyramidal eminence, combined with congenital cholesteatoma.
 The osteoma and cholesteatoma were successfully removed by tympanomastoidectomy.
 The long process of the incus and the superstructure of the stapes disappeared.
 The body of the incus was sculpted and used as a columella.
 Histopathologically, the osteoma was much the same as an external auditory canal osteoma.
 The possibility of a primary congenital origin of this neoplasm is suggested.
