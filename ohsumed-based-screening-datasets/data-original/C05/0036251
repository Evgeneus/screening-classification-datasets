Seasonal variation in the incidence of congenital talipes equinovarus.
 A review of 77 neonates who presented with congenital talipes equinovarus over a seven-year period revealed an increase in the condition amongst babies born in the winter quarter.
 This finding was particularly apparent among the less severe cases of club-foot.
 Possible reasons for this seasonal variation are discussed.
