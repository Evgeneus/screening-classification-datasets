Common variable hypogammaglobulinemia presenting as nontypable Haemophilus influenzae septic arthritis in an adult.
 Haemophilus influenzae is a rare cause of septic arthritis in adults.
 We describe a case of septic arthritis with nontypable Haemophilus influenzae presenting as the first invasive infection leading to a diagnosis of common variable hypogammaglobulinemia.
 Although nontypable strains have been shown to cause serious infections in adults, they are a rare cause of septic arthritis.
 Underlying immune deficiency should be considered in an adult who presents with invasive infection with Haemophilus influenzae, regardless of serotype.
