Zidovudine myopathy: a distinctive disorder associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.
 Muscle biopsy specimens were obtained from 48 human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients suffering from various neuromuscular symptoms.
 Microscopic examination by conventional and electron microscopy revealed a characteristic structural myopathy associated with mitochondrial changes in 13 patients, all of whom had received long-term zidovudine therapy.
 The mean cumulative dose they had received (498 +/- 145 gm) was significantly higher than that of the other 14 zidovudine recipients of the study.
 They suffered from a progressive, usually painful, proximal myopathy with pronounced wasting, normal-to-moderately elevated creatine kinase levels, and a myopathic electromyographic pattern.
 The condition usually improved after withdrawal of the drug.
 Assay of mitochondrial enzymes, including succinate-cytochrome c reductase, cytochrome c oxidase, and citrate synthase, showed a decline in respiratory chain capacity.
 Southern blot analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed no abnormality.
 It is likely that mitochondrial dysfunction, probably resulting from drug-induced inhibition of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase, is implicated in the pathogenesis of this complication of zidovudine therapy.
