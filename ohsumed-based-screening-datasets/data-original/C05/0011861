Rickets and osteomalacia are still around.
 The terms rickets and osteomalacia describe gross, histologic, and radiologic abnormalities common to more than 50 diseases that vary in cause and clinical presentation.
 Rachitic and osteomalacic syndromes seen in current clinical practice usually are resistant to vitamin D forms and are most often caused by phosphate loss or 1,25(OH)2D deficiency, or both.
 Radiographic identification of rachitic or osteomalacic syndromes and accurate diagnosis of a particular cause is essential, as many patients' conditions can be improved or cured with proper therapy.
