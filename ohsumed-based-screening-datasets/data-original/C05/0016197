Gallium uptake in tryptophan-related pulmonary disease.
 We describe a patient who developed fever, fatigue, muscle weakness, dyspnea, skin rash, and eosinophilia after taking "high doses" of tryptophan for insomnia for two years.
 A gallium-67 scan revealed diffuse increased uptake in the lung and no abnormal uptake in the muscular distribution.
 Bronchoscopy and biopsy confirmed inflammatory reactions with infiltration by eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes.
 CT scan showed an interstitial alveolar pattern without fibrosis.
 EMG demonstrated diffuse myopathy.
 Muscle biopsy from the right thigh showed an inflammatory myositis with eosinophilic and lymphocytic infiltrations.
