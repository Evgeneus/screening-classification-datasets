The foot and footwear.
 In the field of sports medicine we see increasing numbers of foot- and leg-related injuries that could have been avoided, either totally or in part, had the individual chosen the proper footwear.
 There is no such thing as the ideal shoe for all types of feet and all terrains, however.
 When an athlete has a chronic problem that does not respond to properly fitted shoes, a physician consultation should be considered.
