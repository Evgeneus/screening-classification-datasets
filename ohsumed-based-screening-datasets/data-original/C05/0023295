The neuroradiology of visual disturbances.
 The neuroradiology of visual deficits has advanced dramatically in recent years.
 Plain film evaluation of the orbit and face remains useful in the emergency room for the evaluation of trauma.
 High-resolution coronal CT remains the method of choice in the assessment of serious injury to the orbit and in cases of penetrating metallic foreign body.
 The contrast-enhanced orbital CT provides useful information in cases of tumor and infection and when the bones of the face or skull are involved.
 MRI has largely replaced CT in the search for brain infarct, brain tumor, and cerebral inflammatory and demyelinating processes.
 MRI is the study of choice in all cases of sellar and parasellar disease.
 It offers high-resolution images in any plane.
 GTPA enhancement has provided additional information from MRI without significant risk.
 The final selection of an imaging modality should be based upon the clinical presentation and any physical limitations of the patient.
