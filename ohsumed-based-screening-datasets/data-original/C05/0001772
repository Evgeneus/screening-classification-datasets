Progressive osseous destruction as a complication of HIV-periodontitis.
 A pathologic condition is described, characterized by rampant necrosis of gingival mucosa, periodontium, and related osseous structures associated with systemic infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 It is believed that this condition is an extension beyond the normal clinical course of HIV-periodontitis (HIV-P) and manifests itself in three progressive stages: (1) HIV-associated gingivitis, (2) HIV-P, and (3) an extension of HIV-P to osseous necrosis.
 Two cases of osseous destruction attending HIV-P are reported, one of which led to initial diagnosis of HIV infection.
 They represent the final stage of disease progression with localized necrosis of gingiva, periodontium, and alveolar bone.
