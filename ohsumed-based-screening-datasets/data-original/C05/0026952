The effects of Rumalon, a glycosaminoglycan peptide complex, in a partial meniscectomy model of osteoarthritis in rabbits.
 The effects of Rumalon, a glycosaminoglycan peptide complex (GP-C), were evaluated in a partial meniscectomy model of osteoarthritis (OA).
 When rabbits were treated with Rumalon, 0.25 ml/kg 3 times/week for 12 weeks after partial meniscectomy, the proportion of animals that developed cartilage ulceration was lower than that in untreated meniscectomized rabbits (p less than 0.05).
 At 6 weeks sacrifice, the same dose of Rumalon was associated with a trend toward reduction in the number of animals with ulcerations.
 Rumalon administered at a dose of 0.5 ml/kg for 12 weeks reduced the number of animals with ulcers, although not at the p less than 0.05 level of significance.
 Semiquantitative histologic evaluations revealed no differences between control and treatment groups either in the thickness of articular cartilage, density of cells present, safranin-O stain or ratio of DNA/protein.
 Increased proteoglycan synthesis characteristic of OA was modulated toward normal in association with Rumalon therapy.
 Diminished OA changes in response to Rumalon are consistent with an ameliorative response to this agent in the partial meniscectomy model in the rabbit.
