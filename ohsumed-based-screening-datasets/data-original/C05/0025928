The contributing role of condylar resorption to skeletal relapse following mandibular advancement surgery: report of five cases.
 The contribution of condylar resorption to relapse following mandibular advancement surgery has not been fully evaluated, yet may contribute substantially to postoperative occlusal and skeletal changes too often considered simply as "relapse." Five cases showing a typical relapse pattern are presented, illustrating the role of condylar resorption.
 Preoperative factors that may contribute to the development of condylar resorption (age, sex, high preoperative mandibular plane angle, and the presence of preoperative temporomandibular joint disease), as well as intraoperative and postoperative factors, are discussed.
 A target group is defined in which special considerations should be made with regard to preoperative and postoperative management.
