Roentgenographic assessment in hallux valgus.
 Which simple roentgenographic angle should be used to assess medial (varus) deviation of the first metatarsal in cases of hallux valgus has been a topic of debate.
 Measurements were made from roentgenograms of 100 symptomatic feet in women with hallux valgus.
 These were compared with similar measurements obtained from symptomatic normal feet of women of a similar age distribution.
 The hallux valgus angle was associated with medial deviation of the first metatarsal measured by all three of the parameters defined and tested, i.e., the intermetatarsal, metatarsus primus varus, and metatarsus omnis varus angles.
 Of these, the best measure was the intermetatarsal angle, which in the hallux valgus feet differed significantly from controls more than the other measurements.
 No evidence was found to support any concept of second metatarsal deviation from normal.
