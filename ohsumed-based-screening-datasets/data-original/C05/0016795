Serum levels of bone Gla-protein in inhabitants exposed to environmental cadmium.
 Serum levels of bone Gla-protein (BGP)--the vitamin K-dependent CA2(+)-binding protein--were evaluated in 76 cadmium (Cd)-exposed subjects with renal tubular dysfunction (32 men, 44 women) and 133 nonexposed subjects (53 men, 80 women).
 Serum BGP levels were higher in the Cd-exposed subjects than in nonexposed subjects.
 Significant correlations between BGP and each index measured by bone microdensitometry (MD), serum alkaline phosphatase activity, and Cd in blood and urine were found.
 For all of the Cd-exposed and nonexposed men and women, BGP showed a significant standard partial regression coefficient (multiple regression analysis) with the metacarpal index (MCI), which was one of the MD indicators.
 Bone Gla-protein also correlated significantly with urinary beta 2-microglobulin in the men and with serum creatinine in the women.
 Serum BGP values strongly reflect the degree of bone damage and also reflect, although less strongly, the degree of renal damage induced by exposure to Cd.
