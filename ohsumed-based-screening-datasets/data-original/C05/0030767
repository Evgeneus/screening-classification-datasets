Nerve blocks for cutaneous surgery on the foot.
 Anesthesia for cutaneous surgery on the foot is often achieved by local infiltration.
 However, procedures that involve large surface areas are anesthetized more effectively with peripheral nerve blocks.
 This discussion of peripheral nerve blocks for the feet includes an overview of the relevant sensory innervation, a brief discussion of local anesthetics, a description of the techniques, and representative cases.
