Reversible hepatitis associated with diclofenac.
 We describe the clinical features, liver histology, and ultrastructure in reversible diclofenac-induced hepatitis and review previous reports of this entity.
 Although rarely reported, diclofenac hepatitis may be severe, and even fatal.
 Symptoms, which develop from 1 week to 11 months after starting the drug, include jaundice, pruritus, fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and rash.
 Bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase are mildly elevated, transaminases often markedly so.
 The nature of the idiosyncratic injury appears variable, some cases having features of a hypersensitivity reaction, most being more suggestive of a toxic metabolic effect.
 Light microscopy shows a nonspecific hepatitis with portal and lobular activity, and focal hepatocellular injury that may progress to zonal or massive necrosis.
 The ultrastructural features in our case are typical of drug or toxin injury.
 This may be of value in distinguishing this entity from other forms of hepatitis, which is important in view of the frequent reversibility of this potentially lethal form of injury.
