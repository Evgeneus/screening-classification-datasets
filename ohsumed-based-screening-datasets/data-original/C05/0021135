Deficiency of osteoclasts in osteopetrotic mice is due to a defect in the local microenvironment provided by osteoblastic cells.
 We have reported that osteoblastic cells are required for differentiation of osteoclast progenitors in splenic tissues into multinucleated osteoclasts.
 In the present study we examined the pathogenesis of the osteoclast deficiency in osteopetrotic (op/op) mice using a coculture system of spleen cells and osteoblastic cells.
 When spleen cells obtained from op/op or normal (+/?) littermates of op/+ parent mice were cocultured with osteoblastic cells obtained from calvaria of normal ddy strain mice, numerous tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated cells (MNCs) were formed in the presence of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1 alpha,25(OH)2D3].
 Most of the TRAP-positive MNCs bound [125I]salmon calcitonin.
 This suggests that there is no abnormality in the osteoclast progenitors present in the splenic tissues of op/op mice.
 When osteoblastic cells from +/? littermates were cocultured with normal spleen cells from ddy mice, TRAP-positive MNCs were similarly formed in response to 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3.
 In contrast, in cocultures of op/op osteoblastic cells with normal spleen cells, no TRAP-positive cells appeared, even in the presence of 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3.
 The op/op mutation was recently reported to exist in the coding region of the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) gene.
 Adding M-CSF and 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 to the coculture with op/op osteoblastic cells induced the appearance of TRAP-positive MNCs with calcitonin receptors.
 These results clearly indicate that osteoclast deficiency in op/op mice is due to a defect in the local microenvironment in bone, in which M-CSF produced by osteoblastic cells plays a critical role in osteoclast development.
