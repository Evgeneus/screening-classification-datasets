Vertebral Candida infections. A case report and review of the literature.
 Vertebral Candida infection in a 57-year-old woman became symptomatic three months following Candida septicemia associated with a central venous catheter.
 The infection was successfully treated with amphotericin B and ketoconazole.
 Review of the literature revealed 29 cases of Candida infection with vertebral involvement.
 Intravenous drug abuse and central venous catheters were identified as predisposing factors in 13 cases.
 An average delay from Candida septicemia until the time the patient sought treatment was 3.3 months.
 Antifungal agents generally resulted in resolution of the infection.
