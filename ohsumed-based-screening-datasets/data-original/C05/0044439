Relapsing polychondritis and Reiter's syndrome.
 We describe a case of relapsing polychondritis associated with Reiter's Syndrome in a 46-year-old white man.
 Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disorder of unknown etiology associated in about 30% of cases with other rheumatic disorders such as connective tissue diseases, vasculitis and exceptionally, seronegative spondyloarthritis.
 We found this association only once in our review of the literature.
