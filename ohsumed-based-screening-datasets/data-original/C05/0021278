Chiari's osteotomy in the treatment of Perthes' disease.
 Seventeen patients, with an average age of nine years 11 months, underwent 18 Chiari osteotomies for the treatment of painful subluxation of the hips following Perthes' disease.
 The average follow-up period was four years three months.
 The 13 patients reviewed clinically all did well and none complained of pain or instability.
 The radiographs were examined in all 17 cases.
 The average centre-edge angle and percentage femoral head cover were definitely improved by the operation.
 No significant medical displacement of the femoral head was achieved.
 The clinical success may result from improved femoral head coverage and diminished eccentricity.
 Chiari's osteotomy is recommended for adolescent patients with painful subluxation of the hip as a consequence of Perthes' disease.
