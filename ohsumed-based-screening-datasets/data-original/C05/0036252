Ultrasonography in transient synovitis and early Perthes' disease.
 We used ultrasonography to examine 36 children suffering from transient synovitis and 12 children with early Perthes' disease.
 Widening of the joint space was revealed by ultrasonography in all affected hips with either disease.
 In the patients with transient synovitis, capsular distension was attributed to synovial effusion, while in the patients with Perthes' disease it was produced by thickening of the synovial membrane.
 Neither capsular distension nor thickening of the joint cartilage was seen in the contralateral normal hip in the patients with transient synovitis, but they were common in early Perthes' disease.
 Ultrasonography may provide significant diagnostic clues to differentiate early Perthes' from transient synovitis.
