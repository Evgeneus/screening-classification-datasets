Developing spinal column: gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging.
 Enhancement characteristics of the normally developing spinal column were examined in magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in 58 children aged 7 days to 9 years.
 With a 1.5-T imager, short-repetition-time spin-echo images were obtained before and after the administration of 0.1 mmol/kg gadopentetate dimeglumine.
 Enhancement of normal bone marrow was seen in all patients aged less than 7 years; it was marked only in patients aged less than 2 years.
 Enhancement of normal cartilage, seen in all patients aged less than 1 1/2 years, may be the most striking feature of enhanced MR images of the infant spine.
 Enhancement of both bone marrow and cartilage in children appears to be due to the unusual prominence of vasculature, associated with permeability of the capillary endothelium and a plentiful extravascular space.
 Although marked and diffuse enhancement of vertebral bodies in adults is often thought to indicate a pathologic marrow state, caution must be used before the same criteria are applied to children.
