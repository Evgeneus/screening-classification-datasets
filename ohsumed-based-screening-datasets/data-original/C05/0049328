Effect of daily etidronate on the osteolysis of multiple myeloma.
 Progressive bone disease in multiple myeloma frequently leads to osteolysis, bone resorption, pathologic fractures, vertebral compression, and hypercalcemia.
 We conducted a double-blind study in 173 newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients of etidronate disodium (EHDP), a diphosphonate compound that reduces bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclastic activity.
 The patients were randomly assigned to receive oral EHDP 5 mg/kg/d or placebo until death or discontinuation due to intolerance or refusal.
 The extent of vertebral deformity was measured by a vertebral index as well as height.
 The frequency of pathologic fractures, hypercalcemia, and bone pain was regularly assessed, as well as size and number of osteolytic lesions.
 All patients received melphalan and prednisone daily for 4 days every 4 weeks as the primary chemotherapy for their disease.
 Although the repeated measures analysis showed a significant height loss, there was no difference between treatment arms (P = .98).
 There was no significant difference in bone pain, episodes of hypercalcemia, or development of pathologic fractures.
 Patients on EHDP showed less deterioration in their vertebral index, but this difference only approached statistical significance (P = .07).
 We conclude that EHDP therapy used in this dosage schedule does not have a clinically significant impact in multiple myeloma.
