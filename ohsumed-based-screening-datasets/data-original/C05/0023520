Percutaneous suction aspiration for osteomyelitis. Report of two cases.
 The nucleotome, a recently developed instrument for percutaneous disc excision, was used for suction aspiration in two cases of osteomyelitis of the spine.
 The technique obtained significant amounts of pus, serosanguinous material, and tissue, which provided adequate samples for histologic examination and culture.
 Both patients obtained immediate relief of pain after a significant amount of pus and infected material was removed.
 Appropriate antibiotics were used for subsequent control of the infections.
 The risk and morbidity of this technique are no greater than with conventional needle biopsy.
