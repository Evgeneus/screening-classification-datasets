Foreign-body-associated experimental osteomyelitis induced with Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis in rabbits.
 Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus epidermidis, alone and in combination, were used to induce foreign-body-associated osteomyelitis in a rabbit model.
 In this model, a catheter, used as a foreign body, was implanted into the medullary cavity of the tibia.
 Only two of five animals infected with S.
 epidermidis alone developed culture-positive osteomyelitis, whereas all three animals infected with B.
 fragilis alone developed osteomyelitis.
 All six animals infected with both microorganisms developed culture-positive osteomyelitis.
 Roentgenographic and histologic evaluations confirmed the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.
 Transmission and scanning electron microscopy showed that when the two microorganisms are involved in a mixed infection, S.
 epidermidis predominates on the foreign body and B.
 fragilis predominates in the infected bone and marrow.
