Fine-detail panoramic radiography by free-focus radiography. A clinical demonstration of diagnostic radiographs.
 Previous comprehensive clinical studies have shown that free-focus radiography (FFR) may be used to improve image detail and diagnostic value in panoramic radiography of the teeth and jaws.
 This study demonstrated the clinical image quality in fine-detail panoramic FFR surveys relative to conventional surveys made by rotational panoramic or intraoral radiography.
 Cases of particular diagnostic interest with respect to common dental disease and changes in the jaws were included.
 The radiographic area of diagnostic interest depicted in FFR surveys generally resembled that of conventional dental radiographic surveys with the use of intraoral films rather then those of conventional rotational panoramic surveys.
