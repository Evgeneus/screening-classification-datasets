Anterior spine fusion using Zielke instrumentation for adult thoracolumbar and lumbar scoliosis.
 Analysis of adult patients undergoing anterior spine fusions with Zielke instrumentation between January 1983 and November 1986 was performed.
 Objectives were to review results of surgical treatment and identify factors affecting results.
 Charts, 3 foot standing anteroposterior and lateral and supine maximal side bending radiographs were reviewed.
 Subjective data were obtained by telephone.
 There were 26 patients, average age 41 years.
 Average radiographic follow-up was 48 months.
 Indications were pain and curve progression.
 Average correction was 63% of the instrumented curve.
 Average change of lordosis was 8 degrees and kyphosis was 6 degrees.
 Apical vertebral rotation corrected an average of 37%.
 Complications were: eight hardware failures, one deep infection, and two psychiatric events.
 The high-risk groups: curves greater than 60 degrees, patients older than 50 years of age, and rigid curves.
