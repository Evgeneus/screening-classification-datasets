Hemorrhagic subcutaneous bursitis.
 Hemarthrosis is a well recognized complication of a number of conditions.
 Hemorrhagic subcutaneous bursitis is less understood.
 We encountered a patient with a myeloproliferative disease who developed hemorrhagic olecranon bursitis.
 Upon reviewing other patients with subcutaneous bursitis, we found that hemorrhagic bursitis also occurs in the setting of traumatic or idiopathic bursitis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, and septic bursitis.
