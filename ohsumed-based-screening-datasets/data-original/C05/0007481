Rotator cuff lesions: signal patterns at MR imaging.
 The signal intensity patterns of rotator cuff lesions at magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were evaluated in 80 patients who had surgical correlation and in 13 asymptomatic individuals (14 shoulders).
 Six cadaver shoulders were examined with MR, and histologic correlation was obtained in four.
 All studies were performed at 1.5 T with a flexible circular surface coil.
 The accuracy of MR imaging in detection of full-thickness cuff tears (31 patients) was 0.95 and of partial thickness tears (16 patients), 0.84.
 The most common and accurate pattern for full-thickness cuff tears (22 of 31 tears) was a region of intense signal seen on T2-weighted images.
 Less often the torn region consisted of an extremely degenerated and attenuated tendon with moderate signal intensity or was obscured by low-signal-intensity scar.
 The intense signal pattern on T2-weighted images was also accurate, although a less common finding (seven of 16 cases), in the diagnosis of partial tears.
 Tendinitis was recognized as focal or diffuse regions of increased signal intensity or a nonhomogeneous pattern of increased signal often associated with tendinous enlargement.
 In some patients, manifestations of subacromial-subdeltoid bursitis was present.
 Tendon degeneration was also manifested as regions of increased signal intensity.
 Some similarity and overlap of signal patterns of partial interstitial tears, tendinitis, and tendon degeneration are observed.
