Chondrocyte nonresponsiveness of arthritic articular cartilage caused by short term immobilization.
 We studied the effect of short term immobilization on chondrocyte synthetic function.
 Arthritis from intraarticular injection of either glucose oxidase or interleukin 1 (IL-1) led to suppression of proteoglycan synthesis.
 Extension casting of arthritic knees prevented inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis, whereas later casting restored synthesis to normal.
 During chronic antigen induced arthritis casting protected chondrocyte synthesis for a period of 5 days.
 The chondrocyte nonresponsiveness was not from altered penetration of suppressing substances.
 Radiolabelled biologically active IL-1 showed no difference in retention or localization in articular cartilage of either mobile or immobile knees.
 Flexion casting did not induce unresponsiveness of chondrocytes and suppression of synthesis was similar to that in mobile arthritic knees, indicating the importance of loading.
 The nonresponsiveness occurred only during immobilization and rapidly disappeared after removal of the cast, provided that suppressing agents were still present.
 Thus, during short term immobilization chondrocytes are protected from inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis by suppressing agents.
 This protection may benefit repair of the depleted cartilage matrix with waning inflammation.
