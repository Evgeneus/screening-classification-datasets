Rhabdomyolysis and operating position.
 Rhabdomyolysis during routine surgery was studied in three groups of patients who had surgery, with limited trauma to muscle, in the lateral and supine positions, and prone on the spinal frame.
 A range of blood tests was performed (before surgery, and on the first, third and seventh day after operation).
 These showed that a creatine kinase increase in the 24 hours and the early appearance of myoglobin in the serum were the best indicators.
 Rhabdomyolysis was associated with the lateral position and long lasting surgery.
 No blood test before surgery was of any predictive value.
