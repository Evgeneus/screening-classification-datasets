Does alternate-day cloprednol therapy prevent bone loss? A longitudinal double-blind, controlled clinical study.
 Osteoporosis is a serious side effect of systemic treatment with steroids.
 Cloprednol, a synthetic glucocorticoid with an anti-inflammatory potency twice that of prednisone, causes less calcium and nitrogen excretion than does prednisone in equipotent doses.
 Therefore a double-blind study was undertaken comparing the effects of alternate-day cloprednol and prednisone therapy on bone mineral density in 39 patients (cloprendol: 13 men and 8 women aged 48.5 +/- 2.8 years; prednisone: 9 men and 9 women aged 49.7 +/- 1.7 years) with lung diseases.
 Ten patients with asthma (9 men and 1 woman aged 37.8 +/- 3.7 years) inhaling daily beclomethasone served as control subjects.
 Trabecular and total bone density of the distal tibia and radius was determined quarterly during 1 year with a special-purpose computed tomographic system.
 Initial mean trabecular bone density of the patients receiving cloprednol and prednisone was 17% below normal.
 After a treatment period of 1 year, we found a loss of radial trabecular bone density (mean +/- SEM) of 1.33% +/- 0.49% in the cloprednol group and 2.38% +/- 0.69% in the prednisone group.
 In postmenopausal women, prednisone but not cloprednol therapy caused significant (p less than 0.01) trabecular bone loss (5.29% +/- 0.99% versus 0.70% +/- 0.65%).
 The control group lost 0.91% +/- 0.79%.
 Loss of cortical bone was insignificant in all three groups.
 In post-menopausal women, 1 year of alternate-day cloprednol therapy was associated with significantly less bone loss than was prednisone therapy in equipotent dosages.
