Ultrasound-guided aspiration for transient synovitis of the hip.
 We reviewed 15 children with transient synovitis of the hip who had aspiration of an effusion under local anaesthesia with ultrasound guidance.
 There were no significant complications; aspiration was useful for diagnosis and gave considerable symptomatic relief.
 We discuss the role of ultrasound in diagnosis and treatment.
