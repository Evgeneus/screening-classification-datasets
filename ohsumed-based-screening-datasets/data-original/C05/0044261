Distal transfer of the greater trochanter.
 After congenital dislocation of the hip, Perthes' disease and some other conditions, the femoral neck may be short and the greater trochanter in a relatively proximal position.
 Distal transfer of the greater trochanter is an effective and relatively simple operation to correct this deformity.
 We have reviewed 26 patients (27 hips) at a mean follow-up of eight years.
 Pain relief and improvement in gait were maintained in 74%, and the poor results were largely due to progression of osteoarthritis.
 We describe a 'gear-stick' sign of trochanteric impingement, which is useful in the pre-operative assessment of patients.
