Vascular complications of lumbar decompression laminectomy and foraminotomy. A unique case and review of the literature.
 The possibility of vascular injury should always be kept in mind during lumbar laminectomy.
 Patients with pre-existing vascular disease are predisposed to injury.
 Unexplained hypotension is highly suggestive of a vascular catastrophe and is an indication for more detailed examination, sometimes laparotomy.
 If the patient's clinical condition is stable, consider arteriography.
 The development of high-output cardiac failure in a patient who has recently undergone lumbar laminectomy is almost diagnostic of traumatic arteriovenous fistula.
 The best prognosis for recovery of acute vascular interruption occurs with immediate treatment within 24-48 hours.
 Continued awareness of the possible occurrence of these injuries and familiarity with their various manifestations will facilitate early diagnosis, prompt operative repair, and improved mortality.
