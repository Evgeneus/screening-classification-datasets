Adaptive and remodeling changes in the fractured mandibular condyle after open reduction using the Kirschner pin.
 Six cases of fracture of the mandibular condyloid process in which there was osteosynthesis using the Kirschner pin were followed radiographically for more than 1 year.
 Tracings were made to analyze the remodeling process.
 The clinical course of all patients was satisfactory, without functional disturbance or asymmetries of the mandible.
