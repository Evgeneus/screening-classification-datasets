Coronoid process elongation in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) after experimentally induced mandibular hypomobility. A cephalometric and histologic study.
 The present study provided an experimental model that allowed a cephalometric and histologic analysis of craniofacial growth in monkeys with induced translatory impairment of the mandibular condyle.
 Cauterization was performed anterior to the joint in nine experimental rhesus monkeys, while eight animals served as control subjects.
 The experimental procedure produced mandibular hypomobility in six animals, in three by means of temporomandibular joint ankylosis and in three by means of dense scar tissue formation anterior to the joint.
 In the remaining three experimental animals no restriction of mandibular mobility was created.
 Mandibular hypomobility was found to induce elongation of the coronoid process and was also associated with bone deposition in the gonial region.
 In contrast, normal remodeling of the gonial region was found in the experimental animals with normal range of movements and in the control animals.
