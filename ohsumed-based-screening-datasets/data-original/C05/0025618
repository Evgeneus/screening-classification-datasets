Bone growth and remodeling after distraction epiphysiolysis of the proximal tibia of the rabbit. Effect of electromagnetic stimulation.
 The effect of pulsed electromagnetic stimulation on bone formation was tested in a lower-limb-lengthening model in the rabbit.
 Limb lengthening was performed by distraction epiphysiolysis.
 A specially designed external distraction device allowed 10 mm of lengthening of the tibia.
 Coils to generate a pulsed electromagnetic field were clipped onto the distractor.
 Stimulation started after a distraction period of three weeks and was continuous for 18 weeks.
 A control group received the same treatment without stimulation.
 Bone formation in the elongated zone was evaluated by computed tomography, scintigraphy, and histology.
 Bone healing involved accretion of callus followed by a process of remodeling, resulting in the formation of a solid cortex.
 The formation of a diaphysislike structure at the original site of the metaphysis progressed from the distal end of the elongated zone upward.
 Electromagnetic stimulation had no effect on the rate or extent of bone formation and remodeling.
