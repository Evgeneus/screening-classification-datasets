Valgus high tibial osteotomy. A long-term follow-up study.
 One hundred twenty-eight knees in 107 patients with osteoarthrosis treated by valgus high tibial osteotomy were clinically reviewed.
 Patients were reviewed from three to 15 years postoperatively (mean, 7.5 years).
 The revision rate in the osteoarthrotic population was 10.9%.
 Patients who were older than 60 years of age at the time of surgery had results comparable to those patients who were younger than 60 years of age at the time of surgery.
 Women and men appeared to have a similar prognosis; 79.6% good and excellent results up to nine years; at ten to 15 years, 70% good and excellent.
