Radiation and pagetic osteogenic sarcomas.
 Radiation and pagetic osteogenic sarcomas should be distinguished from classical osteogenic sarcoma.
 Both occur in older patients with significantly greater comorbidity.
 Roentgenographically, radiation osteogenic sarcoma is typically sclerotic, whereas pagetic osteogenic sarcoma is lytic and associated with pathologic fracture.
 Radical resections give the best result, local control, and survival.
 Chemotherapy has not proven effective to date.
 Improvements in tumor imaging and more intensive chemotherapy regimens may permit limb-sparing surgery.
 Overall results remain poor, with approximately 15% five-year survival in each condition.
