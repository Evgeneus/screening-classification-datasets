Infections of the clavicle in children.
 Of 23 children with infections of the clavicle, 11 had pyogenic osteomyelitis, four had tuberculosis, and eight (infants) had congenital syphilis.
 Acute pyogenic infections were treated by drainage.
 Resection of the clavicle was performed in chronic cases.
 Curettage and antituberculosis drugs were effective for children with tuberculous infection of the clavicle.
 Procaine penicillin was used for the treatment of congenital syphilis.
 Biopsy is generally necessary to differentiate chronic infection from neoplasm.
