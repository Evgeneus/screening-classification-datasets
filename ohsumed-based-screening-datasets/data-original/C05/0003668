Fetal imaging in the skeletal dysplasias.
 Second-trimester diagnosis of fetal skeletal dysplasia is becoming increasingly common.
 By careful examination of the fetus for skeletal mineralization, shape and size of long bones and cranium, and abnormalities of other organ systems, a definitive diagnosis can often be achieved by ultrasound.
 Fetal radiography is very helpful in giving more information about bone shape and mineralization as well as in confirming the diagnosis.
 Subsequent obstetric management should be dictated by the natural history of the disease, the parents' wishes, and the gestational age at diagnosis.
 Because many of these disorders have a high recurrence risk, genetic counseling and follow-up are an important part of the management of these patients.
