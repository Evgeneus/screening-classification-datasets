Familial growth hormone releasing factor deficiency in pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.
 A mother with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism and her short son showed poor spontaneous growth hormone secretion, and provocation tests suggested a deficiency of growth hormone releasing factor.
 This is the first report of growth hormone releasing factor deficiency in pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism.
 The boy has responded well to growth hormone treatment over a period of three years.
