Misdiagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis in an elderly woman with gout.
 Polyarticular gout may be misdiagnosed in the elderly.
 This reflects the confusing clinical presentation of "diuretic gout" in the elderly, characterized by polyarticular onset, subacute symptoms, hand involvement, and early development of tophi.
 A misdiagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis can lead to poor treatment of gout, failure to recognize underlying renal insufficiency, and associated cardiac risks.
 Hyperuricemia may reflect systemic ATP depletion in acutely ill patients and thus represents a predictor for mortality.
 Medical treatment of polyarticular gout in elderly patients with compromised cardiac and renal function requires recognition of the clinical profile and consideration of the increased toxicity from standard therapies.
