IL-6 is produced by osteoblasts and induces bone resorption.
 To examine the possible involvement of IL-6 in bone metabolism, a mouse osteoblastic cell line (MC3T3-E1) and primary osteoblast-like cells from fetal mouse calvaria were cultured with several systemic and local bone-resorbing agents and their expression of IL-6 mRNA was determined.
 Local bone-resorbing agents such as IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, TNF-alpha, and LPS greatly induced IL-6 mRNA expression in both MC3T3-E1 cells and primary osteoblast-like cells.
 Parathyroid hormone slightly increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in primary osteoblast-like cells but not in MC3T3-E1 cells.
 Neither IL-6 nor 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 increased expression of IL-6 mRNA in either of the osteoblast-like cells.
 In agreement with the expression of IL-6 mRNA, biologically active IL-6 was produced in response to the treatment with IL-1 alpha, TNF-alpha, and LPS in MC3T3-E1 cells.
 Adding IL-6 dose dependently stimulated the release of 45Ca from prelabeled fetal mouse calvaria.
 Simultaneously adding suboptimal concentrations of IL-6 and IL-1 alpha induced bone resorption cooperatively.
 In accord with the increase in the release of 45Ca by IL-6, there were three times as many osteoclasts in the bone sections of calvaria cultured with IL-6 for 5 days as in the controls.
 IL-6 slightly suppressed alkaline phosphatase activity and collagen synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells.
 These results indicate that IL-6 is also produced by osteoblasts, preferentially in response to local bone-resorbing agents, and it induces bone resorption both alone and in concert with other bone-resorbing agents.
