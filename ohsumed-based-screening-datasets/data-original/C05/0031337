Surgical treatment of forefoot deformity with special reference to polyarthritis.
 Among 523 patients consecutively treated for forefoot pain and deformity, 64 had inflammatory arthritis.
 Most patients no longer had difficulties finding shoes that fit after the deformities were surgically corrected.
 Although about one half of the patients had some residual symptoms after treatment, 57 (89%) were satisfied with the operation.
 If the deformities are corrected early, joint resections can be avoided and toe function preserved.
