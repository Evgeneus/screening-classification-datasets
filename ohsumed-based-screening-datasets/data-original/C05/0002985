Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome. Recognition of a distinct clinicopathologic entity 
 The eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome is a newly described disorder related to the ingestion of L-tryptophan-containing products.
 Its presentation may mimic other disorders characterized by eosinophilia and muscle pain and/or weakness, but can be differentiated by certain characteristic laboratory and pathologic findings.
 We report two such cases, describe their features, and review similar syndromes.
