Pseudomonal osteomyelitis of the medial sesamoid bone.
 Because osteomyelitis may complicate puncture wounds about the first metatarsophalangeal joint, we believe sesamoid roentgenograms are mandatory.
 These views may show subtle demineralization, which cannot be seen on standard films.
 Treatment must include excision of the sesamoid and culture-directed antibiotics.
