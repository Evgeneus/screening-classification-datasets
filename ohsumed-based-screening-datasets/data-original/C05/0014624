Methods of treating plantar ulcers.
 The purpose of this article is to describe the indications, precautions, and fabrication techniques for orthotic devices the authors use to facilitate the healing of plantar ulcers.
 The methods of fabricating and applying three types of orthotic devices developed by the staff at the Gillis W Long Hansen's Disease Center--walking casts, walking splints, and cutout sandals--are described.
 Patient examples are given for each of the methods.
 These techniques, in conjunction with patient education and the use of special footwear, provide clinicians with procedures they can use to aid in the healing of plantar ulcers secondary to leprosy, diabetes, or other neuropathic conditions.
