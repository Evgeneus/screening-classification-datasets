Increased MR signal intensity due to cervical myelopathy. Analysis of 29 surgical cases.
 The cases of 29 patients with cervical myelopathy, who had been treated by anterior spine fusion, were reviewed.
 The relationship between pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) images was investigated with special reference to increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on the T2-weighted images and the relevance of this finding to clinical conditions.
 Preoperatively, there were areas of increased signal intensity in 12 patients whereas there were no areas of increased signal intensity in the other 17.
 The lesions were not clearly demonstrated on T1-weighted images.
 The pre- and postoperative clinical condition of the patients whose preoperative MR images showed areas of increased signal intensity in the spinal cord on T2-weighted images was worse than that of the patients who did not have areas of increased signal intensity.
 Of the 12 patients with regions of increased signal intensity preoperatively, five showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively compared to the preoperative levels and seven had no change.
 The postoperative recovery of the five patients who showed decreased signal intensity postoperatively was better than that of the seven patients who exhibited no change.
 The areas of increased MR signal in the spinal cord might be due to edema, cord gliosis, demyelination, or microcavities.
