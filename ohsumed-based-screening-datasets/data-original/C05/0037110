Ptosis caused by pachydermoperiostosis.
 Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare inherited disorder which presents with finger clubbing, facial enlargement, and periostitis.
 A case is described in which surgery for ptosis was performed and the differential diagnosis of the condition is discussed.
 The histological and ultrastructural appearances of the eyelids show sebaceous gland hyperplasia and excessive deposition of mucin in the dermis and would suggest that pachydermoperiostosis may be an example of a cutaneous mucinosis.
