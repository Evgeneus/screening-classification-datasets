HLA-D antigens and Paget's disease of bone.
 HLA-A, -B, -C, -DR, and -DQ antigens were determined in 25 Ashkenazi Jews with Paget's disease of bone.
 HLA-DR2 was more frequent in the Pagetic patients compared with 57 healthy controls of the same ethnic origin.
 This finding concurs with a previous report and raises the possibility that HLA-DR2 may be associated with Paget's disease of bone, probably by predisposing the bone cells to viral infection.
