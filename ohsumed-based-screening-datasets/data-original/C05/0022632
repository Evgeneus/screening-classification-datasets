Sports-related Kienbock's disease.
 Ten patients with Kienbock's disease who were actively engaged in sports activities involving repeated minimal trauma to the wrist are presented.
 Comparative studies between the 10 patients with sports-related Kienbock's disease and 82 manual laborers with Kienbock's disease showed no difference in clinical presentation or radiographic findings.
 The history of repeated minimal trauma appeared to be similar in the two groups.
 Therefore, sports activities in which the wrist suffers repeated impact can lead to the development of Kienbock's disease identical to that occurring in manual laborers, although the sports group was younger and had smaller ulnar variance.
 Radial osteotomy improved clinical symptoms even in sports-related Kienbock's disease.
