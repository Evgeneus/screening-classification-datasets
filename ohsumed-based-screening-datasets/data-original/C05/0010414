Remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema in young adults: a subset of rheumatoid arthritis or a distinct syndrome?
 Three young adult patients with seronegative symmetrical polysynovitis affecting the peripheral joints with pitting oedema of both dorsum of hands and feet are described.
 All of these patients had a benign course and resolved completely within 10-15 months of the onset.
 None developed any deformities or erosions and/or relapse of arthritis after prolonged follow-up.
