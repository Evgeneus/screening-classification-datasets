Incidence and management of airway problems in the CHARGE Association.
 The airway problems associated with anaesthesia in patients with the CHARGE Association have been underreported.
 We undertook a retrospective review of 50 cases, of which anaesthetic records were available for 37 patients.
 Apart from choanal atresia and cleft lip and palate, 56% of patients has some other upper airway abnormality.
 There appeared to be greater difficulty in tracheal intubation with increase in age in four patients.
 The incidence and management of airway abnormalities are discussed.
