Production of platelet derived growth factor B chain (PDGF-B/c-sis) mRNA and immunoreactive PDGF B-like polypeptide by rheumatoid synovium: coexpression with heparin binding acidic fibroblast growth factor-1.
 We present evidence supporting the hypothesis that locally produced platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) B-like polypeptides, as well as heparin binding growth factor-1 (HBGF-1), are involved in stimulating the pronounced hyperplasia of rheumatoid synovial stromal fibroblastlike cells.
 Explanted rheumatoid synovial tissues in vitro spontaneously secreted, in a time dependent manner, mitogenic activity for rheumatoid synoviocytes that was neutralizable by anti-PDGF antibody.
 PDGF B/c-sis mRNA transcripts were detected in synovium from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (n = 5).
 Spontaneous PDGF B-like synthesis was detected by immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled PDGF B-like polypeptides secreted by explanted tissues.
 Furthermore, rheumatoid synovial tissues, particularly macrophage-like cells, immunostained specifically with anti-PDGF B chain.
 The extent and intensity of staining and mononuclear cell infiltration were highly correlated.
 Immunostaining of osteoarthritic and normal synovial tissues was significantly less than RA synovium.
 PDGF-B immunostaining of synovial specimens previously characterized for expression of HBGF-1, the precursor of acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF), revealed that the extent and intensity of expression of HBGF-1 and PDGF-B were highly correlated.
