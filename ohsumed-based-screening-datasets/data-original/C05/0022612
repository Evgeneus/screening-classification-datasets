Urate and calcium stones--picking up a drop of mercury with one's fingers?
 The evidence invariably cited to support the suspicion that urinary urate is a predisposing factor in calcium oxalate (CaOx) stone formation is critically reviewed.
 Analysis of the relevant literature shows that speculation is based on the clinical impression that CaOx stone-formers appear to excrete more urate than do normal subjects, and that allopurinol reduces the rate of CaOx stone recurrences.
 On balance, this is sufficient to suggest that a high urinary excretion of urate promotes CaOx stone formation.
 However, in the past, evidence to disclose the mechanism by which urate could exert this effect has been largely shrouded in confusion and controversy.
 The evidence for two theories that have dominated thinking in this area are reviewed and new findings are reported that indicate that neither can account for the purported effect of urate.
 It is concluded that dissolved urate in urine, at normal physiological pH values, directly provokes CaOx crystal nucleation by the phenomenon of salting-out.
 The possibility that urate promotes CaOx stone formation is further strengthened by its ability to increase significantly the amount of CaOx precipitated from solution and to cause the aggregation of individual crystals into large clusters.
 Future avenues of investigation that should assist in the formulation of diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines are presented.
