Repair of the severely contracted socket with meshed skin graft and semi-rigid conformer.
 Nine severely contracted sockets were reconstructed using a meshed skin graft in conjunction with a semi-rigid conformer-stent.
 Particularly useful following unsuccessful surgery with mucosal grafting, or in cases where for some reason mucosal grafts cannot be obtained, this technique is superior to current procedures utilizing nonmeshed split-thickness skin grafts.
