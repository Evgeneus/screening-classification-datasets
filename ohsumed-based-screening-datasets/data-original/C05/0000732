Chiari pelvic osteotomy for osteoarthritis. The influence of the torn and detached acetabular labrum.
 We assessed the results of Chiari pelvic osteotomy in 64 hips with early osteoarthritis in terms of acetabular labral detachment detected pre-operatively by arthrography.
 At an average follow-up of four years, assessment by the Merle d'Aubigne score showed 83% excellent or good results.
 These satisfactory results were achieved in only half the cases with a detached labrum, but in nearly all cases with normal or torn acetabular labra.
 Other factors such as the acetabular index, the level and angle of osteotomy, and the displacement following osteotomy did not affect the results.
 Chiari pelvic osteotomy is a worthwhile procedure for early osteoarthritis in selected cases, but a detached acetabular labrum increases the risk of clinical failure.
