Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia: a newly recognized multisystem disease.
 On the basis of five cases personally observed and one previously reported, we describe a disorder characterized by skeletal dysplasia, rapidly progressive nephropathy, episodes of lymphopenia, and pigmentary skin changes.
 Defects of T-cell function were compatible with an autoimmune process.
 The disorder is probably of genetic origin and inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.
