Mechanism of production of experimental scoliosis in rabbits.
 The hypothesis for the mechanism of production of scoliosis, advanced on the basis of morphometric and morphologic studies in human thoracic skeleton, finds further support in the results of an experimental study in rabbits described herein.
 The removal of transverse processes alone resulted in the production of scoliosis and lordosis.
 When both transverse processes and facet joints were removed, scoliosis developed rapidly and was considerable.
 When paraspinal muscles were incised on one side only, however, this resulted in the development of lordosis alone.
 The convexity of the curve was always toward the operated side, and the apex was almost always at the lowest operated segment.
 Lordosis was limited to within the operated area.
 The results of the experiment indicate that scoliosis resulted because of the asymmetry in load transmission through the ribs to the vertebral column in rabbits.
