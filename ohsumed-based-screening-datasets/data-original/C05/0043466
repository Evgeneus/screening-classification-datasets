Rectus sheath hematoma in an anticoagulated patient.
 Rectus sheath hematoma is an unusual though not rare cause of abdominal wall mass.
 There are multiple causes for RSH, and with a thorough history, usually some precipitating factor can be identified.
 Ultrasound and CT are useful in making an accurate diagnosis.
 Treatment is usually conservative unless the hematoma is enlarging or if the diagnosis is uncertain.
