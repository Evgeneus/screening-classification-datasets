The iliotibial band lateral sling procedure and its effect on the results of anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.
 The effect of iliotibial band "lateral sling" augmentation on long-term outcome in ACL reconstruction using free autogenous central-third patellar tendon was evaluated retrospectively.
 Eighty reconstructions were reviewed; the minimum followup was 2 years and the average was 4 years.
 Sixty percent of the procedures involved supplementation with a lateral sling.
 By both clinical evaluation and KT-1000 measurement, there were no differences in the results of patients with lateral sling augmentation and those without it.
 In addition, 40% of patients had chronic pain and/or swelling related to the lateral sling.
 We do not currently recommend the routine use of a lateral sling augmentation for ACL reconstruction using central-third patellar tendon.
