Temporomandibular joint dysfunction and selected health parameters in the elderly.
 Little research has focused on temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJD) in the elderly.
 The present study describes relationships between TMJD and selected health parameters in a population of 75- to 94-year-old Roman Catholic sisters (nuns).
 Mental, physical, and oral assessments made on 117 sisters identified 26 with TMJD.
 Among all sisters, TMJD was not associated with age, education, mental impairments, hand coordination, handgrip strength, mobility, or use of walking aids.
 In 75- to 84-year-old sisters, TMJD was positively associated with self-reported arthritis (p = 0.12), edentulism (p = 0.09), and the presence of complete dentures (p = 0.05), and negatively associated with the number of teeth present (p = 0.05), especially the posterior teeth.
 These associations were weaker in 85- to 94-year-old sisters.
 This study suggests that TMJD is associated with the presence of complete dentures and a low number of teeth, especially the posterior teeth.
