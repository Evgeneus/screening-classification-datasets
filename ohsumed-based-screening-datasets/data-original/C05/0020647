A technique for evaluating bony changes in the anterior edentulous maxilla: a modification of a cephalometric analysis.
 A modification of a cephalometric analysis is presented for evaluating maxillary bone loss in the edentulous maxilla.
 The analysis involves tracing a lateral cephalometric radiograph of an edentulous maxilla, identifying the new landmarks, and measuring the appropriate vertical and horizontal distances of the maxilla.
 Comparison of the measurements for the patient's initial or baseline radiographic analysis with those of the patient's follow-up radiographic analysis identifies the amount of bone loss that has occurred between the two examinations.
