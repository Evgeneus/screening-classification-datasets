Chronic compartment syndrome caused by aberrant fascia in an aerobic walker.
 The following is a case presentation of a 36-yr-old female athlete who presented with the symptoms and signs of chronic anterior compartment syndrome.
 Pre-exercise and post-exercise tissue pressure measurements revealed increased compartment pressures in both of her anterior leg compartments.
 Aberrant fascial bands overlying and compressing the anterior compartments were discovered at the time of surgery.
 Fasciotomies led to complete recovery and return to previous levels of athletic activity.
 This is the first report of aberrant fascia as a cause of chronic anterior compartment syndrome.
