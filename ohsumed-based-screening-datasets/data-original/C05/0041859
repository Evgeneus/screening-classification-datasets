Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis: a report of two severe cases.
 Two unrelated children with a severe form of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis are described.
 In addition to painful flexion contractures of all of the large joints, oral and skin lesions, and typical radiologic appearance of osteolytic defects, both girls had marked growth retardation and recurrent infections.
 Both children died in early infancy of overwhelming infection.
