Expression of heat shock protein epitopes in tubular aggregates.
 Tubular aggregates may be found in a variety of conditions and have been associated with a wide range of chemical and ischemic insults.
 We report clinical and histological features in a case of myopathy with tubular aggregates.
 The structure of these tubular aggregates was examined using antibodies to cytoskeletal proteins and heat shock proteins.
 Epitopes of the 72 kD heat shock protein were expressed in the areas of abnormality in this case and in a case of hypokalemic periodic paralysis with tubular aggregates.
 Heat shock proteins have a role in the modulation of the tertiary structure of proteins and may be involved in the pathogenesis of tubular aggregates and other microtubular abnormalities in muscle.
