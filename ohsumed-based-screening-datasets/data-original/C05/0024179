The distribution of S-100 protein in articular cartilage from osteoarthritic joints.
 The distribution and localization of S-100 protein was compared with safranin-O staining and H and E morphology in relatively unaffected, degenerative, and osteophytic regions of human articular cartilage from 26 joints obtained at the time of total joint replacement for osteoarthritis.
 S-100 protein immunoreactivity in osteophyte cartilage was more intense than in unaffected regions and comparable to the staining intensity found in metaplastic cartilage tufts in degenerating cartilage.
 Immunoreactivity for S-100 protein appeared more prominent in the deep layers of osteophyte cartilage adjacent to areas of matrix calcification.
