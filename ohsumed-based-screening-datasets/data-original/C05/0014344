Indium-111-chloride and three-phase bone scintigraphy: a comparison for imaging experimental osteomyelitis.
 To investigate the utility of indium-111-chloride (111In-Cl) imaging in detecting osteomyelitis complicating surgical or fracture sites, the proximal tibia of 11 dogs were experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus after creation of a cortical defect.
 The contralateral limb served as a sham-operated control.
 Animals were serially imaged by radiography, three-phase technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) scintigraphy, and 111In-Cl scintigraphy.
 There was a significant difference between infected (1.93) and noninfected (1.32) limb's tibia/femur count density ratios on 24-hr (p = 0.0001) and 72-hr (p = 0.0001) 111In-Cl images.
 A smaller difference was found for 99mTc-MDP bone-phase tibia/femur ratios (p = 0.0199).
 Using receiver operator characteristic analysis of tibia/femur ratios, a sensitivity of 61%, specificity of 88%, and positive (75%) and negative (79%) predictive values were determined for the 24-hr 111In-Cl images.
 Indium-111-chloride was superior to 99mTc-MDP in differentiating infected and noninfected operative sites.
