Aneurysmal bone cyst of the odontoid process: case report.
 Aneurysmal bone cysts (ABCs) are relatively uncommon, benign lesions.
 Fully 50% occur in long bones and 20% in the vertebral column, mostly in patients under 20 years of age.
 We report a case of an ABC in the odontoid process of a 74-year-old who sought treatment for pain and myelopathy.
 This is the first case reported of an ABC of the odontoid process.
