Compartment syndrome of the foot after intraarticular calcaneal fracture.
 Seventeen patients with a total of 21 intraarticular calcaneal fractures were examined at up to 30 days after trauma for the development of tissue pressure in the central plantar muscle compartment.
 Twelve patients had a significant increase in tissue pressure with values greater than 30 mmHg because of primary fracture hematoma or interstitial fluid accumulation.
 This increase in pressure persisted for three to five days after trauma, so that ischemic damage to the short plantar foot muscles had to be suspected.
 Plantar muscle scarring and claw-toe formation were observed in seven patients with a total of 11 fractures during a mean observation period of 18 months.
 The plantar aponeurosis, which forms the constricting fascial envelope of the plantar muscles, is the anatomic structure responsible for the compartment syndrome that may develop after calcaneal fracture.
 Therefore, to avoid functional deficit, plantar compartmental pressures should be regularly measured after calcaneal fracture.
 Significantly increased plantar tissue pressure greater than 30 mmHg should be relieved by longitudinal incision of the plantar aponeurosis, preferably by a plantar incision as soon as the diagnosis is made.
