Laser radiation at various wavelengths for decompression of intervertebral disk. Experimental observations on human autopsy specimens.
 The interaction of laser radiation with the nucleus pulposus from autopsy specimens of human intervertebral disks was evaluated at different wavelengths (193 nm, 488 nm & 514 nm, 1064 nm, 1318 nm, 2150 nm, 2940 nm, and 10600 nm).
 A significant correlation of linear least squares fit of the mass ablated as a function of incident energy was found for all lasers used except the Excimer at 193 nm.
 The 2940-nm Erbium:YAG laser was most efficient in terms of mass of disk ablated per joule in the limited lower range where this wavelength was observed.
 At higher energy levels, the CO2 laser in the pulsed mode was most efficient.
 However, the Nd:YAG 1064-nm and 1318-nm lasers are currently best suited for percutaneous laser disk decompression because of the availability of usable waveguides.
 Carbonization of tissue with the more penetrating Nd:YAG 1064-nm laser increases the efficiency of tissue ablation and makes it comparable to the Nd:YAG 1318-nm laser.
