The effect of carbonic anhydrase inhibition on calcium and bone homeostasis in healthy postmenopausal women.
 Carbonic anhydrase localized in bone resorptive cells generates the protons necessary for bone resorption.
 Inhibition of the enzyme is a potential mechanism for decreasing bone resorption.
 Eight healthy post-menopausal women received oral acetazolamide 250 mg twice daily for 28 d.
 Bone resorption, evaluated by serum acid phosphatase activity and the renal excretion of hydroxyproline, was unaltered, as was bone formation estimated by serum levels of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin.
 The fasting renal excretion of calcium was increased, whereas serum ionized calcium was unchanged.
 The maximal renal reabsorption of phosphate decreased, but it was not an effect of PTH as it decreased significantly during the treatment period.
 In conclusion, no significant effect on biochemical markers of bone remodelling could be detected during the study period.
 The observed changes in calcium and phosphate metabolism may be secondary to the renal effect of acetazolamide.
