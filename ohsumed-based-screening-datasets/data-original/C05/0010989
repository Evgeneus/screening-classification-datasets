Application of the polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence techniques to the detection of bacteria in Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis.
 Leukocytes in synovial fluid and peripheral blood samples from patients with Yersinia-triggered reactive arthritis were analyzed after DNA amplification using the polymerase chain reaction.
 The primers applied were specific for the virulence plasmid-coded 1crE genes of Yersinia enterocolitica O:3 and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis III.
 No Yersinia DNA was observed within the synovial fluid cells or peripheral blood cells by polymerase chain reaction techniques.
 However, Yersinia antigens were detected in the synovial fluid cells by immunofluorescence techniques.
 These results suggest that only parts of the causative agents, not the entire microbe, can enter the joint and initiate the inflammation that leads to a reactive arthritis.
