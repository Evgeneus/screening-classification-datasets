Transarticular cross-screw fixation. A technique of ankle arthrodesis.
 Many techniques of ankle arthrodesis have been described.
 Failure rates of up to 40% have been reported in the past.
 In this study, a technique for internal fixation of ankle fusions was employed using transarticular crossed-screw fixation.
 This provides bony coaptation, compression, and immobilization necessary for reliable union.
 Thirty-five patients had ankle arthrodesis with this technique of internal fixation and 12 patients had ankle fusions with Charnley compression arthrodesis.
 Follow-up evaluation averaged two years.
 The fusion rate was 100% (35 fusions of 35 attempts) with the transarticular crossed-screw technique and 83% (ten fusions of 12 attempts) with compression arthrodesis.
