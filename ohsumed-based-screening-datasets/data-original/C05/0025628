Results of innominate osteotomy in the treatment of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.
 Twenty-seven patients with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease were treated by innominate osteotomy.
 Satisfactory results were achieved in 96% of the patients, with a mean follow-up period of 9.3 years.
 Eleven patients included in assessment seven years previously were reassessed.
 Ten of these 11 patients showed improvement with continued growth in the shape of the affected femoral heads.
 A preoperative center-edge angle of less than 20 degrees is of prognostic importance.
 The presence or absence of a subchondral fracture before and at the time of surgery has not been found to influence the long-term results significantly.
