Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy in association with pulmonary tuberculosis.
 Three white male patients with advanced cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis presented with HOA.
 No other pathology to explain the osteoarthropathy was detected.
 The osteoarthropathy responded symptomatically to NSAI drugs and treatment of tuberculosis but resolved radiologically in only one patient.
