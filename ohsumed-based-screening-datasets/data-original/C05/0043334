Magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of partial growth arrest after physeal injuries in children.
 The precise delineation of the size, shape, and location of an osseous bridge is a critical step in the management of children who have a partial growth arrest of the epiphyseal plate.
 Five children between the ages of ten and fourteen years were diagnosed, with the aid of conventional roentgenograms, as having a partial growth arrest.
 Magnetic resonance-imaging studies were carried out to determine the exact size, shape, and location of the osseous bridge.
 The information derived from the imaging studies was essential for the determination of the appropriate treatment and for the planning and undertaking of any operative intervention.
