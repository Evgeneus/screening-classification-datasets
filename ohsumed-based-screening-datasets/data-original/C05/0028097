Hypotensive anesthesia for scoliosis surgery in Jehovah's Witnesses.
 Hypotensive anesthesia has been advocated in spinal surgery for the purpose of diminishing operative blood loss.
 This study evaluated its effectiveness in 12 Jehovah's Witnesses undergoing Harrington instrumentation and fusion who refused transfusion.
 Previous series from this institute did not use deliberate hypotension because of routinely low blood loss.
 Compared with matched controls operated on under normotensive anesthesia, the Jehovah's Witness patients had lower absolute blood loss but also shorter operative time.
 Applied linear-regression analysis demonstrated that the diminished blood loss was associated with shorter operative time (P = 0.0002) rather than lower blood pressure.
 The majority of blood losses in spinal instrumentation with fusion occurs with decortication.
 This rapid bleeding occurs at venous pressures which are unaffected by arterial blood pressure manipulation.
 The authors conclude that spinal surgery is possible in Jehovah's Witnesses without transfusion and that operative technique is the single most important determinant of blood loss.
