Synovial fluid 5'-nucleotidase activity. Relationship to other purine catabolic enzymes and to arthropathies associated with calcium crystal deposition.
 We measured 5'-nucleotidase (5NT) activity in synovial fluid from 159 patients with various diagnoses.
 The activity of 5NT was compared with activities of nucleotide pyrophosphohydrolase, alkaline and neutral phosphatases, and adenosine deaminase, in the same samples.
 Higher levels of 5NT activity occurred in synovial fluid from osteoarthritic joints than from joints of patients with gout, pseudogout, or rheumatoid arthritis.
 The highest levels of 5NT activity were found in synovial fluid from patients with Milwaukee shoulder syndrome and from osteoarthritis patients in whom deposition of calcium-containing crystals was also present.
