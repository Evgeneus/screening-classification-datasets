Capturing and clustering women's judgment policies: the case of hormonal therapy for menopause.
 Two hundred sixty-five women estimated the likelihood that they would take estrogen plus progestin to alleviate menopausal symptoms when faced with hypothetical cases varying in degree of hot flashes and risk of osteoporosis and cancer.
 Clustering of their judgment policies revealed four groups of women with respect to their approach to this decision.
 These groups of women were significantly different from each other on educational level, perceived experience of stress, and attitudes toward menopause and use of medications.
 Willingness to take hormonal therapy across all cases was related to attitudes about, and knowledge of, menstruation, perceived stress, mother's experience with menstrual problems, severity of symptoms, and use of vitamins.
 While there have been previous attempts to cluster rater policies, the current study represents a novel attempt to understand the differences between people who appear to have different policies about a decision problem, in this case, whether or not to take hormone therapy to counter menopausal symptoms.
