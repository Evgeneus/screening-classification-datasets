Lower limb problems in diabetic patients. What are the causes? What are the remedies?
 Peripheral neuropathy, infection, and peripheral vascular disease can produce serious problems in diabetic patients, particularly in the lower limbs.
 Ulceration of the foot may progress to gangrene and ultimately necessitate amputation.
 Distal symmetric polyneuropathy causes sensory loss.
 Such loss in patients with peripheral vascular disease creates a high risk for foot ulcers, which are vulnerable to infection.
 Treatment includes relief of neuropathic pain and antibiotic therapy for infection.
 Pentoxifylline (Trental) improves microvascular flow and appears to be effective against peripheral vascular disease.
 Aldose reductase inhibitors are being investigated as therapy for diabetic neuropathy.
 Prevention is the mainstay of management in these patients.
 Patient education is essential to help maintain health and prevent the potential adverse effects of diabetes.
