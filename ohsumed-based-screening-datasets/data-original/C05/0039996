Suppressive effects of monocytic cells and transforming growth factor-beta on natural killer cell differentiation in autoimmune viable motheaten mutant mice.
 Viable motheaten (mev) mice are homozygous for a recessive single gene mutation at chromosome 6.
 These mice develop numerous inflammatory and arthritic syndromes and exhibit abnormal B cell functions as well as lower T and NK cell activity.
 In this study, the differentiation of NK cells in mev mice was examined to elucidate the underlying basis for decreased NK activity.
 Although NK cells appear to be present in mev mice, their activity was demonstrable only when the spleen cells were enriched by nylon wool passage.
 Similarly bone marrow cells from these mice could be shown to contain precursors of NK cells when they were passed over nylon wool and transplanted into irradiated recipients.
 The adherent cells from both the spleen and bone marrow of mev mice suppressed the differentiation of NK cells from normal splenic populations.
 These suppressive adherent cells were F4/80(+), AsGm-1(+), Qa-5(+), and NK-1.1(+).
 They were not cytolytic when cultured in IL-2.
 Antibodies to a number of cytokines, such as IFN-alpha, -beta, and gamma, or TNF-alpha, could not reverse the suppressive effect of the adherent cells.
 Addition of anti-TGF-beta antibody could, however, overcome the suppression, suggesting that TGF-beta was partly responsible for the defective NK differentiation in the mev mice.
