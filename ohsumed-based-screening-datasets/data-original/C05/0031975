Complete ophthalmoplegia as a complication of acute corticosteroid- and pancuronium-associated myopathy.
 We report acute complete external ophthalmoplegia and severe myopathy in a patient treated with high doses of IV methylprednisolone and pancuronium.
 Awareness of this rare syndrome in a common clinical setting can lead to prompt recognition and avoid confusion with other causes of acute weakness and ophthalmoparesis.
