Arthroscopic stapling for detached superior glenoid labrum.
 Superior labral tears of the shoulder involve the biceps tendon and labrum complex which may be detached, displaced inferiorly, and interposed between the glenoid and the humeral head.
 We have treated ten young athletes with painful shoulders due to this lesion by arthroscopic stapling.
 Arthroscopy at the time of staple removal, after three to six months, showed that all the lesions had been stabilised.
 Clinical review at over 24 months showed an excellent or good result in 80%.
 The two relative failures were due in one to residual subacromial bursitis, and the other to multidirectional shoulder instability.
 Arthroscopic stapling can restore the shoulder anatomy, and it is recommended for active adolescent athletes with this lesion.
