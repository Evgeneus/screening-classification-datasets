Chin disfigurement following removal of alloplastic chin implants.
 Insertion and subsequent removal of alloplastic chin implants is not an innocuous procedure, as commonly believed.
 Ten women, aged 23 to 62 years of age (mean 45 years) are reported in whom severe soft-tissue deformities were observed 6 months to 6 years (mean 32 months) after removal of their implants.
 Resulting deformities consisted of chin ptosis and bizarre soft-tissue pogonial bunching and dimpling in repose or on animation in 9 of the 10 patients (90 percent).
 Asymmetrical motion of the lower lip was noted by 5 of the 10 patients.
 Two patients complained of pain and tenderness over the soft-tissue pogonion.
 The "bizarre" soft-tissue chin deformities, once established, are virtually uncorrectable.
 Presently, we recommend serious consideration be given to performing an immediate osseous genioplasty in patients requiring removal of alloplastic chin implants to prevent the evolution of such abnormalities.
