Radiological study of primary spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea.
 A radiological study of skull base anatomy was performed in patients presenting with primary spontaneous CSF rhinorrhoea.
 Radiology correctly identified the fistula site in 90 per cent of cases.
 Contrast CT imaging was found to be the most suitable technique for identifying the presence and site of CSF fistulae.
 However, pre-contrast bony dehiscences were identified in all patients leaking from the cribriform plate region.
 More significantly, all of these patients showed deviation of their crista galli, a radiological sign hitherto unreported.
 These findings support the theory that congenital bony dehiscence is the aetiological basis for this condition.
 The importance of radiology in the management of this condition is emphasized.
