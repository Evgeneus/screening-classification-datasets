Malignant osteopetrosis: hypercalcaemia after bone marrow transplantation.
 A 3 year old girl presented with malignant osteopetrosis, which was treated by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
 Successful engraftment was complicated by prolonged hypercalcaemia, which was controlled by a combination of a bisphosphonate, phosphate infusions, vigorous resalination, and salmon calcitonin.
 She was alive and well 16 months after the transplant.
