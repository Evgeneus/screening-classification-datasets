Motion analysis of the cervical spine in athetoid cerebral palsy. Extension-flexion motion.
 Frequently instability and premature onset of spondylosis of the cervical spine are found in athetoid cerebral palsy (CP) patients.
 These structural abnormalities appear to be related to athetoid motion of the neck in CP.
 Through motion analysis, the authors aimed to clarify the abnormalities of cervical motion that could precipitate structural abnormalities.
 The gross characteristic feature of cervical motion in athetoid CP is "whip movement." Both velocity and acceleration during extension-flexion motion were greater than in normal subjects, especially at the upper cervical levels.
 Also, a sudden increase in velocity and acceleration occurred during rapid motions at certain levels, followed by a larger range of motion of the cervical spine.
 Such kinematic abnormalities were thought to generate a greater shearing force and bending moment exerted on the corresponding cervical articulations-discs and facets.
 Olisthetic instability often accompanied disc degeneration at the upper cervical levels.
 A large range of extension--flexion motion of the cervical spine, analogous to a cantilever, caused a repeated bending moment of extraordinary magnitude and was regarded as a precipitative factor for disc degeneration and osteophytosis common at the middle and lower levels of the disc.
