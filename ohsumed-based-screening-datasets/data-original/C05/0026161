Analysis of clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory data on chronic fatigue syndrome.
 Much of the research conducted on chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is exploratory.
 The researchers' overall goal is to use clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory data to provide clues about the etiology of this syndrome.
 In preparation for this symposium, a review of numerous publications on CFS has indicated that the literature generally does not reflect the application of optimal statistical methods for exploration of data.
 Whenever the researchers' aim is to generate hypotheses, modern methods designed specifically for exploratory data analysis are likely to provide greater insights into any patterns of data than are the traditional approaches to hypothesis testing.
 In addition, the use of formal methods of data synthesis for ongoing and future research on CFS is a means of strengthening collaborative efforts and of improving the ability of researchers to interpret the evidence available that relates to specific etiologic factors.
 The inclusion on the research team of experienced biostatisticians, who would oversee the statistical methods and the development of innovative analyses, is recommended.
