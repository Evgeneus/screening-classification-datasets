Combined anterior and posterior fusion for spinal deformity in myelomeningocele.
 Since 1973, 50 of 54 children have been treated by the author with a combined anterior and posterior fusion.
 Twenty males and 34 females, ranging in age from 1 to 16 years, have been followed for a mean period of 5.5 years.
 Sixteen patients with a kyphosis averaging 113 degrees (range, 77 to 170 degrees) had correction of deformity to a mean of 35 degrees.
 Thirty-seven patients with a scoliosis averaging 73 degrees (range, 20 to 135 degrees) had correction to an average of 34 degrees (range, 0 to 75 degrees).
 There were 4 cases of deep wound infection successfully treated with drainage and antibiotics and only one case required implant removal after fusion/maturation.
 A pseudarthrosis was noted by radiograph in 6 patients, 3 of whom had isolated asymptomatic lumbosacral pseudarthroses.
 Three patients had pseudarthrosis at the thoracolumbar junction.
 These required repair and were successfully treated by supplemental posterior fusion resulting in an overall pseudarthrosis rate of 5.7%.
 Anterior fusion of the dysraphic spine allows greater correction of both spinal deformity and pelvic obliquity in addition to contributing significant strength to the fusion mass.
 Segmental spinal instrumentation with sublaminar and pedicular wiring to custom-contoured Luque rods provides excellent correction and immediate postoperative stability.
