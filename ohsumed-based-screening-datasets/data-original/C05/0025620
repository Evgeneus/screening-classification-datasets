Talipes equinocavovarus deformities corrected with the aid of a hinged-distraction apparatus.
 In 56 patients (70 feet) with talipes equinocavovarus, various components of deformity were surgically corrected in multiple stages with the aid of a hinged-distraction apparatus and concurrent training and rehabilitation of motion in the ankle joint.
 Good results were obtained in 53 feet, satisfactory results in 13 feet, and unsatisfactory results in four feet.
 The complications brought on by apparatus-assisted therapy of talipes equinocavovarus deformities require additional treatment but do not depreciate the method.
