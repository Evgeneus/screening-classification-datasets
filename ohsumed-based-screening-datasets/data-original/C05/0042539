Survival and management considerations in postirradiation osteosarcoma and Paget's osteosarcoma.
 Postirradiation and Paget's osteosarcomas are high-grade malignancies.
 The five-year survival was only 10% in recent experience at the author's institution.
 Progressive pain is an important clinical feature in both conditions.
 Careful roentgenographic studies demonstrate cortical destruction and a soft-tissue mass in virtually all patients.
 Metastasis was present in 25% of both groups of patients at presentation.
 In contrast to previous series, more than 80% of the patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma had had irradiation for malignant entities and more than 70% had been treated with modern radiotherapy regimens (cobalt-60 or linear accelerator).
 Twice as many patients with postirradiation osteosarcoma were evaluated and treated in the 1980s than in the previous decade.
 The initial indication for irradiation often was carcinoma of the breast, uterus, or cervix, or lymphoma.
 Two-thirds of the patients had progressive disease that was not controllable within six months after diagnosis.
 Early detection may be the only effective means of improving survival with postirradiation or Paget's osteosarcoma.
 These patients require lifelong follow-up evaluations.
