Vertebral body collapse due to primary amyloidosis.
 Primary systemic amyloidosis is a rare cause of vertebral collapse.
 We describe a patient with extensive systemic involvement who developed collapse of vertebral bodies L1 and L3 in quick succession.
 Primary amyloid was found on biopsy of L1, but plain radiography, isotope bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed no specific features.
