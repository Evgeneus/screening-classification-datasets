Postpolio syndrome and cardiopulmonary conditioning.
 Postpolio syndrome is a group of related signs and symptoms occurring in people who had paralytic poliomyelitis years earlier.
 New weakness, fatigue, poor endurance, pain, reduced mobility, increased breathing difficulty, intolerance to cold, and sleep disturbance in various degrees and expressions make up the syndrome.
 The reported incidence is between 25% and 80%.
 The origins are multifactorial and can be associated with underexertion, overexertion, inactivity due to intercurrent illness or injury, hypo-oxygenation, sleep apnea, deconditioning, and the failure of sprouted, compensatory large motor units.
 The exercise question in postpolio syndrome is related to the experience of new weakness or loss of muscle function due to overuse, which is often associated with injudicious repeated challenges to weakened musculature.
 Carefully prescribed exercise can be used for increasing strength and endurance and improving cardiopulmonary conditioning.
