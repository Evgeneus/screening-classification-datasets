Lovastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis.
 Lovastatin is a new drug that has become popular for the treatment of patients with hyperlipidemias.
 Rhabdomyolysis is a well-documented and potentially dangerous side effect of lovastatin therapy.
 Critical care nurses should be aware of the symptoms and treatment of rhabdomyolysis.
 Patients receiving lovastatin should be instructed to report muscle pain or weakness and dark urine immediately.
 It should be determined whether patients are at risk for development of rhabdomyolysis from other causes so that lovastatin can be withheld.
 Early diagnosis and treatment can prevent serious complications in patients with lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis.
