Computed tomographic assessment of old calcaneal fractures.
 Prolonged pain and disability are common complications of calcaneal fractures.
 A prospective study was conducted on the value of computed tomography (CT) in 63 patients with 73 calcaneal fractures sustained more than 6 months before.
 The fractures were classified from the initial plain radiographs, and the patients' current clinical condition assessed in terms of a "disability score".
 The mean disability scores (MDS) associated with the different types of fracture were correlated with the CT findings.
 The highest MDS was found in the intra-articular fracture group which comprised 71% of the series.
 In this group the MDS was increased in the presence of post-traumatic osteoarthrosis of the subtalar joint (61% of cases), involvement of the calcaneocuboid joint (39% of cases) and subluxation/dislocation of the peroneal tendons (47% of cases).
 Structural abnormalities of the peroneal tendons were associated with a higher MDS including chronic tenosynovitis (eight cases), chronic partial tendon rupture (eight cases), complete peroneus brevis tendon rupture (two cases) and scarring indicating stenosing tenosynovitis (14 cases).
 A similar spectrum of appearances affecting the medial tendons of the hindfoot was identified in eight cases.
 Direct CT measurements of the degree of comminution did not correlate well with the patients' MDS.
 In the patient with persistent symptoms, CT is of value in the later assessment of long-term complications by revealing abnormalities of the subtalar joints and adjacent tendons.
