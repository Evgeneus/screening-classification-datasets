Detection of circulating endothelial antigen.
 In order to determine whether endothelial cell antigens are detectable in serum from patients with rheumatic disease characterized by vascular involvement, we developed an ELISA using a monoclonal antibody directed against a 92,000 molecular weight endothelial cell specific antigen designated E92.
 Sera were assayed from 191 patients and 34 healthy controls.
 E92 was undetectable or present in very low concentrations in healthy controls and was elevated in most patients with an active rheumatic disease.
 Our results indicate that circulating endothelial antigens are present in rheumatic vascular syndromes and may provide a measure of endothelial cell function.
