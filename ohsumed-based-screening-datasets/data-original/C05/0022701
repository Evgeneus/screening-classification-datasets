Electromagnetic treatment of shoulder periarthritis: a randomized controlled trial of the efficiency and tolerance of magnetotherapy.
 The potential benefit of magnetotherapy was investigated in 47 consecutive outpatients with periarthritis of the shoulder.
 Using a controlled triple-blind study design, one group of patients received hot pack applications and passive manual stretching and pulley exercises; the other group received the same therapy plus magnetotherapy.
 Treatment was administered three times a week.
 For a maximum of three months, a standardized treatment protocol was used.
 There was no significant improvement in pain reduction or in range of motion with electromagnetic field therapy.
 After 12 weeks of therapy, the patients who received magnetotherapy showed mean pain scores of 1.5 (+/- .61 SD) at rest, 2.2 (+/- .76 SD) on movement, and 1.9 (+/- .94 SD), on lying, compared to scores for the control group of 1.4 (+/- .65 SD), 2.2 (+/- .7 SD), and 1.9 (+/- .95 SD), respectively.
 Linear pain scale scores improved from 71 to 21 for both groups.
 At 12 weeks the gain in range of motion was mean 109 degrees +/- 46.8 in patients receiving electromagnetic field therapy, compared to 122 degrees +/- 33.4 for the controls (not significant).
 At entry, the functional handicap score was 53.5 for both groups.
 At 12 weeks, it was 24 for the magnetotherapy group and 17 for the control group (difference not significant).
 In conclusion, this study showed no benefit from magnetotherapy in the pain score, range of motion, or improvement of functional status in patients with periarthritis of the shoulder.
