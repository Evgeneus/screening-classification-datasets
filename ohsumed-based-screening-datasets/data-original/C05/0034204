Ankle arthrodesis in children.
 The indications, surgical technique, and long-term functional results for ankle arthrodesis differ between children and adults.
 In children, the reasons for performing a tibiotalar fusion include pain, most commonly from traumatic and septic arthritis, and instability from congenital anomalies or paralytic disorders.
 The most appropriate procedure is Chuinard's fusion, which achieves a tibiotalar fusion without causing a growth arrest of the distal tibial growth plate.
 In the long term, young patients with ankle arthrodesis function very well with minimal pain or disability.
 Stressful activities such as hill climbing, stair climbing, and running may be restricted or require compensatory movements.
