Anaerobic pathogenesis: collagenase production by Peptostreptococcus magnus and its relationship to site of infection.
 Fifty isolates of Peptostreptococcus magnus from intraabdominal sepsis, nonpuerperal breast abscess, and diabetic foot infections were examined for collagenase activity using bovine type I collagen.
 Collagenase production was detected in a higher percentage of strains from nonpuerperal breast and diabetic foot specimens (P less than .001).
 This enzyme may be responsible for P.
 magnus playing a more central role in the pathogenesis of nonpuerperal breast abscess and diabetic foot disease than in intraabdominal sepsis.
