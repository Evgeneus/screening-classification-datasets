Total arthroplasty of the hip after childhood sepsis.
 Total hip arthroplasty was performed in 45 hips of 44 patients who had pyogenic arthritis of the hip during childhood.
 The average age of the patients was 36.4 years (range 19 to 50).
 The interval between active infection and arthroplasty ranged from 11 to 40 years, and average follow-up was 65.4 months (range 58 to 80).
 Specimens of tissue taken before and during operation gave negative cultures in all hips, and no patient had reactivation of infection.
 The mean functional rating of the hips was 58 points before operation and 90 at the final review.
 Complications were seen in 11 cases (24%), loosening of components occurred in six (13%) and one hip had to be revised for acetabular component migration.
 Acetabular allografts were required in 27 hips (60%).
 All allografts united but there was partial resorption of the graft in the non-weight-bearing area in all.
