Temporalis myofascial flap for maxillofacial reconstruction.
 To date, the temporalis myofascial flap has been used only to a limited extent for reconstruction in the maxillofacial region.
 Experience gained with 26 temporalis flaps in reconstruction of tissue defects in the periorbital region, skull base, maxilla, and oral cavity is presented.
 Only one patient developed total necrosis of the flap; significant necrosis did not occur in any other patient.
 The anatomy of the flap and surgical technique are briefly presented.
