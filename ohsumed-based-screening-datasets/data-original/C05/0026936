A behaviorally effective model for training of general health professionals by a rheumatology team.
 This project evaluated a model for inservice arthritis education based in part on principles of applied behavior analysis.
 Thirty-seven public health nurses (PHN) from 10 rural midwestern counties received instruction about screening and management of patients with arthritis; a random half of counties also received public and physician information interventions designed to increase arthritis referrals to community physicians under specific circumstances.
 In clinic interviews with patients of PHN showed modest, but significant, increases in 14 of 16 target behaviors attributable to inservice education.
 Because measured arthritis impact was low in this older adult population, physician referral rates were not affected by either intervention.
 This model illustrates generalizable behavior modification guidelines that are useful adjuncts to traditional procedures for development of professional arthritis education.
