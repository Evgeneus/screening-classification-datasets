New concepts in managing diabetic foot infections.
 Recent enhanced attention to diabetic foot infection--in both clinical care and research--has yielded a modified picture of this disorder.
 It suggests that certain diabetic patients may have important risk factors for the development of infection, and further, infections in these patients may not have the same clinical characteristics as the soft tissue or bony infections found in nondiabetic subjects.
 Treatment of diabetic patients should therefore be modified to conform to the particular characteristics of their infections.
