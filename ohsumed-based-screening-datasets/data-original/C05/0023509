Anterior and combined anteroposterior fusion for lumbar disc pain. A preliminary study.
 This article reports on a study of 51 consecutive patients (83 lumbar discs) with back pain who underwent anterior interbody lumbar fusion or combined anterior and posterior fusion at the same operation during a 2-year period.
 All patients met the criteria for diagnosis of a painful internal disc disruption and/or failed back syndrome and have had a lengthy trial of conservative treatment consisting of rest, physical therapy, back support, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy, and guarded activity; this treatment was often supplemented by epidural cortisone injections, pain management, and functional rehabilitation.
 Patients with prolonged back pain who failed with conservative care after a minimum of 12 months of severely disabling symptoms were selected for surgery on the basis of a positive dynamic discogram reproducing their exact pain and demonstrating a morphologically degenerative disc (internal disc disruption).
 For the purpose of this study, patients were categorized into three groups and followed up for 15-36 months after the operation.
 There were no deaths or major complications, and the overall success in achieving measurable diminution of preoperative pain was 80%.
 This article discusses preliminary conclusions on the efficacy and safety on anterior and anteroposterior fusion for lumbar disc pain.
