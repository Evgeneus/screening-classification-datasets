Necrotizing fasciitis: 10 years' experience in a district general hospital.
 Of 14 patients with necrotizing fasciitis who presented between 1979 and 1988, six (43 per cent) died.
 The deaths were associated with delays in diagnosis, poor surgical technique and diabetes.
 Prompt diagnosis, resuscitation and early radical surgery are essential to the successful management of necrotizing fasciitis.
