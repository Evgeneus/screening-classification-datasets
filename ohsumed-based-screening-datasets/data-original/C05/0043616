Magnetic resonance imaging of the muscles in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the muscles was performed in patients with polymyositis and dermatomyositis.
 Lesions with high intensity on T2-weighted image, but normal intensity on T1-weighted image, were observed in 7 of 8 patients in the active stage of the disease.
 Following clinical improvement with corticosteroid therapy in 4 patients, the high intensity lesions reverted to normal.
 The high intensity lesions seen on T2-weighted image in the active stage may represent edema and inflammation of the muscle.
 MRI of the muscle may serve as a diagnostic tool and be useful for follow-up of the patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis.
