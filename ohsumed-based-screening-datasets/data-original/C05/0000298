Five-year postoperative results of cemented femoral arthroplasty in patients with systemic bone disease.
 To determine whether bone cellular abnormality affects the results of cemented femoral arthroplasty, 21 patients had biopsies of the iliac crest and femoral cortex at the time of surgery.
 Roentgenographic and histomorphometric studies were used to characterize fibrous membrane formation, cancellous bone, calcar resorption, and bone turnover.
 Patients with high bone turnover and decreased femoral thickness and density before surgery were at risk of developing calcar resorption and cancellous diaphyses, conditions that weaken proximal stem support and lead to early failure.
 These findings suggest that noncemented stems may be indicated in this group.
 Another group, osteoporotic patients, suffered from osteoblastic insufficiency, which may be the indication for the use of cemented stems rather than noncemented stems, which require bony ingrowth.
