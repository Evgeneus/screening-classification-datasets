Mandibular reconstruction with composite microvascular tissue transfer.
 Microvascular free tissue transfer has provided a variety of methods of restoring vascularized bone and soft tissue to difficult defects created by tumor resection and trauma.
 Over 7 years, 26 patients have undergone 28 free flaps for mandibular reconstruction, 15 for primary squamous cell carcinoma of the floor of the mouth or tongue, 7 for recurrent tumor, and 6 for other reasons [lymphangioma (1), infection (1), gunshot wound (1), and osteoradionecrosis (3)].
 Primary reconstruction was performed in 19 cases and secondary in 9.
 All repairs were composite flaps including 12 scapula, 5 radial forearm, 3 fibula, 2 serratus, and 6 deep circumflex iliac artery.
 Mandibular defects included the symphysis alone (7), symphysis and body (5), symphysis-body-ramus condyle (2), body or ramus (13), and bilateral body (1).
 Fourteen patients had received prior radiotherapy to adjuvant or curative doses.
 Eight received postoperative radiotherapy.
 All patients had initially successful vascularized reconstruction by clinical examination (28) and positive radionuclide scan (22 of 22).
 Bony stability was achieved in 25 of 26 patients and oral continence in 24 of 26.
 One complete flap loss occurred at 14 days.
 Complications of some degree developed in 22 patients including partial skin necrosis (3), orocutaneous fistula (3), plate exposure (1), donor site infection (3), fracture of reconstruction (1), and fracture of the radius (1).
 Microvascular transfer of bone and soft tissue allows a reliable reconstruction--despite previous radiotherapy, infection, foreign body, or surgery--in almost every situation in which mandible and soft tissue are absent.
 Bony union, a healed wound, and reasonable function and appearance are likely despite early fistula, skin loss, or metal plate or bone exposure.
