Calvarial sutural abnormalities: metopic synostosis and coronal deformation--an anatomic, three-dimensional radiographic, and pathologic study.
 The purposes of this study were (1) to evaluate the histologic differences between synostotic versus deformational suture abnormalities and (2) to correlate these histologic findings with anatomic and three-dimensional computed tomographic (CT) scans.
 We examined three infants with premature metopic synostosis; one infant also had microcephaly trisomy 13 and curious overriding of the coronal sutures.
 The three-dimensional CT scans demonstrated obliteration of the metopic suture inferiorly.
 Histologic sections of this suture showed complete bony stenosis.
 The same pattern was found in all three infants, including the two infants with trigonocephaly who did not have trisomy 13 or microcephaly.
 In the trisomy 13 infant, the overlapped inferior coronal suture was obliterated on CT examination.
 However, histologic sections in this region showed a merging of bone; there was no synostosis.
 In summary, three-dimensional CT re-formation correlated with metopic suture histology.
 "Stenotic" fusion existed in all infants with trigonocephaly, those with normal and abnormal karyotypes, with and without microcephaly.
 However, three-dimensional CT re-formation of the trisomic infant showed opacification of the coronal suture in the areas of greatest overlap, whereas histology revealed a curious bone remodeling pattern, possibly a precursor to "deformational" craniosynostosis.
