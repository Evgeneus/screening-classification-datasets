Transarticular fixation for severely displaced supracondylar fractures in children.
 We have reviewed 34 children who had been treated by open reduction through a medial incision and transarticular pinning for a severely displaced supracondylar fracture of the humerus.
 Follow-up ranging from nine months to 20 years showed that 27 of 34 elbows (79%) had excellent or good results, with satisfactory resolution of neurovascular problems and no complications due to the method of treatment.
