Effect of bucillamine (SA96) on type II collagen induced arthritis in rats.
 The effects of bucillamine, a new antirheumatic drug, on type II collagen induced arthritis in rats was examined.
 Bucillamine inhibited hindpaw swelling in a dose dependent manner.
 The histopathological study indicated that bucillamine inhibited the proliferation of synovial lining cells.
 The anti-type II collagen antibody level was also decreased by the treatment with bucillamine.
 D-penicillamine, on the other hand, showed no beneficial effects on arthritis except for inhibiting new bone formation.
 Our findings suggest that bucillamine has beneficial effects on type II collagen induced arthritis in rats and that its mechanism of action is different from those of D-penicillamine.
