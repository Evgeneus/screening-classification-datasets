Postoperative bone marrow alterations: potential pitfalls in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis with In-111-labeled leukocyte scintigraphy.
 Scintigraphy was used after injection of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) and indium-111-labeled white blood cells (WBCs) to assess for the presence of osteomyelitis in 97 patients who had undergone prior surgical procedures.
 Thirty-four patients with abnormal In-111-labeled WBC patterns underwent restudy with Tc-99m albumin colloid (AC).
 Scintigraphic findings were considered positive for osteomyelitis whenever localization of In-111-labeled WBCs exceeded Tc-99m AC activity in extent or focal intensity (discordant pattern).
 Ten of 12 patients with culture-proved osteomyelitis had discordant patterns; two had false-negative (concordant) patterns.
 The cases of 20 of 22 patients without infection who were considered to have osteomyelitis on the basis of patterns of In-111-labeled WBCs and Tc-99m MDP were reclassified correctly on the basis of concordant patterns of In-111-labeled WBCs and Tc-99m AC.
 Radiocolloid images improved the overall scintigraphic specificity for osteomyelitis from 59% without bone marrow imaging to 92%; sensitivity decreased from 94% to 88%.
