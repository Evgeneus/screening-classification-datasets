Yersinia enterocolitica in the synovial membrane of patients with Yersinia-induced arthritis.
 Using a monospecific rabbit antibody against Yersinia enterocolitica outer membrane protein 1, we examined synovial biopsy specimens from 7 patients with Yersinia-induced arthritis.
 Yersinia were demonstrated in the synovial membrane by indirect immunofluorescence in 4 patients with Yersinia-induced arthritis, but not in 6 control patients with Salmonella-induced arthritis or with rheumatoid arthritis.
 These findings suggest the persistence of Yersinia in the joints of patients with Yersinia-induced arthritis.
