Cranial fasciitis: case report.
 A 2-year-old boy with cranial fasciitis is described.
 He had a rapidly growing subcutaneous right occipital mass, which was associated with a dimple in the overlying skin.
 It appeared similar to a malignant subcutaneous tumor with skin invasion.
 Total resection of the tumor was performed, and the histological diagnosis, cranial fasciitis, was confirmed.
