Wolf blade plate ankle arthrodesis.
 Fifteen patients, each of whom had a Wolf blade plate ankle arthrodesis, were followed for a mean of 56 months.
 The mean age at the time of operation was 46.7 years.
 The preoperative diagnosis was posttraumatic arthritis in 16 cases and one each of degenerative arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and avascular necrosis of the talus.
 Eighteen of the 19 cases fused for a fusion rate of 94.7%.
 The average fusion position was 2.9 degrees of plantar flexion and 5 degrees of valgus.
 All patients whose ankle fused were satisfied with their results.
 The average Mazur postoperative score was 75 (range, 33-91).
 Five patients had delayed wound healing.
 The Wolf blade plate is a simple and easy method to fuse the ankle.
 Minimal dissection is required and a fusion rate of 95% is obtainable.
