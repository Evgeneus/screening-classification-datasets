Radiologic progression during intramuscular methotrexate treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.
 The radiographic evolution of joint lesions in 41 patients with severe and longstanding rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (mean duration: 12.9 years) treated with methotrexate (MTX) for more than 24 months (mean 31.2 months) was studied in a double blind manner by 2 rheumatologists using Larsen's score.
 All the patients were clinically improved.
 The radiological study of hands and wrists was possible in only 37 of 41 patients for surgical reasons.
 We found a deterioration of joint lesions in 31 cases (83.8%), a stabilization in 6 cases (16.2%).
 MTX does not appear to be able to slow down the radiographic evolution of RA.
 Whether it could prevent the radiologic progression in early RA remains to be elucidated.
