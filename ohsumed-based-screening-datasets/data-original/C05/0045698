MR imaging of fractures of the growth plate.
 In order to assess whether MR imaging could be used to evaluate posttraumatic abnormalities of the growth plate cartilage, 28 MR imaging examinations of 26 physeal fractures were performed from 4 days to 2 years after injury.
 Twelve patients were studied within 6 months of the fracture.
 MR imaging changed the Salter-Harris classification in six.
 Interruption of the growth plate detected on T2-weighted images was associated with subsequent growth anomaly in six of eight patients.
 Horizontal fracture of the physis without interruption was associated with growth disturbance in only one of four patients.
 Sixteen growth plates were studied beyond 6 months after injury.
 Twelve had physeal bars and abnormal growth.
 Of four patients without physeal abnormality on MR imaging, two had normal growth and two had mild deformity.
 Our results show that MR imaging defects abnormalities in the cartilage that are associated with subsequent growth disturbances and provides accurate mapping of physeal bridging and associated growth abnormalities that have already occurred.
