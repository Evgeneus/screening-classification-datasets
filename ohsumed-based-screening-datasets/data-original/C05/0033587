The incidence and relationship of cervical spine anomalies in patients with cleft lip and/or palate.
 The relationship, incidence, and distribution of cervical spine anomalies were assessed in 468 patients with cleft lip and/or palate.
 The patients were placed into four groups: lip and/or alveolar; complete unilateral or bilateral; isolated palatal; and soft palate or submucous clefts.
 Cervical anomalies were observed in 22% of the cleft patients and in 7% of the noncleft group.
 Patients with soft palate and submucous clefts had the highest incidence of vertebral anomalies (45%), whereas patients with cleft lip and/or alveolus had an incidence similar to the noncleft group.
 Patients with complete unilateral and bilateral clefts also had a higher incidence (15.6% to 19.0%) of anomalies than the noncleft group.
 Cervical anomalies occurred primarily in the occipital-C1-C2 region.
 The possible implications of these findings are discussed.
