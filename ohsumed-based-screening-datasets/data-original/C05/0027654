Quantitative computed tomography for bone mineral measurement: technical aspects, dosimetry, normal data and clinical applications.
 A single KVp quantitative CT (QCT) technique was used for measuring the spinal trabecular bone density.
 The trabecular bone equivalent density (TBED) was expressed as the density of a K2HPO4 solution that exhibits a linear attenuation coefficient identical to that of trabecular bone.
 A field non-uniformity correcting factor was obtained from experiments on phantoms.
 The effective equivalent dose of the whole examination (four sections and a scout view) is 370 muSv.
 The in vivo short-term precision (reproducibility coefficient of variation) ranges from 1.4% to 4.1% depending on the TBED values of the normal subjects.
 The TBED was measured in 206 normal Greeks aged 30-69 years.
 Average TBED decreased with increasing age for both sexes.
 Analysis considering separately each vertebra showed a tendency to a caudal spinal TBED reduction.
 No correlation was found between the TBED values and the body habitus, milk consumption, smoking habits in men, and number of full-term pregnancies.
 A significant difference (p less than 0.01) was found between the TBED values of the normals and those of 50 women suffering from post-menopausal osteoporosis, 37 alcoholic men, and 12 gastrectomized men (Billroth II).
 Quantitative CT has been established as a method of measuring TBED in health and disease, and the results from this study confirm these applications.
