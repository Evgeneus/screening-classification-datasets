Overview of osteoporosis.
 Osteoporosis is a common age-related disorder manifested clinically by skeletal fractures, especially fractures of the vertebrae, hip, and distal forearm.
 The major cause of these fractures is low bone mass, although an increase in trauma due to falls in the elderly also contributes.
 There are multiple causes for the low bone mass which, in any given individual, may contribute differently to the development of the osteopenia.
 The most important groups of causes are failure to achieve adequate peak bone mass, slow bone loss due to processes relating to aging, the menopause in women, and a variety of sporadic behavioral, nutritional, and environmental factors that affect bone mass in some but not in other individuals.
 The most important approach is prevention.
 Drugs and behavioral factors known to cause bone loss should be eliminated and perimenopausal women should be evaluated for possible preventive administration of estrogen.
 For patients with fractures due to established osteoporosis, the only drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration are the antiresorptive agents calcium, estrogen, and calcitonin.
 Formation-stimulating regimens, however, are being developed and may be available for clinical use in the foreseeable future.
 These regimens may be capable of increasing bone mass to above the fracture threshold, thereby resulting in a clinical cure of the osteoporosis.
