Bridging of mandibular defects with two different reconstruction systems: an experimental study.
 To compare two different mandibular reconstruction systems, a 5-cm angular resection was performed in nine adult sheep.
 The defect was reconstructed using either a classic AO plate or the AO-THORP reconstruction system.
 The animals were killed 5, 9, and 14 weeks after operation.
 Serial sections with the plates and screws in place were prepared and studied histologically and with microradiography and fluorescence microscopy.
 Twenty-six percent of the 2.7-mm AO cortical screws were adequately fixed.
 The corresponding percentage for AO-THORP hollow screws was 73%.
 The main advantage of the latter system is the screw-plate locking principle, which allows plate stability to be maintained even if bone is resorbed under the plate.
 Whether the existence of a screw lumen is an advantage has not yet been established.
