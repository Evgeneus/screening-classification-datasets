Impact of magnetic resonance imaging on the management of diabetic foot infections.
 This combined retrospective/prospective study evaluated the value of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 18 diabetic patients with apparent foot infections.
 The goal was to define the impact of MRI on directing the expedient and accurate surgical intervention so important in achieving optimal preservation of limb tissue and function.
 We found that MRI provides a rapid and reliable means of "viewing" the diabetic foot.
 Unsuspected or poorly localized abscess cavities can be pinpointed for thorough drainage with minimal exploration.
 An abscess can be differentiated from cellulitis or osteomyelitis.
 Moreover, persistent fever following drainage of a foot abscess can be reliably evaluated via MRI, obviating the need for empiric surgical reexploration.
 This exciting noninvasive imaging technique leads to the most accurate surgical drainage of foot abscesses and, at the same time, can prevent unnecessary surgical exploration of the tenuous diabetic foot.
