Osteomyelitis. The Ilizarov perspective.
 It is evident that Professor Ilizarov has devised some remarkable strategies for dealing with chronic osteomyelitis.
 In summary, his methods include: Extensive debridement and intercalary bone transport.
 Oblique osteotomy through multiloculated cavitary osteomyelitis in intact bone.
 Elimination of large cavities by gradual displacement of one cortical wall.
 The role that these techniques will play in the future of osteomyelitis surgery remains to be determined by careful clinical and experimental research.
