Muscle rehabilitation: its effect on muscular and functional performance of patients with knee osteoarthritis.
 Muscle function and functional performance are limited in patients with osteoarthritis (OA).
 Although aerobic exercise can increase aerobic power and reduce fatigue, it does not appear to improve muscle function.
 The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the effect of a muscle rehabilitation program on muscle strength, endurance, speed, and function for patients with OA of the knees.
 Fifteen men (67.6 +/- 6.1 years) with OA of the knees underwent a four-month exercise program, three times per week.
 Muscle strength, endurance, and speed were 50% less in OA patients than in controls.
 After rehabilitation, there was a significant increase in strength (35%), endurance (35%), and speed (50%).
 Deficiencies and improvements in the muscles were greater at longer muscle lengths.
 Increases in muscle function were associated with decreased dependency (10%), difficulty (30%), and pain (40%).
 The average increase in all measured parameters was 10% and 25% after two and four months of rehabilitation, respectively.
 Improvements were sustained for eight months after rehabilitation.
 The muscle rehabilitation program was designed specifically to improve function; the improved muscle function was translated into improved functional performance.
