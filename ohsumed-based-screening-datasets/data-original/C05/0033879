Brucellosis as a cause of severe colitis.
 A 16-yr-old girl presented with osteomyelitis and massive rectal bleeding.
 Colonoscopy revealed severe nonspecific colitis.
 Multiple laboratory investigations failed to disclose the etiology of either the bone or colon infections.
 Empiric treatment with corticosteroids and sulfasalazine resulted in only transient improvement.
 One month after discharge, her original symptoms recurred.
 Blood and pus cultures at this time yielded Brucella melitensis.
 After tetracycline treatment, the patient recovered.
 At 1-yr follow-up, she was found completely asymptomatic.
 Although osteomyelitis is a well-known manifestation of brucellosis, colitis related to this agent has so far not been described.
