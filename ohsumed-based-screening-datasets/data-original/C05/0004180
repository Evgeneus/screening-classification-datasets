The lateral approach for operative release of post-traumatic contracture of the elbow.
 A lateral approach was used to release a post-traumatic contracture of the elbow in seven patients, and the results were evaluated an average of thirty-eight months postoperatively.
 Extension improved from an average flexion contracture of 45 degrees preoperatively to one of 12 degrees postoperatively, and the average point of maximum flexion increased from 116 degrees preoperatively to 129 degrees postoperatively.
 The average arc of motion increased 46 degrees.
 All patients began using a continuous-passive-motion device immediately after the operation.
 There were no problems with wound-healing or formation of heterotopic bone.
