AAEM case report #22: polymyositis.
 Polymyositis usually presents with progressive proximal muscle weakness, increased serum levels of muscle enzymes, inflammatory changes on muscle biopsy, and characteristic electromyographic (EMG) abnormalities.
 Motor unit action potential (MUAP) changes of configuration, duration, and amplitude are the most frequently observed EMG abnormality.
 Fibrillation potentials are commonly seen and tend to reflect active disease, diminishing after successful medical management or disease regression.
 Other muscle diseases can present with similar electromyographic abnormalities, thereby necessitating muscle biopsy for definitive diagnosis.
