Group G streptococcus septic arthritis and osteomyelitis: report and literature review.
 Beta hemolytic streptococcus group G is increasingly being recognized as a cause of serious infections.
 We describe a patient with group G streptococcus septic arthritis of the right knee and osteomyelitis of the proximal tibia.
 Clinical details of 46 patients including 13 patients with infected prosthetic joints reported in the literature were reviewed: 42% had multiple joint involvement.
 Almost all patients had underlying conditions.
 Almost one-half were treated with antibiotics alone without therapeutic drainage procedures.
 Patients with infected prosthetic joints did well without removal of infected prosthesis.
 There have been 11 cases of group G streptococcus osteomyelitis reported including 3 cases with concomitant septic arthritis.
