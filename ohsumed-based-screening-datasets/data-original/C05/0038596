In vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of early disc degeneration with histopathologic correlation.
 The in vivo and ex vivo microanatomic appearance of early disc degeneration were identified by magnetic resonance imaging and correlated with their respective histopathologic findings.
 Five cadaver spines (18 discs) and 25 patient studies (122 discs) all imaged at 1.5 Tesla were studied.
 Two signs of early degenerative disc disease were found: infolding and the central dot.
 Infolding of the central fibers of the outer annulus coalesced into a central dot of low signal intensity that was seen on both the ex vivo and in vivo images.
 Infolding was seen 29 of 122 times, and the central dot was observed 15 to 122 times on the in vivo images.
 A later form of degenerative disc disease was identified as a separation of the nucleus pulposus from the hyaline cartilage end-plate.
 This separation was seen as a linear area of either low or high signal intensity on the ex vivo images but only as a band of high signal intensity on the in vivo spin-echo 2,500-msec/80-msec images.
 Only 7 of 122 in vivo discs showed this separation.
 Internal herniation of nucleus pulposus into the outer annulus was seen only on the ex vivo images.
 Early degenerative disc disease may exist before there is loss of disc height or signal intensity on the long time-to-repetition (TR)/time-to-echo (TE) magnetic resonance images.
