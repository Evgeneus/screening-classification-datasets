Sources of confounding in immunologic data.
 Standardization of immunologic tests requires control of inter-assay, intra-assay, and biologic variation.
 It is important to determine the distribution of each immunologic marker level to be studied in an appropriate control population of adequate size.
 Valid interpretation of results requires consideration of the complex interactions of components of the immune system as well as of interactions of the immune system and other physiologic regulatory systems.
