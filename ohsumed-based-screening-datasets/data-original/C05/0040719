Fibrous dysplasia of the skull: disease activity in relation to age.
 Eighteen of 19 patients with histologically confirmed fibrous dysplasia of the skull seen at the Institute of Neurological Sciences, Glasgow, in the past 20 years have been reviewed and recent radiographs obtained.
 Sex, age at presentation and at follow-up were recorded, in addition to the site, type and extent of cranial involvement.
 The findings have been related to disease activity and progression.
 In comparison with other reports we found the proportion of patients with activity in adulthood to be relatively high (37%).
 Overall, there was an equal sex distribution, but of seven patients presenting as adults, six were female as were six of seven patients with evidence of disease activity in adulthood.
