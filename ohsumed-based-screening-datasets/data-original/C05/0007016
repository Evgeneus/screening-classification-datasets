Interleukin-1-induced interleukin-6 is required for the inhibition of proteoglycan synthesis by interleukin-1 in human articular cartilage.
 Cartilage from normal controls, patients with osteoarthritis, and patients with rheumatoid arthritis produced no interleukin-6 (IL-6) in culture.
 However, IL-1 induced massive production of IL-6 (up to 135 ng/ml) in cartilage from all 3 sources, in a dose-dependent manner (in some cases, a peak value was reached).
 The levels of induced IL-6 were similar to those found in rheumatoid arthritis synovial fluid.
 At IL-1 concentrations that induced almost complete inhibition of proteoglycan (PG) synthesis, IL-6 production could still be increased considerably.
 Exogenous IL-6 inhibited PG synthesis by up to 25%.
 IL-1-induced inhibition of PG synthesis was reversed by antibodies against recombinant human IL-6.
 These results suggest that IL-6 is required for the IL-1-induced inhibition of PG synthesis.
