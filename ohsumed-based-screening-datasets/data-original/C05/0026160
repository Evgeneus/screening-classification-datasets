Validation of biologic markers for use in research on chronic fatigue syndrome.
 Unresolved aspects of chronic fatigue syndrome can be addressed by research involving biologic markers.
 These may be any molecular, biochemical, physiological, or other biologic parameter obtainable from biologic specimens.
 The use of biologic markers in research requires their validation as dependent or independent variables.
 Additionally, other characteristics of markers such as reliability of assays, background level, confounding factors, interpretations, and legal and ethical implications should be considered before the use of markers in research.
 A checklist is provided for evaluating a biologic marker before its inclusion in research.
