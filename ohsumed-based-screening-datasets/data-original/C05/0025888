Chronic infectious mononucleosis; a case report 
 A 39-year-old woman had an adenitis colli followed by anaemia, splenomegaly, atypical lymphoid cells in blood with increased B-lymphocytes, reduced T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells, increased polyclonal IgM, high titres of EB VCA IgG, EB EA IgD&R +/- and EBNA IgG-.
 The disease progressed slowly for 2 years, splenectomy was followed by clinical improvement; spleen morphology was compatible with a benign disease of viral origin.
