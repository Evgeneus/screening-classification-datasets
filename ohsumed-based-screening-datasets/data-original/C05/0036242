Anteromedial osteoarthritis of the knee.
 Medial tibial plateaux excised during 46 unicompartmental arthroplasties for osteoarthritis were collected and photographed.
 The anterior cruciate ligament was intact in all joints.
 In every case the cartilage and bone erosion was centred anteriorly on the plateau and the posterior cartilage was intact.
 The site of the lesion and the intact state of the cruciate ligaments taken together explain why varus deformity was observed only in the extended knee, and why the deformity was correctable and had not become fixed.
 Failure of the anterior cruciate ligament may allow the erosion to extend posteriorly, producing fixed varus deformity and leading to degeneration of the lateral compartment.
 Anteromedial osteoarthritis is a distinct clinicopathological entity; its radiographic features enable it to be diagnosed from lateral radiographs; its anatomical features render it suitable for treatment by unicompartmental arthroplasty.
