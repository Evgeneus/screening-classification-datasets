Combined intertrochanteric and Chiari pelvic osteotomies for hip dysplasia.
 Thirty-two dysplastic hips with secondary osteoarthritis, in 28 patients aged 18 to 42 years, were treated by combined intertrochanteric and Chiari osteotomy.
 They were followed up for 2.5 to 10 years.
 Pain was the main presenting symptom in all the patients.
 The indication for surgery was based on the severity of disease with respect to congruency, secondary degenerative change and degree of dysplasia.
 The average pre-operative Harris hip score was 47.7 and the majority had severe dysplasia with degenerative changes.
 On final review the average score was 88.
 The radiographic appearances of degenerative arthritis regressed in 72% of hips and dysplasia was improved in all cases.
 The results of this conservative form of surgery are better in hips with less severe dysplasia and mild secondary degenerative change.
