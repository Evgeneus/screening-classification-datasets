Variations in adult cortical bone mass as measured by a panoramic mandibular index.
 This study defines a new radiomorphometric index of mandibular cortical bone mass, the panoramic mandibular index (PMI).
 Differences in the index in a population of 353 adult subjects, equally divided by sex, age (30 through 79 years), and racial group (black, Hispanic, white), were evaluated.
 The data were analyzed with respect to side, racial group, sex, age, and combinations of these variables.
 Blacks were found to have a greater mean PMI than Hispanics or whites, who were statistically similar.
 Age-related changes comparing younger and older age groups within each sex and racial group indicated a significant decrease in mean PMI with increasing age in black and Hispanic women.
 The mean PMI in white men increased with advancing age.
