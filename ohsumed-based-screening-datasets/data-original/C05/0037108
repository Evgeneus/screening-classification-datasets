Solitary extramedullary plasmacytoma of the maxillary antrum and orbit presenting as acute bacterial orbital cellulitis.
 Orbital involvement by plasma cell tumours is rare.
 Orbital tumours do not generally present as an acute orbital inflammatory disease in adults, though tumours such as rhabdomyosarcoma may cause clinical signs similar to an acute orbital cellulitis in children.
 We describe a patient with bacterial orbital cellulitis and sinusitis who was found to have an extra-medullary plasmacytoma of the maxillary antrum and orbit and coexisting testicular seminoma.
