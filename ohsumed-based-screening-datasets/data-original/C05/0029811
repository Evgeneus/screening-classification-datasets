Magnetic resonance imaging of spinal trauma.
 A retrospective series of 118 magnetic resonance examinations of 110 patients who had sustained previous spinal trauma is reported.
 Examinations performed within 3 weeks of trauma showed extraspinal soft tissue (including ligamentous) injury in 48% and intraspinal lesions in 61% (mostly consisting of extradural haematoma and spinal cord contusion).
 In examinations performed more than 3 weeks after injury intraspinal abnormalities were shown in 51% and these represented spinal cord compression, atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia.
 Magnetic resonance imaging has the unique capability of displaying non-invasively the late sequelae of spinal trauma permitting simultaneous evaluation of the extra-spinal soft tissues, vertebral column and spinal cord.
 It is therefore recommended as the technique of choice in the investigation of patients who have sustained previous spinal injury, particularly those with neurological deficit.
 In the acute phase potentially remediable causes of neurological impairment such as disc herniation or extradural haematoma can be identified.
 Signal changes in the cord may allow the prognosis for neurological recovery to be established.
 In the later stages sequelae such as cord atrophy, myelomalacia and syringohydromyelia are accurately identified and surgical therapy may be guided, where appropriate.
