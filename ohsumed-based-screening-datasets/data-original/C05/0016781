Stapes surgery in osteogenesis imperfecta: analysis of postoperative hearing loss.
 The disappointing results in 12 of 58 stapedectomies, including 4 revision operations, performed on osteogenesis imperfecta patients were analyzed and compared with reports in the literature.
 It is concluded that the results described as disappointing were not always the product of the stapes operation.
 A progressive sensorineural hearing loss arising independently of the operation as a result of progression in the disease process of osteogenesis imperfecta appears to have a severe influence on the final hearing threshold.
