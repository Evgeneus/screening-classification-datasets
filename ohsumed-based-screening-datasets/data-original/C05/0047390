Successful treatment of pure myopathy, associated with complex I deficiency, with riboflavin and carnitine.
 We describe a 6-year-old boy who presented with progressive muscle weakness.
 Additional investigations revealed the existence of a myopathy and a pure motor neuropathy.
 Biochemical studies in muscle tissue showed a defect of NADH dehydrogenase (complex I).
 The patient dramatically improved on treatment with riboflavin and L-carnitine.
 Seven months after the start of the treatment, complex I activity was determined again and appeared to be normalized.
 Normalization of the enzymatic defect at this level has not been reported before.
 We provide a survey of nine patients with pure myopathy, associated with complex I deficiency and onset of symptoms in childhood.
