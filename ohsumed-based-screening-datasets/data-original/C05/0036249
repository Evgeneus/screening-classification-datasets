End-stage avascular necrosis of bone in renal transplant patients. The natural history.
 We report the results of conservative treatment of stage III and stage IV avascular necrosis of bone (AVN) affecting the hip or knee in renal transplant patients.
 Twenty-nine patients were followed for a mean period of five years.
 Conservative management was successful in controlling symptoms in 40% of those with AVN of the hip and in 70% of those with AVN of the knee.
 Knowledge of the natural history of AVN is important because of the long survival times after renal transplantation.
