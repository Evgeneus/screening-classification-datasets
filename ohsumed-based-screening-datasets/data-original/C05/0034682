Neuroanatomy and pathophysiology of pain related to spinal disorders.
 Sensation is achieved through the integration of many neural elements: receptors, afferent and efferent neurons, the spinal cord with its subdivisions, and the higher brain centers.
 One of the many sensations perceived by the human body is that of pain or nociception.
 To understand the concept of "back pain" associated with various spinal pathologies, some basic knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of sensation, and more specifically nociception, is necessary.
 This knowledge is presented herein.
