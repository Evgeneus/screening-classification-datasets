Hypercalciuria in parathyroid disorders: effect of dietary sodium control.
 Moderate dietary Na restriction (80 mmol/d for 7 days) during constant Ca intake can reduce high urinary Ca excretion to normal levels in idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH).
 A similar protocol was used to test its effect in primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and also in hypoparathyroid subjects (HOPT) during treatment with dihydrotachysterol (DHT).
 Nine subjects with PHPT, 10 with HOPT, and one with pseudo-HOPT were evaluated after Na-restricted (80 mmol/d) and Na-supplemented (200 mmol/d) diets for 7 days each with dietary Ca constant.
 Na restriction resulted in a decrease in mean urinary 24-hour Ca excretion in PHPT subjects (10.6 v 7.6 mmol/d [424 v 304 mg], P less than 0.0001) and in one pseudo-HOPT subject, similar to the pattern seen previously in IH subjects.
 In contrast, Na restriction was not accompanied by significant change in Ca excretion in HOPT.
 There was no change in serum immunoreactive PTH (iPTH) or 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D levels in either group when Na intake was altered.
 Thus, the presence of parathyroid hormone (PTH) is necessary for sodium-related alterations in urinary Ca to occur.
 The effect of PTH appears to be "permissive" rather than "active." Dietary Na restriction may have a role in the management of hypercalciuria in mild PHPT cases when parathyroidectomy is contraindicated.
