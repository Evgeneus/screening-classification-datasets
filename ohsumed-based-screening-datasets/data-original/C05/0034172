A method of ankle stabilization.
 A simple method of ankle stabilization using a long trifin nail, inserted from below, is described.
 The method is particularly suitable in the elderly, when a short period of bed rest and early weight bearing is desirable.
 The procedure is contraindicated if subtalar joint motion is present and should be preserved.
