Anterior cervical plate fixation with the titanium hollow screw plate system. A preliminary report.
 Morscher, of Switzerland, has developed an anterior cervical spine plate system (THSP) that does not require screw purchase of the posterior cortex.
 This design eliminates potential neurologic complications usually associated with the anterior plate system, but maintains the mechanical advantages of internal fixation.
 The authors reviewed 13 consecutive patients in whom the THSP system was applied.
 Indications for the use of this device included acute trauma in three patients, trauma of more than 6 weeks' duration in five patients, and spondylosis in five patients.
 Fifteen plates and 58 screws were placed, with no screws purchasing the posterior cortex.
 Postoperative immobilization varied from no immobilization to four-poster brace.
 With a mean follow-up of 13 months, all 13 patients went on to fusion.
 One patient had screws placed in the disc rather than in bone and went on to malunion.
 In all other patients, radiographs did not demonstrate screw migration, screw-bone lucency, graft dislodgement, or malunion.
 No patient suffered neurologic injury as a result of this device.
 The THSP system facilitates reliable fusion with minimal complications.
 Its use should be considered in multilevel anterior spine defects, posttraumatic cervical kyphosis, and cervical fractures with posterior disruption requiring anterior fusion.
