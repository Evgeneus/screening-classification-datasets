Identification of human remains lacking skull and teeth. A case report with some methodological considerations.
 This report deals with a case in Denmark in which close cooperation among the local police, the Central Missing and Wanted Persons Search Squad, and the Institute of Forensic Medicine resulted in the positive identification of human remains (part of a skeleton), although the deceased's skull was missing, he had no teeth (but a dental prostheses), and an attempt at blood typing produced a false result.
 When the remains were found, there was no idea who the deceased might be.
 The initial forensic examination provided a general description (age, height, and sex), and reconstruction of the vertebral column showed extensive changes caused by arthrosis and changes typical for Scheurmann's disease.
 The description made on this basis was sent to police stations throughout the country and, far from where the remains were found, a police officer had received the report of a missing person who could have been the deceased.
 Further investigation was based mainly on the medical history of this missing person and the tracing of the effects found with the remains, and emphasized radiographic comparison.
