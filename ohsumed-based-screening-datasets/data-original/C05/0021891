Lovastatin use and muscle damage in healthy volunteers undergoing eccentric muscle exercise.
 We did a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 10 healthy young men taking no medications to determine if ingesting lovastatin is associated with more severe muscle damage after exercise.
 Five men in the first group took 40 mg of lovastatin daily for 30 days while those in the second group took an identical-appearing placebo.
 Each volunteer then walked downhill on a -14-degree incline on a treadmill at 3 km per hour for an hour.
 After a 2-week rest, the subjects were crossed over.
 Serial serum creatine kinase activity was measured immediately before and 8, 24, 48, 72, 120, and 144 hours after each treadmill session.
 With each subject serving as his own control, peak mean serum creatine kinase activity (/+- SEM) following treadmill after lovastatin therapy was similar to that following placebo (168.4 +/- 25.8 U per liter versus 146.7 +/- 14.7 U per liter, respectively [P = .9]).
 With an alpha value of .05, we had greater than a 99% chance of detecting a difference in the rise of serum creatine kinase activity of 200 U per liter between groups.
 Our data suggest that lovastatin is not an independent risk factor for developing exercise-induced muscle damage using this model of exercise in our study population.
