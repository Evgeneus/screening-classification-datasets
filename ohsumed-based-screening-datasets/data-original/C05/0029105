An extensive transbasal approach to frontal skull-base tumors. Technical note.
 Lesions in the base of the frontal fossa have conventionally been approached extra- and intradurally through a bilateral frontal craniotomy.
 However, when the lesion is large or deeply situated, wider bilateral retraction of the frontal lobes is required to obtain a sufficiently large operative field.
 The authors describe a new operative approach for huge tumors at the frontal skull base, employing an en bloc bilateral osteotomy of the orbital roofs and frontal sinus.
 This procedure, which is a modification of the transbasal approach described by Derome and Guiot, is termed the "extensive transbasal approach." The advantages of this technique over conventional operative approaches are described.
