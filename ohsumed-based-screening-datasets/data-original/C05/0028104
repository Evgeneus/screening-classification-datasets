Study of correlation between intradiscal pressure and magnetic resonance imaging data in evaluation of disc degeneration. Therapeutic issue with percutaneous nucleotomy.
 Intradiscal pressure and volume measurements using discomanometry were correlated to features of degeneration noted with magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in 36 discs in patients scheduled for percutaneous nucleotomy.
 Discomanometric data (intradiscal pressure and degree of pressure loss at 0 and 60 seconds after intradiscal infusion, area under the pressure curve, and discal volume) were not correlated with the MR data (degree of disc height loss and degree of signal intensity loss on T2-weighted images).
 Results of nucleotomy were strongly correlated with discomanometric data but not with the studied MR factors.
 Discomanometry by evaluating the physical status of discs, may predict results of percutaneous nucleotomy and consequently play a major role in patients selection.
