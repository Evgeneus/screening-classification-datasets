Collagen-induced arthritis in an outbred group of rhesus monkeys comprising responder and nonresponder animals. Relationship between the course of arthritis and collagen-specific immunity.
 It is speculated that the autoimmune response to type II collagen (CII) is a driving force in the pathogenesis of human rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
 In this report, we describe the relationship between the induction of collagen arthritis and the CII-specific humoral, as well as cellular, immune response in rhesus monkeys.
 Ten of 14 monkeys immunized with bovine type II collagen (B-CII) developed polyarthritis.
 Susceptible animals showed a T cell response to B-CII; resistant animals did not.
 After the primary immunization, the humoral response to B-CII, as well as to rhesus monkey type II collagen, was dominated by antibodies of the IgM isotype in the susceptible animals and by antibodies of the IgG isotype in the resistant animals.
 Because of the close phylogenic relationship between the rhesus monkey and humans, these data contribute valuable information about the role of CII-specific immunity in the pathogenesis of human RA.
