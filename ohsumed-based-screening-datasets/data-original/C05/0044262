Pachydysostosis of the fibula.
 We report four patients with unilateral bowing of the lower leg, affecting only the fibula.
 The bone is too long with anterolateral curvature of the distal third.
 Because of its regressive course and the absence of cutaneous involvement, this newly described entity can be distinguished from other forms of bowing of the leg.
