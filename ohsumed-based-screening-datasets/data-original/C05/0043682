Dacryocystorhinostomy in osteopetrosis.
 Osteopetrosis is a rare congenital disorder of bone metabolism characterized by generalized sclerotic bone resulting from osteoclast dysfunction.
 There are several ocular manifestations, one of which is nasolacrimal duct obstruction from osteosclerosis of the nasolacrimal foramen.
 The surgeon must anticipate and prepare for the difficulties of working with marbleized, ultra-dense bone, alternating technique accordingly.
 In nasolacrimal duct obstruction, surgical management produces seemingly stable long-term results.
 However, if ossification recurs at the operative site, reoperation may become necessary for either optic nerve decompression or dacryocystorhinostomy.
