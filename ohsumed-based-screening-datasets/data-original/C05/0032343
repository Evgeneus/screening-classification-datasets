Articular disease severity in rheumatoid subjects with and without Felty's syndrome.
 Articular disease severity as measured by a radiographic score of hands and feet was compared in rheumatoid subjects with (21) and without (170) Felty's syndrome.
 Disease duration was a major determinant of joint destruction.
 When this was taken into consideration radiographic scores were no higher in the Felty's group than in rheumatoid subjects without Felty's syndrome.
 Immunogenetic associations previously described in Felty's syndrome are unlikely therefore to represent non-specific markers of disease severity and more likely to represent markers of extra-articular disease.
