Depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, and the adolescent.
 To summarize, CFS and depression present very real problems for adolescent patients, their families, and their physicians.
 The wealth of symptoms presented may signal the presence of any number of psychiatric or physiologic disorders.
 As part of the evaluation to rule out other maladies, the physician must identify the developmental issues and life stress events with which patients or their families are struggling.
 Helping patients to accept psychiatric referral to address these issues is indicated if it is thought that they may be contributing to the onset or maintenance of the symptoms.
 Referral is also indicated if a protracted clinical course evolves and the patient's normal course of growth and development appears to be in jeopardy.
