T-plasty modification of the Bankart procedure for multidirectional instability of the anterior and inferior types.
 Forty patients who had a diagnosis of multidirectional instability of forty-two shoulders had a modified Bankart operation in which a T-shaped incision was made in the anterior portion of the capsule, with advancement of the inferior flap superiorly and of the superior flap medially.
 All of the patients had been injured during athletic activities.
 Some degree of anterior labral injury was present in thirty-eight of the forty-two shoulders.
 Half of the patients had generalized ligamentous laxity.
 The patients were followed for an average of three years (range, two to seven years).
 Four patients had episodes of instability after the operation.
 Three had a single episode of posterior subluxation during throwing, one had recurrent posterior subluxation that subsequently was treated by posterior stabilization, and one had anterior subluxation while he was diving from a high board.
 The average loss of external rotation after the operation was 5 degrees with the arm at the side and 4 degrees with the arm abducted 90 degrees.
 Satisfaction of the patient was rated excellent for forty (95 per cent) of the shoulders, good for one shoulder, and fair for one shoulder.
 However, throwing athletes found that they were unable to throw a ball with as much speed as before the operation.
