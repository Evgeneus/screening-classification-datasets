Diagnosis of osteomyelitis in the presence of soft-tissue infection and radiologic evidence of osseous abnormalities: value of leukocyte scintigraphy.
 To evaluate the usefulness of 111In-leukocyte scintigraphy for identifying osteomyelitis in the presence of soft-tissue infection, we prospectively studied 45 bone sites adjacent to soft-tissue infection in patients with abnormal findings on radiographs and 99mTc bone scans that were suggestive of osteomyelitis.
 111In-leukocyte scans were analyzed in terms of the intensity of abnormal uptake and its location relative to bone.
 The diagnosis of osteomyelitis was established from results of percutaneous bone biopsy culture (n = 35), histologic examination of surgical specimens (n = 8), and clinical follow-up (n = 2).
 Osteomyelitis was present at 22 sites, including 16 of 18 sites with increased leukocyte uptake in bone, resulting in a sensitivity of 73%, specificity of 91%, and positive predictive value of 89% for this finding.
 Osteomyelitis was present at four of 17 sites with predominantly soft-tissue localization of leukocyte activity in the region of bone, none of seven sites with normal leukocyte scans, and two of three sites with diminished leukocyte uptake in bone.
 Although not helpful in distinguishing infectious from noninfectious bone abnormalities, 3- and especially 24-hr bone scans viewed in conjunction with leukocyte studies provided important correlation to aid in estimating the location of focal abnormal leukocyte uptake.
 The finding of soft-tissue infection with increased uptake of labeled leukocytes that extends to involve adjacent bone strongly suggests concurrent osteomyelitis.
 When the presence of abnormal leukocyte uptake in bone is uncertain, additional imaging and possibly biopsy may be required to establish or exclude the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.
