A case of mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis and complex I deficiency.
 A 34-year-old man affected by exercise intolerance, mild proximal weakness and severe lactic acidosis is described.
 Muscle biopsy revealed mitochondrial abnormalities and an increase of cytochrome c oxidase histochemical reaction.
 Biochemical investigations on isolated muscle mitochondria as well as polarographic studies revealed a mitochondrial NADH-CoQ reductase (complex I) deficiency.
 Mitochondrial dysfunction was confirmed by 31P nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
 Immunological investigation showed a generalized reduction of all complex I polypeptides.
 Genetic analysis did not reveal mitochondrial DNA deletions.
 The biochemical defect was not present in the patient's muscle tissue culture.
 Metabolic measurements and functional evaluation showed a reduced mechanical efficiency during exercise.
