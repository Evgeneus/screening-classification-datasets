Transient cyst-like cortical defects following fractures in children. Medullary fat within the subperiosteal haematoma.
 Asymptomatic cyst-like cortical defects appearing after fractures in children have been occasionally reported.
 Typically, these defects appear during fracture consolidation, within the newly formed subperiosteal bone, proximal to the fracture line, do not enlarge, and progressively disappear.
 We have previously shown a fatty density on CT scan within the early cortical defect.
 We now present two additional cases in which early CT scans appeared to confirm that these transient cortical defects may consist of fat, and probably result from the inclusion of medullary fat within the subperiosteal haematoma.
