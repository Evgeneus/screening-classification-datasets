Biomechanics of the golf swing in players with pathologic conditions of the forearm, wrist, and hand.
 Golf is an activity generally stressful to the hands and wrists and particularly can produce increasing symptoms in players with underlying problems such as hand and wrist arthritis or tendinitis.
 The purpose of this study was to quantitate wrist motion and club head/ball impact force in subjects with pathologic conditions of the hand, wrist, or forearm, within a laboratory environment.
 A regular straight-handled golf club was compared to a new BioCurve handle design that has a 19 degrees ulnar bend.
 We measured and compared the effect of the two grips on wrist motion, club head velocity, ball impact force, ball impact location, and isometric torsional strength in 20 subjects who had a variety of upper extremity disorders.
 This data was then compared to data collected in an identical fashion from golfers without such conditions.
 The results of our study show that there were no differences related to club handle design on impact force or impact location, club head velocity, or club head path and face angle.
 Wrist kinematic differences were minimal between handle designs.
 The differences that were significant (P less than 0.05) centered around the decreased ulnar deviation of the left hand that resulted when subjects used the BioCurve handle design, which also allowed greater resistance to torque than the straight grip club.
 In addition to collecting objective data, we asked subjects for their opinions of the two grips.
 As a whole, the normal group and the group with pathologic conditions noted more comfort, improved grip, and less shock transmission with the BioCurve handle.
