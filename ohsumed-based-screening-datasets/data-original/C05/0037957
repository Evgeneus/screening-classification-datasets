Treatment of refractory chronic Lyme arthritis with arthroscopic synovectomy.
 Of 20 patients who underwent arthroscopic synovectomy for refractory chronic Lyme arthritis of the knee, 16 (80%) had resolution of joint inflammation during the first month after surgery or soon thereafter, and they have remained well during the 3-8-year followup period.
 Three of these 16 patients who were more disabled preoperatively, still had mild functional limitation at long-term followup.
 The remaining 4 patients (20%) had persistent or recurrent synovitis.
 We conclude that arthroscopic synovectomy is effective in treating chronic Lyme arthritis in patients in whom the disease does not respond to antibiotic therapy.
