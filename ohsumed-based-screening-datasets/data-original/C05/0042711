Regional fasciocutaneous flaps for the burned axilla.
 The conventional approach for secondary correction of unstable axillary scars or contractures with skin grafting commonly risks failure of adherence and early recurrence of the problem, even in highly motivated patients.
 Potential early mobilization and the avoidance of postoperative splinting may be advantages of reconstruction with vascularized tissues instead.
 The local fasciocutaneous flap is advocated as a simple, rapidly elevated, single-staged option that preserves function while correcting these deformities.
 Although the dorsal thoracic fascial flaps are the most versatile in the axillary region, if they are unavailable or unsuitable, other unspecified but equally robust alternatives from the upper arm or anterolateral chest are similarly efficacious.
