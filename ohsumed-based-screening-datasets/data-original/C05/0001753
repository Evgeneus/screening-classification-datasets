The radiologic morphology of asymptomatic temporomandibular joints.
 A high frequency of remodeling changes was demonstrated radiographically in a series of 200 female patients with asymptomatic temporomandibular joints.
 Fewer than 10% of joints were completely radiologically "normal".
 Generally, there was an increasing incidence of changes with increasing age and for edentulous patients, but these relationships were by no means direct or mutually exclusive.
