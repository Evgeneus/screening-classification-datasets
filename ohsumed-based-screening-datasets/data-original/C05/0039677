The current state of functional knee bracing research. A review of the literature.
 This paper reviews recent research on functional knee bracing.
 Research is categorized by subject, approach, or technique.
 The authors conclude that, while there is a good deal of excellent research available, there is little data to assist the clinician in selecting an orthosis for a specific application.
 The authors recommend that future investigations address the physiologic aspects of functional knee bracing and that brace manufacturers assume more responsibility in the validation of both existing and future brace designs.
