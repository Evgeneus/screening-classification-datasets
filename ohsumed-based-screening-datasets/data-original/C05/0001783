Tibial nonunions. Treatment tactics with the Ilizarov method.
 The key to the success of the Ilizarov method is that the rigid systems, such as plates and traditional external fixators that bypass the nonunion, have been replaced by the axially elastic system of Ilizarov.
 The cyclic axial telescoping mobility, not rigidity, at the nonunion or fracture site is an important requirement for the formation of reparative callus.
 As we gain more experience with the method, we find ourselves capable of solving increasingly more difficult problems with a level of success rarely, if ever, achieved with more conventional methods.
