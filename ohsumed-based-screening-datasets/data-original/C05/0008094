Biomechanics of a double prosthetic ligament in the anterior cruciate deficient knee.
 We have assessed the biomechanical properties of a 'double-bundle' prosthetic ligament replacing the anterior cruciate in cadaver knees.
 We compared the results with those of single bundle 'over-the-top' and 'through-the-condyle' techniques, performing anterior drawer tests at 20 degrees and 90 degrees knee flexion.
 The over-the-top reconstruction gave better anteroposterior stability at 20 degrees, while the through-the-condyle repair was more stable at 90 degrees.
 The double-bundle reconstruction gave practically normal anterior stability at both 20 degrees and 90 degrees.
