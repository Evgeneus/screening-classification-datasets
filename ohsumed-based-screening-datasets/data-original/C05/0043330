Vibratory response in adolescents who have idiopathic scoliosis.
 The PVD Bio-Thesiometer was tested as a tool for measuring vibratory thresholds and for detecting possible differences in these thresholds between adolescents who have idiopathic scoliosis and those who do not.
 It was found to be limited by low reliability and large errors in measurement, with the metatarsophalangeal joint being the only reliable site for measurement.
 The vibratory thresholds at this site were significantly higher in the fourteen subjects who had scoliosis than in the twenty-two control subjects.
 No significant asymmetry in vibratory thresholds was found between the concave and convex or the right and left sides in either the scoliotic or the control group.
 Because there was no significant difference between the readings from the concave and convex sides, it is unlikely that a lesion of the posterior column is responsible for idiopathic scoliosis.
 If there is a difference, then the PVD Bio-Thesiometer is not sufficiently reliable to detect it.
