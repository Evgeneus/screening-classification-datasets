Quantifying bone loss from the proximal femur after total hip arthroplasty.
 To define the natural history of bone loss around a femoral prosthesis, the bone mineral content and bone mineral density were measured for each femur in 28 patients with unilateral total hip arthroplasty, 18 age-matched controls, and seven patients with unilateral osteoarthritis.
 The areas measured were inside the lesser trochanter and 4.8 cm distal to it.
 The contralateral hip served as the control.
 Three years after arthroplasty there was 40% loss in average bone mineral content inside the lesser trochanter, and 28% loss in average bone mineral content 4.8 cm distally in the medial cortex.
 At seven to 14 years after operation, patients had lost 40% of bone proximally and 49% distally.
 The data suggest that this may progress in a proximal-to-distal fashion, and could account for a 50% decrease in bone mass seven to 14 years after surgery.
