Stabilization of the cervical spine in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita.
 Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is an inheritable bone dysplasia causing abnormalities that manifest at birth and primarily involve the spine and proximal epiphyses.
 The clinical findings include short-trunk dwarfism, myopia, frequent retinal detachment, shortening of the spine and proximal extremities, mild thoracic kyphoscoliosis, a barrel-shaped thorax, a short neck, and mild ocular hypertelorism.
 The characteristic radiographic features are a generalized delay in ossification, flattening and dysplasia of the vertebral bodies, pelvic dysplasia, and retarded ossification of the femoral head and neck.
 Other radiographic features of interest to the neurosurgeon may be platybasia, kyphoscoliosis, lumbar hyperlordosis, and odontoid hypoplasia.
 A case of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita is presented in which an unstable and markedly dysplastic cervical spine was stabilized with Halifax interlaminar clamps and sublaminar wires.
 The clinical findings and radiographic features are presented and the etiology and neurosurgical management of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita are discussed.
