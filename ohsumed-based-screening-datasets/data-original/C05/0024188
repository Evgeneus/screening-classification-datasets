Intraarticular osmic acid in postinfectious arthritis persisting after treated bacterial arthritis.
 We describe 4 patients successfully treated with intraarticular osmic acid for post-infectious arthritis persisting after apparent eradication of bacteria from the infected joint.
 In addition the bactericidal effect of osmic acid in vitro is demonstrated.
 We conclude that treatment with osmic acid carries no risk of iatrogenic infection; on the contrary, an antibacterial effect seems likely.
