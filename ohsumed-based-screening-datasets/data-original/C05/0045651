Mutations of the Gs alpha-subunit gene in Albright hereditary osteodystrophy detected by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
 Affected members of most kindreds with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy have a partial deficiency of functional Gs, the guanine nucleotide-binding protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase.
 By use of the polymerase chain reaction to amplify genomic fragments with the attachment of a high-melting G + C-rich region (GC clamp) and analysis of these fragments by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, heterozygous mutations in the Gs alpha-subunit gene were found in two kindreds.
 These included a G----C substitution at the donor splice junction of intron 10 and a coding frameshift created by a single base deletion within exon 10.
 The findings illustrate the heterogeneity of genetic defects in Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and the usefulness of the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis method to search rapidly for mutations in a large candidate gene.
