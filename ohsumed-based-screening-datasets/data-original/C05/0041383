Understanding osteoporosis.
 Considerable progress has been achieved recently in our understanding of the normal process by which bone mass is regulated.
 Age-related trabecular bone loss is characterized not simply by a global loss of bone but also by cortical porosity and loss of trabecular connections.
 Because bone strength depends on architectural as well as material properties, bone quantity alone cannot define fracture risk with precision.
 Traditional therapies for osteoporosis increase bone mass, and estrogen therapy, in particular, profoundly decreases fracture risk.
 The pharmacologic restoration of bone quantity and quality, however, remains elusive.
 Modern biotechnology offers the hope that progress may come about through the development of growth factors and other osteotropic compounds for clinical use.
