Dupuytren's contracture.
 Dupuytren's contracture is a disease of the palmar and digital fascia that results in a flexion deformity of the fingers.
 Although the first case was reported more than 350 years ago, many questions remain unanswered.
 With our present state of knowledge, treatment remains empiric and operative intervention is the only successful mode of treatment.
 Controversies continue over the type of procedure used, as well as its timing.
 In light of the high rate of recurrence of flexion contractures after apparently successful operations, current research is being directed toward identifying a biochemical or histologic marker to indicate the probability of recurrence.
