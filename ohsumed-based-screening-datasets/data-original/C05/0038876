A limited association of generalized osteoarthritis with alleles at the type II collagen locus: COL2A1.
 A significant genetic influence in osteoarthritis has been observed in the combination of Heberden's nodes and generalized osteoarthritis.
 We examined whether mutation in the gene encoding the major cartilage matrix protein type II collagen was responsible by comparing allele frequencies at the locus (COL2A1) in a group of 61 patients with nodal GOA with a control population and by analysing the COL2A1 genotypes of 21 affected sibling pairs.
 There were no significant allele differences but a slightly increased tendency over chance alone for affected siblings to have inherited the same COL2A1 alleles from their parents.
