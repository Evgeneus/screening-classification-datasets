Newer concepts in antimicrobial therapy.
 Advances in the treatment of infection have continued to increase both the length and quality of life.
 Unfortunately, many bacteria can readily adapt to their environment and develop a tolerance to the antimicrobial agents in widespread use.
 During the recent past, the consumption of cephalosporins has increased so dramatically as to parallel the initial acceptance of penicillin.
 Organisms that are resistant to the cephalosporins will no doubt continue to thrive, especially within the susceptible host.
 It is essential for the clinician to become familiar with the newest antimicrobial agents to more effectively treat modern infections.
