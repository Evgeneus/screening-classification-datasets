Lumbar disc disease and stenosis.
 In recent years MR has been the major advancement in the imaging of lumbar disc disease.
 Its advantages include multiplanar imaging, excellent resolution, and absence of ionizing radiation.
 Although CT remains an efficient and accurate method of evaluating the spine, we currently recommend MR imaging as the best initial examination.
 Myelography with follow-up CT scans should be reserved for specific patients in whom additional information is needed after MR images or CT scans.
