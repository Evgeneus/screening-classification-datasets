Review of laboratory findings for patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.
 Various abnormalities revealed by laboratory studies have been reported in adults with chronic fatigue syndrome.
 Those most consistently reported include depressed natural killer cell function and reduced numbers of natural killer cells; low levels of circulating immune complexes; low levels of several autoantibodies, particularly antinuclear antibodies and antithyroid antibodies; altered levels of immunoglobulins; abnormalities in number and function of lymphocytes; and modestly elevated levels of two Epstein-Barr virus-related antibodies, immunoglobulin G to viral capsid antigen and to early antigen.
