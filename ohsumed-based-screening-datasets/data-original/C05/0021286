Sagittal plane laxity following knee arthroplasty.
 We measured the sagittal laxity in 70 knee replacements at least six months after surgery, using a KT 1000 arthrometer.
 With an unconstrained prosthesis (the Oxford meniscal knee) anteroposterior stability was normal in joints known to have intact cruciate ligaments.
 There was increased laxity in those which lacked an anterior cruciate ligament.
 In knees with an intact anterior cruciate ligament, sagittal laxity did not increase with time.
