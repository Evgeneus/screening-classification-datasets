Differences in shoulder muscle activity between patients with generalized joint laxity and normal controls.
 The aim of the present study was to analyze shoulder muscle activity in patients with generalized joint laxity and shoulder instability and to compare it with muscle activity recorded in healthy subjects from an earlier study.
 Electromyographic (EMG) activity was recorded from eight shoulder muscles in six patients using surface and intramuscular fine-wire electrodes.
 Recordings were made from the subscapularis, supraspinatus, infraspinatus, pectoralis major (sternoclavicular part), the anterior, middle, and posterior parts of the deltoid, and the latissimus dorsi.
 The EMG signal was low-pass filtered, full-wave rectified, and time-average.
 Normalization of the EMG allowed interindividual and intraindividual comparisons.
 During abduction and flexion, muscle activity in the anterior and middle parts of the deltoid was significantly decreased in the patients, and during internal rotation activity in the subscapularis was increased.
 As in healthy subjects, patients showed simultaneous activity in both those muscles producing the movement and in the antagonistic muscles.
 The altered muscle activity observed in patients with generalized joint laxity provides (1) a basis for understanding the mechanism of their shoulder instability and (2) the rationale for a physical training program for these patients.
