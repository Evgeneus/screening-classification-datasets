A bioabsorbable delivery system for antibiotic treatment of osteomyelitis. The use of lactic acid oligomer as a carrier.
 We prepared a composite of D,L-lactic acid oligomer and dideoxykanamycin B for use as a biodegradable antibiotic delivery system with sustained effect.
 The composite was implanted in the distal portion of the rabbit femur, and the effective concentration of the antibiotic was measured in the cortex, the cancellous bone, and the bone marrow.
 In all bone tissues around the implant, the concentration of antibiotic exceeded the minimum inhibitory concentration for the common causative organisms of osteomyelitis for six weeks.
 Most of the implant material had been absorbed and the bone marrow had been repaired to a nearly normal state within nine weeks of implantation.
 The implant caused no systemic side effects, and it is likely to prove clinically useful as a drug delivery system for treating chronic osteomyelitis.
