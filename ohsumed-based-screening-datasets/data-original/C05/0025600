Instability of the hindfoot after lesion of the lateral ankle ligaments: investigations of the anterior drawer and adduction maneuvers in autopsy specimens.
 The mobility patterns in the tibiotalocalcaneal joint complex with a solitary lesion of the anterior talofibular ligament (ATL) and a combined lesion of the ATL and calcaneofibular ligament (CFL) were studied in 22 human lower-extremity autopsy specimens mounted in a kinesiologic testing device.
 A solitary lesion of the ATL increased the anteroposterior (AP) laxity in the ankle joint in the entire range of flexion, with a maximum median of 3.1 mm in neutral flexion.
 Further cutting of the CFL increased AP laxity most obviously in dorsiflexion.
 A solitary lesion of the ATL resulted in a minor instability in adduction, whereas further lesion to the CFL increased adduction in the entire range of flexion, with a maximum median of 14.2 degrees in dorsiflexion.
 The anterior drawer maneuver can reveal a combined lesion of the ATL and CFL if performed with the tibiotalocalcaneal joint complex in dorsiflexion.
 Significant clinical instability in adduction will only take place when a combined lesion of the ATL and CFL is present.
