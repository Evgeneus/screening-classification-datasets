Cis-platinum chemotherapy for ocular basal cell carcinoma.
 We have used intravenous cis-platinum chemotherapy in the treatment of three patients with basal cell carcinoma of the lid extending into the orbit.
 Cis-platinum chemotherapy caused a reduction in tumour size and thereby delayed surgery in all cases.
 It allowed for local resection in one case, appeared to delay a patient's exenteration in a second case, and was used prior to radiotherapy in a third case.
 While not curative, cis-platinum may be useful as an adjuvant to decrease tumour mass prior to local excision and for patients who refuse or must delay exenteration.
