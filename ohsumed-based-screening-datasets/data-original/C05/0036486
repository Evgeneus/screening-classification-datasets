Treatment of a large odontogenic keratocyst using the Brosch procedure.
 The modified Brosch procedure has been described.
 It represents a reasonable alternative to resection or marsupialization when treating large OKC that occupy the molar, angle, and ramus regions of the mandible.
 Extraction of teeth affected by the lesion as well as generous removal of partially eroded bone and overlying soft tissues may contribute to lower recurrence rates.
 Cryosurgical or mechanical treatment of the bony cavity, which is well visualized using this technique, may also lead to improved long-term results.
 Treatment must be followed by continued, careful observation of the patient.
