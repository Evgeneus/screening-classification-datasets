Prevention of chronic erosive streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis in rats by treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the T cell antigen receptor alpha beta.
 Rats treated with an mAb (R73) against the TCR-alpha beta failed to develop chronic persistent arthritis after injection of streptococcal cell walls.
 Histologically, R73 mAb-treated rats had mild hyperplasia of synovial lining cells and minimal destruction of cartilage.
 In contrast, control-treated animals developed marked pannus formation, with pronounced infiltration of mononuclear cells and severe destruction of cartilage and subchondral bone.
 The preventive effect of R73 mAb on streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis was associated with the marked depletion of alpha beta + T cells by R73 mAb.
 These results indicate that T cells play a crucial role in chronic erosive streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis.
