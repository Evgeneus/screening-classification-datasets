Prevalence of HLA-B27 in patients with back pain attending a pain clinic.
 101 patients presenting to a pain clinic with low back pain were tested for HLA-B27 status.
 Eight (7.9%) of the patients were positive for HLA-B27.
 This prevalence is similar to that recorded in the general population and suggests that few patients referred to our clinic with back pain have undiagnosed spondyloarthropathies.
