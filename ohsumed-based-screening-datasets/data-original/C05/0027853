Mode of growth of acquired cholesteatoma.
 A histopathological study of acquired cholesteatoma in four temporal bones from two adults and one child is presented.
 The findings suggest that the cholesteatoma originated from the retraction pockets of the tympanic membrane and there was active growth of the squamous epithelium of the retraction pockets, which may be enhanced in the presence of otitis media.
