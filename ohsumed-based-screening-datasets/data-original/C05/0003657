Two- to four-year results of posterior cruciate-sparing condylar total knee arthroplasty with an uncemented femoral component.
 One hundred fourteen hybrid Press-Fit Condylar total knee arthroplasties (TKAs) were reviewed an average of 2.8 years after surgery to determine if this method of implantation provided satisfactory results compared with conventional cemented TKAs.
 Ninety-three percent of the knees had good or excellent results, and 94% of the knees had at most only mild or occasional pain.
 One knee with a metal-backed patella was revised for mechanical failure of the patellar button.
 Roentgenographic analysis of the femoral component interface showed that 30% of knees had a radiolucent line in at least one zone.
 However, none of the lines was wider than 1 mm, and none was about the central stem.
 There were no signs of loosening about any of the components.
 It was concluded that hybrid TKA provides a good and predictable result that is comparable to cemented TKA.
