Composite reconstruction for chest wall and scalp using multiple ribs-latissimus dorsi osteomyocutaneous flaps as pedicled and free flaps.
 A composite flap is presented based on the latissimus dorsi myocutaneous unit together with the underlying ninth to eleventh ribs.
 Three patients are presented.
 In two, a full-thickness chest-wall defect was present.
 In one, a full-thickness scalp and cranial defect was present.
 Use of the composite osteomyocutaneous latissimus dorsi free flap as a pedicled flap in two patients and as a free flap in one patient resulted in successful definitive reconstruction in all with no complications.
 This procedure necessitates no transplantation of soft tissue prior to bone grafting to maintain local vascularity, so the simultaneous one-stage reconstruction of an osseous-soft-tissue defect becomes possible easily.
