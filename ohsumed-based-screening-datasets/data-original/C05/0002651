Early facial reanimation following radical parotid and temporal bone tumor resections.
 A retrospective study of 35 patients who underwent early facial reanimation following extirpative parotid and temporal bone surgery requiring facial nerve sacrifice was performed.
 Regional facial reanimation performed immediately or within several days included 16 patients who underwent temporalis muscle transposition and 27 who underwent gold weight or eyespring lid reanimation with lower lid tightening.
 Simultaneous nerve grafts or nerve crossover procedures were performed in 22 patients.
 The authors' favored approaches to facial reanimation are discussed, with an emphasis on the value of early reanimation using properly selected techniques.
