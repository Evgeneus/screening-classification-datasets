Weight lifting. Risks and injuries to the shoulder.
 The weight lifter's desire to achieve higher limits of performance coupled with the rotator cuff's unfavorable position during lifting often leads to shoulder injury.
 Proper lifting techniques and training habits could reduce the risk of injury.
 When chronic symptoms occur, however, arthroscopy can help diagnose the injury, and arthroscopic procedures for injuries such as rotator cuff chronic tendinitis and incomplete tears, and biceps tenosynovitis can be performed.
