Modified approach for ethmoid and anterior skull base surgery.
 The use of combined craniofacial resection is well established for tumors of the ethmoid bone and the anterior aspect of the base of the skull.
 Mobilization of the medial fronto-orbital ridge improves the transbasal approach and can be performed with a monobloc bone flap.
 We describe an en bloc bifrontal craniotomy including the supraorbital ridges and the nasal bones.
 This provides a wider angle of approach to the anterior aspect of the base of the skull than any other method and avoids retraction of the frontal lobes.
 This type of bone flap procedure can be performed after a wide periosteal dissection in the coronal area of the scalp alone, without facial skin incision.
