The chronic fatigue syndrome.
 The chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) was formally defined in 1988 to describe disabling fatigue of at least 6 months' duration of uncertain etiology.
 Reports of CFS have emerged from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Israel, Spain, and France.
 The disease primarily affects individuals between 20 and 50 years of age, and there is a preponderance of females.
 Although a triggering infectious illness is reported by most patients with CFS, there is no convincing evidence causally linking any currently recognized infectious agent to CFS.
 Multiple minor immunologic aberrations are frequent but inconsistent and of uncertain significance.
 There is no consistent evidence for myopathy or physical deconditioning.
 Depression is found in approximately 50% of CFS patients, with depression preceding the physical symptoms in half of the cases.
 No therapy has been proved effective in controlled clinical trials with prolonged follow-up, although antidepressants have not been formally evaluated.
 The long-term prognosis of patients with CFS has not been well studied, but CFS appears to be a disease of prolonged duration with considerable morbidity but no mortality.
 Further research into the pathogenesis and treatment of CFS is necessary.
