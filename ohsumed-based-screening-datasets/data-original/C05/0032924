Reconstruction of the entire upper eyelid area with a subcutaneous pedicle flap based on the orbicularis oculi muscle.
 Lagophthalmos caused by trauma or inflammation may damage the cornea and, if not adequately treated, may result in loss of eyesight.
 Hence surgical intervention is required at the earliest possible stage.
 We have developed a subcutaneous pedicle flap elevated from the temporozygomatic area and rotated 180 degrees around a small pedicle base that contains the orbicularis oculi muscle.
 With this flap, the entire upper eyelid can be reconstructed as an aesthetic unit in one stage so that the result is satisfactory not only functionally, but also cosmetically.
 The operative procedure is presented along with case reports.
