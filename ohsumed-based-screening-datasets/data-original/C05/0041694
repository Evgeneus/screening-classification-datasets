Human parvovirus B19 and its associated diseases.
 From the point of view of obstetrics and pediatrics, the importance of B19 infection lies in the potential for intraueterine infection following maternal B19 infection.
 Ongoing prospective studies of B19 infection in pregnant women indicate a risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes considerably lower than previous estimates from retrospective studies and case reports.
 The occurrence, however, of severe nonimmune hydrops or stillbirths or both in even a small percentage of progeny of B19-infected pregnant women is a concern.
 It thus behooves physicians caring for pregnant women and their offspring to be thoroughly familiar with B19 and issues related to B19 infection in pregnancy.
