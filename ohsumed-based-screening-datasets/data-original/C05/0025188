Rate and incidence of capsular contracture: a comparison of smooth and textured silicone double-lumen breast prostheses.
 Capsular contracture results in dissatisfaction and deformity among the 2 million women who have had silicone implants.
 The literature describes contracture rates as high as 74 percent.
 I present a comparison of rates and incidences of contracture in patients augmented with smooth and textured double-lumen silicone implants.
 A total of 165 "smooth" and 63 "textured" implant patients were included in this study, which spans 12 years, 1978-1990.
 All patients underwent bilateral aesthetic augmentation performed by the same surgeon.
 Of the 165 smooth implant patients, 74 (44.8 percent) experienced contractures requiring treatment.
 Of the 63 textured implant patients, 3 (4.8 percent) previous contracture patients experienced sudden fibrosis within 3 months.
 All others remained soft.
 It appears that deeply textured silicone surfaces delay or decrease the rate and incidence of clinical capsular contracture, at least for 2 years.
