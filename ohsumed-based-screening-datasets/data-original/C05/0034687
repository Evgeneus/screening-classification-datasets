Thoracic disc disease and stenosis.
 Disc herniation and stenosis in the thoracic spine are relatively uncommon compared with their occurrence in the cervical or lumbar spine.
 They are usually degenerative, although trauma may be an aggravating or initiating factor.
 The clinical presentation includes local and/or radicular pain with or without signs and symptoms of cord dysfunction.
 Radicular pain may be secondary to mechanical compression or vascular impingement.
 MR imaging is the best way to define the specific abnormality as well as the effect on the adjacent spinal cord.
 CT after myelography may be useful as well, especially in those patients in whom there is involvement of the posterior ligamentous and osseous structures of the thoracic spinal canal.
 MR imaging may finally reveal the true incidence of thoracic disc herniation.
