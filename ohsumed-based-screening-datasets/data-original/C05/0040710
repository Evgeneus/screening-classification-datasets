Fine needle aspiration biopsy in orbital tumours.
 Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) was performed in 46 patients with an orbital mass.
 Positive cytological identification was made in 43 biopsy specimens.
 In 26 cases with histopathological control the accuracy was 81%.
 In experienced hands FNAB is safe and appears to be a valuable tool in establishing a diagnosis of malignancy in orbital tumours.
