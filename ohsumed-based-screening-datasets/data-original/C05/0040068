Retrospective long-term follow-up analysis in 21 patients with chordomas of various sites treated at a single institution.
 Twenty-one patients with chordoma were treated at the Radiation Oncology Center, Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, between 1949 and 1986.
 Thirteen patients had sacrococcygeal tumors, five had clival tumors, two had nasopharyngeal tumors, and one had a lumbar spine tumor.
 Nine patients were treated with surgery alone, eight patients with subtotal resection and postoperative irradiation, and four patients with radiotherapy alone after biopsy.
 The 5- and 10-year actuarial survival rates were 74% and 46%, respectively.
 The 10-year actuarial survival rate was significantly better in patients treated with surgery alone or surgery and irradiation than in those treated with radiotherapy alone (52%, 32%, and 0%, respectively, p = 0.02).
 Although all patients ultimately suffered a recurrence, those with lumbosacral tumors treated with surgery and irradiation had a longer mean disease-free survival period (6.6 years) than those treated with surgery alone (4.1 years) (p = 0.08).
 Disease-free survival times of patients with base of the skull tumors was not significantly different between the treatment groups.
 Irradiation after resection of chordomas appears to increase the time to first relapse in lumbosacral tumors and should be considered after subtotal resection.
