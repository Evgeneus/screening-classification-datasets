Sesamoid disorders and treatment. An update.
 The anatomy, function, and disorders of the hallucal sesamoids show that the diagnosis and current concept of management are based on the individual patient's problems.
 The treatment should always be initiated in a conservative fashion, generally using a molded insole with an appropriate excavation to shift weight from a painful sesamoid.
 The advantages and disadvantages of sesamoidectomy are influenced by surgical technique.
 Care in handling the medial and lateral hallucal nerves is essential.
 Removal of both the medial and lateral sesamoids invariably leads to an intractable clawtoe deformity and is absolutely contraindicated.
