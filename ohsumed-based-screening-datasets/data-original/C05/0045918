Third place--Resident Basic Science Award 1990. Interleukin 1 causing bone destruction in middle ear cholesteatoma.
 We previously reported the localization of interleukin 1 in the epithelial layer of human cholesteatomas.
 On the basis of other studies that showed interleukin 1 can stimulate fibroblasts and macrophages to produce collagenases and prostaglandins, we then proposed that interleukin 1 may play an important role in cholesteatoma-related bone resorption, also.
 Our immunocytochemical study involving more human cholesteatoma samples revealed the presence of interleukin 1 in bone cells and monocytes in the region of active bone destruction.
 In the present study, the effect of interleukin 1 on these cells found at the bone resorption site was examined.
 By radioimmunoassay, interleukin 1 was shown to stimulate the production of prostaglandin E2 by osteoblasts in vitro.
 Interleukin 1 also promoted the migration and multinucleation of bone marrow-derived monocytes.
 These osteoclast-like cells formed from monocytes contained tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and caused the resorption of the devitalized bone in vitro.
 Above findings suggest that interleukin 1 could cause the bone destruction in cholesteatomas, not only by stimulating the local bone cells, but also by recruiting monocytes for osteoclastic bone resorption.
