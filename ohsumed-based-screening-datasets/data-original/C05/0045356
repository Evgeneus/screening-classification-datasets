Immunogenetics of polymyalgia rheumatica.
 Evidence suggests that polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) may be an immune-mediated disease.
 Therefore, the role of HLA class II genes, the switch region of immunoglobin mu and alpha 1 heavy chain as the T-cell receptor (TcR) genes were investigated by Southern blot analysis.
 The frequency of DR4 specificity was increased in PMR (67.4% versus 30.3%; P = 0.00017).
 No association was found with the DQA and DQB genes, the switch region of immunoglobulin mu and alpha 1 heavy chain genes, and the TcR alpha, beta and gamma genes.
 This study suggests that HLA-DR4 is an important susceptibility factor for PMR.
 Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of Ig and TcR genes.
