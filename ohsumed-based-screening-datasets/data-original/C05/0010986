Induction of arthritis in rats by aqueous suspensions of mycobacteria without the use of oil.
 We report for the first time the induction of arthritis by an aqueous, rather than an oil, suspension of killed tubercle bacilli.
 This was accomplished in the highly susceptible dark Agouti strain of rats, by intraperitoneal injection during the healing phase of chemically induced peritonitis.
 The same procedure (injection after the induction of peritonitis) augmented the incidence of arthritis produced by bovine type II collagen and Freund's complete adjuvant.
 Enhanced delivery of antigen from the peritoneal cavity to regional lymph nodes in the postinflammatory state was responsible for this increase in the induction of arthritis.
