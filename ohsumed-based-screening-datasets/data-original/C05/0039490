Intestinal injury after lumbar discectomy.
 In a review of 5,200 lumbar discectomies performed from 1974 to 1989, two patients sustained a ventral perforation of the disc space followed by isolated small intestinal injury.
 Both patients underwent lumbar discectomy at the lumbosacral junction and presented with signs and symptoms of acute abdominal distress within three days after the operation.
 At surgical laparotomy, small tears were noted in the ileum, which were closed primarily.
 The patients had an uneventful recovery.
 The results of a review of 11 instances reported in the literature suggest that isolated intestinal injuries usually occur postoperatively at the lumbosacral junction and involve the small intestine.
 Factors, such as body habitus, surgical experience, patient positioning and types of instruments, as well as the use of a surgical microscope, do not appear to modify the risk of intestinal injury.
 After discectomy, patients may present with acute abdominal signs and symptoms or chronic wound infections.
 Work-up studies include evaluation of vascular structures and ureters either roentgenographically or at abdominal exploration.
 A high index of suspicion and adequate disc space visualization during discectomy may reduce the incidence of this complication.
