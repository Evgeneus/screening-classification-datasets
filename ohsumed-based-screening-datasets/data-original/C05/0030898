Intraoperative recordings of spinal somatosensory evoked potentials to tibial nerve and sural nerve stimulation.
 Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) to stimulation of the tibial nerve at the knee (TN-K) and ankle (TN-A), and the sural nerve at the ankle (SN-A), were recorded from 3 or 4 spinal levels during surgery for scoliosis in 11 neurologically normal subjects.
 With stimulation of all 3 nerves, the propagation velocity along the spine was nonlinear: it was faster over cauda equina and midthoracic cord than over caudal spinal cord.
 Over the mid-thoracic cord, TN-K SSEP propagation was faster than that of TN-A and SN-A SSEPs, whereas over the caudal spinal cord these values were similar on stimulation of all 3 nerves.
 These data suggest that fast conducting second order afferent fiber systems contribute to spinal cord SSEPs evoked by stimulating both mixed and cutaneous peripheral nerves.
