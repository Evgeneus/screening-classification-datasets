Human extracellular recombinant phospholipase A2 induces an inflammatory response in rabbit joints.
 Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzymes hydrolyze membrane phospholipids liberating fatty acid and lysophospholipid.
 This event is thought to be the rate-limiting step in the generation of the lipid proinflammatory mediators, the eicosanoids and possibly platelet-activating factor.
 For this reason, extracellular forms of PLA2 have been postulated to be a component of the inflammatory cascade in certain biologic settings.
 In the synovial fluid of patients with inflammatory arthritides, substantial amounts of PLA2 activity have been found, and subsequently, one enzyme was purified, cloned, and expressed.
 Here we show that the pure recombinant enzyme free of any proinflammatory contaminants elicits a dramatic inflammatory, arthritogenic response when injected into the joint space of healthy rabbits.
 Within 24 h, extensive leukocyte infiltration and hyperplasia of the synovial lining cells were observed, and prostaglandin production in the joint space increased.
 In comparison, pancreatic PLA2(2) had little activity in this system, whereas a very inflammatory cobra venom enzyme was intermediate in its effects.
 In view of the presence of the enzyme in inflamed joints, the fact that its synthesis and secretion can be induced by proinflammatory cytokines and its proinflammatory biologic activity, we suggest that synovial PLA2 plays an exacerbating role in acute episodes in chronic inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.
