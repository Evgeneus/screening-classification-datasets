Depression and chronic fatigue in the college student-athlete.
 For the most part, the intercollegiate athlete is a well-adjusted individual who demonstrates considerable vigor and well-being and less depression, anxiety, and fatigue when compared with nonathletic counterparts.
 The well trained athlete also demonstrates a personality that may be somewhat rigid, is strongly goal oriented, and strives for excellence.
 It is not unrealistic to expect that when confronted with diminished performance or success, athletes may be compelled to drive themselves harder to succeed.
 Such behavior typically leads to the phenomenon of overtraining, which can express itself in the form of chronic fatigue and depression.
 A number of other organic causes of chronic fatigue and depression must be excluded by careful evaluation and appropriate diagnostic testing.
 Although the evaluation of the athlete who presents with chronic fatigue and depression can be somewhat complex, a diagnostic framework has been outlined that may assist the clinician in the assessment of the athlete who presents with such complaints.
