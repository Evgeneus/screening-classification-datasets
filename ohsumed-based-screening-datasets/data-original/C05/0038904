Pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis with paralysis. Prognosis and treatment.
 In the interval between 1983 and 1988, 14 patients were treated for pyogenic spondylitis complicated by neurologic compromise.
 There were nine males and five females aged 39-80 years.
 The average time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis was 2.8 months.
 Predisposing factors were diabetes mellitus in four patients and urinary tract infections in five patients.
 The infection was blood borne in all 14 patients.
 In two patients, the infection was superimposed on a recent vertebral fracture.
 The cervical spine was involved in one patient; the thoracic spine in seven; and the lumbar spine in six patients.
 Six patients presented with a Frankel B paralysis, six with a Frankel C paralysis, and two with grade D paralysis.
 The neurologic symptoms lasted between one day and six weeks before surgery.
 Twelve patients had anterolateral decompression.
 Two of the 12 patients had a second stage posterior stabilization.
 Two patients were deemed inoperable.
 All surviving patients were managed by parenteral antibiotics for three to six weeks followed by enteral route for a total of three to six months.
 All 12 operated patients had a significant neurologic improvement (one grade or more on the Frankel scale) with solid interbody fusion.
