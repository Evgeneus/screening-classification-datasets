Magnetic resonance imaging signs of optic nerve gliomas in neurofibromatosis 1.
 We reviewed the magnetic resonance images of four children with neurofibromatosis 1 and orbital optic gliomas.
 The images showed double-intensity tubular thickening characteristic of perineural arachnoidal gliomatosis, elongation of the nerves, and downward kinking of the nerves in the midorbit.
 We believe these findings typify the orbital gliomas in patients with this disease.
