Magnetic resonance imaging of radiation optic neuropathy.
 Three patients with delayed radiation optic neuropathy after radiation therapy for parasellar neoplasms underwent magnetic resonance imaging.
 The affected optic nerves and chiasms showed enlargement and focal gadopentetate dimeglumine enhancement.
 The magnetic resonance imaging technique effectively detected and defined anterior visual pathway changes of radionecrosis and excluded the clinical possibility of visual loss because of tumor recurrence.
