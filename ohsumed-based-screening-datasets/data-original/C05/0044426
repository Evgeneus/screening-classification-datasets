The impact of increased contact on psychosocial outcomes in patients with osteoarthritis: a randomized, controlled trial.
 After baseline in home interviews, 439 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) were randomly assigned to the control or one of 3 intervention groups which differed only in method of delivery (i.e., phone, clinic, both).
 Trained nonclinical interviewers reviewed medications, problems with joint pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, early warning signs for common chronic diseases, scheduled outpatient visits, an evening/weekend clinic telephone number, barriers to care, and suggestions to encourage participation during clinic visits.
 We hypothesized that the intervention would enhance social support, satisfaction with care, morale, and medication compliance.
 We found that none of the interventions had any effect upon these outcomes.
