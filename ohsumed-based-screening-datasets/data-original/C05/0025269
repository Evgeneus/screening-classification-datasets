Condensing osteitis of the clavicle: a rare but frequently misdiagnosed condition.
 Condensing osteitis of the clavicle is a benign, often painful disorder, marked by bony sclerosis at the sternal end of the clavicle.
 It can be mistaken for other abnormalities such as Friedrich disease, bone island, osteoid osteoma, sternoclavicular osteoarthritis, and even a metastasis and osteosarcoma.
 Clinical, radiologic, scintigraphic, and histologic features of this condition are discussed and a brief overview of the treatment is provided.
 Three histologically proved cases are added to the 13 previously reported in the literature.
 Recognition of condensing osteitis of the clavicle may avoid the occasional unnecessarily aggressive diagnostic approach taken to search for a malignant tumor.
