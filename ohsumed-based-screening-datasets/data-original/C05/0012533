Posterior transfer of the adductors in children who have cerebral palsy. A long-term study.
 Seventy-eight posterior transfers of the adductors of the hip in forty-two children who has spastic cerebral palsy were reviewed an average of 5.7 years after the operation (range, two to 14.6 years).
 The results were assessed on the basis of the patient's ability to walk, the range of motion of the affected hip or hips, and the radiographic measurements.
 In 88 per cent of the patients, the transfer was successful in improving or maintaining abduction, extension, functional walking, and stability of the hip.
 The failures were all in patients who were unable to walk and who had spastic quadriplegia.
 Tenotomy of the iliopsoas tendon at the time of the transfer procedure resulted in an improved range of motion of the hip.
