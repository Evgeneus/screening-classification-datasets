Saphenous nerve entrapment caused by pes anserine bursitis mimicking stress fracture of the tibia.
 Numerous studies have addressed saphenous nerve entrapment at the level of the adductor canal.
 In this case, we report an entrapment syndrome located further distally occurring as part of an athletic overuse injury.
 Distal tibial pain, initially managed as a stress fracture, resolved when a pes anserine bursitis was treated.
 This was associated with return of saphenous nerve potentials along the tibia.
