Pseudoaneurysm of the popliteal artery as a complication of an osteochondroma. A review of the literature and a case report.
 False aneurysm of the femoral artery was associated with a solitary osteochondroma of the femur in a 22-year-old man.
 An extensive review of the literature and the problems related to diagnosis revealed that the aneurysm was apparently unique.
 Contrary to previous reports, computed tomography and angiography did not establish the diagnosis.
 The physical findings were more informative.
