Renal function predicts colchicine toxicity: guidelines for the prophylactic use of colchicine in gout.
 In order to establish the degree of renal malfunction necessary for colchicine toxicity in patients receiving it daily for the prevention of recurrent acute gout, we obtained serum creatinine levels and measured or estimated creatinine clearances in a consecutive series of 17 patients with demonstrated colchicine myotoxicity.
 An estimate of creatinine clearance, based on ideal body weight and age, was nearly always 50 ml/min or less, and was the most practical predictor of the risk of toxicity.
 By comparison, patients with gout from the same clinical data base, but without myotoxicity, had normal renal function.
 The data yield clear guidelines for safe use of colchicine chronically.
