Dysplasia epiphysealis capitis femoris. Meyer's dysplasia.
 We made a prospective longitudinal clinical and radiological study of 18 children diagnosed as having dysplasia epiphysealis capitis femoris.
 Half the cases were bilateral.
 Boys were affected five times more often than girls.
 There were no symptoms or clinical signs in most but some of the bilateral cases had an inconsistent waddling gait.
 The imaging studies suggest that the cartilaginous proximal femoral epiphysis is hypoplastic, with delayed appearance of single or multiple ossification centres.
 Progressive improvement occurred and at an average age of five years and six months, there was complete fusion of all the ossific nuclei and normal density and texture of the epiphyseal bone.
 The end result was a round epiphysis with a slightly diminished height.
 The dysplasia is attributed to focal hypoplasia of the proximal femoral epiphysis.
