Depression and chronic fatigue in children. A masquerade ball.
 Major depression disease is uncommon in children; it occurs mostly in children with a depressed parent or in children under major psychosocial stress such as physical or sexual abuse.
 Most depression in children is masked, i.e., the child presents with signs or symptoms such as headaches, abdominal pain, muscle weakness, vomiting, dizziness, hyperactivity, or school avoidance.
 Careful evaluation of the history is required to assist in the diagnosis.
 Some basic laboratory tests should be done to rule out organic disease.
 Psychiatric referral should be carried out after an appropriate evaluation.
