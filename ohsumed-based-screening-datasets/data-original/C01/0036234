Arthrodesis of the knee with an intramedullary nail.
 The cases of twenty patients who had an arthrodesis in which an intramedullary nail was used for stabilization were reviewed at an average follow-up of six years.
 The predominant indications were infection after total knee arthroplasty and post-traumatic pain and instability.
 Other indications included aseptic loosening of the components of a total knee arthroplasty, reconstruction after resection of a giant-cell tumor, non-union of a fracture of the distal part of the femur or the proximal part of the tibia, and failed external-compression arthrodesis.
 Success was achieved in seventeen patients (85 per cent), and functional stability immediately postoperatively was gained in all twenty.
 Of the three patients in whom the arthrodesis failed, all had sustained an intraoperative fracture, and infection eventually developed.
 Of the twelve nails that were secured to the greater trochanter with a loop of stainless-steel wire, none showed evidence of proximal migration.
 Of the eight nails that were not thus secured, two migrated proximally, necessitating removal of the nail.
 Two drawbacks to this operation are the long duration and the large amount of blood that is lost.
 The major advantage is that a high percentage of patients have progression to a stable fusion despite serious problems.
 Furthermore, all but seven patients (including the six who had a tumor or who had sustained an intraoperative fracture) were able to bear full weight by the second postoperative week.
 Only a few patients needed an external support for walking.
