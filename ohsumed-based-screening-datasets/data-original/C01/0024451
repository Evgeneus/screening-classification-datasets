Pott's disease of the cervical spine.
 Tuberculosis of the cervical spine is relatively rare, and the diagnosis is often delayed.
 Roentgenograms and computerized tomography of the cervical spine can provide important diagnostic clues.
 Chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment, but when neurologic deficits are present the best treatment is debridement and anterior spinal fusion combined with antituberculous chemotherapy.
 The incidence of tuberculosis is increasing in parallel with the growing numbers of immunocompromised patients.
 Awareness of the manifestations of cervical Pott's disease may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment of affected patients.
