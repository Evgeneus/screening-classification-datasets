In vitro susceptibilities of ocular Bacillus cereus isolates to clindamycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin alone or in combination.
 A broth dilution assay was used to determine the in vitro susceptibilities of 10 ocular isolates of Bacillus cereus to clindamycin, gentamicin, and vancomycin both alone and in combination.
 The checkerboard technique was used to determine fractional inhibitory and bactericidal concentration indices for combinations of clindamycin-gentamicin and vancomycin-gentamicin.
