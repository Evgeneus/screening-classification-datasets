Treatment of chronic infected hip arthroplasty wounds by radical debridement and obliteration with pedicled and free muscle flaps.
 Nine patients with extensive wounds of the hip joint due to chronic infection following total hip arthroplasty or internal fixation of fractures of the femoral head and neck have been treated by serial radical debridements to remove infected bone, contaminated remnants of bone cement, and the surrounding fibrotic soft tissues.
 The resultant deep cavity extending down to the acetabulum has then been obliterated with either pedicled muscle flaps or free muscle flaps.
 Subcutaneous or transpelvic transposition of rectus abdominis muscle flaps is preferred for smaller defects, but only the free latissimus dorsi muscle flap provides sufficient volume of tissue to obliterate the more extensive hip defects.
 Systemic antibiotics have been continued only for a short-term course of 14 days postoperatively.
 There has been no recurrence of infection, with follow-up ranging between 6 months and 3 1/4 years.
 One patient has undergone reimplantation of a second custom hip prosthesis into the vascularized bed of a free latissimus dorsi muscle flap.
