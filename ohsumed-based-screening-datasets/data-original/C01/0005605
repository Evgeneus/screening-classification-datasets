Oral histoplasmosis as a presenting disease in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [published erratum appears in Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol 1991 Jan;71(1):76]
 A 43-year-old homosexual man visited his dentist with painful, nodular, ulcerated lesions on the soft palate, right buccal mucosa, and right posterior maxillary gingiva.
 Serologic studies for exposure to human immunodeficiency virus, performed before biopsy, were positive.
 Biopsy of the maxillary gingiva demonstrated sheets of histiocytes containing small intracellular yeasts, which on culture were identified as Histoplasma capsulatum.
 Bilateral leukoplakic lesions with some vertical furrowing involving the lateral borders of the tongue were also noted.
 Histologically, hyperkeratosis and fungal hyphae were identified.
 The patient was treated for histoplasmosis with amphotericin B, which resulted in significant improvement of the oral lesions.
 He was subsequently hospitalized for fatigue and dyspnea and was found to have Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 Pulmonary status deteriorated within a 3-week period, and the patient died.
 Autopsy findings were negative for histoplasmosis but positive for necrotizing and cavitary P.
 carinii pneumonia, pulmonary and hepatic herpes simplex infections, and pulmonary and intestinal cytomegalovirus infection.
