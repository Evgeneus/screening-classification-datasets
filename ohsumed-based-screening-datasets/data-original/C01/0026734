Vitamin E supplementation does not improve survival from infection in mice when given after burn injury.
 Previous studies have shown that vitamin E acetate given by gavage to mice before thermal injury can improve survival from subsequent infection.
 We tested the efficacy of aqueous vitamin E given parenterally after burn injury.
 Female BALB/c mice (n = 120) were given 15% total body surface area full-thickness flame burns.
 Three groups of mice were randomized to receive water-miscible vitamin E with the resuscitation fluid in doses of 0.5 mg per mouse, 0.167 mg per mouse, or 0.056 mg per mouse.
 These doses represented approximately nine, three, and one times the murine recommended daily allowance for vitamin E, respectively.
 Control mice were given saline only.
 The next day the mice were challenged with 2.5 x 10(5) Pseudomonas aeruginosa beneath the eschar.
 Administration of vitamin E was continued on a daily basis for a total of three doses and ending the day after bacterial challenge.
 Mortality rates were observed for 1 week and were not statistically different among the four groups.
 We conclude that vitamin E supplementation started after thermal injury in mice does not improve outcome from subsequent challenge with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
