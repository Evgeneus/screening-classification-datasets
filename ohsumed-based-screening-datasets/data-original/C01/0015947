Early complications in the operative treatment of ankle fractures. Influence of delay before operation.
 We have reviewed the early complications of 121 surgically treated closed ankle fractures; the complication rate was 30%, with 14 major and 22 minor complications.
 Fractures with skin blisters or abrasions had more than double the overall complication rate.
 Fracture-dislocations had three times as many major complications as simple fractures, and those not fixed within 24 hours had a 44% major complication rate compared to 5.3% in those operated upon as emergencies.
 Patients transferred from another medical facility had high complication rates, especially if they had fracture-dislocations.
 We conclude that operative treatment of ankle fractures must be delivered in a timely fashion, especially in severe fractures.
 We would caution against the practice of transferring patients with serious ankle fractures before completion of definitive care.
