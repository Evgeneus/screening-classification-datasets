Liver abscess complicating intratumoral ethanol injection therapy for HCC.
 We report a patient who developed multiple liver abscesses and sepsis caused by lactobacilli after the percutaneous intratumoral injection of ethanol for hepatocellular carcinoma.
 We diagnosed the liver abscess at an early stage because of a the finding of gas on ultrasound and computed tomography.
 Blood cultures grew Gram-positive rods, which were of the Lactobacillus species.
 The patient responded to the administration of antibiotics, and his hepatic tumors have not recurred in the 7 months since treatment.
 This is the first report of liver abscess following percutaneous ethanol injection therapy.
