Tissue transplant-transmitted infections.
 Tissue bankers, as well as those transplanting tissues, have been sensitized to the possibility of transmission of fatal infection via tissue transplants, particularly following recent reports of a few cases of AIDS or HIV infection from bone, semen, and skin grafts.
 It is beyond the scope of this review to describe the steps taken by tissue banks to enhance the safety of tissue transplants.
 Of note is the fact that a number of new donor screening tests, such as those for antibody to HIV, HBcAg, hepatitis C virus, and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I, have recently been implemented.
 In addition, rapid advances in the medical history screening of tissue donors and tissue procurement, processing, and preservation continue.
 Viral inactivation studies are also being undertaken.
 All these measures are being introduced to increase the safety of tissue transplants.
