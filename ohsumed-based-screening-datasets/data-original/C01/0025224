Adverse reactions to prolonged treatment with high doses of carbenicillin and ureidopenicillins.
 Charts were reviewed for 63 patients whose chronic pseudomonas osteomyelitis was treated with high doses of extended-spectrum penicillins for prolonged periods.
 The incidence of untoward drug reactions was significantly higher than expected.
 Carbenicillin evoked adverse reactions in 22.8% of patients.
 However, most of these reactions were mild, and a change of drug was required in only 5.7% of cases.
 No adverse drug reactions were observed with cumulative doses of less than 750 g.
 In contrast to carbenicillin, the ureidopenicillins were associated with adverse reactions in 67.7% of patients; most reactions were moderate to severe in intensity; a cumulative dose of greater than 250 g produced adverse reactions; and discontinuation or change of therapy was required in 51.6% of cases.
 The main adverse reactions to both carbenicillin and the ureidopenicillins included rash, drug fever, leukopenia, eosinophilia, thrombocytopenia, and hepatic damage.
