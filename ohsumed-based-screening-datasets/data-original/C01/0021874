Complications of indwelling central venous catheters in bone marrow transplant recipients.
 Complications associated with indwelling central venous catheters in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation are presented.
 The study group was comprised of 123 patients who underwent transplantation from 1982 to 1988 in whom 139 catheters were placed.
 One hundred and fifteen of 139 catheters placed had a triple lumen, while 24 had a dual lumen.
 Percutaneous placement through the subclavian vein was used in 127 of 139 catheters with a low complication rate.
 Catheters remained in place for 65.0 +/- 55.5 days (mean +/- standard deviation).
 One hundred and eight catheters remained functional during the course of treatment for these patients and lasted until elective removal or until the patient died.
 Thirty-one catheters were removed because of a complication.
 Infection was the most common complication, occurring in 22 catheters.
 Seven infected catheters were salvaged with antibiotic therapy.
 Coagulase negative staphylococcus was the most frequent organism identified.
 Mechanical problems causing catheter malfunction, migration, thrombosis and cuff erosion occurred in 19 catheters; 15 were removed.
 We concluded that double and triple lumen Silastic (silicone rubber) catheters provide relatively safe and effective access for bone marrow transplant recipients.
 The triple lumen catheter provides an additional venous access port that facilitates intensive care.
 The duration of catheter function is sufficient in most patients for therapy during and after bone marrow transplantation.
 Infection is the most common complication; our results indicate that catheters can be maintained and salvaged in some patients with septicemia.
 Noninfectious complications are less frequent, although catheters with persistent mechanical problems are less likely to be salvaged.
