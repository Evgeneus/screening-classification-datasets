The neurologic workup in patients with cervical spine disorders.
 Care must be exercised in interpreting the clinical and radiologic findings when assessing patients with cervical spondylosis and involvement of neural structures for surgery.
 If the clinical picture cannot logically be explained by the radiologic findings, further investigation is indicated to exclude a coexistent disorder.
 Investigations may include electrophysiologic tests, transcranial magnetic stimulation, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
 Only then can the indication for surgical intervention be properly determined.
