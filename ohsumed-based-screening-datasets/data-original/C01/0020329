Chlamydia trachomatis infections in children evaluated for sexual abuse.
 The purpose of this study was to elucidate the conditions under which children evaluated for sexual abuse should be tested for Chlamydia trachomatis.
 Children were seen in an outpatient sexual abuse clinic over a nine-month period.
 Eight patients, ranging from 1.5 to 14.5 years of age, had positive C.
 trachomatis cultures.
 The records of these patients were examined for historical information and physical findings suggestive of rectal or vaginal penetration.
 Neither historical information of abuse nor physical findings were helpful in predicting the C.
 trachomatis infections.
 These results suggest that all children being evaluated for sexual abuse should be cultured for C.
 trachomatis.
