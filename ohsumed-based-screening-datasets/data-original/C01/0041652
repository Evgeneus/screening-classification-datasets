Human herpesvirus-6 infection in bone marrow transplantation.
 Twenty-five pediatric patients who received bone marrow transplantation (BMT) were studied prospectively to determine the relationship between BMT and human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) infection by the virus isolation from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow and by determining neutralizing antibodies to HHV-6 during the 2 months following BMT.
 All of the 25 donors and the recipients were immune to HHV-6 at the time of BMT and the virus was not isolated from them.
 HHV-6 was isolated from peripheral blood and/or bone marrow mononuclear cells in ten (40%) of the 25 recipients between day 14 and day 22 of BMT, but not from any other day.
 Two additional recipients showed a significant increase in the antibody titer.
 Thus, infection with HHV-6 was confirmed in 12 (48%) of the 25 recipients.
 Four of the 12 developed skin rashes; three of these four had a febrile episode when the virus was isolated, whereas none of the remaining 13 developed the skin rash.
 These results suggest a frequent infection with HHV-6 only a few weeks after BMT and a close association between the infection with the virus and the development of skin rashes.
