Plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor in the adult respiratory distress syndrome.
 The purpose of the study was to evaluate the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in critically ill patients.
 An immunoradiometric assay with an upper normal limit of 9 pg/ml was used to measure plasma TNF alpha levels (pl-TNF alpha) in 34 patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and in 16 patients in whom, despite the presence of risk factors, ARDS did not develop.
 Pl-TNF alpha was elevated in 76% of the patients with ARDS (71 +/- 104 pg/ml) and in 48% of the at-risk patients (47 +/- 73 pg/ml); the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.
 In 13 patients studied serially from the onset (Day 0) to the fifth day of ARDS, the peak pl-TNF alpha occurred later than Day 0 in seven subjects.
 Although the highest pl-TNF alpha levels were found in septic patients, moderately elevated values were also observed in 56% of nonseptic subjects.
 We conclude that plasma TNF alpha level is not a marker of ARDS but rather of shock and sepsis.
 These results do not exclude a pathogenic role of TNF alpha in acute lung injury since this cytokine could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs.
 The large incidence of abnormally high could be produced and exert its effects within the lungs.
 The large incidence of abnormally high plasma TNF alpha levels raises important questions on the role of this toxic cytokine in other disorders occurring in critically ill patients.
