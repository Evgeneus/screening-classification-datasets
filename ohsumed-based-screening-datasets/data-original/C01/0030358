Effectiveness of clarithromycin and minocycline alone and in combination against experimental Mycobacterium leprae infection in mice.
 As determined by the proportional bactericide method, clarithromycin had strong bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium leprae.
 Clarithromycin was administered to mice by gavage as 20 daily doses at dosages of 12.5 to 50 mg/kg of body weight.
 At a dosage of 25 mg/kg, minocycline was more active than clarithromycin at a dosage of 50 mg/kg.
 Additive effects were displayed with the combination of clarithromycin (50 mg/kg) and minocycline (25 mg/kg), both of which were administered daily by gavage, and of clarithromycin and minocycline, both of which were administered daily by gavage at dosages of 25 mg/kg each, with rifampin at a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg.
