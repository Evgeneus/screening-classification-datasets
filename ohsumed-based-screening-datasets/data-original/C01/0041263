Astroviruses as a cause of nosocomial outbreaks of infant diarrhea.
 During a 16-month study period at a children's hospital, 32 children developed nosocomial gastroenteritis caused by astroviruses.
 Twenty-five of these occurred during 2 epidemic outbreaks in medical and surgical infants' wards.
 From the community, 13 confirmed cases were admitted during the study period.
 Both community-acquired and nosocomial cases occurred during autumn, winter and early spring.
 The attack rates during outbreaks ranged between 7 and 62% and were highest among children with underlying gastrointestinal diseases.
 Diarrhea and vomiting were the most common clinical manifestations.
 The median duration of symptoms was 4 days and that of virus excretion was 5 days.
 Hospital infection with astroviruses is common and usually affects children less than 2 years of age.
 The probable mode of transmission is spread via contaminated hands.
