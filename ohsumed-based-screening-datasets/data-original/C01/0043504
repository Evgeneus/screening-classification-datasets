Analysis of reconstruction for anterior mandibular defects using AO plates.
 The functional and cosmetic outcome of 11 patients who had anterior arch mandibulectomy for stage II-IV oral cavity carcinoma and were reconstructed with AO stainless-steel or titanium plates was retrospectively analyzed.
 Although the complication rate was high, plate removal was uncommon.
 Patients were afforded good function and cosmesis.
 Severity of postoperative infection corresponded to a low preoperative absolute lymphocyte count, which suggests that increased preoperative diet supplementation may decrease the incidence of early infections.
 Improved mandibular function and esthetics may allow future patients to be offered early reconstruction routinely.
