Counseling patients on proper use of condoms.
 The best condoms are made of latex, are lubricated and coated with a spermicide, and have a reservoir tip.
 Condoms can protect against conception and sexually transmitted diseases, including acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 When condoms are used properly and in combination with vaginal spermicidal foam, the contraceptive failure rate is as low as 1 percent.
 Failure is more often due to user error than product defect.
 Recommendations for the proper use of condoms are presented.
