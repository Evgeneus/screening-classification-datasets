Field trial of oral cholera vaccines in Bangladesh: serum vibriocidal and antitoxic antibodies as markers of the risk of cholera.
 The relationship of serum vibriocidal (VC) and IgG anti-cholera toxin (CT) antibodies to the risk of cholera was evaluated during the first year of follow-up of recipients of three oral doses of B subunit (BS)-whole-cell vaccine, whole-cell vaccine, or Escherichia coli K12 strain placebo in Bangladesh.
 Acute sera from 121 cholera patients were compared with sera from 2592 contemporaneous community controls.
 Each doubling of VC titer was associated, on average, with a 22%-47% reduction of cholera risk in the three groups.
 In contrast, in the two groups that did not receive BS, anti-CT titers were directly associated with cholera and thus served as markers of higher cholera risk.
 Each vaccine conferred approximately 65% protective efficacy against cholera, but antibody titers did not correlate with vaccine efficacy, indicating that serum VC and anti-CT antibodies are poor markers of the longitudinal pattern of vaccine efficacy.
