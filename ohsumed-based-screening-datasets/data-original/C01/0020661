Escherichia coli in patients with renal scarring: genotype and phenotype of Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-, Forssman- and mannose-specific adhesins.
 The frequency of Escherichia coli with Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta-specific adhesins is reduced among children who develop renal scars.
 The adhesion-negative phenotype may be due to the absence of the pap DNA sequences which encode these adhesins or to a phase variation event induced by in vitro culture.
 In the present study the frequency of pap and pil homologous DNA was determined by dot blot analysis with probes specific for the respective sequence using E.
 coli strains from children with recurrent pyelonephritis with and without renal scarring.
 The frequency of pap was 79% in the strains isolated from the nonscarring group compared with 39% in the strains from the scarring group (P less than 0.001).
 The Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta phenotype was expressed by 89% of the pap-positive strains from the nonscarring group compared with 71% in the scarring group (P less than 0.05).
 In addition 13 of 77 of the pap-positive E.
 coli strains agglutinated sheep erythrocytes but not the Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta latex beads; a reaction attributed to reactivity with the Forssman glycolipid.
 DNA sequences homologous with pil were found in 95% of all strains and there was no significant difference between the nonscarring and the scarring groups.
 The low frequency of Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta specific strains in the scarring group was therefore due to the absence of pap-homologous DNA sequences and to a reduced rate of phenotypic expression among pap-positive scarring strains.
 There was no support for a relationship between type 1 fimbriae and renal scarring.
