Early post-treatment with pentoxifylline or dibutyryl cAMP attenuates Escherichia coli-induced acute lung injury in guinea pigs.
 We examined effects of early post-treatment with the methylxanthine pentoxifylline (PTXF), or the cell-permeable adenosine 3', 5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) analog dibutyryl cAMP (db-cAMP) on Escherichia-coli-induced acute lung injury in guinea pigs.
 Acute lung injury was assessed by measurements of lung water (lung wet/dry weight ratio; W/D ratio), the concentration ratio of 125I-albumin in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue compared with plasma (albumin index; BAL-AI or tissue-AI), and total differential leukocyte count in BAL fluid.
 Mean arterial pressure (Pa) and peripheral WBC counts were monitored continuously over the 8-h experiment.
 Septicemia was induced by a bolus injection of 2 x 10(9)/kg live E.
 coli.
 Thirty minutes later the animals received a bolus injection followed by continuous infusion of PTXF (20 mg/kg + 20 mg/kg/h; n = 8) or db-cAMP (2 mg/kg + 2 mg/kg/h; n = 8) or saline (septic control; n = 8).
 Nonseptic control groups were also studied.
 The lung W/D ratio, BAL-AI, lung tissue-AI, and BAL leukocyte count increased significantly in the septic control group.
 The PTXF-septic and db-cAMP-septic groups showed no significant increase in lung W/D ratio, BAL-AI, and lung tissue-AI.
 However, there was no difference in BAL total and differential leukocyte count as compared with the septic control group.
 PTXF and db-cAMP had no effect on E.
 coli-induced changes in peripheral WBC count and Pa.
 Comparison in vitro experiments demonstrated that PTXF and db-cAMP inhibited the endotoxin-induced (E.
 coli) chemiluminescent response of isolated guinea-pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN).
