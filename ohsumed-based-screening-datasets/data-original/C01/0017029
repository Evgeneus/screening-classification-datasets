Local antibiotic delivery in the treatment of bone and joint infections.
 Antibiotics can be delivered locally via an implantable pump to treat bone and joint infections.
 This is a completely closed system, and the pump is refilled percutaneously at intervals based on its flow rate.
 The use of this method is described in three specific clinical situations: (1) resistant osteomyelitis (patients with persistent infections despite previous therapy), (2) acutely infected arthroplasties (symptomatic for less than six weeks), and (3) chronically infected arthroplasties (patients infected more than six weeks).
 In all three clinical situations, hospitalization time was shortened, and high local and low systemic levels of antibiotic were obtained.
 There was only one incident of side effects to the antibiotic used.
 This method has been successful in obtaining long-term suppression of infection in 30 of 42 patients with resistant osteomyelitis, 30 of 37 patients with acutely infected arthroplasties, and seven of ten patients with chronically infected arthroplasties.
 The complication unique to this method of therapy is pump-site and catheter-site infections.
 This occurred in three patients with recalcitrant osteomyelitis and three patients with acutely infected arthroplasties.
