Effect of low-level and intermittent minocycline therapy on the growth of Mycobacterium leprae in mice.
 We evaluated the minimal concentrations of minocycline in the diet and in serum required to inhibit the growth of seven Mycobacterium leprae isolates in mice.
 Minocycline concentrations of 0.01 and 0.04% in the diet, which resulted in levels in serum of less than or equal to 0.17 and 0.51 microgram/ml, respectively, were consistently and completely inhibitory.
 Even 0.004% dietary minocycline (levels in serum, less than or equal to 0.08 microgram/ml) partially inhibited five of these strains, while 0.001% minocycline was consistently inactive.
 For five of these isolates, minocycline at a concentration of 0.04% in the diet given 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) and 1 day weekly completely inhibited the growth of M.
 leprae, and minocycline given even 1 day monthly was partially inhibitory for three of these five M.
 leprae isolates.
