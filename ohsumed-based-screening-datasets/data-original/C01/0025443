Fungal sinusitis in immunocompromised children with neoplasms.
 This paper reviews the treatment and diagnosis of immunocompromised patients with fungal sinusitis at St Jude Children's Research Hospital.
 Sinusitis of all types was found to be more common in patients with hematopoietic neoplasms than in patients with solid tumors; 42% of patients with leukemia had abnormal sinus radiographs.
 Eight cases of pathologically proven fungal sinusitis were identified.
 All patients were undergoing chemotherapy for either acute myeloblastic leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia and had neutrophil counts less than 100 cells/mm3.
 The most common findings were fever, facial pain, and abnormal sinus radiographs.
 Surveillance cultures of the upper aerodigestive system did not reliably predict sinus pathogens.
 An aggressive treatment approach consisting of early administration of amphotericin B (intravenously and via catheter irrigations of the sinuses) and surgical drainage is advocated.
 There was an 80% survival rate in patients in remission who were undergoing maintenance chemotherapy.
 All patients undergoing chemotherapy for relapse died.
