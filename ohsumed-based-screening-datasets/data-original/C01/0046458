Validation of a simplified carbon-14-urea breath test for routine use for detecting Helicobacter [correction of Heliobacter] pylori noninvasively.
 A carbon-14 (14C) urea breath test for detecting Helicobacter pylori with multiple breath sampling was developed.
 Carbon-14-urea (110 kBq) administered orally to 18 normal subjects and to 82 patients with Helicobacter infection.
 The exhaled 14C-labeled CO2 was trapped at 10-min intervals for 90 min.
 The total 14C activity exhaled over 90 min was integrated and expressed in %activity of the total dose given.
 In normals, a mean of 0.59% +/- 0.24% was measured, resulting in an upper limit of normal of 1.07%.
 In 82 patients, a sensitivity of 90.2%, a specificity of 83.8%, and a positive predictive value of 90.2% was found.
 The single probes at intervals of 40-60 min correlated best with the integrated result, with r ranging from 0.986 to 0.990.
 The test's diagnostic accuracy did not change at all when reevaluated with the 40-, 50-, or 60-min sample data alone.
 Thus, the 14C-urea breath test can be applied routinely as a noninvasive, low-cost and one-sample test with high diagnostic accuracy in detecting Helicobacter pylori colonization.
