Comparative in vitro antibacterial activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140; RP 64206), a new quinolone.
 The in vitro activity of sparfloxacin (AT-4140; RP 64206), a new fluoroquinolone, was compared with those of 10 other agents against 1,222 clinical isolates.
 Sparfloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most active quinolones against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli; sparfloxacin had superior activity against gram-positive cocci in comparison with the activities of ciprofloxacin and the other quinolones tested (norfloxacin, lomefloxacin, and pefloxacin).
 Among the inhibited strains, several were resistant to the tested beta-lactam antibiotics or to aminoglycosides.
 The activity of sparfloxacin was not influenced by the medium that was used; lowering of the pH to 5 had a marked effect on the MICs for two strains each of Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one strain each of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus; the MBC of sparfloxacin was within 1 to 2 dilution steps of the MIC for the strains that were tested.
