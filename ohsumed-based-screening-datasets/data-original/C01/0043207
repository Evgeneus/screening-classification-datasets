The maternal immune response in coccidioidomycosis. Is pregnancy a risk factor for serious infection?
 Seven subjects with prior coccidioidal disease and three with active Coccidioides immitis infection during their first trimester were studied during pregnancy and postpartum to determine their general and antigen-specific cell-mediated immune status.
 All ten were white and carried their pregnancies to term without incident.
 Decreases in total lymphocytes and T-helper and T-suppressor subsets were noted during the third trimester, presumably secondary to an increase in plasma volume.
 Lymphocyte responses to the mitogens phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, and pokeweed were mildly decreased late in pregnancy, with significant intrasubject and intersubject variation.
 Responses to tetanus antigen were consistently and significantly lower as pregnancy progressed, rising above first trimester levels by 12 weeks postpartum.
 A similar pattern of response was noted with spherulin antigen for the seven subjects with previously demonstrated coccidioidal immunity.
 The three subjects with active coccidioidomycosis either failed to mount a significant spherulin immune response or demonstrated an early response that fell as pregnancy progressed.
 This antigen-specific immune suppression continued for up to 16 months postpartum despite the fact that there was no clinical evidence of coccidioidal activity beyond the first trimester.
 Thus, while all three completed pregnancy without complication, the data suggest that significantly increased maternal risk may be present when active coccidioidomycosis and pregnancy occur together.
 This risk may be greatest among darker-skinned individuals who become infected during the latter half of pregnancy.
