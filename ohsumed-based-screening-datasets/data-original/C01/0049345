Infection control of parenteral nutrition solutions.
 Microbial contamination of parenteral nutrition solutions is a preventable cause of in patients receiving nutrition support.
 The components of the parenteral nutrition solutions have variable microbial growth potential.
 Crystalline amino acid and dextrose solutions are poor growth media for bacteria but may support fungal growth.
 Lipid emulsions provide an excellent medium for growth of bacteria and fungal species.
 Total nutrient admixtures will support microbial growth better than standard parenteral nutrition solutions will but less well than will lipid emulsion alone.
 Control of infection related to contaminated infusate depends on compounding procedure, quality control, appropriate storage, and procedures to prevent in-use contamination.
 Guidelines are presented for the preparation and administration of parenteral nutrition infusates that will minimize microbial contamination.
