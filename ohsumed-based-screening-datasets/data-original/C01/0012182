Gonococcal osteomyelitis. Case report and review of the literature.
 We report the 11th case of gonococcal osteomyelitis in the postantibiotic era.
 This case demonstrates the classic presentation of osteomyelitis associated with gonorrhea, a subacute illness with minimal systemic symptoms.
 In addition, we present radiologic evidence of the pathogenesis of this unusual osteomyelitis from a contiguous joint infection.
