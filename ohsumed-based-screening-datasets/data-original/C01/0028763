A multi-centre collaborative study into the treatment of menorrhagia by Nd-YAG laser ablation of the endometrium.
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the safety and clinical effectiveness of Nd-YAG laser ablation of the endometrium in the treatment of menorrhagia.
 DESIGN--A prospective 3-year observational multi-centre study.
 SETTING--Gynaecological units in the UK and USA with special interest in endoscopic laser surgery.
 SUBJECTS--859 women with menorrhagia resistant to medical therapy.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Duration of laser ablation, intra- and post-operative complications, amenorrhoea rate, oligomenorrhoea rate, and woman's subjective assessment of treatment.
 RESULTS--No major complications occurred in 859 treatments.
 Four (0.4%) cases of transient fluid overload, 4 (0.4%) of infection, and 3 (0.3%) of uterine perforation occurred.
 Each of the perforations occurred during insertion of the rigid instruments and none was produced by the laser.
 There were no major haemorrhages, no blood transfusions were needed, and no woman required a laparotomy.
 The mean duration of the laser ablation was 24 min, and the average stay in hospital was less than 24 h.
 Of the 479 women followed up for at least 6 months after treatment 288 (60%) developed complete amenorrhoea and 152 (32%) reported continuing but satisfactorily reduced menstruation; 39 (8%) failed to improve with the first treatment, but 26 of them responded to a second laser ablation.
 Overall 466 (97%) had a satisfactory response to laser ablation and only 13 (3%) required subsequent hysterectomy.
 CONCLUSION--Endometrial laser ablation would appear to be a popular, safe, effective and economical alternative to hysterectomy for the treatment of menorrhagia.
