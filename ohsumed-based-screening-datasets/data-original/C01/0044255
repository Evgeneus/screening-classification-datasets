Ultraviolet radiation compared to an ultra-clean air enclosure. Comparison of air bacteria counts in operating rooms.
 Clean air in the operating room is important during joint replacement surgery.
 We compared monochromatic ultraviolet radiation of 254 nm with the use of a Charnley-Howorth air enclosure by bacterial air-sampling during 113 total hip arthroplasties.
 Air samples were taken continuously at the edge of the wound and every 15 minutes at a site 130 cm from the operating table.
 We also tested the effect of occlusive clothing for all personnel.
 Ultraviolet light was more efficient than the ultra-clean air enclosure, and occlusive clothing on its own or in combination also produced improvement.
 The implications of these findings are discussed.
