A retrospective cohort study of the risk of tuberculosis among women of childbearing age with HIV infection in Zaire.
 To determine the risk of active tuberculosis associated with HIV infection, we retrospectively studied a cohort of HIV-seropositive and HIV-seronegative women participating in an HIV perinatal transmission study in Kinshasa, Zaire.
 After a median follow-up of 32 months, new cases of proven pulmonary or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis occurred in 19 of the 249 HIV-seropositive women (7.6%, 3.1 cases per 100 person-years) compared with 1 of the 310 HIV-seronegative women (0.3%, 0.12 cases per 100 person-years), for a relative risk of 26 (95% confidence interval, 5 to 125).
 Proven pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed in 7 HIV-seropositive women (2.8%, 1.2 cases per 100 person-years) and 1 HIV-seronegative woman (0.3%, 0.12 cases per 100 person-years), for a relative risk of 10 (95% confidence interval, 1.5 to 47).
 We estimated that 66 cases of proven pulmonary tuberculosis in 100,000 person-years of follow-up in women of childbearing age could be attributed to HIV; this is 35% of their estimated total incidence of proven pulmonary tuberculosis.
 Among those followed for 2 yr, 27 (11%) of 243 HIV-seropositive women died during 2 yr of follow-up compared with none of 296 HIV-seronegative women (p less than 0.001).
 In HIV-seropositive women with proven or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis mortality was even higher: 5 (26%) of the 19 HIV-seropositive women with proven pulmonary or clinically diagnosed tuberculosis died during follow-up compared with 22 (10%) of the 224 HIV-seropositive women not diagnosed as having tuberculosis (relative risk 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 6.3).
