Suppression of human monocyte function against Candida albicans by autologous IL-2-induced lymphokine-activated killer cells.
 We have previously reported that IL-2-induced lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells have the capacity to lyse autologous and allogeneic monocytes.
 To understand the biologic significance of this interaction, we investigated the function of human monocytes against the opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans, subsequent to a short exposure to autologous LAK cells.
 A highly sensitive radiolabel assay, which makes use of the incorporation of [3H]glucose into residual Candida after their incubation with monocytes, was developed to measure antifungal activity.
 Cultured monocytes, after 2 to 6 h exposure to LAK cells, were found to be substantially suppressed in their ability to control fungal growth.
 Moreover, monocytes cultured in the presence of granulocyte/macrophage (GM)-CSF or IL-3, were even more suppressed in function after a short incubation with LAK cells.
 The effect of GM-CSF was both time and dose dependent, with peak susceptibility induced after 4 days of culture with as little as 10 U/ml of the cytokine.
 These GM-CSF-cultured monocytes, however, were relatively resistant to inhibition by freshly isolated large granular lymphocytic NK cells.
 Therefore, IL-2 induces in large granular lymphocytic cells the capacity to inhibit monocyte function.
 In contrast to GM-CSF and IL-3, IFN-gamma was found to have a protective effect on monocytes, because monocytes cultured 4 days in IFN-gamma were not significantly inhibited by LAK cells.
 These results indicate that LAK cells may be involved in regulation of monocyte function and suggest that the state of differentiation induced by different cytokines may dictate the level of control of the monocytes by LAK cells.
