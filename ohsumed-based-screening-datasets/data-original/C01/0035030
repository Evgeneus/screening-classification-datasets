Immunohistochemistry of the inflammatory response in Propionibacterium acnes endophthalmitis.
 Specimens were obtained from two patients with culture-proven Propionibacterium acnes endophthalmitis who had undergone vitrectomy.
 Wright's and Giemsa stains were performed using cytospin preparations of the dilute vitreous and revealed a predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (80% to 90%).
 The remaining inflammatory cells in the vitreous were mostly macrophages (10% to 15%); very few lymphocytes were present (less than 5%).
 Immunohistochemical studies using monoclonal antibodies confirmed the paucity of lymphocytes.
 Most lymphocytes were CD4+ helper/inducer T cells.
 Almost no CD8+ suppressor/cytotoxic T lymphocytes or B lymphocytes were found.
 The inflammatory response in these two patients is most characteristic of acute inflammation and consistent with an underlying bacterial infection, despite a clinical picture of persistent, low-grade inflammation.
 Infection with P acnes has been shown to inhibit CD8+ T cells and may play a role in the persistent inflammation in cases of P acnes endophthalmitis.
