Infection following strabismus surgery.
 Sixty-three strabismus surgeons were surveyed regarding the incidence of infection they found following strabismus surgery and their use of preoperative and postoperative antibiotics to prevent or treat such infections.
 Cellulitis was rare (1 per 1900 cases) and endophthalmitis was even rarer (1 per 30,000 cases).
 Infection was not entirely prevented by either preoperative or postoperative topical antibiotics.
 Twelve surgeons reported using no antibiotics but did not report higher rates of infection than those who did use them.
