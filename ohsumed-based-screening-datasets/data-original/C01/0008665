Continued need for pneumococcal prophylaxis after splenectomy 
 Two children died from pneumococcal infection five and eight years after splenectomy.
 Pneumococcal vaccination had not been given to either child.
 When the infection developed both children were not taking prophylactic penicillin.
 Vaccination and daily penicillin reduce the incidence of this complication and therefore we strongly recommend that both of these measures are continued indefinitely.
