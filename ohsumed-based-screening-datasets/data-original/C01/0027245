The place of quinolones in bacterial infections.
 The quinolone antimicrobial agents are important therapeutic compounds for many infections.
 They have potential as substitutes for many parenteral agents, particularly in treating urinary tract, diarrheal, bone and joint, and some respiratory tract infections.
 The quinolones are important prophylactic agents for neutropenic patients.
 Adverse reactions to these compounds have been exceedingly infrequent.
 Important drug-drug interactions occur, and the absorption of the compounds can be markedly impaired by antacids.
 Resistance to quinolones is already a serious problem in some countries.
 Improper use in the United States will rapidly make the new quinolones ineffective treatment for staphylococcal, Pseudomonas, and even some Enterobacteriaceae infections.
 Careful attention to those situations in which resistance has been shown to develop is necessary.
