Bacterial resistance.
 Pathogenic bacteria remain adaptable to an increasingly hostile environment and a wider variety of more potent antibiotics.
 Organisms not intrinsically prepared for defense have been able to acquire resistance to newer antimicrobial agents.
 Chromosomal mutations alone cannot account for the rapid emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.
 It has been established that plasmids and transposons are particularly important in the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
 Plasmid- or transposon-mediated resistance provides the bacteria with pre-evolved genes refined to express high-level resistance.
 In particular, transposons can transfer these resistance determinants in diverse bacterial species, and nature provides in humans and animals large intestinal reservoirs in which such communications are facilitated.
 Antibiotic therapy exerts selection pressures on bacteria.
 Eradication or marked reduction in the populations of susceptible organisms promotes the overgrowth of intrinsically resistant strains and favors those resistant as a result of favorable chromosomal mutations or via plasmids or transposons.
 In our hospitals, where antibiotic consumption continues to increase, the nosocomial flora consists of many resistant bacteria, and infections acquired in the nosocomial setting are now far more severe than their community-acquired counterparts.
 There is convincing evidence that infection control measures must take into further consideration the contribution of the hospital worker as carrier and mediator of antibiotic resistance.
