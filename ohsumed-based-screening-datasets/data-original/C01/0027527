Comparison of postoperative complications between saphenous vein and IMA grafts to left anterior descending coronary artery.
 Considerable controversy exists regarding relative morbidity associated with the saphenous vein graft (SVG) and internal mammary artery (IMA) graft in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization.
 As a part of the cooperative study on use of antiplatelet drugs for graft patency, operative and postoperative data were prospectively collected on 1,150 patients who underwent either SVG (n = 656) or IMA anastomosis (n = 494) to the left anterior descending coronary artery.
 There were no differences in baseline characteristics of patients, distribution of randomization among treatment groups, and total number of distal anastomoses performed between the two groups.
 The aortic cross-clamp time, cardiopulmonary bypass duration, operative time, and chest tube drainage were greater (p = 0.0001) in the patients with IMA grafts compared with SVG.
 However, there was no difference in the operative mortality rate, the amount of blood and blood products received, the reoperation rate for control of postoperative bleeding, and incidence of wound complications between the two groups.
 The early and 1-year patency rates for the IMA were slightly but not significantly better than the SVG patency rates (92.8% versus 90.1% for 1-year patency; p = 0.309).
 In conclusion, use of IMA is associated with a longer operative time as well as increased postoperative bleeding compared with the SVG.
 It, however, does not increase operative mortality or postoperative morbidity.
