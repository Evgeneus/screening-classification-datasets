Prevention of bacterial meningitis. Vaccines and chemoprophylaxis.
 The morbidity and mortality caused by bacterial meningitis remains significant despite advances in antimicrobial therapy and supportive care.
 Prevention of meningitis by routine immunization of infants, who are at greatest risk, offers the only practical way of reducing the incidence of this disease.
 Widespread use of the recently developed protein conjugate vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b by itself could reduce the incidence of bacterial meningitis in the U.S.
 by more than half.
 To prevent disease caused by the other pathogens, an effective vaccine against the group B meningococcus must be developed, and the immunogenicity of the pneumococcal and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccines should be improved.
 Until such time that universal immunization of infants with highly immunogenic vaccines is possible, continued efforts must focus on targeting immunization at high-risk individuals and using chemoprophylaxis to prevent secondary disease where indicated.
 Addendum: On October 4, 1990, the U.S.
 Food and Drug Administration licensed the praxis Haemophilus influenzae type b-protein conjugate vaccine (Hboc) for use in infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age with a booster dose at 15-18 months.
 Physicians are directed to statements by the Immunizations Practices Advisory Committee and the American Academy of Pediatrics for official recommendations concerning its use.
