Is dantrolene safe to administer in sepsis? The effect of dantrolene after endotoxin administration in dogs and rats.
 Hyperthermia from septic shock may be indistinguishable from malignant hyperthermia.
 Dantrolene may be given in septicemia if the diagnosis is unclear.
 To determine if dantrolene is safe to use in sepsis, two studies were performed.
 In study 1, 18 anesthetized dogs in which profound septic shock was induced with 5 mg/kg of intravenous Escherichia coli endotoxin were randomized to receive (30 min later) intravenous injections of 10 mg/kg of dantrolene solution, the diluent of dantrolene, or maintenance intravenous fluids alone.
 The use of dantrolene solution and the diluent of dantrolene resulted in similar but transient statistically significant increases in the cardiac filling pressures and cardiac outputs and decreases in the vascular resistances compared with the control dogs.
 In a second study, 185 rats were randomized into five equal groups.
 Groups 1, 2, and 3 received 15 mg/kg of intraperitoneal Escherichia coli endotoxin followed 30 min later by 10 mg/kg of dantrolene solution, the diluent of dantrolene, or normal saline.
 Groups 4 and 5 received normal saline followed by dantrolene or normal saline.
 The survival of groups 1, 2, and 3 was less at 24 h (P less than 0.0001) than that of either control group, but was not significantly different from one another.
 The results suggest dantrolene can be administered safely under clinical conditions where the cause of hyperthermia and shock cannot clearly be ascribed to malignant hyperthermia or septicemia.
