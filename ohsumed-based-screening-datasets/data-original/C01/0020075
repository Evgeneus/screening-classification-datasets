Effects of butenafine hydrochloride, a new benzylamine derivative, on experimental tinea pedis in guinea pigs.
 Butenafine is a new antifungal benzylamine.
 The efficacy of butenafine was investigated in an experimental tinea pedis model in guinea pigs, which is pathologically similar to natural infections in humans.
 Butenafine (0.1 ml) in 0.2 to 1.0% solutions was applied to the site of infection.
 Treatment was started on day 10 postinfection and was continued for 20 days.
 Butenafine applied once daily exhibited excellent dose-related therapeutic efficacy.
 The efficacy of butenafine was significantly superior to those tolnaftate, clotrimazole, and bifonazole.
