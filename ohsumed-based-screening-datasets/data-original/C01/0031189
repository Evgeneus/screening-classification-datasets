Latrine ownership as a protective factor in inflammatory trachoma in Egypt 
 We investigated the association between inflammatory trachoma in children aged 1-5 and environmental and sociodemographic risk factors in a rural Nile Delta hamlet.
 Inflammatory trachoma clustered in households, emphasising the child-to-child nature of transmission in the hamlet.
 Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed three factors predicting inflammatory trachoma in children: the absence of a latrine in the household, school-age siblings with inflammatory trachoma, and additional same-age siblings (with or without disease) in the household.
 In the Egyptian setting the presence of pit latrines in all houses, even when full and unscreened, might result in a reduction in trachoma prevalence in this population from the current 49% to 35%.
 The construction of pit latrines may offer the simplest and most acceptable environmental method for reducing trachoma in this trachoma endemic area.
