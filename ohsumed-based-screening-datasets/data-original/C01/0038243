HIV and periodontal health. A study of military personnel with HIV.
 In 230 military personnel who were seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus, the prevalence of viral and fungal infections in the mouth was clearly related to the degree of immune dysfunction as measured by T4-lymphocyte counts.
 The relation between periodontal health and T4 counts was less clear.
 Tobacco use was related to the increased occurrence of both mucosal lesions and periodontal diseases.
