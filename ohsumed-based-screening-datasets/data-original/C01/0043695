Late bleb-related endophthalmitis after trabeculectomy with adjunctive 5-fluorouracil.
 The incidence of late-onset bleb-related endophthalmitis was evaluated retrospectively in 229 consecutive trabeculectomies performed with adjunctive 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) therapy.
 Mean follow-up was 23.7 +/- 16.3 months (range, 3 to 60 months).
 Thirteen eyes (5.7%) of 11 patients developed bleb-related endophthalmitis an average of 25.9 +/- 17.4 months (range, 5 to 58 months) after surgery.
 Infection occurred in 9 of 96 (9.4%) procedures performed from below and in 4 of 133 (3.0%) procedures performed superiorly (P = 0.05, Fisher's exact test).
 The relative risk of bleb-related endophthalmitis in trabeculectomy from below versus above is 4.0 after adjustment for age and sex (95% confidence interval = 1.1, 14.8).
 Trabeculectomy with adjunctive 5-FU performed from below carries an increased risk of late bleb-related infection.
 The incidence of late bleb-related endophthalmitis after 5-FU trabeculectomy appears to be higher than that for trabeculectomy without adjunctive 5-FU injections.
