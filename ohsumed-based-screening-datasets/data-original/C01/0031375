Enterobacter cloacae bacteremia in children: a review of 30 cases in 12 years.
 A review was performed of the 30 cases of pediatric Enterobacter cloacae (EBC) bacteremia which occurred at our institution during a 12-year period.
 These 30 cases represented 88% of all cases in which EBC was isolated by blood culture (four other instances were considered contaminants); the rate of isolation of this organism relative to all positive blood cultures was 0.6%.
 There were 14 patients less than 12 months of age, with 10 less than 2 months of age.
 Infection was nosocomially-acquired in 17 cases.
 At the time the positive blood culture was obtained, 5 patients were afebrile, and 8 patients (five immunocompromised) had been receiving parenteral antibiotic therapy to which the organism exhibited in-vitro sensitivity for at least 24 hours.
 EBC was a constituent of polymicrobial bacteremia in 6 cases; in 5 instances the associated organisms were also gram-negative bacteria.
 There were a total of 33 underlying medical conditions or foci of infection associated with EBC bacteremia identified in 27 patients, the most common of which were immune-deficiency state (17) and gastrointestinal tract lesions (6).
 There were 3 patients who died.
 EBC bacteremia is a relatively rare pediatric infection.
 It is commonly nosocomially-acquired, and afflicts children who are younger-aged or compromised by underlying medical problems.
