Effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing bacteriuria after multichannel urodynamic investigations: a blind, randomized study in 124 female patients.
 One hundred twenty-four women with chronic, persistent lower urinary tract symptoms who had been scheduled for elective urodynamic investigations at Mount Sinai's Urodynamic Investigative Unit were divided into two blind, randomized groups, receiving either a placebo or prophylactic antibiotic.
 At the time of urodynamic testing, the rate of unsuspected urinary tract infection was 8.1%.
 There was no statistically significant decrease in postinstrumentation infection rate in the group who received prophylactic antibiotics.
 We conclude that, given in the fashion described in the study, prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in preventing urinary tract infections caused by urodynamic testing.
