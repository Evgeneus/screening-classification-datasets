Recurrent aortic graft infection following descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass. A case report and review.
 This paper presents a patient who developed a recurrent aortic graft infection after a descending thoracic aorta to femoral artery bypass.
 The patient had previously undergone successful management of an infected aortobifemoral bypass by removal of the graft and revascularization of the lower extremities with axillofemoral bypasses.
 A general discussion of the management of infected aortic grafts is presented and a discussion of the management of this particular patient is presented in detail.
