Vascular infection: another hazard of listeriosis.
 Two case reports are presented of Listeria monocytogenes infection complicating vascular reconstructions.
 The importance of this problem lies in the resistance of the organism to some of the prophylactic antibiotics recommended for vascular surgery.
 Patients with prosthetic vascular grafts, particularly if immunocompromised, may be at risk from Listeria infection and may be advised to avoid potentially affected food.
