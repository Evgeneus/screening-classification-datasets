Oxygen free radicals: effect on red cell deformability in sepsis.
 OBJECTIVE: To examine the effect of alpha-tocopherol, a free radical scavenger, on RBC deformability, mixed venous hemoglobin saturation (SvO2), arterial-venous oxygen content difference (C[a-v]O2), pHv, and survival during sepsis.
 DESIGN: Randomized controlled study.
 INTERVENTIONS: Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to three groups: sham, cecal ligation and puncture, or alpha-tocopherol/cecal ligation and puncture (pretreatment with alpha-tocopherol before cecal ligation and puncture).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The cecal ligation and puncture group had a significantly (p less than .05) higher SvO2 and lower C (a-v)O2, pHv, and survival rate when compared with alpha-tocopherol/cecal ligation and puncture and sham groups.
 No difference in pHa existed between groups.
 CONCLUSIONS: The alpha-tocopherol treatment improves survival in sepsis.
 RBC deformability during sepsis is prevented by alpha-tocopherol, suggesting that free radicals may cause the decrease in RBC deformability.
 This study provides indirect evidence that decreased RBC deformability may play a role in the physiologic peripheral shunting and decreased microcirculatory flow that occurs during sepsis.
