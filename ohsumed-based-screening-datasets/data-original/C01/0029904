Empyema due to ventriculopleural shunt.
 Empyema developing seven weeks after craniotomy in a 62-year-old black woman with an ipsilateral ventriculopleural (V-PL) shunt is described.
 Infection of the pleural space presumably resulted from transfer of organisms from a proximal V-PL shunt infection to the thorax.
 Empyema resulting from V-PL shunt infection has not previously been reported.
 Pleural effusions in patients with V-PL shunts must be considered as a potential site of infection with possible development of empyema.
