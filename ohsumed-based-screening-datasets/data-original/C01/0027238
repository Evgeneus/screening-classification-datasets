Transurethral resection of prostatic abscess under sonographic guidance.
 Transrectal ultrasound may establish the diagnosis of prostatic abscess in an ambiguous clinical setting.
 Transurethral resection (deroofing) is the treatment preferred by many clinicians, yet intraoperative complete abscess obliteration may be difficult to confirm endoscopically.
 We report on a patient with a complex prostatic abscess endoscopically resected under transrectal ultrasound guidance.
 Adequacy of treatment was proved pathologically.
