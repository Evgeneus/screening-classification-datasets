Septic shock. When patients fail to respond to conventional therapy.
 Patients in septic shock require rapid evaluation and prompt initiation of therapy with appropriate antibiotics and fluids.
 When fluids do not restore perfusion, dopamine (Dopastat, Inotropin) therapy is begun.
 Some patients who fail to respond to these measures will respond to a combination of low-dose dopamine and regulation of blood pressure with norepinephrine (Levophed).
