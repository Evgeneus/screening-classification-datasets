A comparison of the roles of cefamandole and ceftriaxone in abdominal surgery.
 In a prospective, randomized study, we compared the ability of ceftriaxone sodium (serum half-life, 8.0 hours) and cefamandole naftate and sodium carbonate (serum half-life, 0.8 hours) to prevent wound infection in 1238 patients undergoing abdominal surgery.
 Prophylaxis consisted of single-dose therapy at the time of induction of anesthesia, and treatment regimens contained ceftriaxone sodium, 1 g/d intravenously, or cefamandole naftate and sodium carbonate, 1 g intravenously every 6 hours.
 Except for low-risk biliary procedures, cephalosporin therapy was accompanied by the administration of metronidazole.
 No significant difference was noted in the incidence of wound infection, ie, 5.6% for the ceftriaxone group (95% confidence interval, 3.8% to 7.4%) and 6.9% for the cefamandole group (95% confidence interval, 4.9% to 8.9%).
 Single-dose prophylaxis with 1 g of cefamandole naftate and sodium carbonate was relatively inexpensive and provided a cost savings of 64%.
 When treatment was required, a 23% cost savings was associated with the use of a once-daily dose of 1 g of ceftriaxone sodium.
