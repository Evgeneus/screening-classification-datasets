The causes of hospital-treated acute lower respiratory tract infection in children.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the etiologic agents in children with acute lower respiratory infection.
 DESIGN: A survey of a series of patients.
 SETTING: General pediatric hospital serving an urban population with and without referrals in Helsinki, Finland.
 PARTICIPANTS: 135 Finnish children aged 2 months to 15 years (mean, 1.75 years), with clinically defined acute lower respiratory infection (with difficulty of breathing), or found to have fever and a pneumonic infiltrate on chest roentgenogram.
 SELECTION PROCEDURES: Consecutive sample on voluntary basis.
 INTERVENTIONS: None.
 MAIN RESULTS: Of 121 children with adequate samples, an etiologic diagnosis could be established in 84 (70%): 30 (25%) had bacterial, 30 (25%) viral, and 24 (20%) mixed infections.
 Antibody assays alone identified the agent in 91% of positive cases.
 CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial infections are common but generally underestimated in acute lower respiratory infection; serologic methods add significantly to their detection.
