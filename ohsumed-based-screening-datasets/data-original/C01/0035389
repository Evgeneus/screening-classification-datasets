Technetium-99m-MIBI and thallium-201 uptake in pulmonary actinomycosis.
 A patient with pulmonary actinomycosis who unexpectedly showed focal uptake of technetium-99m-hexakis-2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile and thallium-201 is presented.
 The appearance of the lesion on the chest radiograph and x-ray CT scan resembled a mediastinal tumor.
 The diagnosis of pulmonary actinomycosis was achieved by histopathologic examination of the surgically removed mass.
