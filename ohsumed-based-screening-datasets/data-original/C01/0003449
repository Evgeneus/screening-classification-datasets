Unusual case of pacemaker lead migration.
 Pulmonary artery migration of pacemaker lead is rare and may result in pulmonary emboli originating from the thrombus around the infected catheter and causing multiple pulmonary infarcts.
 We report an unusual case of pacemaker lead migration to the right pulmonary artery with septic pulmonary embolism.
 While being treated with intravenous Cefuroxamine, the patient had spontaneous migration of the lead to the left pulmonary artery with subsequent left pulmonary embolism.
