Tracheobronchitis due to Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum.
 We have presented a case of tracheobronchitis due to C pseudodiphtheriticum in a patient with COPD who was treated with prednisone and apparently was not otherwise immunocompromised.
 Chronic lung disease seems to predispose to infection with C pseudodiphtheriticum; it can also occur in the immunocompetent host.
 This organism, when isolated in pure culture, should not be dismissed as a contaminant, but must be considered a possible etiologic agent.
 Sensitivity of diphtheroids to antibiotics is extremely variable.
 We believe vancomycin should be used in respiratory tract infections caused by diphtheroids, including C pseudodiphtheriticum, until the results of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility tests are available.
