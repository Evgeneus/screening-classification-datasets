A new oral lavage solution vs cathartics and enema method for preoperative colonic cleansing.
 Sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution is a new osmotically balanced electrolyte gut lavage solution for colon surgery that has been formulated for improved taste and reduced water and electrolyte changes.
 Sixty patients were prospectively randomized to receive a 1-day preparation with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution or a 3-day preparation using a clear liquid diet, cathartics, and enemas.
 The patient groups were similar in age, race, male-female ratio, and the types of colonic resections performed.
 Colonic cleansing was better with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution (100% vs 63% "good" to "excellent" cleansing).
 Patient tolerance evaluated by a questionnaire showed more overall discomfort with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution but no difference between the preparations in individual symptoms of fullness, cramping, nausea, or vomiting.
 One patient developed a low level of serum potassium after a cathartic and enema preparation, while there were no complications with sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution.
 Patient taste questionnaires showed a slight preference for sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution (53%) over a polyethylene glycol electrolyte lavage solution (47%).
 This study confirms that sulfate free-electrolyte lavage solution is a safe and effective method of preoperative colonic cleansing.
