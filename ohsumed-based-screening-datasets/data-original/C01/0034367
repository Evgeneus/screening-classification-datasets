Prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in kidney transplant recipients.
 Cutaneous lesions can be a significant problem in kidney transplant recipients.
 Factors such as climate and skin types have been implicated as modifiers of these clinical manifestations.
 With the purpose of determining the prevalence and clinical spectrum of skin diseases in a group of Hispanic kidney transplant recipients in a tropical climate, 82 serial unselected patients were examined.
 Seventy-eight were found to have some type of skin disease.
 Infections of the skin were the most common, followed by drug-induced changes and malignant or premalignant cutaneous tumors.
 Except for the preponderance of superficial mycotic infections, the overall results in our population are in agreement with other series.
