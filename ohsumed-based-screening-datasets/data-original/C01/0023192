Duration of adult female Ixodes dammini attachment and transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi, with description of a needle aspiration isolation method.
 The relationship between the attachment duration of adult female Ixodes dammini and the transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi was studied.
 Sixteen rabbits were exposed to spirochete-infected female ticks for specified intervals.
 All five rabbits exposed to ticks that fed to repletion (greater than 120 h) became infected, as did two of three exposed for 48 h.
 In contrast, five rabbits exposed to a cumulative total of 53 infected female I.
 dammini for 36 h failed to become infected, as did three rabbits exposed for 24 h.
 A needle aspirate method facilitated the isolation of spirochetes from host skin.
