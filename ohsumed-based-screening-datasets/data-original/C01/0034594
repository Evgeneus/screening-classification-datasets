Comparison of antigenuria after immunization with three Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines.
 The incidence of antigenuria was documented after vaccination of 75 children 15 to 60 months of age with one of three Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccines, PRP-D (ProHIBiT), PRP-T and HbOC (HibTITER).
 Unconcentrated and concentrated urine was tested on the first, third, fifth and seventh days after vaccination.
 Antigenuria occurred on Day 1 in 100% of PRP-D, 43% of PRP-T and 12% of HbOC recipients.
 The percentages of children excreting antigen on Day 3 were 95, 17 and 8%; on Day 5 they were 36, 4 and 12%; and on Day 7 they were 14, 0 and 18% for PRP-D, PRP-T and HbOC, respectively.
 The difference in the occurrence of antigenuria resulting from each vaccine was statistically significant on Day 1 and for PRP-D compared with PRP-T or HbOC on Day 3.
 It is important for clinicians to be aware of the frequency with which antigenuria occurs after these vaccines so that appropriate therapeutic decisions can be made.
