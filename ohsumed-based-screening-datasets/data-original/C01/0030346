SDZ MRL 953, a novel immunostimulatory monosaccharidic lipid A analog with an improved therapeutic window in experimental sepsis.
 SDZ MRL 953, a new synthetic monosaccharidic lipid A, was investigated in vitro and in vivo for immunopharmacological activities.
 In experimental models of microbial infections, the compound was highly protective when it was administered prophylactically either once or three times to myelosuppressed or immunocompetent mice.
 The 50% effective doses of SDZ MRL 953 varied with the infectious agents and the route of its administration.
 In all cases, the 50% effective doses were about 10(3) times higher than those obtained with endotoxin from Salmonella abortus equi.
 SDZ MRL 953 was, however, less toxic than lipopolysaccharide by a factor of 10(4) to greater than 7 x 10(5) times in galactosamine-sensitized mice.
 The compound was also an effective inducer of tolerance to endotoxin.
 Hence, repeated dosing with the compound induced a transient resistance (greater than or equal to 1 week) to lethal challenges with endotoxin.
 In vitro, the compound was devoid of intrinsic antimicrobial activity, but it moderately induced the release of cytokines from monocytes and primed human neutrophils for the enhanced production of reactive oxygen metabolites in response to a soluble stimulus.
 The results presented here suggest that SDZ MRL 953 may be useful in a clinical setting for enhancing resistance to infections, particularly in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy or irradiation, and for the prophylaxis of endotoxin shock.
