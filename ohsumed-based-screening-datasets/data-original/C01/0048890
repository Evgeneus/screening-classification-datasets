Rocky Mountain spotted fever.
 Rocky Mountain spotted fever, the most prevalent rickettsial disease in the United States, is one of the most severe of all infectious diseases.
 It remains an important infectious disease because of its prevalence, the difficulty of clinical diagnosis, potentially fatal outcome, and lack of a widely available sensitive and specific diagnostic test during the acute stage of the illness.
