Diagnosis and management of the infected total joint arthroplasty.
 The preoperative diagnosis of the infected orthopedic implant is complicated by lack of a single precise test to forewarn patient and surgeon of the presence of microorganisms.
 Given the overall limitation of accuracy of preoperative diagnosis to approximately 80% when 111In scanning, preoperative aspiration, and ESR are considered, it would seem prudent to approach each revision surgery with the possibility in mind of subclinical sepsis as the cause for failure of the implant.
 The essentials of surgical technique including thorough debridement of the wound and removal of all existing foreign bodies, especially including PMMA bone cement, are critical to minimizing the risk for occurrence or persistence of sepsis.
 Although the use of antibiotic impregnated bone cement may enhance the treatment of orthopedic sepsis, the data available to date lead to the conclusion that two-stage revision surgery in the face of known sepsis remains the cornerstone of surgical therapy for the infected implant, along with aggressive and rational antibiotic treatment.
 The surgeon is offered the following guidelines in the management of the septic total hip arthroplasty.
 1.
 Preoperative evaluation including ESR, 111In WBC scan, and aspiration for culture and sensitivity (fluoroscopically guided for the hip) will produce on average approximately 80% accuracy.
 2.
 Intraoperative cultures at the time of revision surgery should be obtained prior to administration of systemic antibiotics; three tissue specimens (hip capsule, femoral membrane, acetabular membrane) should be submitted for culture and sensitivity determination.
 3.
 Careful debridement of the surgical site of granulation tissue and all foreign bodies (e.g., PMMA) should be performed within the limits of patient safety to maximize the likelihood of success.
