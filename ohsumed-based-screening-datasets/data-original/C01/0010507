Immunogenicity and protective effect against oral colonization by Streptococcus mutans of synthetic peptides of a streptococcal surface protein antigen.
 Streptococcus mutans is known to be a major causative organism of human dental caries.
 A surface protein Ag with a molecular mass of 190 kDa of S.
 mutans (PAc) is receiving attention as an anticaries vaccine.
 We have recently determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the gene for PAc.
 In this study, four peptides were synthesized on the basis of amino acid sequence of PAc.
 Among these peptides, PAc(301-319) corresponding to the alanine-rich repeating amino acid region was the most strongly bound by polyclonal murine anti-rPAc antibodies.
 The peptide partially inhibited the binding of polyclonal anti-rPAc antibodies to rPAc.
 The peptide induced the proliferation of T cells from BALB/c mice immunized with rPAc.
 Subcutaneous immunization with PAc(301-319) or rPAc emulsified in CFA/IFA induced high serum IgG responses to rPAc and PAc(301-319).
 In addition, serum IgG responses to a surface protein Ag with a molecular mass of 210 kDa of Streptococcus sobrinus were elicited in mice immunized by s.c.
 injection with PAc(301-319) or rPAc.
 Intranasal immunization with PAc(301-319) coupled to cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) or with rPAc and free CTB induced high serum IgG responses to rPAc.
 The immunization with PAc(301-319) coupled to CTB or rPAc and free CTB suppressed the colonization of murine teeth by S.
 mutans.
 These results suggest that intranasal immunization with the peptide or rPAc may be effective for the prevention of dental caries.
