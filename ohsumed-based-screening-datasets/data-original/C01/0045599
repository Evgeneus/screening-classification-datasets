Bacterial adherence and contamination during radiographic processing.
 Oral fluids are potential contaminants of radiographic processors.
 This investigation measured bacterial contamination in a radiographic processing room during times of high and low clinical activity and processing effects on five types of microorganisms.
 Cultures in the clinical setting, during high and low activity, were taken by brain-heart infusion agar plates placed near automatic processors.
 Site samples were taken of entrance, developer, fixer, water, and exit surfaces.
 Measurements of processing effects were accomplished by intentional contamination of films run in series through an automatic processor.
 Site samples were again taken of the processor.
 In the clinical setting colony-forming units increased with activity.
 Radiographic processing after intentional contamination decreased colony-forming units on films, but they increased for all processing solutions.
 Bacteria on radiographic film survived processing.
 Although processing procedures significantly reduce the number of bacteria on films, the potential for contamination and cross-contamination remains.
