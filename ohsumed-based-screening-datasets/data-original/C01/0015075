Spirochetal infection of the central nervous system.
 Four spirochetal diseases frequently involve the central nervous system: syphilis, leptospirosis, relapsing fever, and Lyme borreliosis.
 In particular, syphilis and Lyme borreliosis are increasing problems.
 During the spirochetemic phase there is seeding of the nervous system.
 After a quiescent latent period, there may be late disease flareups producing a variety of neurologic syndromes.
 Cerebrospinal fluid examination is very helpful in these infections.
