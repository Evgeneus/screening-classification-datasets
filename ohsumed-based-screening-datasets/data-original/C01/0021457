Detection of a local staphylococcal infection in mice with technetium-99m-labeled polyclonal human immunoglobulin.
 The purpose of this study was to investigate both the ability of 99mTc-labeled polyclonal human immunoglobulin (HIG) to localize an infection and the modes of action involved in this process.
 Mice, infected with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 in a thigh muscle, received HIG intravenously.
 Scintigrams were made 1, 4, and 24 hr later; subsequently the mice were killed and the activity in several organs and thighs was determined.
 The radiopharmaceutical demonstrated a time-dependent accumulation at the site of infection.
 It was found that vascular permeability or Fc binding alone could not account for the mode of action of HIG.
 Neither the origin of Ig (human versus murine) nor the total amount of protein (0.01-1.0 mg Ig per mouse) affected the target-to-background (T/B) ratios.
 Ratios were not different for leukocytopenic animals.
 A correlation (p less than 0.001) was demonstrated between the number of bacteria at the site of infection and the T/B ratio.
 This was also found after antibiotic treatment (p less than 0.02).
