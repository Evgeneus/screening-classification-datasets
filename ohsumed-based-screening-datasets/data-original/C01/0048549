Linkage of recognition and replication functions by assembling combinatorial antibody Fab libraries along phage surfaces.
 We describe a method based on a phagemid vector with helper phage rescue for the construction and rapid analysis of combinatorial antibody Fab libraries.
 This approach should allow the generation and selection of many monoclonal antibodies.
 Antibody genes are expressed in concert with phage morphogenesis, thereby allowing incorporation of functional Fab molecules along the surface of filamentous phage.
 The power of the method depends upon the linkage of recognition and replication functions and is not limited to antibody molecules.
