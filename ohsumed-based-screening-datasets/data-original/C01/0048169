Cutaneous herpes simplex virus infections.
 Affecting millions of Americans each year, herpes simplex virus infections are among the most common human viral infections.
 Many clinical forms exist, depending on the site of infection and the patient's age and immune status.
 Clinical evaluation and laboratory studies help establish the diagnosis.
 Acyclovir is the drug most often used to treat herpes simplex virus infections, although newer agents, such as phosphonoformate trisodium, may be required for acyclovir-resistant infections.
