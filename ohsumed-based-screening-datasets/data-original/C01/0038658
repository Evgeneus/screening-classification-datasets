HLA-DR antigen expression on peripheral blood monocytes correlates with surgical infection.
 Monocyte human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) expression has correlated closely with clinical outcome in severely injured patients at high risk for infection.
 Monocytes from 77 asymptomatic volunteers expressed HLA-DR antigen with minimal variability in respect to age, gender, race, time of day or year, or serum alcohol level.
 Patients who developed infection after elective laparotomy had a significantly lower mean percentage of monocytes expressing HLA-DR antigen and a lower mean fluorescent intensity than uninfected patients (p less than 0.05).
 Severely infected nonsurgical patients had significantly lower values than normal volunteers (p less than 0.01), and the mean fluorescent intensity of those who died from infection was significantly lower than that of those who survived (p less than 0.05).
 Patients on immunosuppressive regimens after renal transplantation had levels of HLA-DR expression similar to those of the volunteers.
 Monocyte HLA-DR expression was found to be a reliable marker of clinical infection and showed remarkable reproducibility within the normal uninfected study population.
