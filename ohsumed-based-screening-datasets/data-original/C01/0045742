Epidemiology of high-level gentamicin resistant enterococcal isolates from Zimbabwe.
 High-level gentamicin resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration of greater than or equal to 2,000 mcg/ml) in Enterococcus faecalis has not previously been reported in Africa to our knowledge.
 Eight of 28 (29%) rectal swab specimens obtained from hospitalized patients in Zimbabwe had gentamicin resistant enterococci.
 Previous exposure to penicillins or aminoglycosides were risk factors for colonization with these organisms.
 This study documents the presence of high-level gentamicin resistant enterococci in Africa and suggests that penicillin or aminoglycoside usage may select for gentamicin resistant enterococcal plasmids in Africa.
