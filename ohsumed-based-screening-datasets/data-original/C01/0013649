Mycobacterium chelonei keratopathy with visual rehabilitation by a triple procedure.
 We report a chronic keratouveitis following an eye injury, the etiology of which remained obscure despite repeated corneal scrapings and cultures.
 Eventually, the diagnosis was established by culturing Mycobacterium chelonei from a corneal biopsy specimen.
 Topical amikacin resolved active inflammation, but dense corneal scarring and a cataract remained.
 Visual rehabilitation was achieved through a combined penetrating keratoplasty, extracapsular cataract extraction, and intraocular lens implantation.
 This case illustrates that there should be a high index of suspicion of atypical mycobacteria when faced with any unusual keratitis, particularly following penetrating injuries and corneal grafts.
