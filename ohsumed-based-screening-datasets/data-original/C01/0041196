Brain stem abscess treated successfully by medical therapy.
 A case of a solitary brain stem abscess in a 55-year-old man is presented.
 The computed tomographic scan and clinical picture allowed the presumptive diagnosis to be made.
 The abscess resolved completely after treatment with chloramphenicol, vancomycin, and ceftazidime administered intravenously.
 Medical therapy should be considered as an effective treatment of a brain stem abscess, provided the antibiotic therapy is administered under close clinical and computed tomographic monitoring.
