The proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor and treatment of the septic shock syndrome.
 Treating the septic shock syndrome with antibodies that block only endotoxin has its limitations.
 Other targets for treating septic shock include neutralizing antibodies to the complement fragment C5a, platelet-activating factor antagonists, and blockade of endothelial cell leukocyte adhesion molecules.
 Specific blockade of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF) reduces the morbidity and mortality associated with septic shock.
 Moreover, blocking IL-1 and TNF likely has uses in treating diseases other than septic shock.
 Use of neutralizing antibodies to TNF or to IL-1 receptors have reduced the consequences of infection and inflammation, including lethal outcomes in animal models.
 The IL-1 receptor antagonist, a natural-occurring cytokine, blocks shock and death due to Escherichia coli and ameliorates a variety of inflammatory diseases.
 Soluble TNF and IL-1 surface receptors, which bind their respective cytokines, also ameliorate disease processes.
 Current clinical trials are evaluating the safety and efficacy of these anticytokine therapies either alone or together.
