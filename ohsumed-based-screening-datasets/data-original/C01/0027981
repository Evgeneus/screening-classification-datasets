Vaginitis in adult women.
 Often trivialized by the medical profession, vaginitis in adult women is not only extremely common but is the source of considerable distress.
 Vaginitis is a major symptom, not just a nuisance; severe cases often result in marked suffering.
 Epidemiologic studies described in this article indicate the high incidence of vaginitis, attributable to a large number of causes.
 Although most cases are due to BV, VVC, or trichomoniasis, many other syndromes exist.
 Given the correct diagnosis, there is a wealth of excellent drugs for treating vaginitis.
 Hence, clinicians must abandon any tendency to resort to empiric therapy.
