Microanalysis of bile acid composition in intrahepatic calculi and its etiological significance.
 Brown pigment stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts were compared with those found in the extrahepatic bile ducts with special reference to the bile acids modified by bacterial intervention, that is, unconjugated, glucuronidated, secondary, and ketonic bile acid fractions.
 The former showed significantly lower amounts of total bile acids (P less than 0.01) and lower proportions of unconjugated bile acid fraction (P less than 0.01), secondary bile acid fraction (P less than 0.05), and ketonic bile acid fraction (P less than 0.05) to total bile acids than the latter.
 The discriminant analysis using these bile acid parameters led to complete separation between intrahepatic and extrahepatic stones in the case of brown pigment stones.
 In contrast, cholesterol stones in the intrahepatic bile ducts showed the bile acid composition close to those found in the extrahepatic ducts and gallbladder.
 The above data show that the bacterial infection plays a less important role in the formation and ensuing growth of most intrahepatic brown pigment stones than in extrahepatic stones, and that factors other than or in addition to bacterial infection are involved.
