Histamine concentration of gastric mucosa in Helicobacter pylori positive and negative children.
 The histamine concentration was determined by enzymatic isotopic method in biopsy specimens of oxyntic mucosa from 37 children.
 Nineteen of the 37 had Helicobacter pylori associated gastritis (9 with duodenal ulcer).
 The histamine concentration in the H pylori negative group was mean (SD) 54.1 (23.1) micrograms/g fresh weight, and that in the H pylori positive group was 26.3 (14.2) micrograms/g (p less than 0.01).
 There was also a significant difference between H pylori positive patients with duodenal ulcer (19.8 (6.3) micrograms/g) and those without ulcer (31.4 (17.9) micrograms/g) (p less than 0.05).
 These results suggest that H pylori positive patients, especially those with duodenal ulcer, have reduced 'stored' histamine, perhaps because of increased histamine liberation.
