A triazolodiazepine platelet activating factor receptor antagonist (WEB 2086) reduces pulmonary dysfunction during endotoxin shock in swine.
 We wanted to determine the effects of WEB 2086, a platelet activating factor (PAF) antagonist, in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) shock in anesthetized pigs.
 In a randomized study, LPS from S.
 abortus equi, 2 micrograms/kg/h was given IV for six hours.
 Thirteen animals received LPS and WEB 2086, 10 mg/kg/h IV for 6.5 hours, beginning 30 minutes before LPS.
 Eleven septic controls received saline and LPS, three nonseptic controls received saline and WEB 2086, and three nonseptic controls received saline only.
 In six animals we investigated the effect of synthetic PAF in doses between 50 and 10,000 ng on arterial (AP) and pulmonary arterial (PAP) pressure before and during infusion of WEB 2086.
 The LPS-induced rise in PAP was reduced by WEB 2086 (p = 0.01) but not the decrease in AP.
 The LPS-induced leukopenia, hypoxia, increase in airway pressure, and release of plasminogen activator inhibitor were reduced by WEB 2086.
 Platelet activating factor produced an increase in PAP and a biphasic response in AP.
 All PAF dose response curves were shifted to the right by WEB 2086.
 Platelet activating factor was a pulmonary hypertensive agent and contributed to the LPS-induced respiratory alterations.
