Aberrations in post-trauma monocyte (MO) subpopulation: role in septic shock syndrome.
 Appearance of increased proportions of monocytes bearing the 72kd(FcRI) receptor for IgG correlated to aberrant monocyte (MO) functions, depressed immune functions, and poor clinical outcome.
 The trauma patients' FcRI+ MO subpopulation produced the majority of their elevated IL-6, TNF alpha, TGF beta, and PGE2.
 IgG stimulation of patients' MO through FcRI not only stimulated TNF alpha, IL-6, and PGE2 levels, but also greatly augmented the levels of these monokines produced after subsequent bacterial challenge.
 Post-trauma increased IL-6 levels can lead to polyclonal B-cell activation and high levels of circulating, nonspecific IgG as seen in trauma patients.
 This nonspecific IgG triggers the FcRI on the increased numbers of FcRI+ MO leading to ever-increasing monokine levels.
 IL-4 was found to downregulate patients' FcRI+ MO production of mediators.
 The cycle of altered cytokine levels, increased FcRI+ MO numbers, elevated IgG, and augmented triggering of FcRI+ MO may be broken by addition of IL-4.
