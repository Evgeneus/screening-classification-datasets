In vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing for the newly identified AIDS-associated Mycoplasma. Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain).
 Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain) has recently been recognized as a possible infectious pathogen in humans.
 This mycoplasma is associated with an acute fatal disease in previously healthy patients who do not have the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Many patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome suffer a systemic infection with this microbe.
 Quantitative assay of antimicrobial susceptibility for M fermentans (incognitus strain) in cultures to representative antibiotics has revealed that the microbe is not sensitive to erythromycin, the most commonly used antibiotic for human mycoplasma infections.
 The testing shows that M fermentans (incognitus strain) is sensitive in vitro to the antibiotics tetracycline, doxycycline, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, lincomycin, and ciprofloxacin.
