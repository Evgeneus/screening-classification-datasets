Plasma neutrophil-activating peptide-1/interleukin-8 and neutrophil elastase in a primate bacteremia model.
 A hyperdynamic sepsis model was set up in seven adult baboons to evaluate neutrophil-activating peptide-1/interleukin (IL)-8 (NAP-1/IL-8), IL-1 beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha), and IFN-gamma in plasma.
 By continuous intravenous administration of 10(10) cfu/kg live Escherichia coli over 8 h with additional infusion therapy (less than or equal to 50 ml/kg/h), endotoxin plasma levels of 2.7-22.3 ng/ml were observed.
 In plasma the kinetics of NAP-1/IL-8 and IL-6 were similar to those of IL-1 at the end of the experiment (8 h) (peak median values, 34, 4197, and 230 ng/ml, respectively).
 Differences were greatest for IL-6.
 Monocyte activation during sepsis was confirmed by elevated plasma neopterin levels (91-139 mumol/mmol of creatine).
 Granulocyte activation was evident from both incipient neutropenia and the massive release of neutrophil elastase into the plasma as measured by a new immunoassay (peak level, 374 ng/ml).
 Thus, in primate bacteremia, early TNF release is followed by a concomitant increase of NAP-1/IL-8 with plasma kinetics similar to those of IL-6 and IL-1 and accompanied by massive activation of neutrophils.
