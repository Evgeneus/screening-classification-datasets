False-positive results with the use of chlamydia tests in the evaluation of suspected sexual abuse--Ohio, 1990.
 On June 21, 1990, a commercial laboratory reported to a private residential-care facility for profoundly retarded persons in Ohio that rectal cultures from 10 residents tested positive for Chlamydia trachomatis.
 This report summarizes the epidemiologic and laboratory investigation by public health officials in Ohio and at CDC, which concluded that the C.
 trachomatis results were false-positive.
