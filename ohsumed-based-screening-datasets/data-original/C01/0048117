Immune cell activation in melioidosis: increased serum levels of interferon-gamma and soluble interleukin-2 receptors without change in soluble CD8 protein.
 To evaluate immune cell activation in patients with melioidosis, serum samples were assayed for interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), soluble interleukin-2 receptors (sIL-2R), and soluble CD8 protein (sCD8).
 Forty patients with sepsis (23 fatal cases, 17 survivors) and 13 with localized disease were studied during acute illness; 12 additional patients were studied after discharge while on maintenance antimicrobial therapy.
 Serum concentrations of IFN-gamma and sIL-2R were greatly elevated, but sCD8 concentrations were not.
 These levels increased with disease severity and were associated with fatal outcomes.
 Macrophage activation by high concentrations of the cytokine IFN-gamma may contribute to pathophysiology and death in septicemic patients.
 Both IFN-gamma and sIL-2R seem to be predictive of outcome in patients with severe melioidosis and may prove useful in detection of relapse.
