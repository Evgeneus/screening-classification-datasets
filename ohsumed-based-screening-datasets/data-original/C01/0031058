Disseminated histoplasmosis in a renal transplant patient: a cause of renal failure several years following transplantation.
 A 49-year-old man developed disseminated histoplasmosis 6 1/2 years after transplantation.
 The organism was initially present in the urine and in a tongue lesion.
 Treatment with itraconazole was instituted.
 However, there was further dissemination of the disease and worsening of renal function.
 Allograft biopsy showed extensive involvement with the organism.
 Amphotericin B was started, resulting in a rapid resolution of the disease.
 However, renal function deteriorated, leading to permanent hemodialysis.
