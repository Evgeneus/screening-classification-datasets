An unusual presentation of salmonellal aortitis.
 Our patient represents what we believe to be the first documented case of Salmonella choleraesuis aortitis presenting as a salmonellal empyema in an elderly diabetic man.
 Although S choleraesuis often causes septicemia, its absence should not lead one to forget the pathogenic nature of and high mortality associated with this organism.
 Aggressive efforts must be made to search for endovascular infection, because cures can be achieved only with surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy.
