Pleural penetration of ciprofloxacin in patients with empyema thoracis.
 We evaluated the pharmacokinetics of a single 200-mg dose of ciprofloxacin, administered as a 30-minute infusion, into pleural exudate in five elderly patients with empyema thoracis.
 Ciprofloxacin was measured by HPLC and the pharmacokinetic parameters were determined by noncompartmental methods.
 Mean peak serum levels 30 minutes after administration were 1.98 +/- 0.07 mg/L.
 Terminal serum half-lives ranged from 3.9 to 5.1 h.
 Mean concentrations of ciprofloxacin in pleural exudate were 1.44 +/- 0.42 mg/L at a mean time of 4.5 +/- 2.5 h.
 After this time, the pleural exudate level exceeded the corresponding serum twofold to tenfold.
 The mean percentage penetration into the inflammatory compartment was approximately 210 percent.
 Our data suggested that ciprofloxacin penetrates well into the pleural fluid of patients with empyema thoracis.
 The concentrations achieved were well above the MIC90 of most pathogens normally found in patients with empyema thoracis for a period of approximately 12 h.
