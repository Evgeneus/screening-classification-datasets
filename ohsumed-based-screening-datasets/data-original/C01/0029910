Complications of percutaneous dart therapy in management of pneumothorax.
 Treatment of patients who have pneumothorax is increasingly being undertaken with a small-diameter dart catheter.
 Although the catheter usually is effective, complications can arise with its use.
 We describe a patient in whom empyema developed during treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax with the use of such a catheter.
 Limitations and guidelines for its use are discussed.
