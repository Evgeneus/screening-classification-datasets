Susceptibility of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to cefpodoxime: determination of MICs and disk diffusion zone diameters.
 We studied the susceptibilities of 77 strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae to four antibiotics: cefpodoxime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, and tetracycline.
 All strains were susceptible to ceftriaxone.
 Cefpodoxime MICs (range, 0.001 to 0.125 micrograms/ml) were parallel to and approximately four times those of ceftriaxone, and all strains will probably be considered susceptible to cefpodoxime.
 Disk diffusion zone diameters for cefpodoxime ranged from 35 to 57 mm.
 Of the strains, 32% were penicillin resistant and 51% were tetracycline resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml).
 Susceptibility measurements were consistent for disk diffusion zone diameter and MIC, with an overall agreement of 215 of 225 (96%) for ceftriaxone, penicillin, and tetracycline combined.
 On the basis of these in vitro data, cefpodoxime should be evaluated in the treatment of gonorrhea.
