Pseudomembranous colitis: CT evaluation of 26 cases.
 Pseudomembranous colitis (PMC) is an infectious colitis usually occurring as a complication of antibiotic use.
 The computed tomographic (CT) appearances of 26 patients with PMC were reviewed.
 Twenty-three patients demonstrated an abnormal bowel wall, with an average wall thickness of 14.7 mm (range, 3-32 mm); in three patients, bowel wall thickness was normal.
 Contrast material trapped between thickened folds corresponded to the broad transverse bands described on plain radiographs.
 Pancolonic involvement was seen in 13 cases, while seven patients had right-sided involvement only; three patients had bowel wall thickening limited to the rectosigmoid only.
 Although the CT appearance of PMC is not highly specific, the diagnosis may be suggested in the proper clinical setting.
