Human monoclonal antibodies specific for capsular polysaccharides of Klebsiella recognize clusters of multiple serotypes.
 We report the generation and the characterization of a set of human monoclonal antibodies (HmAb) specific for Gram-negative bacteria of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
 The eight human hybridomas secrete either IgM kappa, IgA1 kappa, or IgA2 kappa antibodies.
 One HmAb binds bacteria of only one serotype.
 Five HmAb recognize non-overlapping clusters of 2, 3, or 10 different serotypes.
 The remaining two HmAb both recognize three serotypes.
 Two serotypes are recognized by both HmAb, and in addition both HmAb bind one more nonidentical serotype.
 These results suggest that in man, epitopes are immunodominant, different from serotype-specific determinants detected by conventional rabbit antisera.
 Screening of clinical isolates revealed that the HmAb recognize not only representative typing strains but also most isolates of the corresponding serotype.
 In addition, most of the isolates that were non-typable by polyclonal antisera were recognized by one of the HmAb.
 Fine specificity analyses revealed that all HmAb are highly specific for the isolated capsular polysaccharides (CPS) of bacteria within the corresponding cluster of serotypes.
 However, the avidity of a HmAb for the different CPS can differ significantly.
 Taken together, our results suggest that the unequivocal interactions between HmAb and CPS offer the basis for an alternative, better defined classification system, and that passive immunization with a limited number of HmAb may provide a feasible strategy for the protection against the majority of fatal, nosocomial infections with multidrug-resistant strains of K.
 pneumoniae.
