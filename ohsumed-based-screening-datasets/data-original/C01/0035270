Helicobacter pylori and ABO blood groups.
 A serological study was carried out to assess the prevalence of antibodies to Helicobacter pylori and compare it with the distribution of ABO blood groups.
 Serum samples from 402 healthy blood donors were tested with an IgG enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
 There was no difference in blood groups between those who were seropositive and those who were seronegative, which suggests that blood group O is not a risk factor for acquiring H pylori infection.
