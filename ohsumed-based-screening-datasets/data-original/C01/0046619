Infant botulism: a review of 12 years' experience at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
 Fifty-seven patients with infant botulism were cared for at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia between 1976 and 1987.
 The ages of the children ranged from 18 days to slightly more than 7 months.
 The average duration of hospitalization was 44 +/- 34 days, with the average intensive care unit stay lasting 29 +/- 25 days (54 of 57 patients).
 The majority (77%) of the patients were ultimately intubated and mechanically ventilated (68%).
 The principal indication for intubation was loss of protective airway reflexes and not hypercarbia or hypoxemia.
 In those patients who required mechanical ventilation the average duration was 23 +/- 22 days, with the 10 most severely affected patients (greater than or equal to 28 days of mechanical ventilation) averaging 53 +/- 25 days.
 Excluding patients ventilated for more than a month, those who underwent tracheostomy were hospitalized nearly twice as long as those who were managed by nasotracheal intubation only (33.5 days vs 63.2 days).
 The use of continuous nasogastric feedings has supplied most infants with sufficient enteral feedings to avoid weight loss and the need for central intravenous alimentation.
