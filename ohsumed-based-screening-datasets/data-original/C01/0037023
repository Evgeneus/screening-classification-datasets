Single-dose trospectomycin for chlamydial urethritis in men.
 Trospectomycin is an aminocyclitol analog of spectinomycin with significant in vitro activity against Chlamydia trachomatis.
 A single 1-g intramuscular dose was administered to 10 men with symptomatic, culture-positive chlamydial urethritis.
 Trospectomycin was well tolerated but failed to eradicate chlamydial infection, as determined by cultures obtained approximately 1 week after treatment.
