Prostatic abscess after transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.
 We report a case of a diabetic man who had bilateral prostatic abscesses after ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate.
 As is typical of prostatic abscesses, the diagnosis was not evident at presentation.
 We discuss the morbidity of transrectal biopsy and recommend consistent antimicrobial prophylaxis.
 We also recommend transrectal ultrasound in the diagnosis of such abscesses, and support the standard treatment of drainage and parenteral antimicrobial therapy.
 We anticipate that the incidence of prostatic abscess will increase due to the increasing number of men undergoing transrectal biopsy in the current age of transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy.
