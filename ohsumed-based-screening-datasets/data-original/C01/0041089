Fine needle cytodiagnosis of renal tuberculosis.
 A total of 8 patients in whom renal tuberculosis was suspected on clinical or radiological grounds but in whom confirmation could not be achieved by urine culture underwent renal fine needle aspiration.
 Immediate cytodiagnosis was accomplished in 7 of 8 patients by the finding of Langhans' giant histiocytes, epithelioid histiocytes and necrotic debris.
 Later confirmation was obtained in all 8 cases by radiometric culture of aspiration material or saline rinses of the fine needles.
 This experience introduces fine needle aspiration cytology as a diagnostic modality in renal tuberculosis.
