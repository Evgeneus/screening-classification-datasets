The effect of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) upon burn-induced defective neutrophil chemotaxis.
 Severe thermal injury results in impairment of granulocyte production and function.
 The ability to improve the functional capacity of neutrophils could contribute to a reduced morbidity and mortality from sepsis following thermal injury.
 Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that rhG-CSF increases the number of femoral marrow granulocyte progenitor cells and circulating neutrophils as well as the survival rate following burn wound infection.
 The studies reported here examine the effect of in-vivo administration of rhG-CSF on neutrophil chemotaxis following a burn injury and also following superimposed Pseudomonas burn wound sepsis in mice.
 Casein-elicited peritoneal neutrophils were harvested 72 hours after burn injury and 24 hours after infection.
 Chemotaxis was assessed using microchemotaxis chambers and 10(-5) M fMet-Phe as a chemoattractant.
 The number of neutrophils that migrated into the filter was used as an index of directed chemotaxis.
 Burn injury resulted in depressed chemotaxis compared with sham or sham/G-CSF-treated animals (p less than 0.05).
 Administration of rhG-CSF to burned animals resulted in a level of neutrophil chemotaxis comparable with that in control animals.
 The presence of a burn wound infection caused no further impairment of chemotaxis.
 Administration of rhG-CSF to animals with a burn wound infection resulted in improved chemotaxis compared with sham, burned, and burned/infected animals.
 The beneficial effect of G-CSF following burn wound infections from this and previous studies appears to be a combination of expanded numbers of myeloid elements and preservation of their function.
