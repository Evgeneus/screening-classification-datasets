Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for struvite renal calculi: prospective study with extended followup.
 To clarify the significance of retained stone particles after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for struvite renal calculi we followed 22 otherwise healthy women for 16 to 52 months (mean 39 months).
 Each patient had persistent Proteus mirabilis bacteriuria before ESWL and received a standardized regimen of antimicrobial therapy in the perioperative period only.
 Of the 22 patients 19 (86%) were cured of the persistent bacteriuria.
 Of these 19 patients 16 had retained stone particles at the beginning of surveillance and 10 had retained particles at last followup.
 None of the particles produced symptoms or enlarged.
 However, 1 of the patients who was rendered stone-free had a P.
 mirabilis reinfection at 20 months and a new stone developed.
 Of the 22 patients 3 (14%) had continued persistent P.
 mirabilis bacteriuria after ESWL.
 Two patients were subsequently cured of the infection with antibiotics alone (1), and with antibiotics and extraction of a new ureteral stone (1).
 The remaining patient had expansion of retained stone particles after 51 months of surveillance.
 We conclude that a stone-free kidney is an unrealistic objective of ESWL monotherapy for struvite renal calculi.
 However, the treatment usually will eradicate the accompanying persistent bacteriuria and sterile stone particles will not enlarge during the first 2 to 4 years after treatment.
