Spontaneous abortion.
 Spontaneous abortion, or the early termination of pregnancy without outside interference, may be caused by fetal, maternal or external factors.
 In many cases, a specific etiology may never be identified.
 A variety of clinical presentations are possible, ranging from imperceptible loss to profound life-threatening shock.
 Physicians should be able to diagnose and manage the six recognized types of spontaneous abortion: threatened, inevitable, incomplete, complete, missed and septic.
 In all cases, uterine evacuation, avoidance of complications and psychologic support of the family are important.
 The prognosis for a subsequent successful pregnancy is good, except in cases of habitual abortion.
