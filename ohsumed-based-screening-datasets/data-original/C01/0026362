Does the retrocecal position of the vermiform appendix alter the clinical course of acute appendicitis? A prospective analysis.
 Ninety-four adult patients undergoing appendectomy for acute appendicitis were prospectively studied during a 2-year period.
 Patients were divided into retrocecal (group 1; n = 27 [29%]) and anterior (group 2; n = 67 [71%]) groups according to the position of the appendix.
 There was no statistical difference between the two groups in duration of symptoms, presenting signs and symptoms, and initial white blood cell count.
 Furthermore, retrocecal appendicitis was not associated with a higher rate of perforation or increased morbidity.
 We conclude that the retrocecal position of the appendix does not alter the presentation of appendicitis.
