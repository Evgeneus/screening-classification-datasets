Transtracheal delivery of oxygen: efficacy and safety for long-term continuous therapy.
 Transtracheal (TT) oxygen delivery involves administration of oxygen percutaneously through a catheter inserted in the suprasternal trachea.
 Transtracheal oxygen delivery has been proposed as a means of overcoming the high visibility, inconvenience, and discomfort associated with nasal cannula use.
 This report describes our experience using TT delivery in 40 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 32) and other types of lung disease (n = 8).
 Overall acceptance of TT catheter use was high and only 5 subjects elected to discontinue use.
 We believe the TT route is a relatively safe approach for oxygen administration and a promising method of improving patient compliance.
 It also offers the potential of more adequately oxygenating patients with refractory hypoxemia.
