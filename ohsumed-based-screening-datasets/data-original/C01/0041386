Comparative study of fluconazole and clotrimazole in the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis.
 Fluconazole is a new oral triazole antifungal with good activity against Candida spp.
 In this study, we investigated the effectiveness and tolerability of a three-day course of treatment with fluconazole compared with clotrimazole vaginal tablets in nonpregnant women with acute Candida vaginitis.
 Of the 90 evaluable patients who received fluconazole, 76 (84 percent) were asymptomatic seven to ten days after treatment compared with 84 of 95 (88 percent) treated with clotrimazole.
 An additional ten patients in the fluconazole group (11 percent) and seven in the clotrimazole group (7 percent) had improvement in their signs and symptoms.
 Only four patients in each group (4 percent) were considered treatment failures.
 Mycological cures were obtained in 89 and 93 percent of patients treated with fluconazole and clotrimazole, respectively, seven to ten days posttreatment.
 Clinical cure rates remained high one month posttreatment: 79 percent in the fluconazole group and 83 percent in the clotrimazole group.
 Both therapies were well tolerated.
 One patient discontinued treatment after she developed diarrhea while receiving fluconazole.
 The most common adverse effects associated with fluconazole use were nausea (six percent) and diarrhea (three percent).
 No clinically significant laboratory abnormalities were observed.
 In this investigation, oral fluconazole therapy was found to be as safe and effective as clotrimazole vaginal tablets in women with acute vulvovaginal candidiasis.
