Urinary tract infection caused by Corynebacterium group D2: report of 82 cases and review.
 Corynebacterium group D2 (CGD2) is a slow-growing, urea-splitting, multiantibiotic-resistant microorganism that is frequently isolated from urine samples and that, in certain circumstances, produces infection of the lower urinary tract (acute and chronic cystitis) and the upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis).
 This paper analyzes (by means of a retrospective and partially prospective clinical protocol) our experience with 82 patients with CGD2 bacteriuria.
 The infection was symptomatic in 62% of cases, and the clinical diagnoses included acute and chronic cystitis and pyelonephritis with or without bacteremia.
 Because CGD2 infection of the urinary tract may require specific antimicrobial treatment and because CGD2 is a fastidious microorganism, we recommend prolonged incubation of urine cultures (up to 48-72 hours), especially if the routine culture is negative, when patients are symptomatic, have alkaline urine, or have struvite crystals in the urine sediment.
