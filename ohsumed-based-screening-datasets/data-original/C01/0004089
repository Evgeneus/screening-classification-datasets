Transfusion risks.
 Hepatitis remains the most serious transfusion risk, in terms of incidence and severity.
 Transfusion-associated AIDS, hemolytic reactions, TRALI, and anaphylaxis are severe problems that occur relatively rarely, while febrile reactions and mild allergic reactions are common but not serious.
 The key to avoiding all these complications is autotransfusion (see the article "Autologous Transfusion" in this issue).
 Although intraoperative scavenging became available in many centers in the United States in the 1980s, it is hoped that pre-deposit autotransfusion will also become widely utilized in the next decade.
