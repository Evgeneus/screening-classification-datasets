Granulomatous pulmonary zygomycosis in a patient without underlying illness. Computed tomographic appearances and treatment by pneumonectomy.
 Pulmonary zygomycosis rarely occurs in the absence of underlying disease.
 We report a patient with granulomatous pulmonary zygomycosis without underlying disease who presented with a pulmonary mass.
 We present the computed tomographic findings that we believe have not been described previously.
 We also report the successful treatment by pneumonectomy.
