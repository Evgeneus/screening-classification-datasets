Nontuberculous mycobacterial peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: case report and review of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.
 Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are responsible for an increasing proportion of mycobacterial disease.
 Peritonitis due to NTM is an unusual but treatable complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).
 Its presentation is similar to that of typical bacterial peritonitis, but special culture techniques are required to avoid a delay in diagnosis.
 Successful treatment depends on early catheter removal, drainage of fluid collections, and appropriate use of antimicrobial agents.
 We report a case of Mycobacterium fortuitum peritonitis in a patient undergoing CAPD, and review all previously reported cases.
 Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are summarized based on available literature.
