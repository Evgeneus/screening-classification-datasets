Blood contamination of anaesthetic and related staff 
 The incidence of skin contamination of anaesthetic and related staff by patient's blood and saliva was studied during 270 anaesthetics in Cardiff hospitals over seven continuous days in October 1989.
 A survey was also made of current Hepatitis B immunisation status and glove-wearing habits of 75 anaesthetists.
 Blood from 35 (14%) patients caused skin contamination of 65 staff during 46 incidents.
 Twenty-eight (61%) of the contamination incidents occurred during vessel cannulation.
 Five (8%) of the 65 staff contaminated by blood already had cuts on their hands.
 There were nine incidents (4%) of skin contamination by saliva.
 Fifty-three (71%) anaesthetists were immunised against Hepatitis B.
 Only seven (9%) anaesthetists wear gloves for oral or nasal intubation, six (8%) for insertion of peripheral venous cannulae, 47 (63%) for insertion of arterial lines and 67 (89%) for insertion of central lines.
 All anaesthetic and associated staff should wear gloves on a routine basis.
