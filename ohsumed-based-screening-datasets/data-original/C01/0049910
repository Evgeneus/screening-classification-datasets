Retropharyngeal space infection: changing trends.
 Retropharyngeal space infection, now a rare entity since the introduction of modern antibiotic chemotherapy, has traditionally been described to occur in children less than 4 years of age with suppurative disorders of the ear, nose, and throat.
 Recent reports suggest a changing trend in the epidemiology, bacteriology, diagnostic imaging, treatment, and clinical course of this entity.
 However, the medical literature concerning this topic over the last two decades has consisted mainly of case reports.
 We reviewed eight cases of retropharyngeal space infection at our institutions over a 15-year period, representing one of the largest clinical series of its kind in the last 20 years.
 Patient ages ranged from 3 months to 41 years.
 Findings of these cases and 13 cases from similar reports obtained by a MEDLINE computer search of the recent literature were analyzed.
 Results show a trend toward occurrence in older age groups, polymicrobial infections, successful use of CT scan as a diagnostic modality, and fewer patients requiring incision and drainage.
 These findings will be discussed and contrasted to conventional wisdom.
