The slide centrifuge gram stain as a urine screening method.
 A slide centrifuge Gram stain procedure was performed to screen for bacteriuria 4161 urine specimens submitted in urine preservative tubes for routine culture.
 For slide centrifuge Gram staining, each urine sample was mixed well.
 Thereafter, 0.2 mL of each sample was placed, using a pipette, into a slide centrifuge chamber and centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 5 minutes.
 The slides were heat fixed, Gram stained, and read by laboratory personnel who scanned 12 consecutive oil-immersion fields using a set pattern.
 The presence of the same organism in six or more fields was defined as a positive urine screen.
 Urine samples were cultured using a 0.001-mL loop and a comparison of culture growth with slide centrifuge screening was made.
 When growth of 100,000 or more colony-forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL) was the reference for comparison, the screen had a sensitivity rate of 98%, a specificity rate of 90%, a negative predictive value of 99%, and a positive predictive value of 65%.
 When a lower colony count of 10,000 or more CFU/mL was the reference for comparison, the screen had a sensitivity rate of 88%, a specificity rate of 95%, a negative predictive value of 96%, and a positive predictive value of 84%.
 The slide centrifuge Gram stain is a very sensitive screening method to detect bacteriuria in an adult male population.
