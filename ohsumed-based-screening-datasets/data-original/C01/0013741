Bacterial colonization of the upper respiratory tract and its association with acute lower respiratory tract infections in Highland children of Papua New Guinea.
 Acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) is the major cause of death among children in Papua New Guinea.
 This longitudinal study reports the bacteriologic findings for children observed in their hamlets.
 A total of 1,449 nasal swab specimens from 158 children less than 5 years of age who were studied intensively for 18 months were examined.
 Non-serotypable strains of Haemophilus influenzae were isolated from 91% of specimens, and serotypable strains were isolated from 35% (8% H.
 influenzae type b) of specimens.
 All children had acquired Streptococcus pneumoniae by the age of 3 months.
 The most frequently occurring serotypes of S.
 pneumoniae were 6, 19, and 23.
 Children more frequently carried invasive pneumococci during an episode of ALRI than when they were healthy.
 Also, children more frequently carried serotypable strains of H.
 influenzae during the 2 weeks preceding an episode of ALRI than when they were healthy.
 Between-children analyses showed that children who were susceptible to attacks of ALRI and those who were not susceptible had similar rates of carriage of bacteria.
