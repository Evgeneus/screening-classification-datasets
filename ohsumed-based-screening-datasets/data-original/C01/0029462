Drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst: an unusual complication.
 A 34-year-old white woman had external drainage of a pancreatic pseudocyst.
 During sinography, contrast medium filled perigastric varices, causing septic shock.
 From this experience, we believe that although sinograms are helpful, they should be preceded by prophylactic administration of antibiotics and that contrast material should be sterile.
 The drainage catheter should be removed as soon as possible.
