Pharmacokinetics and antibacterial efficacy of cefpirome (HR 810) in experimental Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis.
 Cefpirome (HR 810) is a new cephalosporin related to cefotaxime that has potent bactericidal activity against a broad spectrum of gram-negative and gram-positive organisms.
 The pharmacokinetics and bacteriological efficacy of cefpirome administered as a single intravenous dose were assessed in rabbits with experimental Haemophilus influenzae type b and Escherichia coli K1 meningitis.
 The mean penetrations into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in relation to the amount of drug in serum of animals infected with H.
 influenzae and E.
 coli were 25 and 54%, respectively.
 The median CSF bactericidal titers were 1:128 against both organisms at 1 h of uninfected animals, the mean penetration was 4.5%.
 There was a significant reduction in the concentrations of bacteria in CSFs of both groups of animals treated with cefpirome compared with that in untreated groups.
 Mortality was also significantly lower in treated animals than it was in untreated animals.
 Intravenous administration of dexamethasone before the cefpirome dose did not compromise penetration, bactericidal titers, or antibacterial activity of cefpirome in CSF.
