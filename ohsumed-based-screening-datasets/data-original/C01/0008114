The efficacy of pediatric blood culture sets in the determination of burn bacteremia.
 A blood culture is an essential laboratory procedure necessary to confirm a septic episode.
 However, it is important to collect the blood sample at the appropriate time with an acceptable technique.
 The standard method is to collect at least 5 to 10 ml blood per culture bottle from patients with fevers.
 However, this volume of blood is an unrealistic amount to take from the frequently febrile pediatric patient.
 Alternatively, the pediatric blood culture bottle allows the collection of 1 ml blood per bottle to perform the same evaluation.
 We evaluated the two techniques of blood-culture collection over a 9-month period and compared the results between adult and pediatric blood culture bottles.
 Seventy-six patients, from November 1988 through February 1989, had blood cultures performed with the adult culture bottles, which produced a total of 1314 samples.
 A total of 113 patients, from March through July 1989, had blood cultures performed with the pediatric culture bottles, which produced a total of 758 samples.
 Percent recovery for the adult bottles versus the pediatric bottles was 13.95% versus 22.8% (p less than 0.0001).
 Since the amount of blood necessary to isolate an infectious agent is critical not only for laboratory identification but also for the volume of blood of pediatric patients, these data clearly establish the efficacy of pediatric blood culture bottles and the utilization of smaller amounts of blood.
 Not only did this approach significantly enhance organism recovery rate, but it may well be more cost-effective because fewer cultures need to be performed to isolate the infectious organism.
