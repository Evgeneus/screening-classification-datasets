Long-term results of pectoralis major muscle transposition for infected sternotomy wounds.
 During an 11.5-year period, 100 consecutive patients (79 male, 21 female) underwent repair of an infected sternotomy wound.
 Sixty-five patients had failed attempts at wound closure by other physicians.
 Median age was 61.5 years (range, 5 to 85 years).
 Reconstruction included muscle in 79 patients, omentum in 4, and both in 15.
 A total of 175 muscles were transposed, including 169 pectoralis major, 3 rectus abdominis, 2 external oblique, and 1 latissimus dorsi.
 Median number of operations was four (range, 1 to 11).
 Mechanical ventilation was required in 30 patients.
 Two perioperative deaths occurred, one related to sepsis.
 Median follow-up was 4.2 years (range, 1.3 to 13.5 years).
 Twenty-six patients had recurrent infection.
 Median time from our closure to recurrence was 5.5 months (range, 0.3 to 27.6 months).
 Cause of recurrence was inadequate removal of cartilage in 16 patients, bone in 6, and retained foreign body in 4.
 Eighteen patients had the wound reopened with further resection; 10 had another muscle or omentum transposition.
 There were 30 late deaths, only one related to recurrent infection.
 At the time of death or last follow-up, 92 patients had a healed chest wall.
 Transposition of the pectoralis major muscle remains an excellent method of management for infected sternotomy wounds.
 Failure is directly related to persistent infection of cartilage, bone, or retained foreign bodies.
