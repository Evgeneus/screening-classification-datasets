Specific detection of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis by DNA hybridisation with a fragment of the insertion element IS900.
 This paper describes the evaluation of a newly developed DNA probe for Mycobacterium paratuberculosis.
 DNA probe PCR278 is a 278 bp fragment obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 5'-region of IS900, an insertion element contained in the genome of M paratuberculosis.
 This DNA probe can specifically distinguish M paratuberculosis from a wide range of other organisms, including members of the M avium-M intracellulare complex.
 When used in conjunction with the PCR amplification technique DNA probe PCR278 could detect as little as 10 fg (equivalent to two genomes) starting material of M paratuberculosis genomic DNA.
 Use of PCR amplification assays based on IS900, for the detection of M paratuberculosis, and homologous IS elements found in disease isolates of M avium should greatly help our understanding of the role of these organisms in Crohn's disease and other chronic inflammatory disorders.
