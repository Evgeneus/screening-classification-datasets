Update: self-induced malaria associated with malariotherapy for Lyme disease--Texas.
 In December 1990, the Texas Department of Health (TDH) was contacted by a man who had recently moved from the northeastern United States and who was considering malariotherapy for Lyme disease (LD).
 He described a 2-year history of unsuccessful treatment with multiple antibiotics for arthralgias and palpitations, which had been diagnosed as LD.
