The "nuisance" sexually transmitted diseases: molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and crab lice.
 Although molluscum contagiosum, scabies, and infestation by crab lice do not carry the requirements of partner notification or other long-term consequences, they are among the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease.
 Molluscum contagiosum is a benign viral infection of the skin epidermal layer, most often transmitted by intimate skin-to-skin contact.
 The lesions often resolve spontaneously over time, but patient discomfort or social reasons may require destructive removal of the lesions.
 Scabies is caused by the Sarcoptes scabiei mite.
 The victims continually itch, especially at night, and often seek over-the-counter topical remedies before seeing a clinician.
 Once a correct diagnosis is made, successful resolution of this disease and its itching can be achieved.
 Head and pubic lice account for most of the more than three million cases of louse infestation treated in the United States each year.
 Symptoms of infestation generally include itching that leads to scratching, erythema, irritation, and inflammation.
 A careful diagnosis followed by disinfection, symptomatic treatment, and psychologic support should result in a complete cure with no long-term effects.
