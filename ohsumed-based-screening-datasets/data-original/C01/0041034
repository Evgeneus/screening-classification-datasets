Parapharyngeal space melioidosis in a diabetic.
 Pseudomonas pseudomallei, a gram negative organism causing melioidosis, is found in tropical and subtropical regions.
 It may manifest as a pulmonary lesion, osteomyelitis, soft tissue abscesses, abscesses in various organs or in septicaemic form.
 Melioidosis of the parapharyngeal space has not been reported so far.
 A case of melioidosis of the parapharyngeal space which was successfully treated by drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy is reported here.
 Melioidosis should be suspected in severe forms of deep neck space infection, especially if the patient comes from an endemic area.
