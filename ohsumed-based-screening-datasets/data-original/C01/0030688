An update on home intravenous antibiotic therapy.
 Home intravenous antibiotic therapy (HIVAT) has proven to be a safe, effective, and cost-saving method to treat appropriately selected patients with bone, soft tissue, respiratory, genitourinary, and cardiac infections.
 Further, the acceptance of HIVAT by both physicians and patients has been enhanced by the availability of new venous access devices and home IV therapy companies.
 In determining when to use HIVAT, it is important to carefully consider the individual patient, the disease or medical condition, and antibiotic selection.
 HIVAT requires a team approach, with the physician, pharmacist, IV therapy nurse, and others playing critical roles in successful treatment plans.
