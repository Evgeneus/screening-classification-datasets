Comparison of the Gen-Probe PACE 2 system, direct fluorescent-antibody, and cell culture for detecting Chlamydia trachomatis in cervical specimens.
 A chemiluminescent-labeled DNA probe (Gen-Probe PACE 2 System) for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis in endocervical specimens was evaluated.
 For each specimen, tissue cell culture, direct immunofluorescent staining (DFA), and DNA probe assay were performed.
 Thirty of 318 (9.4%) specimens were positive for C.
 trachomatis.
 The sensitivities, specificities, and positive and negative predictive values of the DNA probe compared with cell culture were 93%, 98%, 85%, and 99%, respectively, and for DFA these same values were 81%, 99%, 83%, and 99%, respectively.
 The Gen-Probe PACE 2 System is a reliable method for the rapid detection of endocervical chlamydial infection.
