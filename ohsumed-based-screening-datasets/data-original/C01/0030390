Factors affecting morbidity following hepatic trauma. A prospective analysis of 482 injuries.
 During a 5-year period, 482 patients with liver injuries were studied prospectively: 65% resulted from penetrating and 35% from blunt injuries.
 The injuries were graded by the hepatic injury scale (grades I to VI); transfusion requirements and perihepatic abscesses correlated with increasing scores.
 Minor surgical techniques were needed in 338 patients and 144 patients required major techniques.
 Omental packing was used in 60% of the major injuries and yielded 7% mortality and 8% abscess rates.
 Gauze packs were used for management of 10% of major injuries and yielded 29% mortality and 30% abscess rates.
 The patients were randomized to no drain, closed suction, or sump drainage and respective perihepatic abscess rates were 6.7%, 3.5%, and 13% (p less than 0.03; suction compared to closed suction).
 Multivariate analysis demonstrated increasing abdominal trauma indices and transfusion requirements as well as sump drainage to be associated independently with perihepatic infection.
