Prosthetic valve endocarditis due to Cardiobacterium hominis occurring after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
 Bacterial endocarditis secondary to endoscopic procedures has been convincingly documented in only four cases.
 We describe a case of prosthetic valve endocarditis due to Cardiobacterium hominis that developed after upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
 Because of this, we recommend subacute bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis in patients who have a prior history of endocarditis or valve replacement.
