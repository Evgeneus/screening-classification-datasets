Periodic acid-Schiff-positive organisms in primary cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection. Case report and an investigation of the periodic acid-Schiff staining properties of bacteria.
 Primary cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection frequently presents as a single necrotic bulla on the extremity of an immunocompromised patient.
 In lesional biopsy specimens and smears, the large gram-positive rods of B cereus may be mistaken for Clostridium species.
 This is a potentially serious error, as Bacillus species are resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics.
 We studied a case in which large periodic acid-Schiff-staining organisms were seen in the biopsy specimen from a necrotic bulla on the finger of a neutropenic patient with diffuse large cell lymphoma.
 The tissue biopsy specimen subsequently yielded a pure culture of B cereus.
 Staining with periodic acid-Schiff was then performed on a series of bacterial species in human tissue and from smears of culture colonies.
 The following bacterial species were found to be consistently periodic acid-Schiff positive after diastase digestion: B cereus, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Propionibacterium acnes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Micrococcus luteus.
