Mersilene tip implants in rhinoplasty: a review of 98 cases.
 Reshaping the nasal tip is the most difficult part of a rhinoplasty, particularly in certain types of nasal tip deformities, such as the recessed tip, the thick-skin tip, the boxy tip, the asymmetrical tip, the thin-skin tip, the bifid tip, the turned-up tip, and the turned-down tip.
 A new approach is introduced regarding the use of Mersilene tip implants.
 Guidelines for preoperative evaluation and surgical technique are outlined.
 The so-called "PEPSI" rule (pocket, experience, positioning, shape and size, and incision) is emphasized.
 The advantages and disadvantages of the Mersilene tip implant are discussed.
 The Mersilene implant was used in the tip region in a total of 98 patients, and the results are satisfactory.
