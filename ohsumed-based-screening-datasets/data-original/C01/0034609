Serious bacterial infections in children. When can outpatient treatment be used?
 Several studies now support outpatient treatment of many serious bacterial infections in children, such as periorbital or buccal cellulitis, urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and abscess.
 However, an appropriate agent, that is, a third-generation cephalosporin with a long half-life, must be available and its effectiveness properly researched.
 In addition, children must be free of other illnesses and able to ingest fluids and maintain hydration, and their parents must be willing and able to cooperate with an outpatient treatment regimen.
 Family physicians can maintain the close patient and family contact needed to facilitate this form of therapy.
