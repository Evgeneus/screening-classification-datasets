Hemodynamic effects of lobar pulmonary artery occlusion in a porcine sepsis model.
 We induced severe pulmonary hypertension and acute lung injury in 6 pigs by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infusion.
 We studied the effect of pulmonary artery catheter inflation of a pulmonary artery catheter balloon in the left lower lobar pulmonary artery was accompanied by a significant (p less than 0.05, paired t test) increase in pulmonary artery pressure, a decrease in left atrial pressure, a decrease in cardiac output, and a decrease in mean arterial pressure.
 No significant changes occurred when the catheter was advanced into the wedged position without balloon inflation.
 Balloon inflation had no significant effect on these variables before bacterial infusion.
 We conclude that with sufficiently severe pulmonary hypertension in association with diffuse lung injury, lobar pulmonary artery occlusion may cause alterations in cardiac output and left atrial pressure.
 This may confuse interpretation of pulmonary artery catheter measurements.
