Alterations of ATP levels and of energy parameters in the blood of alcoholic and nonalcoholic patients with liver damage.
 Blood adenine nucleotides were determined in patients with alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases.
 They included patients with alcoholic hepatitis (AH), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC), non-alcoholic liver cirrhosis (NALC), and amoebic liver abscess (ALA) (28 patients).
 A decrease of 28% to 39% in blood ATP levels was observed among the patients with AH and the cirrhotic groups, respectively (p less than 0.05), whereas no significant changes in blood ATP levels were detected in the ALA group.
 Although total blood adenine nucleotides were significantly diminished in AH, ALC, and NALC groups, the AH patients retained their energy relationships within normal range.
 On the other hand, the cirrhotic groups, independently of their etiology, failed to maintain an adequate ATP/ADP ratio, energy charge, and phosphorylation potential in the blood, suggesting a decreased energy availability in their blood cells.
 Nevertheless, the mechanism involved in these effects remains to be elucidated, a failure of the damaged liver to supply purines to extra-hepatic tissues might be a major event altering the blood energy parameters.
