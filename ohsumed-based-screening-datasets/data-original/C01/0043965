Stability of positive tuberculin tests: are boosted reactions valid?
 To determine the stability and presumed significance of tuberculin skin tests, we followed a cohort of 380 tuberculin-positive patients living in chronic care facilities.
 Each patient had a positive reaction (greater than or equal to 10 mm induration to 5 tuberculin units of purified protein derivative) to one of three sequential baseline tuberculin tests.
 One year after the initial series, each patient had a single repeat skin test.
 Reversion to a negative test occurred in 98 (26%) of the 380 patients.
 Decreases in induration of 6 mm or more occurred in 88 (90%) of the reverters.
 Initially positive tests were more likely (p less than 0.001) to remain stable than tests that were "boosted" to positive reactions on the second or third initial administration.
 Stable responses were found in 96% of those whose tests had greater than or equal to 15 mm induration compared with 61% of those with reactions of 10 to 14 mm induration.
 Increasing age also was associated with a high rate of reversion.
 The instability of boosted tuberculin reactions brings into question the clinical significance of these tests.
 We propose limiting tuberculin testing to two sequential tests.
