The use of a tourniquet when plating tibial fractures.
 Sixty closed fractures of the tibia were treated by open reduction and internal fixation with plates and screws.
 Half the operations were performed with a thigh tourniquet and half without.
 In the tourniquet group, there were six cases with erythema and induration of the wound; in the other group there were no such complications.
 Despite negative bacterial cultures, superficial infection of the inflamed wounds was suspected.
 It is suggested that a tourniquet may predispose tissues to infection, and its use is not recommended during operations for internal fixation of the tibia.
