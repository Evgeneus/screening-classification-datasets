Comparative therapy with cefpirome alone and in combination with rifampin and/or gentamicin against a disseminated Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in leukopenic mice.
 Treatment of disseminated Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in leukopenic mice was evaluated using cefpirome alone and in combination with gentamicin and/or rifampin.
 Mice were made leukopenic with cyclophosphamide and infected through a skin incision with an inoculum of 1250 organisms (13 LD50).
 Antibiotics were administered subcutaneously for 48 h.
 Although the addition of cefpirome to gentamicin and/or rifampin improved survival significantly at 48 h compared with untreated controls (84.6%-100% vs.
 38.5%), therapy with these combinations did not improve survival significantly from that achieved with cefpirome alone.
 Quantitative blood and tissue (liver, spleen, kidney, lung) cultures in mice treated with cefpirome alone or including rifampin were lower than in infected controls or groups receiving therapy that excluded cefpirome.
 Highest counts were observed in mice receiving cefpirome plus gentamicin.
 Except for the cefpirome plus gentamicin group, which demonstrated areas of acute tubular necrosis, the cefpirome group had less tissue pathology than infected controls.
