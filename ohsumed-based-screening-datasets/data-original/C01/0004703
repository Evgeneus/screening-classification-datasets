A 'silent' intracranial complication of frontal sinusitis.
 Intracranial complications of frontal sinusitis, although rare today, do still develop despite widespread use of antibiotics.
 We report a case which demonstrates how silently a frontal lobe abscess may present with subtle changes in mood and behaviour, with no focal neurological signs.
 Diagnosis and management are discussed and a brief review of the incidence of intracranial complications of frontal sinusitis, mode of spread, clinical presentation, investigations, treatment and bacteriology is presented.
