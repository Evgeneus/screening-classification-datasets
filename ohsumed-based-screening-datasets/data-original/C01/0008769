Antibiotic compared with antiseptic prophylaxis for prostatic surgery.
 Two different regimens of cephalosporin antibiotic prophylaxis were compared with antiseptic lubricating jelly to try to prevent infection and complications in 196 men after prostatic surgery.
 Pre-operative urine was cultured and prostatic chips (170 cases) were also cultured to define the source of any infection.
 The use of antibiotics was associated with a reduced risk of postoperative bacteriuria.
 No serious complications occurred, although 1 patient in the antiseptic treated group developed rigors; 79 of 170 patients (46%) had positive prostatic chip cultures, of whom 74 had sterile pre-operative urine.
 There was no association between the result of chip culture and the presence of a pre-operative catheter.
 Culture positive patients had an increased risk of post-operative urine infection, although the same organism was found in the prostate and urine in only 36% of cases of post-operative bacteriuria and in 43 (54%) the organism cultured from the prostate was Staphylococcus albus.
 This study provides further evidence of the benefit of true prophylactic antibiotic therapy for transurethral prostatic surgery and the prostatic chip data suggest that some of the risk is due to pre-operative contamination of the prostate in the absence of per-operative urinary infection or catheterisation.
