Treatment of chronic moccasin-type tinea pedis with terbinafine: a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
 Terbinafine is an orally and topically active fungicidal drug of the allylamine series.
 Its oral efficacy at 125 mg taken twice daily was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in moccasin-type tinea pedis.
 The study was conducted simultaneously in two centers and consisted of 41 evaluable cases (23 terbinafine, 18 placebo).
 Mycologic cure and near to complete clearing of signs and symptoms were obtained in 59% of the terbinafine-treated patients after 6 weeks of treatment and in 65% at 2 weeks after treatment.
 Corresponding efficacy for placebo-treated patients was zero at both evaluations.
 Side effects in both groups were minimal.
 We conclude that terbinafine is well tolerated and highly effective in moccasin-type tinea pedis.
