Pelvic inflammatory disease.
 The costs of PID to both individuals and society are enormous.
 Although primary prevention of PID through control of lower genital tract infections is the most effective prevention strategy, early diagnosis and treatment of acute PID may minimize some of its serious sequelae.
 Although laparoscopy is helpful for establishing the diagnosis of salpingitis, other less invasive tests along with selected clinical criteria may also be useful.
 Treatment of PID, which is empiric and broad spectrum, is oriented toward polymicrobial PID.
 Whenever possible, women with PID should be hospitalized for parenteral therapy.
 The 1989 CDC STD treatment guidelines recommend two regimens for inpatient parenteral therapy: clindamycin/gentamicin and cefoxitin, or equivalent cephalosporin/doxycycline.
 Outpatient management of PID should be monitored closely; the CDC-recommended regimen includes use of intramuscular cephalosporins and oral doxycycline.
 Oral penicillins are no longer recommended.
