Serodiagnosis of invasive amebiasis using a recombinant Entamoeba histolytica protein.
 One hundred eight serum samples from 106 patients were examined by Western blot analysis for the presence of antibodies to a recombinant fusion protein containing the sequence of the newly described serine-rich Entamoeba histolytica protein (SREHP).
 Among patients with invasive amebiasis from Durban, Republic of South Africa; San Diego, Calif; Mexico City, Mexico; and St Louis, Mo, 53 (82%) of 65 had antibodies to SREHP.
 In contrast, only one patient (2%) of 43 without acute invasive amebiasis had antibodies to SREHP.
 The predictive value of a positive test for anti-SREHP antibodies in the detection of acute invasive amebiasis was most marked when analyzed in the patients from Durban, where 11 (92%) of 12 patients who were seropositive for SREHP had acute invasive amebiasis vs 17 (65%) of 26 patients who had a positive serologic diagnosis as determined by agar gel diffusion.
 The use of a serologic test based on the recombinant SREHP fusion protein may be a useful adjunct to the diagnosis of acute invasive amebiasis in endemic regions.
