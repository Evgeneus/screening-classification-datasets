Safety and immunogenicity of a Haemophilus influenzae type b conjugate vaccine in a high risk American Indian population [published erratum appears in Pediatr Infect Dis J 1991 May;10(5):369] 
 The safety and immunogenicity of a Haemophilus influenzae type b polysaccharide conjugate vaccine linked to the outer membrane protein complex of Neisseria meningitidis (Hib-OMP) were evaluated among Apache and Navajo infants and children.
 One dose of the Hib-OMP was given to 42 children who were from 12 and 60 months of age.
 Ninety-two infants 6 to 8 weeks old were given one dose of Hib-OMP at the time of enrollment.
 A subsequent dose of the vaccine was given 2 months later and a third dose was offered between 12 and 15 months of age.
 All of the 12- to 60-month-old children achieved a protective antibody concentration (greater than 1 microgram/ml) 1 month postvaccination.
 Among the 6- to 8-week-old infants only 11% of the Apaches and 8% of Navajos had a protective anti-PRP antibody concentration prevaccination.
 One month post vaccination 68% of the Apaches and 69% of the Navajos had protective anti-PRP antibody concentrations.
 One month after the second immunization 67% of the Apaches and 75% of Navajos had protective anti-PRP concentrations.
 Among the infants that received the third (booster) immunization (N = 28) 74% had protective anti-PRP antibody titers just before the booster immunization.
 One month after the booster immunization all of the infants had protective concentrations of anti-PRP antibody.
 We conclude that the Hib-OMP is safe and highly immunogenic among Apache and Navajo infants and children.
