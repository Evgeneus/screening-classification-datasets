A prospective study of incisional time, blood loss, pain, and healing with carbon dioxide laser, scalpel, and electrosurgery.
 Carbon dioxide laser incisions are reported to be less painful, less bloody, and less prone to seroma formation and to heal better than scalpel or electrosurgical incisions.
 We compared all three modalities in a prospective randomized study of cholecystectomy incisions.
 Time required for the incision and incisional blood loss was less with electrosurgery than with the carbon dioxide laser or scalpel.
 Postoperative pain and wound healing, however, were the same for all three techniques.
 The carbon dioxide laser appears to offer no advantage over conventional means of making a standard incision.
