Acute pulpal-alveolar cellulitis syndrome. V. Apical closure of immature teeth by infection control: the importance of an endodontic seal with therapeutic factors. Part 2.
 During orthodontic treatment to promote eruption of maxillary and mandibular second bicuspids, a young male patient had a severe endodontic cellulitis of a mandibular bicuspid.
 Apexogenesis and resolution of the periapical lesion was achieved by infection control with nonspecific intracanal medication without calcium hydroxide, as stated by Das.
 A mild periodontal cellulitis occurred shortly thereafter and rapidly resolved.
 A second endodontic cellulitis, after apexogenesis without an endodontic seal, occurred shortly after completion of orthodontic treatment.
 This also quickly resolved, and the canal was effectively sealed.
 This case indicates the importance of an effective endodontic seal shortly after apexogenesis is induced by infection control.
 This report and others on the subject indicate that apexogenesis of nonvital permanent immature teeth by infection control is a predictable endodontic treatment procedure.
