Decline in Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis--Seattle-King County, Washington, 1984-1989.
 The first vaccines licensed in the United States for prevention of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease were composed of the capsular polysaccharide of Hib, polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP).
 The vaccines, licensed in 1985, were moderately effective in preventing Hib disease in children aged 24-59 months.
 In December 1987, the first Hib conjugate vaccine was licensed.
 The vaccine was recommended for use in children aged 18-59 months to prevent meningitis and other forms of invasive disease caused by Hib.
 This report summarizes surveillance for Hib meningitis and provides data on the use of Hib vaccine in Seattle-King County, Washington, where Hib meningitis surveillance methods have remained the same since 1984.
