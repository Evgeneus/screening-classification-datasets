Serious infections involving the CDC group Ve bacteria Chryseomonas luteola and Flavimonas oryzihabitans.
 Chryseomonas luteola and Flavimonas oryzihabitans are phenotypically similar gram-negative bacilli and are also referred to as CDC groups Ve-1 and Ve-2, respectively.
 These bacteria are rarely reported as pathogens in humans.
 Infections described in the literature include primarily bacteremia in critically ill patients and peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 We describe three cases of polymicrobial infection secondary to infection with group Ve organisms, including the first reported case (to our knowledge) of CNS infection due to F.
 oryzihabitans.
 These three cases and a review of literature suggest an association between the presence of indwelling catheters and polymicrobial infections with CDC group Ve organisms.
 F.
 oryzihabitans and C.
 luteola should be added to the expanding list of nosocomial pathogens with a propensity to infect critically ill patients who have undergone surgical procedures and/or had indwelling catheters placed.
 The isolation of either of these organisms from clinical specimens should prompt a search for a device-related source.
