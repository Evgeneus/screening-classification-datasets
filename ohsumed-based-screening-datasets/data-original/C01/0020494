Decreased resistance and immune response to Escherichia coli infection in chicks with low or high intakes of vitamin A.
 The effects of vitamin A excess of insufficiency on resistance to Escherichia coli infection and subsequent anti-E.
 coli immune response were examined in chicks.
 Chicks receiving depleted (0 microgram/kg), sufficient (0.85 mg/kg) or excess (1000 mg/kg) levels of vitamin A in their feed were inoculated by a subcutaneous injection of pathogenic E.
 coli (1 x 10(9) and 2 x 10(9) cfu per chick).
 Susceptibility to E.
 coli was determined by mortality, morbidity and immune responses (antibody production and T lymphocyte proliferation).
 Excess of insufficient vitamin A led to increased susceptibility of chicks of E.
 coli infection; this was accompanied by depressed immune responses.
 Chicks receiving excess vitamin A were more sensitive to E.
 coli than vitamin A-depleted chicks.
 This was reflected in higher mortality and morbidity rates and in severely depressed immune responses.
 In contrast to chicks receiving excess vitamin A, T lymphocyte responses (though not antibody responses) of vitamin A-depleted chicks achieved levels similar to those of vitamin A-sufficient birds with a lag period of 6 to 10 d.
 Therefore, reduction in resistance to E.
 coli infection, resulting from vitamin A excess or deficiency, probably was compounded by a delayed immune response.
