Elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressures in patients with cryptococcal meningitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Increased intracranial pressure has been a noteworthy problem in some of our patients with cryptococcal meningitis and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and this appears to be a feature observed in patients with cryptococcal meningitis reported in the literature.
 Whereas most attention of clinicians is presently focused on optimizing the antifungal regimen, so as to improve on high failure rates in cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS, little attention has been paid to the problem of intracranial hypertension.
 We argue that visual loss and some of the cases of death early after the onset of chemotherapy may be related to high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, regardless of antifungal therapy.
 The possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed, and we postulate that the mechanism is reduced CSF outflow possibly due to increased outflow resistance, not necessarily accompanied by prominent cerebral edema.
 Optimal therapy of this complication is not yet established, but some measures that may be helpful are ventricular shunting, frequent high-volume lumbar punctures, and possibly glucocorticoids.
