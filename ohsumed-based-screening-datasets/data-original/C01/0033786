Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteriuria in nursing home-residents.
 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become increasingly common in nursing homes in the United States.
 It can cause serious infections and is difficult to eradicate once it becomes established in an institution.
 We report three representative cases of MRSA bacteriuria occurring in residents of a skilled nursing facility that experienced an outbreak of MRSA beginning in 1988.
 The clinical options available in such cases are described, and the research methods that should be used to answer important clinical questions arising from the presence of MRSA bacteriuria in long-term care settings are outlined.
