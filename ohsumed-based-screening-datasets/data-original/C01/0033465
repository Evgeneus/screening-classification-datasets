Mycotic aneurysm of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery in a case of infective endocarditis.
 Mycotic aneurysms of the celiac artery are extremely rare, and in our review of the literature we found that in only one case was it due to infective endocarditis.
 In our case a 19-year-old female patient with culture-negative infective endocarditis presented with pain in the epigastric area.
 A celiac artery aneurysm was diagnosed by ultrasonography and confirmed on CT scan and angiography, which also demonstrated an associated aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery.
 Since excellent collateral circulation was present, simple ligation of the two aneurysms was performed.
 The patient presented no major complications in the postoperative course.
