O-specific side-chain toxin-protein conjugates as parenteral vaccines for the prevention of shigellosis and related diseases.
 Only indirect evidence has been cited to document that lipopolysaccharide-mediated virulence at the bacterial level and serum antibodies to the O-specific side chain of the lipopolysaccharide molecule may prevent shigellosis.
 Our proposed use of the B subunit of Shiga toxin as a carrier protein is based upon evidence (even more indirect) that serum antitoxin may reduce the severity of dysentery and diarrhea.
 Because animal models of disease may provide information inapplicable to the prediction of vaccine-induced protective immunity, we suggest that clinical trials in the population at risk should be started after successful completion of the safety and immunogenicity phases of vaccine development in laboratory animals and in the target population.
 Clinical studies of shigella vaccines are difficult because of the many causes of dysentery in a population with a high rate of intestinal disease.
