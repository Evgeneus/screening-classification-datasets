Intercontinental spread of a multiresistant clone of serotype 23F Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 Isolates of serotype 23F Streptococcus pneumoniae with high levels of resistance of penicillin have been commonly recovered in Spain for more than a decade.
 Recently penicillin-resistant serotype 23F S.
 pneumoniae strains were also isolated from children attending a day-care center in Cleveland.
 A number of Spanish and Cleveland isolates were compared by electrophoretic analysis of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) profiles and DNA restriction endonuclease cleavage profiles of the PBP 2X and 2B genes amplified with the polymerase chain reaction and by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis.
 All strains were identical by these criteria.
 The findings demonstrate that the Spanish and Cleveland isolates are clonally related and suggest that this antibiotic resistant clone of serotype 23F S.
 pneumoniae has spread intercontinentally from Spain to the United States.
