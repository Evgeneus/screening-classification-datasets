Invasive aspergillosis in patients with HIV infection: report of two patients and a review of the literature.
 Two cases of invasive aspergillosis in AIDS patients are reported and previously reported AIDS-related cases are reviewed.
 Only one-half of all cases were diagnosed antemortem.
 Outcome is poor despite antifungal and surgical therapy.
 Normal phagocytic function is important in host defense against Aspergillus species.
 HIV-infected patients may have impaired phagocytic function as a result of antiretroviral therapy or treatment of opportunistic infection, or due to HIV infection itself.
 As the lifespans of HIV-infected patients are extended by antiretroviral therapy, an increasing awareness of Aspergillus infection as an opportunistic pathogen will be necessary.
