Treatment of organic impotence.
 A review of 86 patients referred to a urological clinic with impotence showed that in 58% the causation was predominantly psychogenic.
 These patients were managed with psychosexual counselling.
 The various treatment options were discussed with those patients with organic impotence and 14 underwent the implantation of a penile prosthesis.
 A review of 130 patients who received penile prostheses in the period 1983 to 1987 was carried out to compare the complications and results obtained with the various types of prosthesis.
 The overall satisfaction rate was 81%; dissatisfaction usually arose as a result of complications of surgery.
 These were highest in patients with diabetes and priapism.
 The complications were also related to the type of prosthesis used.
