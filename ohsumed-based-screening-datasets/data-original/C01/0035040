Role of candida in pathogenesis of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in elderly inpatients 
 The part that candida plays in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea was investigated in 24 elderly inpatients (mean age 74 years) who tested negative for Clostridium difficile toxin and other intestinal pathogens.
 7 had intestinal overgrowth of Candida species (greater than or equal to 10(5) cfu/ml).
 None of the 24 matched, antibiotic-treated controls without diarrhoea had candida overgrowth.
 All 5 patients with diarrhoea and candida overgrowth treated with oral nystatin responded with resolution of diarrhoea and lowering of faecal counts to less than 10(4) cfu/ml within 7 days of start of antifungal therapy despite continuation of antibacterial therapy.
 In the other 2 patients with candida overgrowth, the diarrhoea subsided spontaneously and faecal candida counts returned to normal (less than 10(4) cfu/ml) after antibacterial agents were withdrawn.
 In patients without candida overgrowth, diarrhoea persisted until antibiotics were withdrawn, at a mean of 16 days after study entry.
