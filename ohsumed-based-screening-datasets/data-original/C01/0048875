Hepatotoxicity of rifampin and isoniazid. Is it all drug-induced hepatitis?
 Serologic markers for hepatitis viruses were studied in 40 children who developed acute hepatitis during antituberculosis therapy with rifampin and isoniazid, with the aim of assessing the contributory role of these viruses toward producing hepatic injury.
 Hepatitis A and B were confirmed in 7.5 and 35% patients, respectively, by IgM antibodies.
 Epidemiologic evidence suggested the possibility of non-A, non-B hepatitis in at least a few of the remaining 23 children.
 Hepatitis B was seen more often in children with severe tubercular disease (72%) and was largely (92.8%) parenterally transmitted.
 The study highlights that the endemicity of viral hepatitis in developing countries, among other factors, could also be responsible for the reported higher incidence of hepatotoxicity from developing countries and also for the increased risk of hepatotoxicity seen in severe tubercular disease.
