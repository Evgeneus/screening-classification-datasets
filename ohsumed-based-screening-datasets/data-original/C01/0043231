Mycoplasma pneumoniae as the causative agent for pneumonia in the immunocompromised host.
 A young man undergoing chemotherapy for Ewing's sarcoma presented with fever, neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and a new infiltrate on the chest roentgenogram.
 Routine cultures and cytopathologic examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid provided no evidence for an etiology; however, special cultures of the BAL fluid demonstrated heavy growth of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
 We recommend that evaluation of pneumonia in the immuno-compromised host include appropriate cultures of BAL fluid for M pneumoniae, particularly when the patient is 5 to 25 years old, the age of high incidence of mycoplasmal pneumonia.
