Pneumocystis carinii infection presenting as necrotizing thyroiditis and hypothyroidism.
 Extrapulmonary Pneumocystis infection has been increasingly reported in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), in particular, recently in association with the increasing use of aerosolized pentamidine.
 This report describes the unusual presentation of extrapulmonary Pneumocystis infection as a thyroid neck mass and clinical hypothyroidism in a 37-year-old man with hemophilia and AIDS.
 This case differs from the previously reported single case of isolated thyroid pneumocystosis in the presence of a rapidly enlarging neck mass, lack of previous Pneumocystis, and prior prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine.
 The pathologic and electron microscopic description of the peculiar flocculent necrotic thyroid material is contrasted with typical pulmonary alveolar findings in Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), the differential diagnoses of a rapidly expanding neck mass, and diagnostic difficulties of hypothyroidism in patients with AIDS are discussed.
 Finally, it is emphasized that use of aerosolized pentamidine, although successful for prevention of pulmonary PCP, may be insufficient to prevent extrapulmonary infection.
