The Nairobi STD program. An international partnership.
 Since 1980, Canadian, Belgian, and American scientists have been working together with colleagues in Kenya to understand the epidemiology and biology of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in Africa.
 The rapid spread of human immunodeficiency virus has dramatically increased the importance of this information.
 Interventions to slow the spread of all STDs and to reduce their consequences are now our major priority.
 However, this will require continuing research, ongoing training of scientists, epidemiologists, and technologists, and increasing financial support from industrialized societies.
