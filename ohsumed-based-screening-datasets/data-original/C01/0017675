Local infectious complications following large joint replacement in rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with methotrexate versus those not treated with methotrexate.
 We performed a 10-year retrospective analysis of the frequency of local postoperative infectious complications in methotrexate (MTX)-treated rheumatoid arthritis patients who underwent total joint arthroplasty.
 Sixty patients, who had a total of 92 joint arthroplasties, were receiving MTX.
 A comparison group of 61 patients with a combined total of 110 total joint arthroplasties were not receiving MTX.
 The 2 groups were compared for the occurrence of local postoperative infectious complications and poor wound healing.
 Eight patients in the MTX group experienced a total of 8 complications (8.7% of procedures).
 In comparison, 5 patients in the non-MTX group experienced a total of 6 complications (5.5% of procedures), a difference that was not statistically significant (chi 2 = 0.816, P = 0.366).
 Statistical analysis of many other variables revealed none that could be identified as risk factors for postoperative complications.
 These results suggest that treatment in the perioperative period with weekly low-dose pulse MTX does not increase the risk of local postoperative infectious complications or poor wound healing in rheumatoid arthritis patients who undergo total joint arthroplasty.
