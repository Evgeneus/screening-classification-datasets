Antimicrobial prophylaxis in coronary bypass surgery: a critical appraisal.
 The literature has been examined to assess the optimal prophylactic antimicrobial regimen for patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery.
 Antimicrobial surgical prophylaxis should be based on the two main potential pathogens, Staphylococcus epidermidis and S.
 aureus.
 It is unclear whether the prophylactic use of antimicrobials can or should be guided by in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility testing; data from well-performed clinical trials should be evaluated.
 The data fail to demonstrate consistently a significant difference within the cephalosporin class of antimicrobials with regard to prevention of infectious complications.
 Although it does not reach statistical difference, the trend with respect to efficacy appears to be cefuroxime, then cefamandole, and then cefazolin.
 The lack of significant difference among antimicrobials suggests an institution-individualized approach to the selection of the optimal antimicrobial for prophylaxis.
 For our facilities we recommend the following regimen: cefazolin sodium 1-2 g iv q8h for two days.
 There are not enough data at this time to recommend less than two days of antimicrobial prophylaxis for this type of surgery.
 In addition, aminoglycosides provide no added benefit when added to cephalosporins.
