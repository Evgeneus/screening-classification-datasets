Bilateral emphysematous pyelonephritis.
 Emphysematous pyelonephritis is an uncommon and serious infection associated with gas-forming coliform bacteria.
 Bilateral involvement is rare with only 10 reported cases in the English literature.
 Prompt and aggressive management is required to salvage these patients.
 Preservation of renal function using broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical drainage provide the greatest benefit to these patients.
 Three new cases are presented with a brief review of the results of management in the reported cases.
