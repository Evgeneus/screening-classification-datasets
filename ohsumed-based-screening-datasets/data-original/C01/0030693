Diagnostic efficiency of an ultrarapid endoscopy room test for Helicobacter pylori.
 There are several reliable methods for detecting Helicobacter pylori but all have as a major disadvantage the time required to yield a definitive result.
 We have modified the standard urease test so that a positive result is available in one minute.
 We describe the use of this test in biopsy specimens from the gastric antrum from 220 consecutive patients referred for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
 The performance of the 'one minute test' was compared with a standard urease test, Gram stain, and microbiological culture.
 Using culture as the 'gold standard' 80 (36%) of the patients were H pylori positive.
 The one minute test produced no false positives and showed a sensitivity of 89% and specificity of 100%, while the predictive values of a positive and negative test were 100% and 94% respectively.
 The diagnostic efficiency of the test was 96% compared to 85% for both the Gram stain and direct urease test.
 All positive results using the one minute test were available within one minute.
 The test is easy to prepare and costs approximately pounds 0.04.
 This new modification of the urease test should be superior to the currently available urease tests because a reliable result will be available in almost 90% of infected individuals even before endoscopy is completed.
