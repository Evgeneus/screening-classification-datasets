Epitopes of group A streptococcal M protein shared with antigens of articular cartilage and synovium.
 Rabbit antisera evoked by purified pepsin-extracted group A streptococcal M proteins were screened for the presence of joint cross-reactive antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence using thin sections of mouse knee joints.
 Pep M1, M5, and M18 antisera contained antibodies that cross-reacted with chondrocytes, cartilage, and synovium.
 Immunofluorescence inhibition assays showed that some of the joint cross-reactive epitopes were shared among the three heterologous serotypes of M protein.
 The pep M5 joint cross-reactive epitopes were localized to three different synthetic peptides of the C-terminal region of pep M5.
 Immunoblot analyses showed that the M5 joint cross-reactive antibodies recognized two proteins of human synovium and cartilage of molecular mass 56 and 58 kDa.
 The cross-reactive antibodies binding to the 56-kDa protein were inhibited by purified vimentin in immunoblot inhibition experiments.
 M protein-specific antibodies from patients with acute rheumatic fever were also shown to cross-react with joint tissue in a pattern similar to the rabbit antisera.
 Rabbit and human M protein-specific antibodies that were bound to articular cartilage activated significant levels of complement when compared to control serum, suggesting that M protein joint cross-reactive antibodies could potentially be involved in the pathogenesis of ARF and arthritis.
