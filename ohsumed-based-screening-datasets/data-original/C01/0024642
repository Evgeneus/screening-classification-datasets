First-exposure adaptive resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in vivo with meaning for optimal clinical use.
 The first exposure of gram-negative bacilli to an aminoglycoside antibiotic in vitro induces a biphasic bactericidal response and adaptive drug resistance (G.

 The therapeutic implications were examined in netilmicin treatment of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection of normal and neutropenic mice.
 For 2 h after the first dose, the bactericidal rates were rapid, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.5 log10 CFU/h with doses of 10, 30, and 60 mg/kg, respectively.
 Each twofold increase in dosage reduced the number of surviving bacteria fivefold.
 Between 2 and 6 h, the second-phase bactericidal rate was slow, less than or equal to 0.3 log10 CFU/h, regardless of the dose.
 In a multiple-dose regimen, the same amount of netilmicin given in one dose was 70 and 90% more effective than two or three doses, respectively.
 Doses calculated to keep the drug level in plasma above the MIC were less effective than regimens giving first exposure to a high drug concentration.
 Adaptive resistance occurred when doses were given more than 2 h after the start of treatment.
 Temporary survival of bacteremic neutropenic mice was 60 to 70% greater with a second dose at 2 h than after a longer interval.
 In a thigh infection of neutropenic mice treated every 2 h, doses 4, 6, and 8 h after the first one showed no bactericidal effect.
