Neonatal osteomyelitis.
 Thirty-four neonates with osteomyelitis were reviewed.
 The hip (19) was the most common site involved.
 Swelling and pseudoparalysis were the most significant local signs.
 Radiographic abnormalities, such as metaphyseal rarefaction and/or joint subluxation were found on the initial radiographs in 18 of the 19 hips involved.
 All patients were treated with antibiotics and all infections involving joints were drained surgically.
 Good results were achieved in 75% of all sites and in 68% of hips.
