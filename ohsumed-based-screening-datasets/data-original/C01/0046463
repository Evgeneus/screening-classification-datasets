Enhanced immunoglobulin levels correlate with infectious complications after surgery in esophageal cancer.
 Severe septic complications account for the high mortality of patients with esophageal cancer.
 We examined the levels of immunoglobulins and complements together with infection-related complications in a large number of patients.
 Enhancements of IgG, IgA, C3, C4, and CH50 were evident in patients with esophageal cancer and were more predominant compared to findings in cases of gastric cancer.
 Average levels of IgG and IgA immediately before surgery were significantly higher in esophageal cancer patients with postoperative septic complications than in those without such problems.
 Preoperative radiation therapy and total parenteral nutrition did not significantly alter the levels of immunoglobulins and complements.
 It would thus appear that the enhancement of IgG and IgA is associated with the occurrence of infectious complications following surgery for patients with esophageal cancer.
