Reactional states in Hansen's disease: practical aspects of emergency management.
 Hansen's disease (leprosy), though not a common condition in the United States, can be found in some localities among patients who come to the emergency room for treatment.
 Hansen's disease (HD) is a chronic systemic infectious granulomatous disease involving principally the skin, mucosa, nerves, and eyes.
 The causative organism, Mycobacterium leprae, is neither highly contagious nor aggressive, but rapid alterations in the immunologic response to M leprae in affected tissues can result in acute exacerbations termed "reactions." Since most of the symptoms and morbidity in HD are a consequence of these reactional states, they must be recognized and treated early to prevent permanent sequelae, especially neurologic and ophthalmologic.
 Drug therapy, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery all play a role in minimizing the injury caused by reactions.
