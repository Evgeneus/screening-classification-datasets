Neutrophil chemotactic factors in synovial fluids of patients with Lyme disease.
 We examined synovial fluid samples from 14 patients with Lyme arthritis for the presence of neutrophil chemotactic factors.
 Thirteen of the synovial fluids stimulated chemotaxis of normal human neutrophils.
 The chemotactic activity was heat-sensitive and was not inhibited by antibody to C5a or antibody to interleukin-8, or by a competitive inhibitor of the chemotactic peptide f-Met-Leu-Phe.
 A culture supernatant of Borrelia burgdorferi also contained neutrophil chemoattractants.
 Chromatography demonstrated that the chemoattractants in the synovial fluid samples were different from those in the B burgdorferi culture supernatant.
 One of the major chemotactic factors in Lyme disease synovial fluid had a calculated molecular weight of 13,900.
 We conclude that a novel, host-derived chemoattractant is present in the synovial fluid of patients with Lyme disease.
