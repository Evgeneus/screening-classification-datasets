Endoscopy in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection.
 Two cases of mycobacterium avium-intracellulare (MAI) infection in association with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are presented to highlight the distinctive upper gastrointestinal endoscopic appearances: 2 X 4 mm diameter, white nodules with intervening erythema and hemorrhagic erosions covered the mucosa of the second part of the duodenum.
 Histological evaluation of these nodules revealed diffuse expansion of the lamina propria by macrophages that contained numerous intracellular and extracellular acid-fast organisms.
 We conclude that endoscopy with endoscopic biopsy may represent the most rapid and sensitive diagnostic tool available in this disease.
