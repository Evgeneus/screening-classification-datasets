HIV-1 and pregnant women: associated factors, prevalence, estimate of incidence and role in fetal wastage in central Africa.
 The major goals of this study were to measure the current prevalence and estimate the annual incidence of HIV-1 infection in young pregnant women from urban Malawi, to identify factors that were associated with HIV-1 infection, and to examine adverse pregnancy outcomes.
 Four hundred and sixty-one consecutive pregnant women were studied when they presented for prenatal care.
 The overall seroprevalence for HIV-1 infection in these urban populations was 17.6% (81 out of 461) during early 1989.
 Based on previous seroprevalence in similar unselected pregnant women, the estimated annual incidence of HIV-1 seroconversion in urban pregnant women ranged from 3 to 4% per annum between 1985 and 1987 and from 7 to 13% between 1987 and 1989.
 HIV-1 infection was significantly associated with reactive syphilis serology.
 Reported history of sexually transmitted disease was also correlated with HIV-1 infection but was not statistically significant.
 Other variables, such as history of transfusion, history of tuberculosis, parity or occupation were not associated with HIV-1 infection.
 History of spontaneous abortion was significantly associated with reactive syphilis serology, HIV-1 infection and history of sexually transmitted disease.
 In logistic regression analysis, HIV-1 infection remained the only significant variable that was correlated with spontaneous abortion.
 This study suggests that HIV-1 infection may play a role in fetal wastage.
