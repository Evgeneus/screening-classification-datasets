Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections of the skin. Report of fourteen cases and review of the literature.
 This study comprised 14 patients from whose skin nontuberculous mycobacteria were recovered.
 Most clinical manifestations were relatively nonspecific.
 Various histopathologic patterns were observed in 22 biopsy specimens.
 Recurrences were common and prolonged treatment was often necessary.
 Culture of tissue remains the definitive diagnostic procedure.
 Cutaneous lesions can be the first or only site of nontuberculous mycobacteriosis.
