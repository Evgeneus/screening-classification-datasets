Diagnosis and treatment of prostatic infections.
 The diagnosis and management of prostatitis and pelviperineal pain is a challenge to the clinician.
 Careful examination of the prostatic fluid and bacteriologic cultures to differentiate bacterial from nonbacterial prostatitis are essential.
 Antimicrobial therapy is effective in the majority of men with acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis.
 Nonbacterial prostatitis is the most common type of prostatitis.
 The etiology is unknown and treatment with repeated antimicrobial therapy is ineffective.
 Alpha-blocking agents may relieve symptomatology.
 Pelviperineal pain may be of prostatic origin but other nonprostatic causes should be sought.
