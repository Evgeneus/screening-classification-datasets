Lyme disease.
 The rapid rate of increase in reported cases of Lyme disease exceeds that of any zoonotic disease, and the annual occurrence of cases is greater than the sum of all other tick-borne illnesses in the United States.
 This, in addition to the geographic spread of cases to most of the United States, has greatly heightened investigative interests in all aspects of Lyme disease and its control.
