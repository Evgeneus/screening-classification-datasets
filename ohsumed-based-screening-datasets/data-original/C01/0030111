Efficacy and duration of antistaphylococcal activity comparing three antibiotics bonded to Dacron vascular grafts with a collagen release system.
 Type 1 collagen, minimally cross-linked, was used to bind one of three antibiotics (amikacin, chloramphenicol, or rifampin) to double-velour Dacron grafts to develop a prosthesis resistant to infection.
 Six millimeter disks of graft were placed in separate flasks (specific for each antibiotic) containing albumin in saline and continuously agitated.
 At daily intervals the solution was changed, and paired graft samples were removed and placed on a blood agar plate confluently streaked with bacteria.
 The initial zone of inhibition (centimeters squared), the time to 50% reduction of initial inhibition zone, and the overall duration of antibacterial activity were recorded on an exponential model.
 Grafts bonded with amikacin and chloramphenicol had an overall duration of activity of only 2 and 1 day, respectively, against Staphylococcus aureus.
 The collagen bonded rifampin grafts had an initial zone of 14.76 cm,2 took 3.92 days to reach 50% of initial inhibition, and had an overall duration of activity of 22.4 days.
 This was significantly better than grafts preclotted with 1.0 ml of rifampin (60 mg/ml) and 9 ml of blood (10.92 cm,2 1.06 days, and 5.6 days).
 When tested against a slime-producing Staphylococcus epidermidis (American Type Culture Collection No.
 35983), the graft bonded with rifampin had inhibitory activity of up to 27.77 days with a 50% of activity eluted at 4.78 days, significantly better than the preclotted rifampin graft without collagen bonding.
 These data suggest that rifampin bonded by collagen can protect a vascular graft against infection from S.
 aureus and S.
 epidermidis for up to 3 weeks after implantation.
