White piedra: evidence for a synergistic infection.
 To determine the relative roles of coryneform bacteria and Trichosporon beigelii in the pathogenesis of genital white piedra, scrotal hair from 10 subjects was studied.
 Hairs were examined by light microscopy to determine the relative proportions of each organism, and were also cultured for coryneforms and yeast.
 Histologically, hair nodules from five out of nine cases showed a mixture of yeasts and bacteria, four had bacteria alone, and none showed yeast alone.
 Five strains of T.
 beigelii were cultured, two strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and 22 strains of coryneforms.
 The isolates were tested for synergism by a plate-overlay method.
 Growth of coryneforms occurred over and around sections of the plate inoculated with T.
 beigelii but not around the control yeast, S.
 cerevisiae.
 There were strain differences in the stimulatory response of both T.
 beigelii and coryneform strains.
 In reverse experiments coryneforms did not enhance growth of T.
 beigelii.
 It was concluded that white piedra is a mixed infection caused by the synergistic action between T.
 beigelii and a specific coryneform bacteria resulting in invasion of the hair cuticle and cortex.
