Antisperm antibodies to sperm surface antigens in women with genital tract infection.
 Antisperm antibodies to sperm surface antigens in nulligravid women with primary upper genital tract infections were measured by the sperm mixed agglutination reaction assay.
 As many as 56% of women with a primary episode of pelvic inflammatory disease had antisperm antibodies.
 In addition, 69% of those women with no history of genital tract infection but with laparoscopic evidence of past pelvic infection had significant levels of circulating antisperm antibodies.
 Electroimmunoblots of sperm preparations probed with the sera of women who had either known or presumed upper genital tract infection revealed a uniformly recognized 69 kd antigen.
 In contrast, women with circulating antisperm antibodies before primary upper genital tract infection recognized up to five distinct sperm antigen determinants of 27, 54, 131, 146, and 174 kd.
 It is a distinct possibility that genital tract infections may lead to immunopotentiation of antisperm antibodies that could affect fertility.
