Plasma terminal complement complexes in acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis.
 In most instances of acute poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN), activation of the complement system occurs, as reflected by decreased levels of the complement proteins C3, C5, and properdin (P).
 Recent studies implicate terminal complement complexes (TCC) in the pathogenesis of glomerular injury.
 The fluid phase TCC, SC5b-9, reflects the formation of membrane-bound C5b-9 and has been used as a clinical marker in various diseases.
 Plasma concentrations of SC5b-9 were measured with an enzyme immunoassay using a monoclonal antibody to a neoantigen expressed on the SC5b-9 complex in 13 children who presented with clinical and pathologic features of APSGN.
 SC5b-9 was significantly elevated in all plasmas obtained within 30 days after onset of clinical glomerulonephritis.
 Concentrations of SC5b-9 in acute plasmas were significantly higher than those of paired convalescent samples.
 For individual patients, as SC5b-9 concentration returned to normal there was a coincident decrease in serum creatinine concentration and urinary protein excretion, signifying clinical improvement in glomerulonephritis.
 Thus, TCC generation commonly occurs in the early stages of APSGN and may be of importance in the pathogenesis of the condition.
