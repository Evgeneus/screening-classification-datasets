Septic metastatic lesions of pyogenic liver abscess. Their association with Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia in diabetic patients.
 Septic metastatic endophthalmitis from Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess, first reported in seven cases treated at the Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, between 1981 and 1985, was seen in six similar cases at the same hospital in the subsequent 2 years.
 We conducted a retrospective search for factors that might be associated with these complications of pyogenic liver abscess.
 A total of 23 cases with septic metastatic lesions from pyogenic liver abscess were found between 1981 and 1987, and 164 cases of pyogenic liver abscess without septic metastatic lesions were identified as a comparison group.
 Klebsiella pneumoniae liver abscess, bacteremia, and the underlying diabetes mellitus were significantly more common in the study group than in the comparison group.
 Of the 23 patients with septic metastatic lesions, there were 14 cases (60.8%) of endophthalmitis or uveitis, 10 cases (43.4%) of pulmonary abscess and/or emboli, six cases (26.0%) of brain abscess and/or purulent meningitis, five cases (21.7%) of bacteriuria and/or prostate abscess, two cases (8.6%) of osteomyelitis and/or pyogenic arthritis, and one case (4.3%) of psoas abscess.
