Diagnosis of pneumonia by cultures, bacterial and viral antigen detection tests, and serology with special reference to antibodies against pneumococcal antigens.
 In a prospective study of the etiology of pneumonia 196 adult patients were included.
 One of the following criteria was required for diagnosis of pneumococcal pneumonia: isolation of pneumococci from blood; isolation from transtracheal aspirate; isolation from sputum or nasopharynx or detection of capsular antigen in sputum in combination with a significant increase in antibodies against at least one pneumococcal antigen (type-specific capsular polysaccharide, C-polysaccharide, pneumolysin); or increase in antibodies against two pneumococcal antigens.
 Pneumococcal pneumonia was diagnosed in 63 patients (32%).
 Other diagnoses were nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae isolated from transtracheal aspirates, 9; Mycoplasma pneumoniae diagnosed by serology, 17; Chlamydia psittaci, 6; and viral infections, 42.
 Twenty-two patients (11%) had evidence of infection with more than one agent.
 The pathogen could not be determined in 70 (36%).
 Many patients were given antibiotics before admittance to the study, and in some cases a convalescent serum sample was not available.
