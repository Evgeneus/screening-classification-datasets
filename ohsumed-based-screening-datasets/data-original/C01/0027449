Differing activities of quinolones against ciprofloxacin-susceptible and ciprofloxacin-resistant, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
 The in vitro activities of nine quinolones (seven fluoroquinolones, nalidixic acid, and acrosoxacin) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were compared with those of the glycopeptides teicoplanin and vancomycin.
 MICs against 160 strains of ciprofloxacin-susceptible (MIC, less than 2.0 micrograms/ml) MRSA and 40 strains of ciprofloxacin-resistant (MIC, greater than or equal to 2.0 micrograms/ml) MRSA were determined.
 The following MICs for 50% of the strains tested (in micrograms per milliliter) were obtained for ciprofloxacin-susceptible and -resistant strains, respectively: tosufloxacin, 0.06 and 2.0; ofloxacin, 0.25 and 16; ciprofloxacin, 0.5 and 16; pefloxacin, 0.5 and 32; acrosoxacin, 1.0 and greater than 256; enoxacin, 1.0 and 64; fleroxacin, 1.0 and 32; norfloxacin, 2.0 and 64; nalidixic acid, 64 and 512; teicoplanin, 1.0 and 1.0; vancomycin, 2.0 and 2.0.
 In mutation rate studies using a range of antibiotic concentrations to reflect those achievable in vivo, resistant mutants grew only on plates containing nalidixic acid (rate of mutation to resistance, 10(-7) to 10(-8) and on plates containing low concentrations of ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin (rate of mutation to resistance, 10(-8) to 10(-9).
 In time-kill studies, 99.9% killing was found within 8 h for all of the quinolones tested (norfloxacin and nalidixic acid were not tested).
 Teicoplanin and vancomycin were less rapidly bactericidal.
 For the clinical isolates of ciprofloxacin-resistant MRSA, different levels and patterns of quinolone resistance were found.
 Generally, cross-resistance among the fluoroquinolones was complete; however, incomplete cross-resistance did occur with the nonfluorinated quinolone acrosoxacin.
