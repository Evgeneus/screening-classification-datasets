Abdominal CT findings after liver transplantation in 66 patients.
 CT scanning is used frequently to assess the condition of patients after liver transplantation.
 The CT records of 174 adult patients who underwent liver transplantation were studied retrospectively to determine the number and timing of CT studies as well as the frequency and significance of the findings.
 One-hundred seventy CT scans were obtained in 66 (38%) of the 174 patients, with a mean of 2.6 scans/patient.
 The interval between transplantation and scanning was 1 day to 24 months; in 59 (89%) of 66 patients, the first CT scan was obtained within 30 days.
 The acute indications for CT scanning were fever or leukocytosis in 54 (92%) of 59 patients and abnormal liver function tests in five (8%) of 59 patients.
 CT scans obtained more than 30 days after transplantation were repeat scans in all but seven patients.
 Indications in this latter group were the same as for the acute group, plus evaluation of hepatic neoplasia in three patients.
 CT findings included periportal low attenuation in 41 (62%) of 66 patients; ascites in 25 (38%); splenomegaly in 19 (29%); loculated intraperitoneal noninfected fluid collections in 13 (20%); intrahepatic, splenic, pancreatic, or perihepatic abscesses in seven (11%); hepatic infarction in six (9%); splenic infarction in three (4%); and hepatic calcification in two (3%).
 Other major abnormalities included inferior vena caval thrombosis (one patient), pseudoaneurysm of the hepatic artery with rupture (one patient), and recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (one patient).
 CT scanning after liver transplantation is used predominantly in the acute setting to evaluate for liver infarction or intraabdominal abscess.
 In this setting, CT showed these abnormalities, in addition to tumor recurrence or vascular abnormalities, in 15 (23%) of 66 patients.
