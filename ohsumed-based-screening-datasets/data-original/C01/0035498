Cranioplasty, vertebral body replacement, and spinal fusion with tobramycin-impregnated methylmethacrylate.
 A prospective analysis of cranioplasty, vertebral body replacement, and spinal fusion using tobramycin-impregnated methylmethacrylate in 65 patients is presented.
 Cranioplastic methacrylate (1 packet) was mixed with 1.2 g of powdered tobramycin and placed into the desired location.
 The polymer was irrigated with bacitracin until it became solid.
 All patients received prophylactic medication with intravenously administered nafcillin and cephalosporin perioperatively and for 48 hours postoperatively.
 The follow-up time ranged from 7 to 57 months (mean, 32.2 months).
 Serum tobramycin levels remained below 0.5 microgram/ml in all patients tested, regardless of the time interval.
 Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels remained within normal limits in all patients, and there has been no nephrotoxicity or ototoxicity.
 There has been 1 infection among the 65 patients (1%) to date.
 It occurred in a patient who had a previously treated local infection.
 Cranioplasty, vertebral body replacement, or spinal fusion with tobramycin-impregnated methylmethacrylate is safe and may reduce the incidence of infection.
