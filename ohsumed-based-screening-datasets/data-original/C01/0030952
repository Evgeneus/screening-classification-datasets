Corneal ulcer caused by Pseudomonas pseudomallei: report of three cases.
 We report three cases of corneal ulcer caused by Pseudomonas pseudomallei.
 In all cases corneal trauma preceded the development of extensive ulcers, subconjunctival abscesses, and hypopyon.
 Treatment for a total of 8 weeks with topical and/or parenteral ceftazidime followed by amoxicillin-clavulanic acid produced resolution of infection in each case.
