Esophageal tuberculosis: a rare presentation with hematemesis.
 Esophageal tuberculosis is rare, with only 26 cases previously reported in the literature.
 Patients usually present with progressive dysphagia or odynophagia.
 We report a patient with hematemesis that was later attributed to the erosion of tuberculous subcarinal lymph nodes into the esophagus.
 This presentation has been described in only two other patients, both of whom died of exsanguinating hemorrhage.
 The successful outcome in the present case rested on the availability of rapid diagnostic modalities and timely surgical intervention.
