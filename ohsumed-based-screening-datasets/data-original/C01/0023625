Infectious keratitis and cyanoacrylate adhesive.
 We studied three patients with infectious keratitis that occurred after cyanoacrylate gluing despite prophylactic antibiotic therapy.
 Two patients developed culture-positive bacterial ulcers, one caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and the other by Haemophilus influenzae.
 The third patient developed a fungal keratitis.
 Two patients required penetrating keratoplasty.
 Each infection and perforation was concealed by the opaqueness of the glue.
 The pain of the infectious ulcers may have been obscured by the ocular surface irritation and drying induced by glue.
 Tissue toxicity, microbial colonization, use of bandage lenses, and long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics may precipitate glue-related corneal infections.
 Masking of underlying infection and the development of resistant organisms should be considered when using this mode of therapy.
