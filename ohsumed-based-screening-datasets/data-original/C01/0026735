Dietary fat and infection in burned animals.
 Dietary lipids can influence the immune response, chiefly through modulation of eicosanoid synthesis.
 Previous studies showed that diets high in linoleic or oleic acid significantly improved survival rates, compared with diets high in either saturated fats or omega-3 fatty acids, when fed to mice for 2 to 3 weeks before burn injury.
 These experiments suggest that neutrophil function in rats is not altered by diets high in either fish or safflower oil before burn injury.
 Serum opsonization is marginally improved by safflower oil diets for 2 weeks before burn injury but not for 6 weeks before burn injury.
