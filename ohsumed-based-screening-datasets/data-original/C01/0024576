HIV infection in an Ethiopian prison.
 HIV-1 antibody was detected in 6.0 percent of prisoners in an Ethiopian prison.
 HIV-1 seropositivity was strongly associated with positive VDRL status (RR = 3.7) and recent admission to prison (RR = 3.5).
 Seropositive prisoners were more likely to have prostitute contacts.
 No correlation was found between seropositivity and number of sexual contacts, long-term sex partners, or dental extractions.
 HIV-1 infection in this area may be of recent origin and the high prevalence may reflect rates in the surrounding community.
