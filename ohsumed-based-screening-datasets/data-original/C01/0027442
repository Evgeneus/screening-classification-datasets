Comparison of fluconazole and amphotericin B for treatment of disseminated candidiasis and endophthalmitis in rabbits.
 We compared the efficacy of intravenous fluconazole (80 mg/kg of body weight per day) with that of amphotericin B (1 mg/kg/day) for the long-term treatment of endophthalmitis in rabbits with disseminated candidiasis.
 After 17 days of therapy, fluconazole decreased the fungal colony counts of the choroid-retinas significantly more than did the saline control (P less than 0.05); however, after 24 days of fluconazole therapy, this treatment effect was lost and fluconazole was no more effective than saline.
 In contrast, treatment for 24 days with amphotericin B reduced the vitreous and choroid-retina fungal colony counts significantly more than either fluconazole or saline (P less than 0.05 for both treatment groups).
 After 17 days of therapy, indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed less severe eye involvement in both antifungal treatment groups than in saline controls; however, this difference reached statistical significance only for the amphotericin B-treated rabbits (P less than 0.05).
 Also, there was a trend towards worsening eye lesions, as seen by indirect ophthalmoscopy, in the fluconazole-treated rabbits after 24 days of therapy, which roughly paralleled the quantitative culture results.
 Despite the presence of negative choroid-retina cultures, some rabbits in all treatment groups had persistently visible eye lesions, indicating that ophthalmoscopic resolution of Candida endophthalmitis may lag behind lesion sterilization.
 Amphotericin B was superior to fluconazole in the treatment of Candida endophthalmitis in this model.
