Fluconazole: a new triazole antifungal agent.
 Fluconazole is a recently approved agent for the treatment of certain fungal infections.
 Based on available studies, the drug is clearly effective in oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunosuppressed hosts.
 Current evidence suggests it may be more efficacious than other azole drugs for oropharyngeal disease.
 It is probably also effective in other infections due to Candida species, but controlled studies are lacking.
 Fluconazole is also efficacious in the treatment of cryptococcal meningitis, but recent reports question its use as initial therapy in HIV-infected patients with this illness.
 The drug, however, is clearly more effective than amphotericin B in the suppression of cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS patients and is the treatment of choice in this situation.
