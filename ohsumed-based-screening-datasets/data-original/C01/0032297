Pseudomembranous tracheobronchitis caused by Aspergillus.
 Four immunosuppressed patients with a rapidly evolving, febrile, respiratory distress syndrome were found at autopsy to have Aspergillus pseudomembranes of their lower tracheobronchial tree.
 Steroids, neutropenia, broad spectrum antibiotic use, and alcoholism appear to be predisposing risk factors.
 Bronchoscopy may reveal the pathology but antemortem diagnosis is difficult because of the low yield of sputum cultures and fulminant nature of the disease.
