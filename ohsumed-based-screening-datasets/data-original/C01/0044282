Cutaneous Histoplasma capsulatum in a nonimmunocompromised patient with previously treated cutaneous Mycobacterium kansasii.
 This report describes a black woman with a history of cutaneous Mycobacterium kansasii responsive to antituberculous drugs.
 A culture several years later of cutaneous lesions was also positive for Histoplasma capsulatum.
 Both cutaneous diseases are rare and most often occur in immunocompromised hosts.
 There is no known association between these two diseases.
 This patient may have an as-yet unidentified immunodeficiency that predisposes her to these rare infections.
 Her case emphasizes the importance of repeat biopsy for atypical skin lesions.
