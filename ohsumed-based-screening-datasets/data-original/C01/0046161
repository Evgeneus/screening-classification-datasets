Prevalence of malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency in the Diourbel, Fatick, and Kaolack regions of Senegal: feasibility of the method of impression cytology with transfer.
 The evaluation of the prevalence of ophthalmological diseases and vitamin A deficiency in Senegalese preschool-aged children enabled us to confirm the method of impression cytology with transfer (ICT) and to assess the impact of ophthalmological diseases on the cytological appearance of conjunctival cells.
 A simplification of the ICT method consisted of transferring cells present on a strip of paper to a glass slide by finger pressure.
 Harris-Schorr staining of the sample papers confirmed the results obtained by the transfer.
 Inflammatory trachoma influenced the results of the test.
 This simple method will prove very helpful for detection of vitamin A deficiency in children in underdeveloped areas.
