Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal balanitis: it may be more common than you think.
 Group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus can cause balanitis in prepubertal males, and its incidence is probably greater than previously reported in the pediatric literature.
 We suggest the routine inclusion of a GABHS-selective culture in any case where a discharge or irritation is present on the glans or foreskin, especially if a recent streptococcal infection has been documented, whether or not sexual abuse is being considered.
 Finally, we hope to stimulate interest for further in-depth study of balanitis caused by GABHS.
