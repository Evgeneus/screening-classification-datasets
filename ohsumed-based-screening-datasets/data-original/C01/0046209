Anti-idiotype-induced, lipopolysaccharide-specific antibody response to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. II. Isotype and functional activity of the anti-idiotype-induced antibodies.
 We recently developed a murine anti-idiotypic mAb that functioned as a molecular mimic of the O-specific polysaccharide side chain (Ps) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa LPS in vitro, and which induced Ps-specific antibodies in syngeneic BALB/c ByJ mice.
 In the current studies, we demonstrate that these anti-Id-induced, Ps-specific antibodies fix complement to the bacterial cell surface, and protect neutropenic mice from fatal P.
 aeruginosa sepsis.
 The isotypic distribution of the anti-Id-induced antibodies, however, resembles the restricted pattern (IgM and IgG3) seen after administration of purified Ps to mice.
 The immunogenicity and number of isotypes of Ps-specific antibody produced could be enhanced by conjugating the anti-Id to keyhole limpet hemocyanin.
 Finally, the anti-Id administered before immunization with purified Ps, primed BALB/c ByJ mice for production of other Ps-specific antibody isotypes (IgG1).
 These studies show that this anti-Id induces functional anti-Ps antibodies in syngeneic mice, and when used in conjugate form or as a priming agent before Ps immunization, yields an antibody response consistent with "T cell dependence." These immunization strategies may be useful for the induction of polysaccharide-specific antibodies in man.
