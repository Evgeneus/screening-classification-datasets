Causes and clinical management of vertebral osteomyelitis in Saskatchewan.
 A retrospective review of all patients with vertebral osteomyelitis admitted to all Saskatchewan referral hospitals from 1973 to 1986 was undertaken to determine the incidence and clinical characteristics of the disease.
 There were 73 patients, an incidence of 5.3 cases/million per year.
 Erroneous initial diagnoses were common (41%).
 There was a significantly increased risk in patients older than 60 years.
 Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent organism.
 Mycobacterium tuberculosis was present in 29.5% and was more common in native Indian patients.
 Surgery was performed in 31% of all patients, and in 50% of those with tuberculous infections.
 The outcome was excellent in 92% of patients.
 Diabetes and transurethral resection of the prostate were risk factors for vertebral osteomyelitis.
