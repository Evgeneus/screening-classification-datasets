Child care options for ill children.
 Care of ill children who normally attend out-of-home child care programs poses a problem for many working parents, employers, and child care workers.
 Children cared for in child care centers have an increased incidence of illness and consequently their parents miss work more often compared with children cared for in other child care arrangements.
 Programs for the care of ill children are discussed to provide the practicing pediatrician with an understanding of the various programs currently or potentially available in the community.
 The paper ends with a discussion of the various solutions to enhance the economic gains of working parents while serving the need of children for nurturant care.
