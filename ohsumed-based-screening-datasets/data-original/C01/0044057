Actinomycosis in obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy and recurrent tonsillitis.
 A quantitative analysis of adenoid and tonsillar specimens from 460 patients was performed.
 The patients underwent tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy for either recurrent tonsillitis or obstructive tonsillar hypertrophy.
 Histologic preparations revealed Actinomycetes as statistically more prevalent in the obstructive population.
 The presence of Actinomycetes in the adenotonsillar core of this diagnostic group may indicate an etiologic role for this organism in tonsillar and adenoidal hypertrophy.
