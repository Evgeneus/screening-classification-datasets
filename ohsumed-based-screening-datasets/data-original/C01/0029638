Intraamniotic detection of Chlamydia trachomatis deoxyribonucleic acid sequences by polymerase chain reaction.
 The presence of Chlamydia trachomatis in cervicovaginal cells and amniotic fluid of pregnant women was examined by culture and by polymerase chain reaction deoxyribonucleic acid amplification methods.
 Chlamydial deoxyribonucleic acid sequences were found in nine of 31 (29.0%) cervicovaginal cell specimens, five of which also were positive by culture method.
 Amniotic fluid specimens from two of the nine (22.2%) cervicovaginal chlamydial deoxyribonucleic acid-positive women and none from the remaining 22 cervicovaginal chlamydial deoxyribonucleic acid-negative women were found to contain chlamydial deoxyribonucleic acid.
 The results underscore the significance and frequency of intraamniotic chlamydial infection in women with urogenital chlamydial infections.
