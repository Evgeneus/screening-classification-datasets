HIV infection: clinical features and treatment of thirty-three homosexual men with Kaposi's sarcoma.
 The clinical findings of patients with oral Kaposi's sarcoma are reviewed.
 These oral findings commonly included candidiasis, hairy leukoplakia, gingivitis associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), periodontitis, and other symptoms, including xerostomia.
 The other common symptoms of HIV disease that may be of importance in leading to a diagnosis are reviewed in this patient group.
 Treatment by local radiotherapy or by intralesional vinblastine of these oral Kaposi's sarcomas resulted in successful palliation, with more than 50% regression of the lesions in 80% of the patients treated.
