A meta-analysis of prophylactic antibiotics in head and neck surgery.
 Although it is generally agreed that prophylactic antibiotics are necessary for the prevention of postoperative wound infection, the choice of antibiotic regimen is controversial.
 In an attempt to determine the most effective antibiotic regimen, a meta-analysis of published clinical trials of prophylactic antibiotics for head and neck surgery was undertaken.
 The meta-analysis revealed a relative difference in infection rates of 43.7 percent in favor of the use of antibiotics versus placebo, of 8.3 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus a single antibiotic, of 13.7 percent in favor of multiple antibiotics versus cefazolin, and of 4.1 percent in favor of multiple-day prophylaxis versus single-day prophylaxis.
 This meta-analysis suggests that a 1-day course of clindamycin may be the most effective prophylactic antibiotic regimen for head and neck surgery.
