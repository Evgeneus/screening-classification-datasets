Nosocomial endophthalmitis survey. Current incidence of infection after intraocular surgery.
 The authors reviewed the incidence of hospital-linked postoperative endophthalmitis at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between January 1, 1984 and June 30, 1989.
 After 30,002 intraocular surgical procedures, the following incidence of culture-proven endophthalmitis was observed: (1) extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) with or without intraocular lens (IOL) implantation--0.072% (17 of 23,625 cases); (2) pars plana vitrectomy--0.051% (1 of 1974 cases); (3) penetrating keratoplasty (PKP)--0.11% (2 of 1783 cases); (4) secondary IOL--0.30% (3 of 988 cases); and (5) glaucoma filtering surgery--0.061% (1 of 1632 cases).
 A statistically significant (P = 0.038, Fisher's exact test, two-tailed) increased incidence of endophthalmitis occurred in diabetic (0.163%, 6 of 3686 cases) compared with nondiabetic (0.055%, 11 of 19,939 cases) patients undergoing ECCE with or without IOL implantation.
 The authors also reviewed the incidence of postoperative endophthalmitis after intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) with and without IOL and observed an incidence of 0.093% (7 of 7552) in cases operated on between September 1, 1976 and December 31, 1982.
