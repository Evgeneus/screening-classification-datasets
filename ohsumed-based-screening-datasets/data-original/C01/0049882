Blindness resulting from orbital complications of sinusitis.
 Loss of vision remains a potential complication of orbital infection.
 Appropriate evaluation and management of the patient with signs and symptoms of orbital inflammation may prevent progression to blindness.
 Evaluation of patients with orbital inflammation from sinusitis includes a comprehensive clinical examination and radiographic studies.
 Clinical examination should test for changes in visual acuity, pupillary reactivity, and extraocular motion.
 Computerized tomography (CT) has facilitated the diagnosis of orbital infections and aids in diagnosis.
 However, CT can be misleading in patients with acute orbital infections and should not be relied on to determine the need for surgical intervention.
 We reviewed the records of all patients admitted to Parkland Memorial Hospital from 1978 to 1988 with orbital complications resulting from sinusitis.
 Four of 159 patients in this group had permanent blindness.
 The presence of an abscess, which was ultimately found at surgical exploration, was not diagnosed by CT in any of these four patients.
 Clinical examination remains the most important indicator for surgical intervention in patients with orbital complications of sinusitis.
 We present our findings and give guidelines for surgical intervention in patients with orbital infections resulting from sinusitis.
