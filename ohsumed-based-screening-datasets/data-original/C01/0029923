Toxic shock syndrome after pilonidal cystectomy. Report of a case.
 Toxic shock syndrome is an uncommon disease associated with staphylococcal infections.
 Although most frequently reported in menstruating women and associated with tampon use, toxic shock syndrome has been described following many types of surgical procedures.
 In this report we describe a case of toxic shock syndrome occurring in a previously healthy young man after elective surgery for a pilonidal cyst.
