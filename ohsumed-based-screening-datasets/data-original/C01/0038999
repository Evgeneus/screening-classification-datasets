Severity of Helicobacter-induced gastric injury correlates with gastric juice ammonia.
 We postulated that ammonia produced by Helicobacter pylori may contribute to gastric mucosal injury.
 This hypothesis was evaluated in Helicobacter-positive patients with chronic renal failure in whom a high urea concentration might amplify this phenomenon.
 Gastric urea and ammonia were measured, and the severity of gastritis was evaluated by counting mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells.
 High gastric ammonia and low urea in Helicobacter-positive patients, and the converse in Helicobacter-negative subjects, were observed.
 There was a significant correlation between gastric ammonia and interstitial polymorphonuclear leukocytes infiltration (P less than 0.05), suggesting a causal link.
 Eradication of Helicobacter pylori was associated with a decrease of ammonia and an increase of urea (P less than 0.01).
 The significant correlation between the severity of gastric inflammation and the gastric juice ammonia concentration suggests that ammonia may play a pathogenic role in Helicobacter-associated gastric injury.
