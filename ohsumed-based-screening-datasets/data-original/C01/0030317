Peritonitis after cecal perforation. An experimental model to study the therapeutic role of antibiotics associated with allopurinol and catalase.
 This work uses cecal perforation on the rat as a model of intra-abdominal sepsis.
 Under these conditions, various antibiotics were tested alone or in association with free radical scavengers, such as allopurinol and catalase.
 It can be concluded that the scavengers were not effective alone, but when combined with antibiotics they rendered good results in the majority of the groups when given postsepsis.
 Further studies are needed to determine the real role of agents like the free radical scavengers in infectious situations such as the one discussed here.
