A randomized comparative study of the prophylactic use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus netilmycin-metronidazole in transrectal prostatic biopsy.
 An open randomized study was done to compare the prophylactic value of single doses of netilmycin-metronidazole versus trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in the prevention of postoperative infections associated with transrectal prostatic biopsy.
 Of 117 patients enrolled in the study 101 were evaluated and of these patients 47 received netilmycin-metronidazole and 54 received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.
 The bacteremia rate in the netilmycin-metronidazole group was 28% (13 of 47 patients) with a 95% confidence interval of 18 to 42% and in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group it was 37% (20 of 54) with a confidence interval of 26 to 50% (p = 0.43).
 None of the patients with bacteremia was symptomatic.
 Urinary tract infection rates were greater in the netilmycin-metronidazole group: 17% (8 of 47 patients) versus 2% (1 of 54) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group, p = 0.01.
 Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (cotrimoxazole) is a better choice as an antimicrobial prophylaxis for patients undergoing transrectal prostatic biopsy.
