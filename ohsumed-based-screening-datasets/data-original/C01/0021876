Computed tomography for evaluation of puerperal infections.
 Pelvic computed tomography was used to evaluate 74 women with persistent puerperal infection.
 There was at least one abnormal roentgenographic finding in 57, and these are correlated with clinical and surgical findings.
 In 16 women, a palpable pelvic mass was seen on tomography, however, masses not appreciated clinically were visualized in another 29 women, and in five, a clinically palpable mass was not visualized by tomography.
 In 12 women who had a normal pelvic examination, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis was diagnosed by tomography.
 Over-all, there was poor correlation with roentgenographic findings and uterine incisional necrosis and dehiscence.
 We conclude that pelvic tomography is useful to evaluate some women with persistent puerperal infection, but that these studies must be correlated with clinical findings.
