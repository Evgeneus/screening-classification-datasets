Risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia after coronary artery bypass graft operations 
 We attempted to determine risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia in patients undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft operation.
 We reviewed the microbiology and medical records for any patient with a sputum culture who had undergone a coronary artery bypass graft operation in 1988 to identify patients with pneumonia according to a standard clinical definition.
 We found 19 cases of pneumonia through our initial review; complete medical records were found on 15 cases.
 Gram-negative bacilli predominated as the most common etiologic agent causing pneumonia in this cohort.
 There were no clusters noted.
 Mortality was 26.6%.
 Pneumonia occurred approximately 4 days after the operation.
 Thirty-six controls were randomly selected from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft operations in 1988.
 Logistic regression analysis revealed that a history of chronic obstructive lung disease, duration of more than 2 days of mechanical ventilation after operation but before diagnosis of pneumonia, and receipt of gastric acid inhibitors (antacids or H2-blockers) were independent risk factors for nosocomial pneumonia.
 Only the last risk factor was amenable to intervention at the time of operation.
