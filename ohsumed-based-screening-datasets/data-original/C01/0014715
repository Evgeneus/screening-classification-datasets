Improved results with combined donor-specific transfusion (DST) and sequential therapy protocol.
 A combined DST-sequential CyA therapy protocol has been described that results in optimum graft survival for 1- and 2-haplotype mismatched living related donor-recipient combinations.
 In addition to the excellent graft survival obtained through 4 years, lower prednisone and CyA dosage levels are achieved with significantly decreased infection rates during the posttransplant period.
