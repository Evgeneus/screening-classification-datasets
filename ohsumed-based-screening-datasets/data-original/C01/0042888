Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria with onset in childhood and adolescence.
 BACKGROUND.
 Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is an acquired clonal hematologic disorder characterized by hemoglobinuria, thrombosis, infection, and a tendency toward bone marrow aplasia.
 Onset usually occurs in adulthood.
 Few children and adolescents with PNH have been described, and data on diagnosis, clinical course, and survival in young patients are unavailable.
 METHODS.
 We retrospectively reviewed clinical and laboratory data on all patients 21 years old or younger in whom PNH had been diagnosed at Duke University Medical Center from 1966 to 1991.
 RESULTS.
 Medical records and clinical follow-up data were available for 26 young patients.
 Although 50 percent of adult patients present with hemoglobinuria, only four of our patients (15 percent) presented with this feature.
 In contrast, 15 of our patients (58 percent) had moderate or severe bone marrow failure at presentation, as compared with about 25 percent of adults in cases from the literature; all 26 patients eventually had evidence of bone marrow dysfunction.
 Eight patients (31 percent) have died, with a median survival of 13.5 years since their initial symptoms.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Children and adolescents with PNH have a greater prevalence of bone marrow failure than do adults with this disorder, and their morbidity and mortality are high.
 Bone marrow transplantation should be considered for selected young patients with PNH.
