Coagulase-negative staphylococcal infection in the neonate.
 During the last decade, improved neonatal care has permitted the survival of extremely low birthweight infants who are at increased risk for the development of nosocomial infection.
 The coagulase-negative staphylococci currently represent the most frequent nosocomial pathogen isolated from infants in the newborn intensive care unit.
 This article details pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of neonatal infection with this organism.
