Evidence of activation of the protein C pathway during acute vascular damage induced by Mediterranean spotted fever.
 Mediterranean spotted fever (MSF) is a rickettsiosis that induces widespread microvascular injury.
 To obtain quantitative information on the in vivo activation and inactivation of the protein C system during the acute phase of endothelial damage, several components of the protein C pathway were studied in 28 MSF patients.
 Upon admission (day 1), patients showed clear evidence of endothelial damage as reflected by the significant decrease in the ratio VIII:C/vWF:Ag (0.36 +/- 0.14, mean +/- SD) compared with normals (0.98 +/- 0.14), and clinical and laboratory signs of hemostatic alterations such as decreased platelet count, positive fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products, and increased thrombin:antithrombin-III complex levels.
 Antigenic protein C (72% +/- 18%) and protein C inhibitor (PCI) (41% +/- 20%) were significantly decreased (P less than .001).
 Complexes of activated protein C (APC) with PCI or with alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha 1AT) and of plasma kallikrein with PCI (KK:PCI) were measured using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.
 APC:alpha 1AT complex levels were increased in patients at day 1 (27 +/- 13 ng/mL) compared with controls (7 +/- 2 ng/mL), and APC:PCI and KK:PCI complexes, which were not detectable in any of the controls, were present in 57% and 75% of the 28 MSF patients, with mean levels of 11 +/- 5 and 46 +/- 16 ng/mL, respectively.
 After remission of the disease (day 30), a trend toward normal values in the majority of the parameters studied was found.
 This study shows that, in the course of endothelial injury, MSF patients experience a generalized activation of the protein C pathway, resulting in consumption of protein C and PCI, and in the appearance of APC:inhibitor complexes.
 Moreover, these data provide the evidence that KK:PCI circulating complexes occur in vivo.
