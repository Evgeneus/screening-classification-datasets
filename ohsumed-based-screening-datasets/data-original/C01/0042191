Agrobacterium radiobacter peritonitis in two patients maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis.
 We report two patients with end-stage renal disease maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis who developed peritonitis in which the infecting organism was Agrobacterium radiobacter, normally a rare pathogen in humans.
 Both patients initially responded to antibiotics, but later relapsed and required catheter removal.
 Neither had been exposed to soil or plant material.
 A radiobacter is yet another of a growing list of unusual organisms that infect the peritoneal cavity of peritoneal dialysis patients.
