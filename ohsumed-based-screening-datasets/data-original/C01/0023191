Biochemical and genetic characterization of autoagglutinating phenotypes of Aeromonas species associated with invasive and noninvasive disease.
 The genetic characteristics and biochemical and structural properties of a number of autoagglutinating (AA) strains of Aeromonas associated with invasive and noninvasive disease in humans and infections in animals and from environmental sources were investigated.
 Of 27 strains analyzed by multilocus enzyme typing and DNA hybridization studies, 25 (93%) were confirmed to belong to either hybridization group 1 (phenospecies and genospecies Aeromonas hydrophila) or 8 (phenospecies Aeromonas sobria; genospecies Aeromonas veronii).
 Further analysis of 19 of these strains indicated that four major groups could be identified on the basis of serologic and surface characteristics, protein and lipopolysaccharide composition, and virulence properties; these groupings held true regardless of the site of isolation or disease process involved.
 The major AA+ group identified was serogroup O:11, whose strains possessed an S layer, were resistant to the bactericidal activity of normal serum, and were pathogenic in mice.
 The results suggest a set of useful phenotypic and structural markers for identification of specific subsets of mesophilic Aeromonas involved in a wide range of infections in the animal kingdom.
