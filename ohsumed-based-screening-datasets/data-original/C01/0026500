Bilateral nephrectomy before transplantation: indications, surgical approach, morbidity and mortality.
 Forty patients with end-stage renal failure, who had undergone simultaneous bilateral native nephrectomy before a subsequent renal transplant operation, were reviewed with particular reference to the indications and surgical approach for bilateral nephrectomy and to the complications of the procedure.
 The main indications for bilateral nephrectomy are hypertension resistant to medical therapy, persistent symptomatic renal infection, severe renal protein loss and occasionally polycystic kidneys or bilateral renal tumours.
 In this consecutive series of 40 patients both kidneys were removed because of chronic pyelonephritis with reflux (n = 28), glomerulonephritis with reflux (n = 9) and uncontrolled hypertension (n = 3).
 Surgical morbidity was less in patients who had bilateral nephrectomy performed through bilateral vertical lumbotomy incisions.
 There was no surgical mortality.
