A critical look at scheduled relaparotomy for secondary bacterial peritonitis.
 Scheduled relaparotomy is attracting interest as a means of treating intra-abdominal sepsis.
 It is the subject of several studies to evaluate its role in the management of peritoneal infection.
 However, indications for this procedure are not clear and current knowledge does not allow for adequate scientific evaluation.
 Many trials lack control groups and historical control groups cannot be evaluated on criteria, such as illness severity, concomitant health problems or even surgical technique.
 Indicators of outcome are generally described in insufficient detail; only death or survival are reported and important morbidity and resource utilization data are not included.
 A randomized, prospective, multicenter clinical trial using standardized techniques is necessary to determine the usefulness of scheduled relaparotomy performed on different patients.
