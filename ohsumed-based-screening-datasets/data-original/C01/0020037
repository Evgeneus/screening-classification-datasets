Oxygen supply and utilization relationships. A reevaluation.
 The relationship between oxygen transport (TO2) and oxygen consumption (VO2) has been studied in patients with a number of acute and chronic disorders.
 Many of these patients have been shown to have a linear relationship between these two variables over a wide range of TO2, which has been considered as evidence of pathologic supply dependency.
 This supply dependency contrasts with animal studies that have clearly demonstrated a biphasic relationship between TO2 and VO2.
 This review of the available data concerning the relationship between oxygen transport and supply under conditions of increased oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen transport suggests the possibility that the observed interaction in patients may, in many cases, represent the normal physiologic behavior of the system rather than an abnormal manifestation of impaired oxygen extraction.
