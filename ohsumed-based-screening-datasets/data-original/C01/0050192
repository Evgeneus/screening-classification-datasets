Requiring formal training in preventive health practices for child day care providers.
 The study was a test of the feasibility of mandating training in preventive health practices for child day care providers in California.
 Three approaches were taken to determining the feasibility of mandatory training.
 They were (a) to identify persons and groups with the capability to provide training, (b) to identify systems and networks for communication and collaboration on health issues related to day care at the local level, and (c) to determine the child day care providers' concerns, needs, and future interests regarding child health.
 Information was collected on relevant courses offered by universities, colleges, and adult education programs; on training offered by child health authorities; and on formal curriculums offered by local and national sources.
 Day care center and family day care home providers were surveyed to determine their knowledge of child health issues, their concerns, and their future needs.
 The providers surveyed cared for a total of 14,340 children.
 Information on local networks was obtained from the surveys, from interviews, and from a special task force that had been set up to advise the State legislature.
 Study results supported the conclusion that a coordinated system of State-wide training was feasible, given the existing networks of training and educational resources, the number of day care providers who had already been motivated to seek some training in child health practices, and the almost unanimous interest among day care providers in obtaining training.
 Mandating training in child health for day care providers will require a commitment in the form of new legislation outlining basic requirements and allocating funding.
 The implementation and costs of such a mandate at the State and local level are discussed.
