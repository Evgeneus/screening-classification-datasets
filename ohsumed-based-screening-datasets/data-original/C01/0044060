Complications following ventilation of the middle ear using Goode T tubes.
 This is a 3.5-year retrospective review on the insertion of 210 Goode T tubes into 182 ears of 93 patients.
 Otorrhea was noted postoperatively in 35.2% of the ears treated, with chronic drainage lasting longer than 4 months developing in more than 7% of the cases.
 Perforations were found in 34 ears (18.7%) following removal or extrusion of the T tubes; in 13 (7.1%) of these patients, chronic perforations requiring tympanoplasties developed.
 The literature was screened for additional studies addressing the complications associated with tympanostomy tubes.
 The documented incidence of perforations between conventional tubes and Goode T tubes was emphasized, and comparisons were made.
 Our findings indicate that, even with the immediate placement of paper patches following removal of all Goode T tubes, the percentage of tympanic membrane perforations resulting from the use of Goode T tubes is significantly greater than previously reported.
