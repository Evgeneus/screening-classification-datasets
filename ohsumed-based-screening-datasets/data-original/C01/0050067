Prevention of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation in cystic fibrosis by early treatment.
 To assess whether chronic pulmonary colonisation with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis is preventable, 26 patients who had never received anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy were randomly allocated to groups receiving either no anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy or oral ciprofloxacin and aerosol inhalations of colistin twice daily for 3 weeks, whenever Ps aeruginosa was isolated from routine sputum cultures.
 During the 27 months of the trial, infection with Ps aeruginosa became chronic in significantly fewer treated than untreated subjects (2 [14%] vs 7 [58%]; p less than 0.05) and there were significantly fewer Ps aeruginosa isolates in routine sputum cultures in the treated group (49/214 [23%] vs 64/158 [41%]; p = 0.0006).
 Thus, chronic colonisation with Ps aeruginosa can be prevented in cystic fibrosis by early institution of anti-pseudomonas chemotherapy.
