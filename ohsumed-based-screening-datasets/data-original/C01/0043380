Detection of Helicobacter pylori carriers by discriminant analysis of urea and pH levels in gastric juices.
 An alternative approach to the problems inherent in current methods for detecting Helicobacter pylori carriers--that of being generally time-consuming, expensive, and not sufficiently sensitive--was devised by using the urea concentration and pH levels of gastric juices.
 A linear discriminant analysis of these variables, measured in 54 patients submitted to digestive endoscopy for gastritis, provided a mathematical formula for assigning the subjects (previously classified by other standard methods) to groups of either positive or negative H pylori carriers.
 The results obtained showed a correct classification in 52 out of 54 cases with only one false negative and one false positive case.
