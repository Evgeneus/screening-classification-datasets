Effect of triple therapy (antibiotics plus bismuth) on duodenal ulcer healing. A randomized controlled trial.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether antimicrobial therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection accelerates the healing of duodenal ulcers.
 DESIGN: Single-blind, randomized, controlled trial.
 SETTING: Veterans Affairs hospital.
 PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and five patients with endoscopically verified duodenal ulcers.
 INTERVENTION: Patients received either ranitidine, 300 mg/d, or ranitidine, 300 mg/d, plus "triple therapy" (2 g/d of tetracycline, 750 mg/d of metronidazole, and 5 or 8 bismuth subsalicylate tablets per day).
 Triple therapy was administered for only the first 2 weeks of ulcer treatment.
 MEASUREMENTS: Videoendoscopic assessment of ulcer status was done until ulcer healing was complete.
 Evaluations were done after 2, 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of therapy.
 MAIN RESULTS: Ulcer healing was more rapid in patients receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy than in patients receiving ranitidine alone (P less than 0.01).
 The cumulative percentages of patients with healed ulcers in the group receiving ranitidine plus triple therapy and in the group receiving ranitidine alone were as follows: 37% and 18% after week 2; 74% and 53% after week 4; 84% and 68% after week 8; 96% and 80% after week 12; and 98% and 84% after week 16.
 CONCLUSION: Combined therapy with anti-H.
 pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing.
 Our results indicate that H.
 pylori plays a role in duodenal ulcer disease.
