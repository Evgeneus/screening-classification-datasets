Fever: knowledge, perception and attitudes. Results from a Norwegian population study.
 To investigate the layman's knowledge, perception and attitudes regarding normal body temperature, fever, infections and the effect of penicillin on virus infections a representative sample of the Norwegian population (619 women and 592 men over the age of 15) was interviewed in 1988 as part of a monthly national opinion poll.
 One-third thought body temperatures up to 40.5 degrees C to be life-threatening, but the results do not justify the application of the term 'fever phobia' as described in other studies based on non-representative samples.
 More respondents were afraid of viral infections (48%) than bacterial infections (9%), which may be due to the media focus upon the HIV/AIDS epidemic.
 Thirty-five per cent believed penicillin to be effective against virus infections.
 Educational programmes on fever should also include information about virus infections and their treatment.
