Liver function tests in patients receiving parenteral nutrition.
 A 5-year prospective study was performed to monitor liver function tests (LFTs) in patients receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN).
 A gradual and progressive rise was seen in the plasma concentration of bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase.
 The rate of rise was not increased in patients with LFT abnormalities before the start of TPN.
 Half of the patients had an episode of sepsis during TPN, but overall abnormal LFTs did not appear more common in these patients than in those without obvious sepsis.
 Patients with malignant disease, those requiring long-term TPN, and those requiring a nonstandard TPN regimen were more likely to develop raised LFTs.
