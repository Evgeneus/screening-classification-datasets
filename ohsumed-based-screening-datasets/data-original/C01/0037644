Anti-CD18 antibody attenuates neutropenia and alveolar capillary-membrane injury during gram-negative sepsis.
 Activated polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are implicated in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury (ALI) associated with sepsis.
 Adhesion of activated PMNs to endothelial monolayers is mediated by the CD18 adhesion-receptor complex on the PMN cell surface.
 Monoclonal antibody 60.3 (MoAb 60.3) blocks CD18-dependent PMN-endothelial adhesion in vitro and in vivo.
 This study was designed to determine the role of CD18-dependent PMN adhesion in ALI associated with gram-negative sepsis.
 Anesthetized, ventilated (FiO2 0.5, positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm H2O) pigs received sterile saline (control, n = 8) or live Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 5 x 10(8) colony-forming units/ml at 0.3 ml/20 kg/min (septic, n = 9) for 1 hour.
 A third group (n = 7) received MoAb 60.3, 2 mg/kg intravenously, 15 minutes before Pseudomonas infusion.
 Animals were studied for 300 minutes.
 MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) attenuated the neutropenia seen in sepsis (15 +/- 1 vs 6 +/- 1 x 10(3) PMNs/mm3 at 300 min).
 Alveolar-capillary membrane injury was assessed by bronchoalveolar-lavage protein content and extravascular lung water determination.
 MoAb 60.3 significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced BAL protein at 300 minutes (388 +/- 75 vs 1059 +/- 216 micrograms/ml in septic animals) and attenuated the increase in extravascular lung water to 240 minutes (7.1 +/- 2 vs 14.2 +/- 1.2 ml/kg in septic animals).
 Systemic hypotension, decreased cardiac index, pulmonary hypertension, and relative hypoxemia, all characteristic of this model, were not altered by MoAb 60.3.
 These data suggest that, in this model of septic ALI, neutropenia is, in part, CD18 dependent and that blocking CD18-dependent PMN adhesion protects the alveolar-capillary membrane independently of altered hemodynamic status.
