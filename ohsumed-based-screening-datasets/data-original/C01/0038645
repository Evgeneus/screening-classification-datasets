Achromobacter xylosoxidans. An unusual neonatal pathogen.
 Perinatal acquisition of a rare pediatric pathogen, Achromobacter xylosoxidans, with evidence for in utero transmission, is described.
 Cultures from the mother and neonate demonstrated A.
 xylosoxidans.
 An ascending bacterial infection in the mother with clinical chorioamnionitis is presented as the probable mode of transmission.
 Postmortem examination of the infant confirmed Achromobacter meningitis.
 In contrast to the current case with transmission from mother to neonate, previously published neonatal cases of Achromobacter infections indicate that nosocomial transmission of the organism is most common (79%).
 In addition, the literature review revealed a high mortality associated with meningitis (77%), frequent hydrocephalus, and subsequent neurologic sequelae (36%).
 To the authors' knowledge, this is the first documented case of maternal-fetal transfer of A.
 xylosoxidans.
