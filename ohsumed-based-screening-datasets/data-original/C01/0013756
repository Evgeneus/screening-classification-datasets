Microbial agents associated with pneumonia in children from Uruguay.
 The etiology of severe pneumonia, not frequently encountered in a community-based study, was determined in 204 hospitalized children less than 5 years of age.
 Potential pathogens were identified in 41% of episodes.
 Viruses were isolated or antigen was detected in 36.3% of cases; 82.4% of these cases were due to respiratory syncytial virus.
 Bacteria or bacterial antigens were identified in 13.2% of cases; Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were the most frequently identified bacterial pathogens isolated from blood and/or pleural effusions.
 Mixed infections were identified in 4.9% of the episodes.
 Among the 17 patients with pleural effusion whose pleural space was drained, the etiology was suggested for 10 (58.8%).
 A clear-cut seasonal variation was seen, with the highest prevalence between May and October.
 Viral infections were more common in the first 6 months of life, although viral and bacterial infections were distributed throughout the first 5 years of life.
