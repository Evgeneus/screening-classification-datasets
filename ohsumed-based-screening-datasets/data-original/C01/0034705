Emergency pulmonary resection for pneumonia. High morbidity and mortality.
 Emergency pulmonary resection was performed because of complicated pneumonia in eight patients (5 pneumonectomies, 2 lobectomies, 1 bilobectomy) over a 2-year period.
 The patients' age range was 5 months to 43 years.
 The indications were rapid aggravation of respiratory insufficiency in children with staphylococcal pneumonia and enlarging pneumatoceles, and massive hemoptysis in patients with chronic destructive pneumonia.
 Two patients died after pneumonectomy, one from contralateral aspiration and one from cardiogenic shock.
 Postoperative complications occurred in four cases--bronchopleural fistula and pyopneumothorax in three and thoracic empyema with massive chest-wall infection in one.
 Only two patients had an uneventful postoperative course.
 Complications of pulmonary necrosis in pneumonia may dictate urgent pulmonary resection, often pneumonectomy.
 Surgery will be life-saving in most cases, but high morbidity is to be expected.
