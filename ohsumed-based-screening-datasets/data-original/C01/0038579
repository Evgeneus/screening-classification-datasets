Haemophilus influenzae disease and immunization in developing countries.
 Haemophilus influenzae is one of the leading causes of severe bacterial infection in children of developing regions, causing 30% of the cases of culture-positive pneumonia and 20%-60% of the cases of bacterial meningitis.
 In infants and children, the majority of isolates from cerebrospinal fluid and blood and 16%-38% of pulmonary isolates are H.
 influenzae type b.
 The availability of several new polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccines for the prevention of invasive disease due to H.
 influenzae type b prompts this review of the epidemiology of H.
 influenzae disease in the developing world and of the characteristics of current H.
 influenzae type b vaccines.
 To develop a strategy for use of H.
 influenzae type b vaccines in developing countries, the following data are needed: the age-specific attack rates of H.
 influenzae type b disease and the immunogenicity and efficacy of these vaccines in young infants in developing countries.
 Should H.
 influenzae type b vaccines prove to be inadequate for the prevention of H.
 influenzae pneumonia, the use of non-type b H.
 influenzae vaccines may be necessary.
