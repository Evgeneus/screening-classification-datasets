A randomized trial of fully intermittent vs. daily followed by intermittent short course chemotherapy for childhood tuberculosis 
 Fully intermittent short course chemotherapy regimens have been used successfully in adults but not in children.
 We report the results on 76 children with tuberculosis, excluding central nervous system tuberculosis and primary pulmonary complex.
 Isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide were used for treatment.
 They were randomly allocated to Regimen A (52 doses) and Regimen B (94 doses).
 Overall efficacy of both schedules was greater than 95% in 27 children with lymphatic, 43 with pulmonary and 6 with disseminated tuberculosis.
 Compliance in 10 children after 2 to 4 months of therapy was poor because rapid improvement was mistaken by parents for cure.
 Two children died, probably of underlying lung disease.
 Follow-up for up to 2 years did not reveal any case of relapse or recurrence of the disease.
 Therapy for 6 months involving administration of only 52 or 94 doses of drugs was found to be economical, effective and safe for treating children with tuberculosis.
