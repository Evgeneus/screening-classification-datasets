Suppurative cervical lymphadenitis after Yersinia enterocolitica bacteremia.
 Yersinia enterocolitica is increasingly recognized as a pathogen causing diverse complications.
 We have reported the case of a man with fever, abdominal tenderness, and Y enterocolitica bacteremia.
 After antibiotic therapy, his condition improved initially, but later, suppurative cervical lymphadenitis developed.
 This suggests that the hematogenous spread of Y enterocolitica to a distal lymphatic focus of infection is a possible complication of Y enterocolitica bacteremia.
