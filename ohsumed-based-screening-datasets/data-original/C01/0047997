Early appearing gamma/delta-bearing T cells during infection with Calmette Guerin bacillus.
 To search for a potential role of TCR gamma/delta T cells in host-defense against mycobacterial infection, we analyzed the kinetics, repertoire, specificity, and cytokine production of gamma/delta T cells in the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC), lymph node (LN) cells and spleen cells during an i.p.
 infection with a sublethal dose (5 x 10(5) of viable Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) in mice.
 In the PEC on day 7 after infection, approximately 26% of the CD3+ cells were CD4-CD8-, most of which expressed TCR gamma/delta on their surface.
 However, the PEC on day 28 contained an increased number of alpha/beta T cells that were CD4+8- or CD4-8+ and the proportion of gamma/delta T cells in the PEC reciprocally decreased to 18% of the CD3+ cells.
 The kinetics of gamma/delta and alpha/beta T cells in the LN during BCG infection showed in much the same pattern as that seen in the PEC.
 When purified CD4-CD8- cells in the LN on day 7 after BCG infection were cultured with sonicated BCG lysate, PPD derived from Mycobacterium tuberculosis or recombinant 65 kDa heat shock protein derived from Mycobacterium bovis, the gamma/delta T cells on this stage significantly proliferated and secreted IL-2 in response to sonicated BCG lysate and PPD but not to 65 kDa heat shock protein.
 V gene segment usage analysis with PCR method revealed that purified protein derivative-reactive gamma/delta T cells preferentially used V gamma 1/2/V delta 6, whereas gamma/delta T cells polyclonally expanded in response to the BCG lysate.
 These results suggest that gamma/delta T cells specific for mycobacterial antigens preceding alpha/beta T cells in appearance during infection may serve as a first line of defense against mycobacterial infection.
