Tuberculosis in the elderly: incidence, manifestations, PPD skin tests, and preventive therapy.
 Tuberculosis is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
 The incidence of tuberculosis has declined dramatically over the past decades, but it is still highly prevalent in the geriatric population.
 This report describes the etiology, clinical manifestations, and immunologic changes of tuberculosis in the elderly.
 The basis for tuberculin skin testing and its interpretation in patients over 65 years of age are discussed, as well as the controversies regarding preventive therapy with isoniazid in the elderly.
 Guidelines for tuberculosis screening in long-term care facilities are proposed.
