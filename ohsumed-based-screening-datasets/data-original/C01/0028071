Percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement: an outpatient procedure?
 The authors report their experience with 56 percutaneous nephrostomies (PCNs) performed on an outpatient basis on 55 patients.
 Complications included pain that required use of parenteral medication in four patients, bleeding in three that resolved spontaneously, and shaking chills or fever in 12.
 This last complication, considered to be a sign of sepsis and treated with antibiotics, occurred more frequently than the 1.4%-4.5% infectious complication rate reported in the literature.
 Antibiotic use during and after PCN significantly decreased the likelihood of sepsis.
 In the high-risk group, antibiotic administration during and after PCN decreased the risk of developing signs of sepsis from 50% to 9%.
 On the basis of the authors' results and the findings in the literature about antibiotic prophylaxis, guidelines are recommended to improve the safety of PCN as an outpatient procedure.
 In the majority of instances PCN should still be considered to be more safely performed as an inpatient procedure at this time.
