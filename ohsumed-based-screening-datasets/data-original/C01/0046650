Cystic fibrosis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and selective decontamination.
 We used an oral topical antibiotic preparation to try and prevent oropharyngeal carriage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 Ten of 15 patients treated with a two week course of intravenous ceftazidime together with a 90 day course of an antibiotic containing gel continued to carry P aeruginosa in the oropharynx.
