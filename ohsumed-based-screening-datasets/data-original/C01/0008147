Clinically inapparent (asymptomatic) bacteriuria in ambulatory elderly men: epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological findings.
 In a prospective longitudinal study, ambulatory elderly men were followed from 1 to 4.5 years to gain insight into the prevalence rates, clinical characteristics, and patterns of clinically inapparent (asymptomatic) bacteriuria (CIB).
 The prevalence of CIB was 12% (29/238) and increases with age.
 Unlike the gram-negative organisms that cause overt urinary tract infection in this age group, gram-positive organisms dominated the CIB group.
 Both the CIB and abacteriuric patients have multiple chronic medical conditions and are indistinguishable on that basis.
 Twenty-nine elderly men with bacteriuria and 105 abacteriuric subjects were followed with serial urine cultures.
 During the study period the bacteriuric subjects exhibited spontaneous temporary or permanent resolution (76%, 22/29), intermittency (21%, 6/29), and probable bacterial persistence (38%, 11/29).
 No consistent pattern of bacteriuria was evident.
 Therefore, antimicrobial therapy is not warranted in the treatment of asymptomatic or clinically inapparent bacteriuria in ambulatory elderly men.
