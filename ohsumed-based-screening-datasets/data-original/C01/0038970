Localized Aspergillus infestation in primary lung carcinoma. Clinical and pathological contrasts with post-tuberculous intracavitary aspergilloma.
 Saprophytic infestation with Aspergillus was observed in pathologic specimens of primary squamous cell lung carcinoma.
 In one case, the fungus grew in cystic scarred parenchyma and bronchi distal to an obstructing carcinoma of a segment bronchus.
 In the other, fungi colonized the inner surface of a peripheral cavitary carcinoma.
 Neither patient had roentgenographic evidence of aspergilloma and neither experienced severe pulmonary hemorrhage or other complications attributable to the presence of fungus.
 Although both specimens showed colonizing growth within the abnormal air spaces, in neither had the colonies detached to form a separate intracavitary fungus ball.
 These patients, and eight patients with similar lesions reported in the literature, demonstrate that Aspergillus colonization of a lung neoplasm frequently lacks one or both of the features characteristic of post-inflammatory intracavitary aspergilloma, a loose fungus ball and antifungal serum antibodies.
 No patient, to date, has developed massive hemorrhage as a complication of this lesion.
