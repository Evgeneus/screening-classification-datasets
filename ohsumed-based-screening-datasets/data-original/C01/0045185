Osteoradionecrosis of sphenoid and temporal bones in a patient with maxillary sinus carcinoma: a case report.
 A case of radionecrosis of sphenoid and temporal bones is reported.
 The patient received a combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy for his left maxillary sinus carcinoma.
 After the combined therapy, necrosis accompanying inflammation developed in the maxillary and temporal regions.
 Excision of the necrotic tissues was done, and the left ascending ramus of the mandible was resected because of persistent tumor mass at the left infratemporal fossa.
 Although the excision wound of the maxilla healed by epithelialization, an area of nonvital bone remained exposed in the temporal region, where progressive osteonecrosis with infection led to breakdown of the skin.
 The necrotic bones of the zygomatic arch and the sphenotemporal sutural region became visible through the skin defect, and computerized tomography scan revealed bone necrosis involving the inferolateral area and the base of the skull.
 Excision of the necrotic bone and reconstruction with sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap were performed.
