Rhodococcus infection of the skin with lymphadenitis in a nonimmunocompromised girl.
 A 7-year-old girl had a 4 X 3 X 3 cm nodule on the left wrist with axillary lymphadenopathy.
 Acid-fast bacilli were seen on a smear from a biopsy specimen of this granulomatous skin lesion.
 A Rhodococcus species grew on culture.
 Skin infections caused by Rhodococcus may be more common than the few prior case reports suggest.
