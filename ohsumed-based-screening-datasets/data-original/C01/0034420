Abdominal wall Actinomyces abscess associated with an intrauterine device. A case report.
 An abdominal wall Actinomyces abscess occurred in a woman with an intrauterine device.
 Contributing factors were local trauma, spread from surrounding colonized body sites and symbiotic growth of other anaerobes.
 The diagnosis was based on the histologic finding of the sulfur granule.
 Special studies may be needed to distinguish this condition from other, similar ones (Nocardia, botryomycosis).
