Double-blind, placebo-controlled study of three-month treatment with lymecycline in reactive arthritis, with special reference to Chlamydia arthritis.
 We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of 3-month treatment with lymecycline, a form of tetracycline, in reactive arthritis (ReA).
 Lymecycline therapy significantly decreased the duration of the illness in patients with Chlamydia trachomatis-triggered ReA, but not in other ReA patients.
 In 2 ReA patients, C trachomatis was found in the throat, an uncommon locale for this organism.
 Our results suggest that it is important to verify the triggering microbe and that it is beneficial to treat Chlamydia arthritis patients with a prolonged course of tetracycline.
