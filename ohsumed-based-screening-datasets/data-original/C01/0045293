Multi-laboratory evaluation of a scrub typhus diagnostic kit.
 Scrub typhus is a major cause of febrile illness throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
 It is commonly undiagnosed, partly because of the lack of a simple, reliable diagnostic test which can be used in clinical laboratories.
 The indirect immunoperoxidase technique, configured into a test kit, was provided to technicians who were trained in its use.
 They used the kit during a 2 year field trial in their respective clinical hospital laboratories throughout Malaysia.
 In an evaluation using 1,722 consecutive sera tested in those laboratories, the kit was found to have a median sensitivity for IgG detection of 0.85 (range 0.33-0.95), a median specificity of 0.94 (range 0.88-1.00), reproducibility of 0.86, and efficiency of 0.92 when compared to the reference laboratory.
 In a proficiency survey in which 10 laboratories received 3 coded test samples, all but 2 laboratories had results within 1 dilution of the reference laboratory in quantitating specific IgG, whereas 7 laboratories were within 1 dilution in quantitating IgM.
 The shelf life of the kit was at least 1 year at 4 degrees C.
