Uptake of sparfloxacin and norfloxacin by clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus.
 The amount of sparfloxacin uptake was higher than that of norfloxacin uptake in Staphylococcus aureus.
 Moreover, energy-dependent reduction in quinolone uptake, probably due to active efflux of the quinolone, was observed.
 The reduction in quinolone uptake appeared to be associated with quinolone resistance in S.
 aureus.
