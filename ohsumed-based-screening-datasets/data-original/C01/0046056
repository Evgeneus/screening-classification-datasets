Development of alumina ceramic transcutaneous connector to prevent skin exit site infections around CAPD catheters.
 It is very important to prevent skin exit site infections in order to continue continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) safely over the long-term.
 The silicon material conventionally used can result in sinus formation between the skin and the catheter, and may trigger exit site infections.
 To resolve this problem, we employed a bioinert, rigid, and nonporous transcutaneous connector made of alumina ceramic.
 Earlier long-term animal experiments with alumina ceramic placed in soft tissue demonstrated the outstanding biocompatibility of this material.
 The transcutaneous connector was designed with a simple cylindrical configuration; in order to make sufficient contact between this connector and the patient, a silicon tube was made into a swan neck catheter with a disk-shaped Dacron cuff at the upper position in order to reinforce adhesion to soft tissue.
 Ten CAPD patients (maximum time on dialysis of 14 months) have used the new CAPD catheter system with no exit site infections to date.
 Furthermore, there has been virtually no downgrowth of the skin around the connector, while the connector and tissue have remained in very close contact.
