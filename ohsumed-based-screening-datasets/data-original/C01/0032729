Correlations between endotoxin and clinical symptoms or radiolucent areas in infected root canals.
 Samples were collected from the root canals of 30 teeth of patients with apical periodontitis and assayed for endotoxin content.
 The detection rates of endotoxin and endotoxin content were higher in symptomatic teeth, teeth with radiolucent areas, and teeth with exudation than in those without them.
