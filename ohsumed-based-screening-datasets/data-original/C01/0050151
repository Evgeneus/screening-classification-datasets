Survival in septic guinea pigs is influenced by vitamin E, but not by vitamin C in enteral diets.
 Oxygen-free radicals are produced during sepsis, and may contribute to cell injury and dysfunction.
 We studied the effect of different levels of vitamins E and C in the diet fed enterally to septic guinea pigs.
 Sixty-four female guinea pigs were provided with gastrostomies and allowed to recover.
 Intraperitoneal osmotic pumps were then implanted that provided effusion of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus for the next 7 days.
 Three days after pump implantations, the animals were started on one of nine diets.
 The diets were isocaloric and isonitrogenous, and differed only in the amounts of vitamins E and C.
 Three levels of each vitamin were used, based on the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA).
 The feedings were continued for 2 weeks, during which time mortality was observed.
 The amount of vitamin C had no effect on outcome, with mortality rates of 68% (15/22) in the 1 x RDA group, 73% (16/22) in the 5 x RDA group, and 65% (13/20) in the 25 x RDA group.
 However, vitamin E altered outcome significantly, with mortality rates of 86% (18/21) in the 1 x RDA group, 45% (10/22) in the 3 x RDA group, and 76% (16/21) in the 9 x RDA group.
 Mortality in the 3 x RDA group was significantly lower than that in the 1 x RDA group and in the 9 x RDA group.
