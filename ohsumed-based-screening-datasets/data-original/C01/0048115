Production and characterization of a human hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella species.
 A hyperimmune globulin for intravenous use (H-IVIG) was prepared from the plasma of donors immunized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella vaccines.
 H-IVIG preparations contained substantially higher IgG antibody levels to all nine P.
 aeruginosa vaccine antigens and to 22 of the 24 Klebsiella vaccine antigens than did commercial IVIG.
 The H-IVIG was more effective at promoting the opsonophagocytic killing of P.
 aeruginosa and Klebsiella vaccine serotype strains than normal IVIG.
 The H-IVIG neutralized greater than 20 times more toxin A than commercial IVIG.
 Only the H-IVIG offered significant protection against Klebsiella K2 sepsis.
 The H-IVIG provided significantly better protection against six of the eight P.
 aeruginosa vaccine serotypes than normal IVIG when compared in a murine burn wound sepsis model.
 The H-IVIG also protected mice against an Enterobacter aerogenes challenge, whereas normal IVIG was ineffective.
