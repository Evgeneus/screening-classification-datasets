Serum immune response to Helicobacter pylori in children: epidemiologic and clinical applications.
 Antibody responses to Helicobacter pylori were measured by a solid-phase whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 150 children and adolescents; in 47 consecutive children undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, including 17 with H.
 pylori infection before and after antimicrobial treatment; and in 46 family members of the infected children.
 Abnormal levels of either IgG or IgA were found in 6% of the 150 children.
 In the latter group the prevalence of H.
 pylori seropositivity increased with age.
 Parents and siblings of the infected children had 94% and 71% seropositivity, respectively, suggesting intrafamilial spread.
 Abnormal levels of IgG or IgA against H.
 pylori identified infected children with 95% sensitivity and 84% specificity.
 Eradication of the infection was accompanied by a significant decrease in IgG and IgA titers, with normalization in 10 cured patients in 12 months or less.
 We conclude that the method described for evaluation of H.
 pylori-specific IgG and IgA antibodies gives helpful information on the epidemiology of the infection and represents a useful adjunct to diagnosis and management of chronic gastritis in children.
