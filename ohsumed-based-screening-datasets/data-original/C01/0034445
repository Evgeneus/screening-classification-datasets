In situ fresh allograft replacement of an infected aortic prosthetic graft: eighteen months' follow-up.
 We report a case in which an allogenic aortic graft was used to treat the last one of a series of infectious graft complications.
 The original operation was a Dacron aortobifemoral bypass for aortoiliac occlusive disease in an institution other than ours.
 The patient was referred for the treatment of the infection of the prosthetic implant.
 We inserted a prosthetic bypass from the left axillary to the left deep femoral artery, as well as a crossover autogenous saphenous vein graft from the prosthesis to the right deep femoral artery; in the same operation the infected intraabdominal prosthesis was removed with closure of the proximal aortic stump.
 Subsequent stenosis of the vein graft made it necessary to insert a prosthetic bypass between the descending thoracic aorta and the two deep femoral arteries.
 Infection of the last named prosthesis made it necessary to remove it and replace it with a tailored allogenic arterial allograft between the infrarenal abdominal aorta and both deep femoral arteries.
 The patient had an uneventful recovery as the infection was controlled and both lower limbs were salvaged.
 Eighteen months later the allograft was patent without any signs of degeneration.
 Further clinical experience under appropriate conditions may prove the use of allografts effective in the treatment of selected cases of aortic prosthetic infection.
