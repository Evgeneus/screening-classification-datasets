Infections at the site of a hip implant. Successful and unsuccessful management.
 Thirty-four patients developed the complication of deep infection at the site of a hip implant (n = 35).
 Multiple factors in existence at the time of implant placement and the time of presentation with infection as well as the therapeutic regimen were retrospectively analyzed.
 Patients with successful outcomes (n = 15) were relatively younger (mean, 52 years) compared to those that had an unsuccessful outcome (n = 19; mean, 65 years; p less than 0.01).
 No other factors were predictive of the outcome of treatment.
 Implant extirpation, expedient wound closure, and, when necessary, muscle transposition favored a successful outcome.
 Implant retention and open wound packing resulted in prolonged wound healing and, sometimes, hip disarticulation or death.
