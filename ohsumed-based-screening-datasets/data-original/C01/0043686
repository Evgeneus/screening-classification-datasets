Infectious crystalline keratopathy occurring in an eye subsequent to glaucoma filtering surgery with postoperative subconjunctival 5-fluorouracil.
 We present a case of infectious crystalline keratopathy occurring after 5-fluorouracil filtering surgery.
 The patient had discrete, branching, white crystalline lesions in the anterior corneal stroma.
 Cultures grew Streptococcus viridans, and gram-positive cocci were demonstrated in corneal tissue biopsy specimens.
 Toxic and immunosuppressive properties of 5-fluorouracil may have participated in the pathogenesis of the infectious crystalline keratitis.
