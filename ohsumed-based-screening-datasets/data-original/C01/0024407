Crohn disease in the pediatric patient: CT evaluation.
 Computed tomographic (CT) scans and medical records of 25 children (age range, 10-18 years) with pathologically proved Crohn disease were reviewed to better define the role of CT in the management of pediatric patients with Crohn disease.
 CT findings included small bowel thickening (range, 5-10 mm) (n = 20), colonic wall thickening (range, 6-15 mm) (n = 15), and small bowel dilation (n = 5).
 Mesenteric abnormalities such as adenopathy and focal fatty proliferation were seen in 11 to 18 patients, respectively.
 Extraluminal complications were easily identified with CT.
 Abscesses were noted in seven patients, inflammatory masses in four, and perirectal or perineal inflammation in 10.
 Fistulas were detected in four patients.
 The authors conclude that CT should be the initial imaging study performed in children with known Crohn disease and a changing pattern of clinical symptoms.
