Cutaneous botryomycosis.
 We report four cases of cutaneous botryomycosis.
 The predisposing factors included alcoholism, diabetes, and trauma.
 Clinically, the patients had nodules, suppurative plaques, or ulcers.
 In two cases, Staphylococcus aureus was cultured.
 In one case Neisseria species was cultured and in another a coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Corynebacterium species were the only organism cultured.
 All patients responded to systemic antibiotic therapy.
