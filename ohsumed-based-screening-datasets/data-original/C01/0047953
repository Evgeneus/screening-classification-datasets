In vitro and in vivo activities of LJC10,627, a new carbapenem with stability to dehydropeptidase I.
 The activity of LJC10,627 was compared with the activities of imipenem and other antibiotics.
 LJC10,627 was more active against most members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., and Acinetobacter spp.
 but slightly less active than imipenem against staphylococci and streptococci.
 LJC10,627 showed stability to mouse dehydropeptidase I and was more effective in vivo than imipenem plus cilastatin against gram-negative bacterial infections and as effective against staphylococcal infections.
