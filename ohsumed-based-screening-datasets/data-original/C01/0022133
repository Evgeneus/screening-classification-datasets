Gastroduodenal mucosal prostaglandin generation in patients with Helicobacter pylori before and after treatment with bismuth subsalicylate.
 To determine whether Helicobacter pylori has an effect on gastroduodenal mucosal prostaglandin generation, mucosal biopsies were obtained from the gastric body, antrum, and duodenal bulb of 30 patients who were undergoing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for clinical indications.
 One biopsy from the gastric body and one from the antrum were tested for urease activity (urea broth) and one biopsy from each area including the duodenum was processed for histology.
 Two other biopsies form each area were incubated and the accumulation of prostaglandin E2 and 6-keto prostaglandin F1 alpha in the incubation medium was measured by radioimmunoassay.
 Twelve of the 17 H.
 pylori-positive patients and seven of the 13 H.
 pylori-negative patients agreed to take bismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol) two tablets four times a day for four weeks.
 One week after treatment, these patients again underwent endoscopy and the above studies.
 This study indicates that: (1) mucosal PGE2 generation may be increased in the duodenum, gastric body, and antrum in H.
 pylori-positive patients compared to H.
 pylori-negative patients, and (2) treatment with bismuth subsalicylate for four weeks results in reduction of mucosal PGE2 in the duodenum, gastric body, and antrum of H.
 pylori-positive patients and fails to eradicate H.
 pylori or reduce gastric inflammation.
