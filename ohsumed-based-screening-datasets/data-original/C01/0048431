Successful treatment of Bacillus cereus infection with ciprofloxacin.
 Bacillus cereus is rarely a pulmonary pathogen but may cause pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.
 A patient with bronchiectasis and no recognisable immunodeficiency had this organism isolated during two infective exacerbations, once from respiratory secretions and once by blood culture.
 Ciprofloxacin treatment was effective on both occasions.
