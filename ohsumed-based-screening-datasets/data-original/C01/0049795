Source of tubercle bacilli in cervical lymph nodes: a prospective study.
 A prospective study searching for associated mycobacterial infection of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBLN) was carried out.
 One hundred and thirteen patients with a clinical suspicion of cervical TBLN were included.
 All patients had a physical examination of the upper aerodigestive tract.
 Routine endoscopy and biopsy of the nasopharynx were performed.
 All of them had surgery to the cervical lymph node.
 Seventy-five patients had histologically confirmed cervical TBLN.
 Culture of the lymph node specimen showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis in 68 (90 per cent).
 In 45 (60 per cent) patients with cervical TBLN the primary foci of infection could not be found.
 Twenty-nine (39 per cent) had radiographic evidence of active or healed pulmonary tuberculosis.
 Sputum culture from two patients showed Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
 Five patients (six per cent) had tuberculous nasopharyngitis.
 In one of them (one per cent) the tuberculous nasopharyngitis was primary as no other evidence of mycobacterial infection was found.
 In the present study, mycobacterial infection of other parts of the upper aerodigestive tract was not found.
