Community-wide outbreak of group G streptococcal pharyngitis.
 Although several outbreaks of group G beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GGBHS) pharyngitis have been described, doubt still remains regarding the etiologic role of GGBHS in acute pharyngitis beyond a limited number of situations.
 In the winter/spring of 1986/87, throat cultures were obtained from 222 consecutive children seen at a private pediatric office with acute pharyngitis and group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) were recovered from 91 children (41%) and GGBHS from 56 children (25%).
 One patient had both GABHS and GGBHS isolated.
 This isolation rate of GGBHS was dramatically greater than in previous and subsequent years, and 67% of the GGBHS isolates occurred during an 8-week period.
 Results of DNA fingerprinting of the 57 isolates of GGBHS demonstrated that 43 (75%) appeared to be the same strain.
 The patients with GGBHS were comparable to those with GABHS with respect to clinical findings, antistreptolysin-O titer response, and clinical response to antibiotic therapy.
 However, patients with GGBHS were significantly older (P less than .05).
 This is the first well-documented, community-wide outbreak of GGBHS pharyngitis and the first respiratory outbreak of GGBHS pharyngitis in a pediatric population.
 GGBHS may be a more important cause of acute, treatable pharyngitis than had been previously recognized.
