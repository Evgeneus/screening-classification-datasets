Four decades of shigellosis in Israel: epidemiology of a growing public health problem.
 Despite the improved standard of living in Israel, shigellosis remains a common disease.
 Examination of trends in the incidence of shigellosis in Israel between 1951 and 1987 showed a period of declining rates followed by an increase in the reported incidence beginning around 1969.
 This increase was mainly due to Shigella sonnei; rates of infection with Shigella flexneri remained relatively constant.
 Trends showed marked differences between age groups and between ethnic groups.
 In comparison, the rates in the United States--much lower than those in Israel--began to decline in the early 1950s and have remained low.
 The incidence in Israel is now about 20 times higher than that in the United States.
 Thus shigellosis remains a major and growing public health problem in Israel, a country that has enjoyed a dramatic improvement in basic sanitary services and infrastructure over the past few decades.
 This disturbing finding lends urgency to efforts to control the disease.
