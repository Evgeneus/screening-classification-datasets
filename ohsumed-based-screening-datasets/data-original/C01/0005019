Clinical course and pharmacokinetics following a massive overdose of amphotericin B in a neonate.
 Amphotericin is the drug of choice for the treatment of fungal infections in infants and children.
 When used in the recommended doses, amphotericin therapy is associated with high rates of adverse effects, including nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, decrease in white blood cells, platelets and hemoglobin, chills, fever and even death (1).
 We report a case involving a neonate who was exposed to a 50 fold overdose of Amphotericin over a three day period.
