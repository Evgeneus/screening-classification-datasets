Catheter infection control in parenteral nutrition.
 Catheter sepsis rates related to total parenteral nutrition are variable and depend on several patient-specific factors.
 These factors include the presence of immunosuppression or critical illness, the use of multiple intravascular catheters, and bacterial translocation.
 Catheter-related sepsis may present in the patient as fever, chills, change in mental status, hypotension, and leukocytosis.
 In patients with suspected catheter-related infection whose peripheral blood cultures do not grow the same organism as a blood culture drawn from the catheter, a guidewire exchange of the catheter has been shown to be effective.
 This technique should be considered a surgical procedure.
 Complications that are associated with guidewire exchange of central venous catheters are catheter malposition, embolism of air or septic thrombi, and cardiac arrhythmias.
