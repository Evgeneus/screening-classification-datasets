Renal carnitine concentration decreases in endotoxic dogs.
 BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Renal cortical and serum carnitine concentrations were studied in seven anesthetized beagle dogs in which acute circulatory collapse was induced by an iv injection of Escherichia coli endotoxin, 0.5 mg/kg given over 15 mins.
 Four controls received normal saline.
 RESULTS: The endotoxin injection resulted in cardiac depression, renal hypoperfusion, acidosis with a decrease in urinary output, and hematuria.
 Arterial and renal venous free carnitine concentrations increased significantly in endotoxemia during the 5-hr experiment, but remained low and unchanged in the controls.
 Circulating acyl-carnitine concentrations underwent no essential changes in either group.
 Total, free, and acyl-carnitine concentrations decreased in endotoxic renal tissue.
 CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that endotoxemia decreases carnitine concentrations in the renal cortex, but increases free carnitine concentrations in the circulation.
