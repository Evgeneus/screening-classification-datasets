Brain stem tuberculoma in adult patients: diagnosis and treatment.
 A consecutive series of six adult patients ranging in age from 29 to 53 years is presented.
 The clinical and radiological features in each patient are described.
 Attention is drawn to the features demonstrated on computed axial tomography.
 In only one patient, the first encountered, was surgical excision undertaken and histological verification obtained.
 One patient died before any form of treatment could be instituted.
 The remaining four patients were treated with antituberculous chemotherapy alone and their progress monitored by sequential computed tomography.
 The excellent response and good outcome in this conservatively treated group are documented.
