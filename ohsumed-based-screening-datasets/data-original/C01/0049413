Meningococcal disease in the United States--1986. Meningococcal Disease Study Group.
 Active surveillance for invasive meningococcal disease was conducted during 1986 and 1987 in six areas of the United States with a total population of approximately 34 million persons.
 The incidence of meningococcal disease was 1.3:10(5).
 The highest incidence of disease among the surveillance areas was in Los Angeles County (1.65:10(5).
 Neisseria meningitidis serogroups B and C caused about equal amounts of disease, which reflects a recent increase in the incidence of group C disease.
 Group C caused more than half of the cases of meningococcal disease in Los Angeles and Tennessee but less than one-third of the cases in Missouri and Oklahoma.
 Multilocus enzyme electrophoresis demonstrated that a group of closely related isolates of N.
 meningitidis was prevalent in Los Angeles during the surveillance period and was associated with an increased incidence of meningococcal disease there.
