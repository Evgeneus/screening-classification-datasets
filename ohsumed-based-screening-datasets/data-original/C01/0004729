Adult immunization in a network of family practice residency programs.
 A substantial proportion of morbidity and mortality associated with vaccine-preventable diseases occurs among adults.
 Teaching residents about disease prevention is mandated in the curriculum guidelines for family practice programs.
 A cooperative study among the Kansas City family practice residency programs was begun to look at immunization behaviors in these teaching programs.
 A retrospective audit of medical records and a prospective survey of residents and faculty were performed.
 From the medical records of 400 patients seen for health maintenance examinations, the frequency of tetanus-diphtheria immunizations recorded was 4.75%.
 The pooled immunization rate recorded for pneumococcal vaccine was 25%, and for influenza vaccine, 24%.
 Although 93% of respondents knew patients need tetanus-diphtheria immunization every 10 years, on a written questionnaire giving clinical examples, they were less likely to elect to immunize older patients eligible for tetanus-diphtheria vaccine.
 The following immunization criteria were listed by respondents: for pneumococcal vaccine, age over 65 years (86%); for influenza vaccine, age over 65 years (85%), chronic diseases (69%), residence in a chronic care facility (7%), and being a health care worker (28%).
 Educational interventions stressing the appropriate criteria and involvement of the patient are planned at the separate programs.
