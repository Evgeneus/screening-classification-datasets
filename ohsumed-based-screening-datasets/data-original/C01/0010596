Shunt surgery for hydrocephalus in tuberculous meningitis: a long-term follow-up study.
 Hydrocephalus is a common complication of tuberculous meningitis.
 Case studies of 114 patients with tuberculous meningitis and hydrocephalus, who underwent shunt surgery between July, 1975, and June, 1986, were reviewed to evaluate the long-term outcome and to outline a management protocol for these patients based on the results.
 Seven factors were studied in each case: 1) age at admission; 2) grade on admission (I to IV, classified by the authors; Grade I being the best and Grade IV being the worst); 3) duration of alteration of sensorium; 4) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell content at initial examination; 5) CSF protein levels at initial examination; 6) number of shunt revisions required; and 7) the necessity for bilateral shunts.
 During a long-term follow-up period ranging from 6 months to 13 years (mean 45.6 months), the mortality rate was 20% for patients in Grade I; 34.7% for patients in Grade II; 51.9% for patients in Grade III; and 100% for patients in Grade IV.
 Only the grade at the time of admission was found to be statistically significant in determining final outcome (p less than 0.001).
 Based on these results, the authors advocate early shunt surgery for Grade I and II patients.
 For patients in Grade III, surgery may be performed either if external ventricular drainage causes an improvement in sensorium or without selection.
 All patients in Grade IV should undergo external ventricular drainage and only those who show a significant change in their neurological status within 24 to 48 hours of drainage, should have shunt surgery.
