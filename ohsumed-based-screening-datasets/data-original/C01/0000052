Replacement of an aortic valve cusp after neonatal endocarditis.
 Septic arthritis developed in a neonate after an infection of her hand.
 Despite medical and surgical treatment endocarditis of her aortic valve developed and the resultant regurgitation required emergency surgery.
 At operation a new valve cusp was fashioned from preserved calf pericardium.
 Nine years later she was well and had full exercise tolerance with minimal aortic regurgitation.
