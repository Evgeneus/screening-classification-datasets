In vitro susceptibilities of Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia rickettsii, and Rickettsia conorii to the fluoroquinolone sparfloxacin.
 In vitro susceptibilities of Rickettsia rickettsii, Rickettsia conorii, and Coxiella burnetii to the new fluoroquinolone sparfloxacin (AT-4140; RP 64206) were determined.
 Plaque and dye uptake assays were used to measure the MICs against R.
 rickettsii and R.
 conorii.
 The susceptibilities of C.
 burnetii Nine Mile and Q 212 were determined in two acute-infection models and in two chronic-infection models.
 The MICs were 0.125 to 0.25 microgram/ml for R.
 rickettsii and 0.25 to 0.5 microgram/ml for R.
 conorii.
 Sparfloxacin (1 microgram/ml) cured cells recently infected with C.
 burnetii Nine Mile and Q 212 within 4 to 9 days and cured multiplying, persistently infected cells within 10 days.
 As previously described with other fluoroquinolones (D.
 Raoult, M.
 Drancourt, and G.
 Vestris, Antimicrob.
 Agents Chemother.
 34:1512-1514, 1990), sparfloxacin failed to cure cells persistently infected with C.
 burnetii and blocked from dividing with cycloheximide.
 As determined by the dye uptake assay, no cellular toxicity was noted with sparfloxacin at up to 128 micrograms/ml.
 These results are consistent with those previously obtained with fluoroquinolones (D.
 Raoult, M.
 Yeaman, and O.
 Baca, Rev.

 Dis.
 11[Suppl.
 5]:S986, 1989), although sparfloxacin may be slightly more active.
