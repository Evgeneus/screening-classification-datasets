Avoiding sexually transmitted diseases.
 As the spectrum of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) has broadened to include many infections that are not readily cured, prevention of STDs has become more important than ever.
 Primary prevention methods include abstinence, careful selection of sexual partners, condoms, vaginal spermicides, and a vaccine for hepatitis B.
 Condoms will protect against STDs only if they are used consistently and correctly; vaginal spermicides may also reduce risk of certain STDs.
 Health care providers should routinely counsel women on methods to reduce risk of STDs.
