Haemophilus influenzae: an important cause of maternal and neonatal infections.
 Although Haemophilus influenzae is recognized as a major pathogen of infants, its role in maternal and neonatal infections is not as well appreciated.
 We analyzed the records of all mothers and neonates infected with H influenzae over a 10-year period.
 Twenty-eight mother/neonate sets were identified in which at least one had documented infection with H influenzae.
 Of the 18 mothers with documented infection, 13 had chorioamnionitis, endometritis, or both, and two of these mothers were bacteremic with H influenzae.
 Of the 23 infected neonates, 15 presented with early sepsis and/or pneumonia and nine had conjunctivitis.
 During the period of the study, only group B streptococci and Escherichia coli were more common as causes of early neonatal bacteremia.
 Under the conditions of this retrospective study, maternal infection predicted neonatal infection.
 However, prospective studies in which asymptomatic patients are cultured will be required to determine how well maternal colonization/infection with H influenzae predicts neonatal infection.
