Yersinia enterocolitica tenosynovitis. The first case.
 We describe a case of tenosynovitis of tibialis posterior due to Yersinia enterocolitica occurring after injury by a plant thorn in a 55-year-old man.
 The illness was chronic with 2 recurrences in spite of antibiotic treatment.
 Full recovery was obtained only after surgical intervention.
 Our patient's chronic course was fostered by the persistence of thorn fragments in the infected area and the exceptionally pathogenic character of the isolated colony of Yersinia.
