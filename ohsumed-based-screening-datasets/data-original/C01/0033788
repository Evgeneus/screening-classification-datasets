Gonorrhea care in a clinic for low-income patients.
 There are few studies from family practice offices summarizing experience with culture-proven gonorrhea.
 Seventy-nine such cases were identified over a six-year period in a family practice model office in Gainesville, Florida, a rate of 5.8 cases per 10,000 patient visits.
 Ninety-six percent of the patients in the study had limited financial resources by insurance classification.
 The most commonly recognized presentations in men were complaints of discharge or dysuria or both.
 Nine (15%) of the women gave a history of contact with a person said to have a sexually transmitted disease, but none of the men did.
 Of the 62 women, gonorrhea was found on routine cervical culture in only two (3%), 38 (61%) had pelvic pain, and 40 (65%) had discharge as an initial complaint.
 Fifty-one of the patients (88%) reported symptomatic improvement with treatment, and seven (12%) reported no improvement by the treatment.
 Post-treatment gonorrhea cultures were positive in two (3%), negative in thirty-three (42%), not done in seventeen (22%), and twenty-seven of the patients (34%) did not return for scheduled follow-up.
 Difficulties in treating patients with gonorrhea in this population appeared to be largely related to problems with patient follow-up.
