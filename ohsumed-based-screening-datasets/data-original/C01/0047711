Sudden hearing loss due to AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis--a temporal bone study.
 We have presented the clinical history and temporal bone findings in a patient who manifested sudden hearing loss, and who subsequently was found to have cryptococcal meningitis associated with AIDS.
 The histopathologic findings are similar to earlier reports in patients without AIDS.
 Because cryptococcal infection is so much more common in AIDS patients than in the general population, it must be considered a causative factor when presented with an AIDS patient with progressive or sudden hearing loss.
 This offers the patient a chance for timely and effective treatment.
