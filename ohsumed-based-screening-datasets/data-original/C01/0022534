Fungal skin infections associated with animal contact.
 Zoophilic dermatophytes are fungal organisms that primarily infect animals but occasionally infect humans.
 The most common of these are Microsporum canis and Trichophyton mentagrophytes.
 The clinical lesions of zoophilic fungal infections are more inflammatory than those caused by the typical anthropophilic fungi normally transmitted from person to person.
 To diagnose zoophilic fungal infections, a potassium hydroxide preparation of the skin scrapings may be examined microscopically or a culture may be obtained.
 Small lesions located anywhere except on the scalp may be treated with a topical antifungal agent.
 Oral griseofulvin is preferred for the treatment of scalp infections and extensive cutaneous infections.
