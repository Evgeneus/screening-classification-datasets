Clinical experience with aztreonam for treatment of infections in children.
 The in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics, bactericidal activity, and tissue penetration of aztreonam suggest that it may play a role in therapy for serious gram-negative bacterial infections in children.
 Several thousand children throughout the world received aztreonam during open or comparative clinical trials for treatment of infections including pyelonephritis, bacteremia, meningitis, skeletal infection, pneumonia, and peritonitis.
 Cure rates have ranged from 92% to 100%, with relapses seen mainly in children with obstructive renal lesions and those with infections caused by Salmonella.
 A comparative trial of aztreonam for treatment of neonatal sepsis showed it to be at least as effective as amikacin for this infection.
 Aztreonam yielded clinical results comparable to those of conventional combined therapy for pulmonary infection in patients with cystic fibrosis.
 Adverse effects in pediatric trials have been uncommon; fever, diarrhea, or rash occurred in less than 2% of treated children.
 Reversible laboratory abnormalities have occasionally been noted.
 On the basis of these data, aztreonam is considered an appropriate alternative agent for the treatment of serious gram-negative bacterial infections in neonates and children.
 Further comparative clinical trials will delineate specific indications.
