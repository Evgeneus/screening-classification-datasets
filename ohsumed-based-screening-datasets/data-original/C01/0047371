Inhibition of Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase and Pseudomonas keratitis using a thiol-based peptide.
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase is a zinc metalloproteinase which is released during P.
 aeruginosa infections.
 Pseudomonas keratitis, which occurs following contact lens-induced corneal trauma, can lead to rapid, liquefactive necrosis of the cornea.
 This destruction has been attributed to the release of both host-derived enzymes and the bacterial products P.
 aeruginosa elastase, alkaline protease, exotoxin A, and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin.
 A synthetic metalloproteinase inhibitor, HSCH2 (DL)CH[CH2CH(CH3)2]CO-Phe-Ala-NH2, which we previously showed to be a potent inhibitor of corneal collagenase and alkali-induced corneal ulceration, was tested as a potential inhibitor of P.
 aeruginosa elastase.
 Inhibition constants (Kis) for the resolved diastereomers were determined with the chromogenic substrate furylacryloyl-glycyl-L-leucyl-L-alanine.
 One isomer had a Ki of 0.3 microM, while the other had a Ki of 0.4 microM.
 The more potent diastereomer was evaluated in vivo in experimentally induced Pseudomonas keratitis in rabbits.
 Following inoculation of one cornea of each rabbit, topical treatment with a 1 mM solution of the inhibitor significantly delayed the onset of corneal melting and perforation, as compared with the results for the control and gentamicin-treated groups.
 This protective effect suggests that the inhibitor may have a therapeutic application by delaying the progression of corneal destruction in Pseudomonas keratitis.
