Late recurrent Candida endocarditis.
 Late recurrent Candida endocarditis (LRCE) developed on a prosthetic mitral valve 22 months after treatment for primary native mitral valve endocarditis.
 The LRCE was difficult to diagnose; results of two dimensional echocardiography and repeated blood cultures were negative.
 Only transesophageal echocardiography revealed a vegetation and only lysis centrifugation blood cultures demonstrated candidemia.
 Postmortem examination revealed a large Candida vegetation on the prosthetic valve and Candida in the mitral valve ring.
 This case and a review of the literature indicate that Candida endocarditis treated with amphotericin B and prosthetic valve replacement may recur months after treatment, and that LRCE, which is difficult to diagnose and treat, may be best prevented by lifelong antifungal suppressive therapy.
