An external urine collection device for incontinent women. Evaluation of long-term use.
 Urinary incontinence is common in aged women, may precipitate nursing home admission, and may prompt use of a urine collection device, usually an indwelling urethral catheter.
 The safety and efficacy of a new external urine collection device for women that is affixed to the perineum by an adhesive developed for ostomy bags was evaluated.
 Applied to 26 aged women, 78% of 2,264 devices were leak-free for 24 hours and 49% for 48 hours.
 The incidence of new bacteriuria was less than half that found in our earlier studies of long-term urethral catheters in the same institution.
 Perineal erythema was infrequent and preexisting decubitus ulcers improved or did not change.
 Four patients were withdrawn, one each because of periurethral itching, diminished urine output, recurrent wetness, and fracture of the proximal femur associated with severe osteoporosis.
 This device may offer an alternative to urethral catheters for management of urinary incontinence but should not be used on women with urine retention and should be used with care on women with severe osteoporosis.
 Controlled trials must determine effects upon bacteriologic complications and health-care costs.
