Isolated articular melioidosis.
 Melioidosis is an infection caused by a gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas pseudomallei.
 This organism can cause fatal infection in domestic animals and are probably transmitted to humans by soil contamination of skin abrasions, ingestion, and inhalation.
 Melioidosis is being increasingly diagnosed in Western countries in other than its endemic areas of tropical and subtropical zones.
 In the past, only a few single case reports of articular melioidosis were published in English journals, and almost all were secondary to melioidosis of another organ.
 Accurate diagnosis of this infection is important because a high mortality rate is usually associated with the septicemic form.
 Nine cases of isolated articular involvement were diagnosed between 1984 and 1988 in Northeast Thailand.
 Symptoms were subtle and diagnosis required a high degree of suspicion.
 Diagnosis depended on bacteriologic methods including Gram's stain, pus and blood cultures, and on an indirect hemagglutination titer of over 1:40.
 In addition to general measures for septic arthritis, antibiotic therapy using a combination of intravenous cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol was generally satisfactory.
 Second line drugs (i.e., more effective but also more expensive drugs that the authors administered when patients failed to respond to the first line drugs cotrimoxazole, doxycycline, and chloramphenicol) comprising intravenous ceftazidime and cotrimoxazole were administered in cases with an underlying disease.
 Comparison of the disease course before and during hospitalization as well as the total days of treatment between two small groups of patients with and without underlying disease revealed no statistically significant difference.
