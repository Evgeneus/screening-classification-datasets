Pyogenic sacroiliitis in a rural population.
 We describe 10 cases of pyogenic sacroiliitis occurring in a rural population.
 Seven were male and 3 were female with a mean age of 22.4 years.
 None was a recent intravenous drug abuser.
 Five patients had a history of recent pelvic trauma.
 99mTechnetium scintiscans revealed increased sacroiliac (SI) joint uptake in 8 of 8 cases.
 Blood cultures were positive in 60% of patients.
 Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in 7 cases from blood and/or SI aspirates and Hemophilus influenzae type B in one case.
 Nine of 10 patients recovered completely.
 One underwent arthrodesis for recurrent SI pain without evidence of relapse of infection.
 Median followup was 18 months.
