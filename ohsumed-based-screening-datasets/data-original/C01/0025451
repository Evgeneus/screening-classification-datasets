Comparative in vitro and in vivo activities of six new monofluoroquinolone and difluoroquinolone 3-carboxylic acids with a 7-azetidin ring substituent.
 E-4502, E-4501, E-4500, E-4480, E-4474, and E-4441 are new monofluorinated or difluorinated quinolone agents that are chemically characterized by the presence of an azetidin ring, with different C'-3 substituents, at position 7 of the molecular structure.
 The MICs of the difluorinated compounds E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 for 90% of isolates were 0.06 to 1, 0.06 to 1, and 0.12 to 1 microgram/ml, respectively, against gram-positive organisms (staphylococci, streptococci, and Enterococcus faecalis); 0.0015 to 0.12, 0.015 to 0.12, and 0.03 to 0.12 microgram/ml, respectively, against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except Providencia spp.; and 1, 1, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively, against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 inhibited all anaerobic bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively.
 Difluorinated compounds were significantly more active than the corresponding monofluorinated analogs E-4502, E-4500, and E-4480 against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms, as well as against anaerobes.
 Considering monofluorinated and difluorinated compounds, activity in moderate ascending order was observed in quinolones containing an amine and a methyl group (E-4441 and E-4480), an amine group (E-4474 and E-4500), and a methylamine group (E-4501 and E-4502) in the C'-3 position of the azetidin ring.
 E-4501, E-4474, and E-4441 were more active than norfloxacin and DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], had activities comparable to or slightly lower than that of ciprofloxacin against gram-negative bacteria, and were more active than all the reference quinolones against gram-positive organisms and anaerobes.
