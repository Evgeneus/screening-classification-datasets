Pneumococcal bacterial tracheitis.
 Bacterial tracheitis is an uncommon cause of acute respiratory distress in children.
 The authors present a case of bacterial tracheitis in a 6-year-old girl caused by an unusual pathogen, Streptococcus pneumoniae.
 Her clinical presentation and radiographic findings are typical for an older child.
 Management of this case involved endotracheal intubation, although a review of the literature suggests that airway management can vary with age and size of the tracheal lumen.
 The microbiology of bacterial tracheitis shows a predominance of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus reported previously, with only three prior reported cases of Pneumococcus.
