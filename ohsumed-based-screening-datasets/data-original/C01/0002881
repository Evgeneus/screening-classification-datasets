SCH-39304 in prevention and treatment of disseminated candidiasis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits.
 To investigate the potential use of SCH-39304 for the prevention and treatment of disseminated candidiasis in granulocytopenic patients, we studied its in vivo antifungal activity as preventive, early, and late treatments in three models (acute, subacute, and chronic) of disseminated candidiasis in persistently granulocytopenic rabbits.
 SCH-39304 was an effective as amphotericin B alone and fluconazole alone for the prevention of disseminated candidiasis.
 SCH-39304 alone and fluconazole alone were as effective as amphotericin B plus flucytosine for early treatment of subacute disseminated candidiasis.
 When treatment was delayed for 5 days to establish chronic disseminated candidiasis, SCH-39304 was less effective than amphotericin B plus flucytosine.
 In comparison with different treatment regimens, SCH-39304 was more effective in early and preventive treatment.
 Thus, SCH-39304 was comparable to treatment control regimens in prevention and early treatment of subacute disseminated candidiasis.
 SCH-39304 also was most effective in granulocytopenic rabbits with disseminated candidiasis when used for prevention or early treatment.
