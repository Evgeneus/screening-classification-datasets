Neuroleptic malignant syndrome and Escherichia coli urosepsis.
 Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a rare but potentially life-threatening reaction to neuroleptic drugs.
 The syndrome develops rapidly, and may occur at the initiation of neuroleptic therapy or after long-term use; its pathogenesis is unclear.
 The signs and symptoms associated with the syndrome are hyperpyrexia, extreme muscle rigidity, an altered level of consciousness, and autonomic dysfunction.
 We describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a patient who had Escherichia coli urosepsis caused by thioridazine.
