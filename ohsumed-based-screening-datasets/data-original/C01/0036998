Role of the beta-lactamase of Campylobacter jejuni in resistance to beta-lactam agents.
 We studied the role of the beta-lactamase of Campylobacter jejuni in resistance to beta-lactam agents.
 beta-Lactamase-positive strains were more resistant than beta-lactamase-negative strains to amoxicillin, ampicillin, and ticarcillin (P less than 0.05).
 With penicillin G, piperacillin, imipenem, and six cephalosporins, the susceptibility levels were similar for both beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains.
 By using spectrophotometric and microbiological assays, the beta-lactamase from three strains hydrolyzed ampicillin, amoxicillin, penicillin G, cloxacillin, and, partially, cephalothin.
 Ticarcillin and piperacillin were partially hydrolyzed in the microbiological assay.
 There was no activity against five other cephalosporins or imipenem.
 Isoelectric focusing of the enzyme showed a pI of 8.8.
 Tazobactam was the best inhibitor of the enzyme, followed by clavulanic acid, sulbactam, and cefoxitin, while EDTA and p-chloromercuribenzoate had no activity.
 All beta-lactamase-positive strains became susceptible to amoxicillin and ampicillin with 1 micrograms of clavulanic acid per ml.
 With the same inhibitor, there was a reduced but significant effect for ticarcillin but no effect for penicillin G or piperacillin.
 Sulbactam had no effect and tazobactam was effective only at 2 micrograms/ml on amoxicillin and ampicillin.
 The beta-lactamase of C.
 jejuni seems to be a penicillinase with a role in resistance for only amoxicillin, ampicillin, and ticarcillin.
