In vitro activities of new antimicrobial agents against multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from septicemic patients during a Belgian national survey from 1983 to 1985.
 The antimicrobial agents most active against bacteremic isolates of oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from 1983 to 1985 were new fluoroquinolones, including PD 117,596 and PD 127,391 (MIC for 90% of isolates [MIC90] in agar, in micrograms per milliliter, 0.1) and temafloxacin, pefloxacin, and ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.4).
 Other active antimicrobial agents included fusidic acid (MIC90, 0.2) and fosfomycin (MIC90, 12.5).
 Vancomycin was active against all isolates.
 Mupirocin was very active (MIC90, 0.4).
