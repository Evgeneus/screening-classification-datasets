Diagnosis and laparoscopic grading of acute salpingitis.
 Pelvic inflammatory disease continues to be a major cause of morbidity in women of reproductive age.
 Findings of bilateral adnexal tenderness and signs of a lower genital tract infection (mucopus, or leukorrhea, or both) should prompt clinicians to consider the diagnosis of salpingitis in this group of women.
 Additional signs of infection, such as elevated temperature, palpable adnexal complex, leukocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, or c-reactive protein, and positive tests for either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis will improve the overall specificity of the clinical diagnosis.
 Endometrial biopsy offers an acceptable approach to documenting objectively inflammation of the upper genital tract.
 Diagnostic laparoscopy should be considered in all patients but may be especially helpful for those patients in whom a diagnosis is unclear.
 A laparoscopic grading system based primarily on tubal mobility and inflammation can be useful in predicting duration of in-hospital therapy and future tubal factor infertility.
