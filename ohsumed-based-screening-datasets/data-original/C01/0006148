Management of Peyronie disease by implantation of inflatable penile prosthesis.
 Sixty-seven patients with advanced Peyronie disease were treated by implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP).
 Twenty-eight of the 67 patients had documented total erectile failure.
 The remaining 39 patients had significant penile curvature causing "mechanical impotence" due to inability to achieve adequate vaginal penetration and chose implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis (in some cases, combined with a straightening procedure) rather than one of the standard penile straightening procedures.
 Currently, 63 of the 67 patients have functioning prosthetic devices; in 3 other patients the device was removed because of infection, and 1 patient was dissatisfied and had the device removed.
 For impotent patients with severe Peyronie disease for whom other medical or surgical treatment is neither desirable nor suitable, we recommend implantation of an inflatable penile prosthesis combined with a possible straightening procedure.
