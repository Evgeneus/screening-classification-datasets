Necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis in a patient receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for non-small cell lung carcinoma.
 We describe a case of necrotizing bronchial aspergillosis which developed after lobectomy following neoadjuvant chemotherapy in a 73-year-old woman with non-small cell lung cancer.
 The lesion was visualized and biopsied through FBS, which played a useful role for early diagnosis of this disease.
 Itraconazole therapy was effective and safe.
