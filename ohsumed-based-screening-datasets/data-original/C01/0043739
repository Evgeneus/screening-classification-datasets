Community- and hospital-acquired respiratory syncytial virus infections in Chile.
 Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained on admission from 614 patients younger than 2 years of age who were hospitalized in a ward for acute respiratory infections from June 1988 through October, 1989, in Santiago, Chile.
 Patients in two rooms were followed during the cold seasons by sampling aspirates every other day during the child's entire hospital stay.
 Clinical features were recorded daily.
 Indirect monoclonal immunofluorescent assay and isolation in HEp-2 were used for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) diagnosis.
 The mean RSV detection rate was 39% at the time of admission, ranging from 8% in April, 1989, to 62% in July, 1988.
 During the cold months 43 of 288 (15%) nosocomial RSV cases were detected.
 Pneumonia and wheezing bronchitis were the principal diagnoses of both groups admitted, whether they were shedding RSV or not.
 It is concluded that RSV plays a major role in admissions for acute respiratory infections, as well as in nosocomial infections, in Santiago.
 Because clinical features do not allow one to differentiate viral from bacterial acute respiratory infections, the importance of rapid viral diagnosis is emphasized.
