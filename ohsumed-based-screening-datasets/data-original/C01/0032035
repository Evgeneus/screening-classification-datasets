Oral mucosal soft tissue necrosis caused by superinfection. Report of three cases.
 Three patients in whom flap necrosis developed after oral surgeries and antibiotic therapies were studied microbiologically by routine aerobic and anaerobic methods.
 In all cases the bacteria Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and coagulase-negative penicillinase-producing staphylococci were resistant to the antibiotics used.
 These bacteria are frequent microorganisms of superinfection and were not found after the necrotic tissues had repaired.
