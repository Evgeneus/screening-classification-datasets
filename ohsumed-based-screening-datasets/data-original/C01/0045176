Rapid diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
 Using a rapid and highly sensitive method for the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we detected the Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome in CSF of 5 of 6 patients with clinically diagnosed tuberculous meningitis.
 The genome was not present in CSF from 10 patients with other types of meningitis and 10 normal controls.
