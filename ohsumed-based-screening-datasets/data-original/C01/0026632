Chlamydia trachomatis induces an inflammatory response in the male genital tract and is associated with altered semen quality.
 U.
 urealyticum with 15.8% and C.
 trachomatis antibodies with 15.4% were the most prevalent microbiological findings in 209 male infertility patients.
 The inflammatory marker granulocyte-elastase was significantly increased in men with C.
 trachomatis; these men also showed significantly decreased citric acid levels indicating inflammatory damage of the prostate induced by C.
 trachomatis.
