Salmonella meningitis and infection with HIV.
 Patients infected with HIV demonstrate increased susceptibility to serious infections with non-typhoidal salmonellae.
 However, no cases of salmonella meningitis have been reported in this population.
 We now report three cases of salmonella meningitis which occurred in a population of 1800 patients with AIDS or AIDS-related complex at our hospitals.
 The incidence of meningitis complicating salmonella infection in our HIV-infected population appears to be much higher than that reported in non-AIDS patients (7.5 versus 0.15%).
 All had cerebrospinal fluid parameters consistent with bacterial meningitis, and two of three revealed organisms on cerebrospinal fluid Gram stain.
 Two presented with a fulminant illness and died despite therapy; the third developed a brain abscess associated with a relapse of meningitis.
 Salmonella meningitis should be considered as a cause of acute neurological deterioration in patients at risk for HIV-related disease.
 Relapses may occur, and mortality is high.
