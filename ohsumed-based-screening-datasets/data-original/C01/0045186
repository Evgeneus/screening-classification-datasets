Invasive aspergillosis of the maxilla in an immunocompromised patient.
 Patients who are immunocompromised have a high susceptibility to infection, which can be fatal.
 Studies have shown that patients receiving chemotherapeutic and adjunctive medications have inhibited inflammatory response to microbes, particularly those increasing the potential for the development of invasive infection.
 Aspergillus is a fungus often found in the atmosphere.
 Colonization of Aspergillus in the upper respiratory tract is common.
 In the immunocompromised patient, Aspergillus flavus is found to be the most frequent fungus cultured in the maxillary sinus.
 Because of the depressed immunologic state of the patient, A.
 flavus can differentiate into hyphal forms producing toxins that destroy epithelial tissues.
 Penetration of Aspergillus into connective and vascular tissue produces thrombosis and ultimately necrosis of hard and soft tissue.
