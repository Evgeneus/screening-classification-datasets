Primary intrasellar coccidioidomycosis simulating a pituitary adenoma.
 The case of a 68-year-old woman who had relatively acute, unilateral ophthalmoplegia is reported.
 Radiological studies indicated a mass lesion involving the pituitary gland and left cavernous sinus.
 Pathological tissue obtained by the transsphenoidal approach revealed the presence of a Coccidioides granuloma.
 This pathological entity should be considered when evaluating patients with a pituitary mass and ophthalmoplegia.
