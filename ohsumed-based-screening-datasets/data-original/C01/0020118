Flavimonas oryzihabitans (Pseudomonas oryzihabitans; CDC group Ve-2) bacteremia in the immunocompromised host.
 Flavimonas oryzihabitans, known previously as Pseudomonas oryzihabitans, and a member of the Centers for Disease Control group Ve-2, is a gram-negative organism that has rarely been implicated as a human pathogen.
 Flavimonas oryzihabitans appears to be a soil and saprophytic organism that survives in moist environments and is indigenous to rice paddles.
 To our knowledge, only seven cases of human infection caused by this organism have been reported; they involved four patients with bacteremia and three patients with peritonitis who were receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 In this report, we describe three immunocompromised patients with catheter-associated bacteremia: a patient with cancer, a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and a patient with sickle cell disease.
 There is emerging clinical evidence that F oryzihabitans should be recognized as an organism that is capable of causing human disease, particularly in immunocompromised patients and with the increased usage of permanent catheters.
