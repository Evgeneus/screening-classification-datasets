Clue cells in predicting infections after abdominal hysterectomy.
 Seventy women scheduled for abdominal hysterectomy were examined for the presence of clue cells in the vaginal discharge in an attempt to identify a possible risk group for development of postoperative infection.
 Seven of 20 women (35%) with clue cells developed vaginal cuff infections or wound infections, compared with four of 50 women (8%) without clue cells (P less than .01).
 Women with bacterial vaginosis, diagnosed by air-dried vaginal smears, are therefore at risk for postoperative infection.
