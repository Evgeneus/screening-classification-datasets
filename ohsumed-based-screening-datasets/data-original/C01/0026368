Tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 appearance in experimental gram-negative septic shock. The effects of plasma exchange with albumin and plasma infusion.
 To study the effect of plasma removal vs plasma administration on the appearance of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin 1 in septic shock, 24 anesthetized piglets were inoculated with live Escherichia coli.
 Plasma exchange with albumin was performed in one group.
 Fresh-frozen plasma was administered to a second group.
 A third group served as nontreated controls.
 Following plasma exchange, a reduction in both TNF and interleukin 1 levels occurred, whereas plasma infusion was followed by a decrease in TNF levels only.
 No significant differences were observed between the two treated groups with respect to survival or cardiovascular performance, with both being significantly enhanced compared with the controls.
 High levels of TNF and interleukin 1 correlated with depressed cardiovascular performance in the early phase of the shock.
 Our results confirm the important role of TNF and interleukin 1 as early mediators of septic shock.
 However, the benefit of reducing cytokine activity in later stages of septicemia seems to be dubious.
