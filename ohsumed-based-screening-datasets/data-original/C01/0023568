A 20-minute breath test for helicobacter pylori.
 In this study, we evaluated a simplified rapid 14C-urea breath test for the diagnosis of Helicobacter pylori.
 Fasting patients undergoing initial assessment for H.
 pylori drank 5 microCi of 14C-urea in 20 ml of water.
 Breath was collected at intervals for 30 min.
 Samples were counted in a beta-counter, and the results were expressed as counts per minute (cpm).
 In the same week, patients underwent endoscopy, and a blinded investigator examined biopsy samples of gastric mucosa by culture and histology for H.
 pylori.
 There were 49 H.
 pylori-negative (HP-) and 104 H.
 pylori-positive (HP+) patients in the study.
 HP+ patients expired a mean of 4398 cpm (SD 2468) per mmol CO2 in a sample taken 20 min after ingestion of the isotope.
 In contrast, HP--patients expired only 340 cpm (SD 196).
 If the mean +3 SD of HP- patients was used as a cutoff value, the 20-minute sample gave a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 100% for detecting H.
 pylori.
 The radiation exposure from this test is less than 1% of that received from an upper gastrointestinal series, and the short collection time makes it both convenient and cost effective.
