Nosocomial bacteremias in measles.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether nosocomial bacteremias occurred more frequently in patients admitted with severe measles compared with general pediatric admissions.
 In a retrospective survey of 977 blood culture reports during a 4-year period, 1985 to 1988, the incidence of nosocomial bacteremias in patients with measles was found to be on the average of 3.37/100 admissions/year, approximately 6 times that of general pediatric patients (0.57).
 Gram-negative organisms (predominantly Klebsiella and Salmonella species) accounted for 86.5% of all isolates from measles patients, with 23% of these being multiply antibiotic-resistant.
 All the isolates from the general patients were fully susceptible to antibiotics.
 The duration of hospitalization was more than doubled in both groups of affected patients.
 The onset of hospital-acquired bacteremias occurred on an average of 11.2 days after admission in the patients with measles and 20.5 days in the general patients.
 Our findings revealed that nosocomial bacteremias occurred with greater frequency in patients with measles and contributed to the morbidity of these patients.
