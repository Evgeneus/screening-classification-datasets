A rare case of 'coccidioidoma' of the breast.
 Coccidioidomycosis has been reported in almost every tissue of the human body.
 The gastrointestinal tract and breast have been uniquely spared from this fungal infection.
 Despite the exceedingly large number of screening mammographies that are performed every year, to our knowledge subcutaneous breast tissue involvement as the sole presentation or of secondary spread of coccidioidomycosis has not been reported.
 We describe a patient who showed an unusual manifestation of a coccidioidal breast nodule simulating a neoplasm.
 The patient had been transiently immunosuppressed by prednisone therapy for presumptive temporal arteritis.
