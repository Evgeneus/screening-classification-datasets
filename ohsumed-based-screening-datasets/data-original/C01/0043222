Gram-negative sepsis. Background, clinical features, and intervention.
 Gram-negative sepsis remains an urgent medical problem, with more than 200,000 cases occurring each year in the United States and an associated mortality rate of 20 to 50 percent.
 Since the onset of shock greatly worsens prognosis and to encourage early intervention, the term sepsis syndrome was developed to describe the features of a preshock septic state.
 Early clinical and metabolic indicators are discussed, and current therapy is reviewed.
 Better understanding of the pathophysiology of endotoxin release from Gram-negative bacteria and advances in biotechnology have led to the development of potential new treatments for sepsis.
 One such development--monoclonal antibodies to endotoxin--has shown great promise in the effort to block the progression to septic shock, reduce mortality, and decrease the overall costs of sepsis to the patient and to the national economy.
