Cystic fibrosis. Infection and immunity to Pseudomonas.
 Chronic pulmonary infection with P.
 aeruginosa in CF may result from: 1.
 An initial failure of clearance mechanisms (increased adherence) leading to the development of a highly compartmentalized inflammatory reaction; 2.
 Inhibition of clearing mechanisms for bacteria present in the bronchial lumen; and 3.
 A largely ineffective, and possibly damaging, hyperactivity of inflammatory cells in the lumen and bronchial wall.
 The special relationship between the CF host and P.
 aeruginos, always long-term, and frequently subtle in its complexity, needs further understanding in order to develop new strategies for the treatment of chronic lung infections with this organism.
