Torulopsis glabrata vaginitis: clinical aspects and susceptibility to antifungal agents.
 Torulopsis glabrata is second only to Candida albicans in frequency of isolation from the vagina in both asymptomatic women and patients with yeast vaginitis.
 We retrospectively studied 33 patients from whom vaginal isolates of T glabrata were obtained.
 Torulopsis glabrata caused symptomatic vaginitis in 42% of the patients but was unassociated with symptoms in 30%; in 27% of patients, its importance was uncertain because of concomitant pathology.
 Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed on 39 T glabrata strains isolated from 39 patients.
 The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the majority of T glabrata isolates fell within the sensitive range of the antimycotic drugs tested; however, no correlation was found between in vitro antifungal MICs and the response to azole drug therapy.
 Clinical success was achieved in 67% of the patients although mycologic cure occurred in only 33%.
 A small number of patients developed recurrent and often chronic Torulopsis vaginitis unresponsive to conventional therapy.
 Limited experience suggests that vaginal boric acid therapy may be of value in these recalcitrant cases.
