Nonprescription drugs and hypertension. Which ones affect blood pressure?
 Hypertensive patients should be aware of the possible effects of nonprescription medications on blood pressure control.
 For absolute safety, no adrenergic agents should be used.
 Nasal phenylephrine hydrochloride is probably the safest of these agents, and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride may also be safe.
 Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride and ephedrine sulfate are probably best avoided.
 The effects of other adrenergic agents (eg, epinephrine) on blood pressure have not been clinically evaluated.
 Ibuprofen may elevate blood pressure if taken in maximum over-the-counter doses for more than a few days.
 The ethanol and sodium chloride content of nonprescription drugs taken in recommended doses does not appear to pose a great hazard.
