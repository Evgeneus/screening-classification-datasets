Relationship between coronary blood flow and perfusion pressure during reactive hyperemia: a case report in an awake unanesthetized woman with normal coronary arteries.
 The linear relationship between coronary blood flow and mean arterial pressure during reactive hyperemia is presented for the first time in an awake unanesthetized woman with normal coronary arteries during systemic hypotension induced by pharmacologic vasodilation.
 This case demonstrates the critical dependence of coronary flow reserve on simultaneous perfusion pressure.
