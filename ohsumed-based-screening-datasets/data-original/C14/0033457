Surgical treatment and prevention of vasculopathic impotence in conjunction with revascularisation of the lower extremities in Leriche's syndrome.
 The results are presented of combined revascularization of the lower extremities and the penis in 29 patients with Leriche's syndrome.
 This was effected by placing an autogenous venous shunt between the branch of a prosthesis or the common femoral artery and one of the dorsal arteries of the penis.
 Preoperatively lost sexual function was restored in 6 patients, while in 16 the sexual function was maintained at the preoperative level or improved in the late postoperative period.
 A comparison of the results obtained with the sexual performance of patients who had undergone bifurcated aortofemoral shunting only, prompted the conclusion that this surgical procedure was effective in the prevention and treatment of vasculopathic impotence in Leriche's syndrome.
