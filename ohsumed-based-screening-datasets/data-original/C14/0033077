Management of hypertensive emergencies: changing therapeutic options.
 Rapid lowering of severe hypertension is essential to prevent irreversible damage to vital organs.
 The patient's clinical status should be evaluated, noting particularly cardiac, neurologic, and renal functions.
 Choice of treatment should be based on speed and efficacy of action and on hemodynamic, vascular, and renal consequences.
 It is also important to preserve circulatory homeostasis and vital organ function.
 Sodium nitroprusside, labetalol, diazoxide, and hydralazine have been used parenterally for rapid control of severe hypertension, but they do not always produce optimal, balanced hemodynamic effects.
 Calcium antagonists have been advocated because of their beneficial circulatory effects.
 Nicardipine, a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, produces significant antihypertensive effects, and when given intravenously, results in a rapid fall in blood pressure.
 Studies have confirmed that nicardipine is effective and safe in the management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises.
 Because the aim of rapidly controlling severe hypertension is to prevent target organ dysfunction, nicardipine therapy offers a useful additional option in the clinical management of severe hypertension and hypertensive crises.
