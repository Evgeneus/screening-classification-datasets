Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty following surgical repair of sinus venosus atrial septal defect.
 Mitral valvuloplasty performed 5 y after repair of a sinus venosus ASD was difficult because of a thickened septum, but resulted in improved mitral valve opening and did not lead to ASD.
 Thus, prior repair of a sinus venosus ASD may not be an absolute contraindication to mitral valvuloplasty.
