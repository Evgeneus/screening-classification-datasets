Postprandial hypotension: microneurographic analysis and treatment with vasopressin.
 To clarify the mechanism of postprandial hypotension (PPH), we made microneurographic analyses of patients with PPH and 10 healthy controls by recording multi-unit vasoconstrictive impulses of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) directly from the tibial nerve fascicles during a glucose tolerance test.
 Oral intake of 75 grams glucose in 225 ml of water produced significant and prolonged hypotension in all patients and an increase in MSNA in all healthy subjects.
 Insulin and glucose responses were not significantly correlated with arterial blood pressure reduction.
 PPH was prevented by an infusion of vasopressin (0.3 U/min) given before glucose intake.
 These results suggest that PPH is caused by the lack of sympathetic compensation for the systemic hypotensive stress of splanchnic blood pooling that occurs after food ingestion, and that prior treatment with vasopressin reduces the portal venous flow by constricting the splanchnic vessels in patients with PPH.
