Endothelium-dependent responses of cerebral blood vessels during chronic hypertension.
 Acetylcholine produces less dilatation of pial arterioles in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) than in normotensive (WKY) rats.
 Responses of cerebral vessels to acetylcholine and bradykinin appear to involve different mechanisms.
 Our first goal was to determine whether responses of pial arterioles to bradykinin are impaired in SHRSP.
 Diameter of pial arterioles (20-60 microns) was measured using intravital microscopy in WKY rats and SHRSP (9-12 months old).
 Superfusion of bradykinin (3 x 10(-7) M) dilated pial arterioles by 35 +/- 6% (mean +/- SEM) in WKY rats, but only 21 +/- 3% in SHRSP (p less than 0.05 versus WKY rats).
 Both nitric oxide (5 x 10(-7) M) and nitroglycerin (10(-5) M) produced similar vasodilatation in WKY rats and SHRSP.
 Our second goal was to determine whether alteration of postreceptor mechanisms contributes to impairment of endothelium-dependent cerebral vasodilatation in SHRSP.
 Calcium ionophore A23187 (10(-5) M) produced more vasodilatation in WKY rats than in SHRSP (32 +/- 8% versus 9 +/- 4%, p less than 0.05).
 Responses to A23187 (10(-5) M) were inhibited by indomethacin (46 +/- 13% versus 15 +/- 5%, p less than 0.05) in WKY rats, whereas responses to A23187 (10(-6) M) were potentiated modestly by indomethacin (-3 +/- 2% versus 4 +/- 2%, p less than 0.05) in SHRSP.
