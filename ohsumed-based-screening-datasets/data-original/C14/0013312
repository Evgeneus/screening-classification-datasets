Role of endogenous angiotensin II in the control of vasopressin secretion during hypovolemia and hypotension in conscious rabbits.
 In order to investigate the physiological role of angiotensin II (ANG II) in the control of vasopressin (VP) secretion, the VP responses to hypotension induced by hemorrhage (20 ml/kg, n = 10) or nitroprusside infusion (1-10 micrograms/kg.min, n = 9) were studied with or without blockade of ANG II formation by the converting enzyme inhibitor captopril in conscious rabbits.
 Administration of captopril (5 mg/kg, iv) caused a small decrease in mean arterial pressure but did not enhance the hypotensive response to subsequent hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion.
 The renin response to both stimuli was enhanced by captopril, whereas the increase in plasma ANG II concentration was attenuated.
 Plasma VP (PAVP) concentration increased during hemorrhage (2.0 +/- 0.2-113.6 +/- 47.7 pg/ml, P less than 0.01) and nitroprusside infusion (2.1 +/- 0.3-5.1 +/- 1.0 pg/ml, P less than 0.01).
 Captopril did not change basal plasma PAVP, nor did it attenuate the VP responses to hemorrhage or nitroprusside.
 Indeed, captopril tended to enhance the VP responses to hemorrhage (2.3 +/- 0.3-147.1 +/- 65.9 pg/ml) and nitroprusside infusion (1.9 +/- 0.2-15.4 +/- 6.0 pg/ml).
 The relationship between log PAVP and mean arterial pressure during hemorrhage and nitroprusside infusion in the presence of captopril was not different than in the absence of captopril.
 These results indicate that in conscious rabbits, the renin-angiotensin system does not contribute to the increase in VP secretion during hypotension induced by hemorrhage or nitroprusside infusion.
