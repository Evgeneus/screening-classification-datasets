A nine-year experience with crossover femoro-femoro-popliteal sequential bypass.
 Multisegmental arterial occlusive disease may require a combined inflow and outflow procedure for optimal treatment of limb ischemia.
 Twenty-one patients with unilateral iliac artery stenosis or occlusion and ipsilateral superficial femoral artery occlusion underwent crossover femoro-femoro-popliteal sequential bypass during a 9-year period.
 Seventeen operations were for limb salvage.
 Patency rates were determined separately for each segment of the bypass.
 Primary patency rates for the femoro-femoral segment were 89%, 83%, and 57% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively.
 Primary patency rates for the femoro-popliteal segments were 68%, 62%, and 40% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively.
 Limb salvage rates were 100%, 90%, and 77% at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively.
 This experience indicates that femoro-femoro-popliteal bypass is an effective treatment in selected patients with severe ischemia due to combined iliac artery and superficial femoral artery disease.
