Assay of serum cardiac myosin heavy chain fragments in patients with acute myocardial infarction: determination of infarct size and long-term follow-up.
 To evaluate the correlation between myosin heavy chain release and the necrosis mass, serum levels of myosin heavy chain fragments were determined serially in 55 patients with acute myocardial infarction.
 Eight of these patients were successfully treated with thrombolytic agents: the others were not treated.
 The same myosin titration was applied to the sera of 25 dogs with an experimental myocardial infarction.
 Six of the dogs were successfully treated with thrombolytic agents.
 The time courses of the myosin concentrations are typical and monophasic for all patients with a noncomplex myocardial infarction.
 The values for the kinetic parameters of myosin release are comparable to those previously reported.
 We have now determined that cumulative myosin release significantly correlates with cumulative creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and lactate dehydrogenase release, as well as with thallium-201 distribution, as determined for different patient groups.
 Thrombolytic treatment does not seem to qualitatively upset myosin kinetics.
 The results obtained in dogs with or without thrombolysis conclusively indicate that myosin release is a quantitative index of the necrosis mass.
 From a practical point of view, a few serial determinations of serum levels of myosin heavy chains are enough to estimate the necrosed mass in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
 More generally, serum myosin titration could be useful in detecting any cardiac disturbance involving myocardial injury resulting in membrane leakage of cardiac cells.
