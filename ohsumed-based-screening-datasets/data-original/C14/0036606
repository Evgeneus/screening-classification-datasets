Effects of dynamic cardiomyoplasty on left ventricular performance and myocardial mechanics in dilated cardiomyopathy.
 We tested the hypothesis that dynamic cardiomyoplasty produces beneficial changes in the functional mechanics of the dilated, failing left ventricle.
 Chronic dilated cardiomyopathy was induced in seven mongrel dogs by rapid ventricular pacing (260 beats/min) for 3 to 4 weeks.
 After completion of the induction period, dynamic cardiomyoplasty was performed with the left latissimus dorsi muscle, paced synchronously with the R waves of the electrocardiogram (Medtronic SP1005).
 Instruments included an aortic flow probe, a left ventricular Millar pressure catheter, and piezoelectric sonomicrometric crystals on the left ventricle for measurements of wall thickness and minor and major axis dimensions.
 Data were obtained with the stimulator off and on.
 Statistical comparisons were made with Student's t test for paired data.
 Dynamic cardiomyoplasty increased the cardiac output of the failing heart (966 +/- 124 versus 1166 +/- 112 ml/min; p less than 0.01).
 Systolic shortening of both minor and major axis dimensions increased (3.1 +/- 0.3 versus 4.7 +/- 0.3 mm, p less than 0.01, and 4.6 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.9 mm, p less than 0.05, respectively).
 Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased by 16% (18 +/- 1 versus 15 +/- 1 mm Hg, p less than 0.01).
 Although skeletal muscle contraction increased the pressure development in the left ventricular chamber, mean systolic wall stress was diminished by concomitant changes in left ventricular dimensions (116,144 +/- 11,530 versus 101,268 +/- 7464 dynes/cm2, p less than 0.05).
 At end-systole, wall thickness increased (11.8 +/- 1.1 versus 12.7 +/- 1.1 mm, p less than 0.01), minor axis dimension decreased (51.3 +/- 1.4 versus 49.2 +/- 1.8 mm, p less than 0.01), and major axis dimension also decreased (85.6 +/- 3.3 versus 79.0 +/- 2.3 mm, p less than 0.05).
 Our detailed evaluation of left ventricular chamber mechanics suggests that dynamic cardiomyoplasty may have a role in ameliorating the functional and mechanical derangements associated with progression of dilated cardiomyopathy both by augmenting cardiac performance and by diminishing determinants of myocardial oxygen consumption.
