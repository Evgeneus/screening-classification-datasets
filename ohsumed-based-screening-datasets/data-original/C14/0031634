Beriberi heart disease in a schizophrenic with an unusual diet.
 A 37-year-old male presented with peripheral edema of sudden onset.
 Other signs of heart failure were absent.
 Subsequent evaluation revealed that the patient was a schizophrenic whose diet consisted almost entirely of carbohydrates.
 A clinical diagnosis of beriberi heart disease was made and the patient improved dramatically within several days of thiamine supplementation.
 The presentation of beriberi heart disease in developed countries is discussed.
 Emphasis is placed on food faddists and psychiatric patients in whom clinical findings may be subtle or absent.
