Clinical management of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy.
 Rapid delivery of thrombolytic therapy to suitable patients with acute myocardial infarction can limit myocardial damage and reduce the risk of death.
 This requires an emergency department team approach following a written protocol to initiate thrombolytic therapy within 45 minutes of the patient's arrival at the emergency department.
 Nurses and physicians caring for patients with acute myocardial infarction must be aware of inclusion and exclusion criteria, drug preparation, dosage and administration, recommended adjunctive therapies, and potential complications associated with pharmacologic thrombolysis.
 All patients with acute myocardial infarction should be carefully screened for their potential for receiving thrombolytic therapy with a favorable benefit/risk ratio.
