Regression of carotid plaques during low density lipoprotein cholesterol elimination.
 We performed serial prospective ultrasound examinations of four flat and 17 soft carotid plaques during an average of 17 months in seven patients with heterozygous hypercholesterolemia during heparin-induced extracorporeal low density lipoprotein elimination on precipitation from plasma.
 By means of a specially designed quantitative three-dimensional ultrasound analysis, significant plaque volume reduction could be evaluated in all subjects, along with a marked reduction of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and fibrinogen serum levels.
