Successful excision of a juvenile-type spinal arteriovenous malformation following intraoperative embolization. Case report.
 The case of a 57-year-old woman with a 14-year history of progressive paraparesis is presented.
 Selective spinal angiography revealed a juvenile-type spinal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with a typical large size and rapid flow.
 The AVM was located primarily in the retromedullary space at the cervicothoracic junction.
 The AVM was successfully obliterated by intraoperative embolization using isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate and surgical excision.
