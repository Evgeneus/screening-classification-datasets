False-negative dipyridamole-thallium-201 myocardial imaging after caffeine infusion.
 The vasodilator effect of intravenously administered dipyridamole may be caused by an increase in endogenous plasma adenosine levels.
 We evaluated the effect of caffeine, an adenosine receptor antagonist, on the diagnostic results of dipyridamole-201Tl myocardial imaging in eight patients with coronary artery disease.
 Caffeine infusion significantly attenuated the dipyridamole-induced fall in blood pressure and the accompanied increase in heart rate.
 The infusion of dipyridamole alone resulted in chest pain and ST-segment depressions on the electrocardiogram in four patients, whereas none of these problems occurred when the tests were repeated after caffeine.
 In six of eight patients, caffeine was responsible for false-negative dipyridamole-201Tl tests.
 Semiquantitive scores of the dipyridamole-induced 201Tl perfusion defects were decreased by caffeine from 9.0 +/- 0.9 to 2.0 +/- 1.1 points (p less than 0.05).
 Computerized analysis revealed a caffeine-mediated reduction in the percent reversibility of the images from 46% +/- 16% to 6% +/- 10% (p less than 0.05).
 We conclude that the use of caffeinated products prior to dipyridamole-201Tl testing may be responsible for false-negative findings.
