Fibrinopeptide A excretion in urine: a marker of the cumulative thrombin activity in stable versus unstable angina patients.
 Plasma levels and 24-hour urine excretion of fibrinopeptide A were measured in a consecutive series of 179 patients with angina pectoris.
 Sixty-four patients had stable angina and 115 patients had unstable angina.
 Urine was collected over 24 hours the day before coronary arteriography, and blood samples were taken at the end of urine collection.
 When the values of fibrinopeptide A in plasma and in the 24-hour urine specimens were compared, no significant correlation was found in patients with either stable (rs = 0.16, difference not significant) and unstable (rs = 0.07, difference not significant) angina.
 The concentrations of fibrinopeptide A in the plasma did not differ significantly when patients with stable angina (range 0.1 to 82.6, median 7.4 ng/mL) were compared with patients with unstable angina (range 0.2 to 61.7, median 14 ng/mL, p = 0.055), whereas fibrinopeptide A 24-hour urinary excretion was significantly higher in patients with unstable angina (range 0.3 to 38.1, median 11.8 micrograms/24 hr) than in patients with stable angina (range 0.4 to 38.1, median 3.8 micrograms/24 hr, p less than 0.001).
 Twenty-four-hour urine excretion of fibrinopeptide A in patients with unstable angina and angiographically documented intracoronary thrombi were higher than the corresponding values in patients with unstable angina without such angiographic characteristic (p less than 0.001).
 The largest increase in plasma and urine concentration of fibrinopeptide A was observed in patients whose first episode of angina at rest occurred within the previous 48 hours.
 We conclude that the cumulative thrombin activity, assessed by 24-hour urinary excretion of fibrinopeptide A, is a more useful index, compared with single fibrinopeptide A measurement in plasma, for discriminating between patients with stable and with unstable angina pectoris.
