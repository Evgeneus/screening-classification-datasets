Endoscopic laser surgery. A single-center comprehensive experience.
 A retrospective review of endoscopic procedures using the Nd:YAG laser was carried out for patients treated between October 1985 and March 1989.
 During this 42-month period 165 procedures were performed on 100 patients.
 The study encompasses a unique period of time in this center, as it includes the initial application, and finally, the time when its use became routine.
 Indications for laser surgery included the treatment of tumors, bleeding, benign strictures, arterial occlusions, and hemorrhoids.
 Nd:YAG laser was found to be effective in the treatment of these lesions.
 The overall success rate was 81 per cent.
 Patients who are poor surgical candidates would especially benefit from this therapeutic alternative.
