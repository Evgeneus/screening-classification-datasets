Results of multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in persons aged 65 years and older.
 Between 1981 and 1990, 1,373 patients, aged greater than or equal to 65 years (mean 71.2 +/- 4.9), underwent 1,640 multivessel percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures.
 Of these, 224 patients (13.6%) had a left ventricular ejection fraction less than or equal to 40%, 412 (25.1%) had prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and 48 (2.9%) had left main artery dilatation.
 Of the 1,640 PTCA procedures, 697 were in patients with 2-vessel disease and 943 were in patients with 3-vessel disease.
 A mean 3.5 lesions were dilated per patient, with an overall angiographic success rate of 96%.
 Complete revascularization was achieved in 857 (52%).
 A total of 52 patients (3.2%) had a major in-hospital complication: 27 patients (1.6%) died, 24 (1.4%) had a Q-wave myocardial infarction, and 14 (0.8%) underwent emergent CABG.
 Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified ejection fraction less than or equal to 40% (p less than or equal to 0.001), 3-vessel disease (p less than or equal to 0.01), female gender (p less than or equal to 0.02), and PTCA between 1981 and 1985 (p less than or equal to 0.05) as independent predictors of mortality.
 Of the 1,373 patients, 1,023 have been followed for greater than or equal to 1 year (mean follow-up 32.5 +/- 21.3 months).
 There were 156 (15.2%) late deaths, 81 (7.9%) recurrent myocardial infarctions, and 162 (15.8%) coronary artery bypass operations.
 Actuarial survival, computed from the time of hospital discharge, was 92% at 1 year, 86% at 3 years and 78% at 5 years.
 Repeat PTCA was required in 371 patients (36.3%).
