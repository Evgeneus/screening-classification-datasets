Double-blind comparison of perindopril and captopril in hypertension. Effects on left ventricular morphology and function.
 Using digitized M-mode echocardiograms, we compared, in a double-blind study, the effects of 4 to 8 mg perindopril given once daily and 25 to 50 mg captopril given twice daily on the left ventricle (LV) in 20 hypertensive patients.
 Both treatments significantly (P less than .001) lowered blood pressure, reducing systemic vascular resistances.
 After 3 months both drugs induced a comparable percentage of reduction in LV mass, with an increase in the peak rate of LV relaxation and no changes in the peak rate of LV contraction.
 Our results demonstrate that perindopril once daily is an effective antihypertensive agent; it is also able, like captopril, to induce regression of LV hypertrophy, with improvement in diastolic performance and no deterioration in ventricular systolic function.
