Surgical treatment of renovascular hypertension and respective late results. A twenty years experience.
 This paper presents the long term results following operative reconstruction for renovascular hypertension in 115 patients operated upon over a period of 20 years.
 There were 71 (61.7%) males and 44 (38.3%) females with a median age of 46 years (range 16-67).
 Renal revascularization was unilateral in 96 (83.4%) cases and bilateral in 19 (16.6%).
 Dacron knitted bypass grafts, were used in 51 and PTFE in 33 instances.
 Saphenous vein grafts were used in 11 patients.
 In 15 cases treatment was by local endarterectomy with concomitant angioplasty (12 unilateral and 3 bilateral).
 Simultaneous aortorenal reconstruction was undertaken in 38 (33%) patients.
 There were no deaths in the group with isolated renal artery reconstruction.
 In the group of aortorenal reconstructions, two deaths were encountered (5.7%).
 Postoperatively, blood pressure was either normal or improved in 83 (72%) patients at a mean follow-up period of 48.3 months (range 1-195 months).
 The best results were obtained in younger individuals with segmental renal artery lesions.
 Linear progression analysis, showed age to be a major determinant in the postoperative response to hypertension.
 There was a greater degree of long term success in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, as compared to individuals with atherosclerosis.
 Crude survival probabilities, were 78% and 61% at 5 and 10 years respectively.
 Late deaths encountered in the present series, were mostly attributable to myocardial infarction (7.8%).
 In this series, the best results were obtained in individuals younger than 50 years of age, with segmental renal artery lesions.
