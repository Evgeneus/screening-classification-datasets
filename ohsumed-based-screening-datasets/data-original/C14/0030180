Alpha 1 blockers. Safe, effective treatment for hypertension.
 Alpha 1-adrenergic blocking agents, used alone or in combination with other medications, are efficacious in the management of hypertension.
 They are safe and well tolerated, and they offer unique advantages.
 Their mechanism of action in lowering blood pressure targets elevated peripheral vascular resistance, which is the principal hemodynamic abnormality of essential hypertension.
 The alpha 1 blockers maintain cardiac output and blood flow to vital organs, and they do not affect renin release.
 These agents have beneficial lipid and metabolic effects and can improve left ventricular hypertrophy, theoretically having a positive impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
 The only drug interaction identified with the alpha 1 blockers is an increased hypotensive effect when they are combined with other antihypertensive agents.
 A further advantage of the alpha 1 blockers is that, because of the widespread location of alpha 1 receptors, the agents offer potential benefit for a number of disease states, including benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 They also provide an especially useful antihypertensive choice for middle-aged and elderly patients.
