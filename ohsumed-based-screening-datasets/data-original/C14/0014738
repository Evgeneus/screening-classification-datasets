Managing the whole patient with hypertension: practical applications in a clinical setting.
 Physicians are aware of the value of treating hypertension.
 Complications such as stroke and congestive heart failure are less likely to occur in the well-controlled patient.
 In our quest to add coronary heart disease to this list, we must go beyond simple reduction of blood pressure.
 We must consider other risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and family history.
 The presence of one or more of these may indicate a more aggressive treatment approach.
 Similarly the presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary disease, or renal disease may indicate specific pharmacotherapy.
 On the other hand, the low-risk patient with no other problems or conditions may be treated with only nonpharmacologic therapy such as weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and/or alcohol restriction.
 Every patient has a different constellation of findings.
 Every patient should be treated individually.
 It is no longer sufficient just to lower blood pressure; we need to manage the whole patient with hypertension; keeping in mind that most antihypertensive agents are equally effective, the side effect profile is often the decisive factor in choosing an antihypertensive agent.
