Unexplained syncope evaluated by electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical characteristics of subgroups of patients with unexplained syncope having electrophysiologic studies and head-up tilt testing and to assess the efficacy of various therapies.
 DESIGN: Retrospective study.
 SETTING: Inpatient services of a tertiary referral center.
 PATIENTS: Eighty-six consecutively referred patients with unexplained syncope.
 MEASUREMENTS: All patients had electrophysiologic examinations.
 Patients with negative results subsequently had head-up tilt testing.
 MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-nine (34%) patients (group 1) had abnormal electrophysiologic results, with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia induced in 72%.
 Thirty-four (40%) patients (group 2) had syncope provoked by head-up tilt testing.
 The cause of syncope remained unexplained in 23 (26%) patients (group 3).
 Structural heart disease was present in 76%, 6%, and 30% of groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
 In group 1, pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic therapy was recommended based on electrophysiologic evaluation.
 All group 2 patients had negative results on head-up tilt testing while receiving oral beta blockers (27 patients) or disopyramide (7 patients).
 Group 3 patients did not receive any specific therapy.
 During a median follow-up period of 18.5 months, syncope recurred in 9 (10%) patients.
 CONCLUSIONS: The combination of electrophysiologic evaluation and head-up tilt testing can identify the underlying cause of syncope in as many as 74% of patients presenting with unexplained syncope.
 Therapeutic strategies formulated according to the results of these diagnostic tests appear to prevent syncope effectively in most patients.
