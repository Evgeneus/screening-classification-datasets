Tracking of elevated blood pressure values in adolescent athletes at 1-year follow-up.
 Resting blood pressures were measured in 467 adolescents during preparticipation physical examinations for high school sports.
 Fifty-seven of the athletes (12.2%) had significantly elevated blood pressures.
 Forty-three (79.6%) of 54 subjects demonstrated significantly and persistently elevated blood pressures at 1-year follow-up.
 A family history of hypertension was positively associated with elevated blood pressures in 46 (80.7%) of 57 subjects compared with controls (23/410 [5.6%]).
 Consistent with previous studies, subjects with elevated blood pressures had a greater body weight (94.5 +/- 25.7 kg) compared with normotensive subjects (75.2 +/- 14.0 kg).
 Subjects with elevated blood pressures engaged in heavy resistance weight training (three times a week or more) more often (41/57 [71.9%]) than normotensive subjects (65/410 [15.8%]).
 These data support the idea that blood pressures measured during routine preparticipation physical examinations for high school sports are a useful tool in screening for elevated blood pressure in adolescents.
