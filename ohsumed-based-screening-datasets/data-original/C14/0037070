Predicting left heart failure after a myocardial infarction: a preliminary study of the value of echocardiographic measures of left ventricular filling and wall motion.
 Heart failure occurs from both systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
 To determine whether simple Doppler echocardiographic measures of left ventricular filling could improve upon the ability of systolic function to predict heart failure after infarction, patients with acute myocardial infarction were studied within the first 36 hours by Doppler and two-dimensional echocardiography.
 Forty-eight patients who did not have heart failure before the Doppler echocardiographic study and who did not have myocardial revascularization, moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, or other complications during recovery were monitored for 6 months or to the onset of heart failure (n = 10).
 The univariate predictors of heart failure were age (p less than 0.05), anterior infarction (p less than 0.05), early diastolic peak filling velocity (p = 0.05), filling velocity with atrial systole (p less than 0.05), the ratio of these velocities (p less than 0.001), the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001), and the wall motion score index (p less than 0.001).
 However, the only independent predictors of heart failure by use of multivariant stepwise logistic regression analysis were the wall motion score index (p less than 0.05) and either the ratio of early and late peak filling velocities (p less than 0.001) or the percentage of filling with atrial systole (p less than 0.001).
 The combined use of a measure of systolic function and measures of the relative contribution of atrial systole to ventricular filling were useful predictors in identifying patients likely to develop subsequent heart failure after myocardial infarction.
