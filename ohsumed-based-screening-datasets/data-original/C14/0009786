Clinical association of autoantibodies to fibrillarin with diffuse scleroderma and disseminated telangiectasia.
 Circulating autoantibodies against a variety of nuclear and nucleolar antigens are characteristic serologic findings in systemic scleroderma.
 Some of these antibodies correlate with clinical subsets of the disease.
 We describe three patients with systemic scleroderma and high autoantibody titers against U3 ribonucleoprotein-associated fibrillarin, a recently identified 34 kD nucleolar protein.
 These patients showed a progressive course with multiple organ and diffuse skin involvement with disseminated telangiectasia.
