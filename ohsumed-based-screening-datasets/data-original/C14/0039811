Clinical factors affecting the immediate outcome of PTCA in patients with unstable angina and poor candidates for surgery.
 Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) has been successfully applied in unstable angina to carefully selected patients.
 In this study, PTCA was performed in 277 consecutive patients suffering from unstable angina and for whom bypass surgery was not a valid alternative because either of inoperable conditions or of emergency, or because surgery was not the best option.
 All patients were admitted first to the intensive care unit where an attempt was made to control unstable angina under conventional medical therapy using at least iv nitroderivative, heparin, and calcium blockers.
 After a standardized preparation PTCA was performed either as an emergency procedure in medically refractory unstable angina (107 cases) or as an elective procedure in controlled situations after a 7 to 10 days symptom-free period.
 Three hundred fifty-three coronary vessels were attempted.
 Results of this group are compared with those of a control group made of 670 consecutive stable patients recruited during the same period, and clinical characteristics are envisaged as potential predictive factors.
 Unstable angina is undoubtedly associated with a higher overall complication rate, but the immediate outcome is strongly affected by the clinical context.
 As an example, respective success and mortality rates are: 93% and 0% when a full revascularization is attempted; 91% and 0% in elective procedures in patients under 60; 87% and 1.2% in elective PTCA for multiple vessel disease; 80% and 6.5% in emergency PTCA; 80% and 11% in the overall triple vessel disease; 84% and 16% in patients with deeply altered ejection fraction; and 58% and 26% in triple vessel disease with 2 previously occluded coronary arteries.
