Deep venous thrombosis in the surgical intensive care unit.
 The ICU patient population is at a high risk for the development of deep venous thrombosis leading to a potentially fatal pulmonary embolism.
 It is vital to appreciate this risk and apply appropriate prophylaxis.
 Constant vigilance is required, as deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary emboli can develop and progress despite standard prophylactic measures.
 In unstable patients, more aggressive prophylaxis may be warranted, including the use of inferior vena cava filters.
 A high index of suspicion and a low threshold for screening and diagnostic testing will allow earlier recognition and treatment of this lifethreatening condition.
 Treatment decisions are based on clinical suspicion, diagnostic examination results, and the potential complications of difficult treatment modalities.
