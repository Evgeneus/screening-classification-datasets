Left atrial bacterial mural endocarditis.
 An unusual case of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis confined to the mural left atrium is presented.
 Echocardiographic studies revealed a 1.5 x 2.0-cm vegetation mimicking a myxoma situated in the path of a mitral regurgitant jet on a color Doppler test.
 Emboli to upper and lower extremities and brain complicated the patient's preoperative course.
 Surgical excision and pathologic examination confirmed this rare occurrence.
