Myocardial fibrosis in aging germ-free and conventional Lobund-Wistar rats: the protective effect of diet restriction.
 The influences of diet restriction and germ-free environment on aging were studied in 127 male Lobund-Wistar rats ranging in age from 7 to 48 months.
 There was an age-related increase in collagen deposition of the heart, particularly involving the left ventricle.
 The degree of fibrosis was significantly less extensive in middle and old age rats (18 mo, 30 mo, 32+ mo) maintained on a restricted diet.
 No clear-cut influence of germ-free environment was apparent.
 No amyloid was detected in 175 tissue sections examined from hearts, lungs, and livers.
