Infected intravenous port device causing tricuspid valve regurgitation.
 Sepsis and tricuspid valve regurgitation developed in a 29-year-old man with Crohn's disease after implantation of an intravenous port device for parenteral nutrition.
 A thrombus, caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis, had grown along the catheter and prolapsed through the valve without affecting it.
 Complete removal in an open heart procedure led to quick recovery.
