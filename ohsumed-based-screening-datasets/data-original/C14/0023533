A new method for estimating preexcitation index without extrastimulus technique and its usefulness in determining the mechanism of supraventricular tachycardia.
 The preexcitation index has been shown to be useful in determining the mechanism of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and the site of the accessory pathway in atrioventricular (AV) reentrant tachycardia.
 To test whether a preexcitation index could be computed analytically instead of by scanning the whole SVT cycle with extrastimuli, 19 patients with SVT were studied.
 The new index was computed using the following formula: (AV conduction time during SVT) + (ventriculoatrial conduction time during ventricular pacing at the SVT cycle length) - (SVT cycle length).
 There was a strong correlation between the preexcitation index determined by the extrastimulus technique and the new index in 15 patients in whom the preexcitation index could be determined (r = 0.99, p less than 0.01).
 The value on the new index was greater than 90 ms only in patients with dual AV nodal pathways.
 In the 4 patients in whom the preexcitation index could not be determined by the extrastimulus technique, the new index could differentiate AV reentrant tachycardia (index for 2 patients, 60 and 60 ms, respectively) from AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (index for 2 patients, 100 and 105 ms, respectively).
 In conclusion, the new index provided help in determining the mechanism of SVT, even when retrograde atrial preexcitation by a ventricular extrastimulus did not occur.
