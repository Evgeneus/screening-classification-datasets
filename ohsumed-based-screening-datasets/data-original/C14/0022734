Calcium metabolic indices, vascular retinopathy, and plasma renin activity in essential hypertension.
 The interplays between calcium metabolic indices, retinal vascular status, plasma renin activity and blood pressure were examined in 67 patients with untreated essential hypertension.
 There was an inverse relationship between plasma ionized calcium and blood pressure (P = .002), whereas albumin-modified total serum calcium was directly related to blood pressure (P = .02).
 The plasma cyclic AMP level (P = .05) and the 24 h urinary excretion of cyclic AMP (P = .03) were also positively associated with blood pressure.
 Patients with vascular retinopathy had lower plasma ionized calcium concentrations (P = .01) and higher 24 h urinary cyclic AMP excretions (P = .05) than those without such changes, even when the differences in blood pressure, age, sex and body mass index were taken into account in analyses of covariance.
 Plasma renin activity did not interfere with the relationships between calcium metabolic indices and blood pressure, nor were there any associations between the renin status and the calcium metabolic indices.
 These findings suggest that a low concentration of plasma ionized calcium is an independent risk factor for vascular disease.
