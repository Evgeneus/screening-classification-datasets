Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease--a case report.
 A fifty-three-year-old woman presented with coronary artery aneurysm in association with Osler-Weber-Rendu disease (hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia) manifested also by large pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas.
 The arterial dye dilution curves were unusually distorted owing to the right-to-left shunts.
 The coronary artery aneurysm was located in multiple sites but was not accompanied by stenotic lesions.
 Coronary artery aneurysm without stenosis is a rare pathologic state and has not been previously reported in association with hereditary telangiectasia.
