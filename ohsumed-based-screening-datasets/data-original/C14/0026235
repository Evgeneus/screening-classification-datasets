Autonomic nervous system dysregulation in human hypertension.
 An increased sympathetic drive combined with decreased parasympathetic inhibition is found in patients with borderline hypertension, who characteristically have rapid heart rates, high cardiac output and relatively normal vascular resistance (hyperkinetic state).
 In established hypertension, cardiac output is normal, vascular resistance is elevated and signs of increased sympathetic drive are absent.
 Apparently hemodynamics and sympathetic drive change during hypertension.
 The mechanism of the hemodynamic transition in the course of hypertension is well understood.
 Cardiac output returns from elevated to normal values as beta-adrenergic receptors down-regulate and stroke volume decreases (due to decreased cardiac compliance).
 The high blood pressure induces vascular hypertrophy, which in turn leads to increased vascular resistance.
 The mechanism of the change of sympathetic tone from elevated in borderline hypertension to apparently normal in established hypertension can best be explained within the conceptual framework of the "blood-pressure-seeking" properties of the brain.
 In hypertension, the central nervous system seeks to maintain systemic blood pressure at the higher level.
 As hypertension advances and vascular hypertrophy develops, arterioles become hyperresponsive to vasoconstriction.
 At this point, less sympathetic drive is needed to maintain pressure-elevating vasoconstriction, and the central sympathetic drive is down-regulated.
 The etiology of increased sympathetic drive in hypertension remains unresolved.
 Subjects with increased sympathetic drive are also usually overweight and have elevated levels of insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as decreased high-density lipoproteins.
 Future research must focus on the link between coronary risk factors and sympathetic overactivity in hypertension.
