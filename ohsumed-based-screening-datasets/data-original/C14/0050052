Anti-anginal therapy and quality of life. A comparison of the effects of transdermal nitroglycerin and long-acting oral nitrates.
 A total of 112 male patients with severe effort-induced angina pectoris (New York Heart Association functional classes II and III) participated in a randomized open trial consisting of a 6 month phase with 3 month treatment cross-overs.
 The aim of the study was to compare the effect of transdermal nitroglycerin (TN) patches and long-acting oral nitrates (LAON) on quality of life (QL).
 During the cross-over period 30 patients (20 on TN and 10 on LAON) withdrew from the study, over half of them within the first month.
 Although the results should be interpreted with some caution, they showed that improvement in QL was present for both treatments but greater during the transdermal therapy (unadjusted p = 0.07, adjusted p = 0.03).
 Anginal attacks were associated with improved QL scores, and fewer attacks occurred on TN (p = 0.06).
 Improvement in QL was most pronounced in patients whose recorded duration of angina was less than 8 years.
