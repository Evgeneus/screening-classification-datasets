The "ultraperipheral" revascularization in arteriosclerotic obstruction of tibial vessels. Experimental study.
 In arteriosclerotic obstruction of the main tibial arteries, the tibial collateral vessels are usually patent, and about 70% of these arteries are potentially suitable for surgical revascularization.
 The present study aimed at investigating the practical feasibility of a selective revascularization procedure on these tibial muscular arteries (ultraperipheral revascularization).
 Six lower limbs amputated at thigh level for arteriosclerotic gangrene with complete obstruction of the main tibial arteries, were studied: the tibial collateral muscular vessels showed patency in 65% of cases.
 The authors propose a surgical technique for the revascularization of these peripheral vessels with the use of a vascular prosthesis.
 The "post-operative" angiographic studies showed that revascularization of these peripheral muscular arteries was possible.
