Transseptal catheterization in adults: enhanced efficacy and safety by low-volume operators using a "non-standard" technique.
 Transseptal catheterization is often not performed because of concerns about morbidity and mortality.
 The authors present several refinements of this technique that have allowed a series of cases to be done with minimal morbidity or mortality.
 This was possible despite limited previous experience in this technique and a relatively low-volume of cases.
