Histologic characteristics of carotid artery plaque.
 Carotid plaque characteristics associated with the production of symptoms were identified with quantification of carotid plaque constituents in high-grade stenotic asymptomatic (n = 8) and symptomatic (n = 44) plaques.
 Asymptomatic plaques contained significantly more fibrous/collagen material (88%) than symptomatic plaques (66%) (p less than 0.05).
 Hemorrhage constituted 2% and 1% of asymptomatic and symptomatic plaques, respectively.
 The predominant nonfibrous material was a pink amorphous material mixed with cholesterol, which composed 7% of asymptomatic and 27% of symptomatic plaques (p less than 0.05).
 No relationship was found between plaque composition and the number of ipsilateral ischemic neurologic events, nor was there evidence of a healing process.
 B-mode ultrasound scanning had a sensitivity of 94% in identifying plaque with greater than 80% fibrous content.
 We believe that plaque composition may be a useful discriminating factor in selecting asymptomatic patients for carotid endarterectomy.
