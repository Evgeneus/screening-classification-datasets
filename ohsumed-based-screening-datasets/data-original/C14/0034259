Ventricular tachycardia originating from the right ventricular free wall in a patient with an old myocardial infarction.
 A 64-year-old woman with right ventricular infarction had ventricular tachycardia (VT) with left bundle-branch block morphology.
 Pace-mapping during sinus rhythm and the earliest ventricular potential during VT suggested that the VT originated in the inflow-inferior site of the right ventricular free wall.
