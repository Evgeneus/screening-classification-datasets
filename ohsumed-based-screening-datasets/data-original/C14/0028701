Early experience with mitral valve reconstruction for mitral insufficiency.
 Mitral valve repair for mitral regurgitation has been reported to have more favorable early and late results than mitral valve replacement.
 From July 1985 through July 1990, 63 patients have undergone valve repair at Good Samaritan Hospital.
 Twenty-two men and 41 women whose ages ranged from 34 to 81 years (mean 67.9 years) were treated.
 Twenty-eight patients were in New York Heart Association functional class III or IV.
 Twelve (19%) had undergone prior cardiac surgery.
 Isolated valve repair was performed in 18 patients.
 Valve repair was combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, other valve procedures, or aneurysm resection in the remainder (71%).
 Two patients (3%) died while in the hospital, and four deaths (one valve-related) occurred after discharge.
 Leaflet resection for ruptured chordae was done in 24 patients (38%), chordal shortening in 5 patients (8%), and leaflet transposition in 2 patients.
 Rigid ring annuloplasty (Carpentier) was performed in 62 patients.
 Eight patients required mitral valve replacement at the same operation because of unsatisfactory valve repair.
 Results of valve repair evaluated by echocardiography at discharge show that 48 patients (88%) are free of significant regurgitation.
 Follow-up to date reveals that all surviving patients who underwent valve repair have clinically improved and are stable.
 Four of five patients with moderate mitral regurgitation are currently asymptomatic.
 There have been two valve-related late failures requiring reoperation.
 Based on this early experience, we conclude that valve repair compared with mitral valve replacement has a low operative mortality with good early results.
 Continued efforts to preserve native mitral valve function in the presence of mitral regurgitation appear justified.
