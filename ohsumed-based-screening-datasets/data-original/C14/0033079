Clinical benefits of structural and functional changes with calcium antagonists.
 Calcium antagonists have a large variety of pharmacologic effects in addition to those exploited clinically.
 All drugs used in the management of hypertension, including calcium antagonists, are coming under increasing scrutiny for the possible beneficial and adverse effects they may have on the circulation and risk factor profile.
 This is particularly because of concern about the relative resistance of coronary heart disease to antihypertensive drug treatment and the increasing interest in evaluating the impact of blood pressure-lowering drugs on surrogate endpoints such as left ventricular hypertrophy.
 Given the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic heterogeneity of calcium antagonists, it may be wise to keep in mind the subtypes as exemplified by the prototypes nifedipine, diltiazem, and verapamil and to extrapolate from one type to another with great caution.
 The increased understanding of the diversity among calcium antagonists as well as the pathophysiology of hypertension and other vascular diseases promises an exciting future for calcium antagonists in cardiovascular therapeutics.
