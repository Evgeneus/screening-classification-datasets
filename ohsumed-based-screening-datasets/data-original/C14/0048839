Pharmacology of the nitrovasodilators. Antianginal, antihypertensive, and antiplatelet actions.
 The nitrovasodilators, nitroglycerin and sodium nitroprusside, cause both arterial and venous smooth muscle dilation by the intracellular release of nitric oxide.
 Nitric oxide activates guanylate cyclase, resulting in an accumulation of cyclic GMP.
 The endogenous formation of nitric oxide results in vasodilatory activity similar to the nitrovasodilators.
 Nitroglycerin is commonly used in the treatment of angina pectoris because of its ability to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption.
 Most likely, this response occurs as a result of a reduction in preload, which can decrease arterial wall tension and improve coronary blood flow.
 This pharmacologic effect warrants the use of nitroglycerin in the treatment of myocardial ischemia or infarction, congestive heart failure, and hypertension.
 Sodium nitroprusside is effective in reducing arterial blood pressure in hypertensive crisis as a result of systemic vasodilation leading to a reduction in preload and afterload.
 Sodium nitroprusside is not as effective in the treatment of angina pectoris or in diminishing of myocardial ischemia because it does not preferentially improve blood flow to ischemic myocardium over nonischemic myocardium.
 Inhibition of platelet aggregation has been demonstrated with these drugs, but the clinical applications need further investigation.
 Nursing interventions for the patient on nitrovasodilator therapy include careful hemodynamic monitoring and drug infusion, along with elimination of physical and emotional stimuli that can aggravate the patient's underlying pathology.
