Aneurysm or occlusive disease--factors determining the clinical course of atherosclerosis of the infrarenal aorta.
 Atherosclerosis of the infrarenal aorta results in distinct clinical entities--aortoiliac occlusive disease (AOD) and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).
 Although loss of collagen has been implicated in AAA, collagen accumulation plays a role in AOD.
 In vivo collagen-gene expression can be assessed using complementary DNA for collagen types I and III alpha-chains.
 The purpose of this study is to compare total collagen (type I + III) and collagen types I and III messenger RNA in AAA, AOD and normal aorta.
 Specimens were collected from the infrarenal aorta during operation for AOD (n = 7), AAA (n = 7), autopsy, or organ procurement (normal; n = 7).
 Northern transfer analysis of total RNA was used to compare mRNA levels for type I and III collagen.
 After preliminary extraction, specimens were hydrolyzed for hydroxyproline analysis used to calculate total collagen (type I + III).
 Relative levels of type I (pro-a1[1]) mRNA were greater in both AOD (0.77 +/- 0.35) and AAA tissue (0.94 +/- 0.24; p = 0.6) than in normal aorta (0.02 +/- 0.03).
 Type III (pro-a1[III]) mRNA levels were also greater in AOD (2.52 +/- 0.19; p = 0.09) and AAA tissue (3.15 +/- 1.3) than in normals (0.97 +/- 0.47).
 Total collagen concentration was increased in AOD (45.6% +/- 3.1% dry weight; p less than 0.05) but not AAA tissue (27.8% +/- 4%) when compared to normal aorta (34.7% +/- 2.3%).
 Collagen type I and III gene expression is greater in older, diseased aorta, yet collagen accumulated only in AOD.
 This implies a similar synthetic response in both AOD and AAA.
 Thus, proteolytic degradation in AAA appears to determine collagen content and possibly the clinical course of the atherosclerotic process.
