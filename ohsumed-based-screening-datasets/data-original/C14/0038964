Intraluminal pulsed Doppler evaluation of the pulmonary artery velocity time curve in a canine model of acute pulmonary hypertension.
 The velocity pattern of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery was investigated in an animal model of acute pulmonary hypertension.
 Nine anesthetized, open-chest dogs were embolized with polystyrene microspheres, and the velocity pattern of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery was studied with use of an invasive pulsed Doppler technique.
 Phasic intraluminal velocity was recorded with use of a miniature piezoelectric crystal activated by 20-MHz Doppler pulses and mounted on the tip of a needle probe introduced into the pulmonary artery.
 The recorded Doppler quadrature signals were processed by spectral analysis.
 Significant increases occurred in mean, systolic, and diastolic pulmonary arterial pressures (p less than 0.0002), in pulmonary vascular resistance (p less than 0.005), and in negative velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed toward the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.002).
 Significant decreases occurred in right ventricular ejection time (p less than 0.006) and in positive velocity time (duration in milliseconds that the mean velocity was directed away from the pulmonic valve) (p less than 0.005).
 A significant shortening in the time to peak velocity (acceleration time) was found (p less than 0.005).
 Second-order regression analyses demonstrated an inverse correlation between the ratio of positive velocity time to negative velocity time and the mean pulmonary artery pressure in all animals (r = 0.71).
 These findings should be compared with the velocity patterns of the blood flow in the pulmonary artery obtained under pulmonary hypertensive conditions due to various causes to facilitate interpretation and understanding of clinical investigations.
