The use of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with aortic aneurysms.
 Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) has revolutionized management of most patients with urolithiasis.
 The effect of ESWL on patients with an aortic aneurysm is unknown and its safety is questioned by the absence of any case reports in the urological literature.
 A 68-year-old man with an abdominal aortic aneurysm underwent successful ESWL using the Medstone STS 1050 lithotriptor for right renal calculi.
 Continuous monitoring of the aneurysm was done using real-time ultrasound during the ESWL treatment.
 Careful preoperative evaluation in conjunction with appropriate intraoperative and postoperative monitoring makes ESWL management of patients with associated aortic aneurysm possible.
