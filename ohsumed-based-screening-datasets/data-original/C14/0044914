Surgical correction of coarctation in early infancy: does surgical technique influence the result?
 Between 1979 and 1988, a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation.
 Thirty-seven patients (70%) were younger than 3 months.
 Median age was 0.9 month.
 Four different surgical techniques were used: resection with end-to-end anastomosis, patch enlargement, subclavian flap aortoplasty, and subclavian displacement aortoplasty (Meier-Mendonca technique).
 Hospital mortality was 7.5% and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects.
 Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk.
 Follow-up averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups.
 Restenosis developed in 9 (19%) of 47 patients regularly followed up, 5 (11%) of whom have had reoperation.
 Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis, which occurred in 17.4% of patients less than 1 month and 20.8% of those greater than 1 month of age at operation.
 Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates (42% and 43%, respectively).
 However, patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions.
 It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect, which largely determines the method of treatment.
 Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique.
