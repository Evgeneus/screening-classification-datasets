Effects of alfentanil and fentanyl on induction of anaesthesia in patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension.
 Forty patients with severe pregnancy-induced hypertension presenting for Caesarean section under general anaesthesia were allocated randomly to receive either fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1 or alfentanil 10 micrograms kg-1 as part of the anaesthetic induction sequence.
 In all patients, the cardiovascular response to tracheal intubation was measured.
 Both drugs attenuated the response equally but did not abolish it in all patients.
 Alfentanil 10 micrograms kg-1 is a suitable alternative to fentanyl 2.5 micrograms kg-1 for patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension.
