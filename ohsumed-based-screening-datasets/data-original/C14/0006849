Correction of truncus arteriosus with truncal valvar stenosis or insufficiency using two homografts.
 Surgical correction of truncus arteriosus requires the creation of right ventricular to pulmonary artery continuity and closure of the ventricular septal defect.
 A variety of conduits have been used including valved and nonvalved.
 Despite a significant incidence of truncal valvar stenosis and insufficiency, this valve has seldom been replaced.
 We present 4 cases of truncus arteriosus with truncal valvar stenosis or insufficiency that were repaired using two valved homografts: one to create the pulmonary outflow tract and the other to replace the abnormal truncal valve.
 Two of these patients are doing well after 4 months.
 Another child survived the operation and did well for 2 months when she died suddenly.
 The last child died 14 hours postoperatively from low cardiac output syndrome secondary to diabetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 When truncal valvar abnormalities are present, the primary repair of truncus arteriosus in an infant should include replacement of the truncal valve.
 Total correction can be successfully achieved using two valved homografts, resulting in long-term palliation and freedom from thromboembolic events and the use of anticoagulants.
