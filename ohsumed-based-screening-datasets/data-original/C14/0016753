Unilateral diffuse pulmonary artery involvement in Takayasu's arteritis associated with coronary-pulmonary artery fistula and bronchial-pulmonary artery fistula: a case report.
 Diffuse involvement of the right pulmonary artery associated with fistulas between the pulmonary artery and systemic artery is reported in a woman with Takayasu's arteritis.
 The most proximal portion of the abdominal aorta was pronouncedly narrowed and the aortic wall was markedly calcified.
 Both the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery were totally occluded and drained by the meandering artery arising from the inferior mesenteric artery.
 The proximal right pulmonary artery was focally narrowed and the middle lobe artery was occluded.
 All other branches of the right pulmonary artery were diffusely narrowed with sparse distributions of their distal branches.
 Fistulas were identified between the right coronary artery and the right pulmonary artery and between the right bronchial artery and the right pulmonary artery.
 This is the first English report of Takayasu's arteritis presenting with a coronary-pulmonary artery fistula that is secondary to a diffuse unilateral involvement of the pulmonary artery.
