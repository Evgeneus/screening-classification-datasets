Relief of tracheal compression by aortopexy.
 We have performed aortopexy in 12 children with tracheal compression.
 Six infants had compression secondary to a vascular anomaly (group 1), and the other 6 had previous repair of esophageal atresia (group 2).
 Eleven of the 12 children are alive after a mean follow-up of 36 months.
 In group 1, 1 patient died and 3 patients (50%) experienced recurrent respiratory distress.
 Five infants sustained a major postoperative complication, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 25 days.
 In group 2, however, aortopexy was uniformly successful.
 There were no deaths, no postoperative complications, and no cases of postoperative respiratory distress, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was only 10 days.
 For children with reflex apnea after repair of esophageal atresia, aortopexy is lifesaving and can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality.
 Great caution is indicated in children with tracheal compression from other causes.
