Preservation of aortic valve in type A aortic dissection complicated by aortic regurgitation.
 Two hundred fifty-two patients underwent operation for type A aortic dissection at Stanford University Medical Center from 1963 to 1987 and Duke University Medical Center from 1975 to 1988.
 Sixty-seven percent had an acute type A dissection and 33% had a chronic type A dissection.
 In addition to repair or replacement of the ascending aorta, 121 patients (48%) required an aortic valve procedure.
 Valve resuspension was performed in 46 (39 acute type A and 7 chronic type A), with an operative mortality rate of 13% +/- 5% (+/- 70% confidence limits), and aortic valve replacement in 75 (36 acute type A and 39 chronic type A), with an operative mortality rate of 20% +/- 5% (p = not significant versus resuspension).
 The operative mortality rate for patients requiring only repair or replacement of the ascending aorta was 32% +/- 4%.
 Indications for valve replacement included coexistent (nonacute) aortic valve disease, Marfan's syndrome, annuloaortic ectasia, and cases in which successful resuspension could not be accomplished.
 The overall actuarial survival rate for all patients was 59% +/- 3% (+/- 1 standard error of the mean), 40% +/- 4%, and 25% +/- 5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively.
 Survival rates at these same times for patients with valve resuspension were 67% +/- 8%, 52% +/- 10%, and 26% +/- 19%, respectively; for patients who required aortic valve replacement, these survival rates were 70% +/- 5%, 39% +/- 8%, and 21% +/- 11%; finally, patients who received only an ascending aortic procedure had survival probabilities of 51% +/- 5%, 37% +/- 6%, and 23% +/- 6% (p = not significant versus resuspension versus aortic valve replacement).
 Multivariate analysis showed advanced age (p less than 0.001), previous cardiac or aortic operation (p less than 0.001), more preoperative dissection complications (p = 0.002), and earlier operative date (p = 0.038) to be the only significant, independent factors that increased the likelihood of early or late death.
 The type of aortic valve procedure (resuspension versus aortic valve replacement versus none) was not a significant predictor of mortality.
 Two of 46 patients with valve resuspension required late aortic valve replacement (freedom from aortic valve replacement: 100% and 80% +/- 13% at 5 and 10 years, respectively), as did 4 of 75 patients with initial aortic valve replacement (freedom from repeat aortic valve replacement: 98% +/- 2% and 73% +/- 13%, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).
