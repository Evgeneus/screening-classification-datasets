Echocardiographic prediction of left ventricular volume after myocardial infarction.
 Left ventricular volume is a strong determinant of survival after acute myocardial infarction.
 The aim of this study was to determine which clinical and echocardiographic criteria assessed early after myocardial infarction would predict later left ventricular dilation.
 Forty-eight patients with uncomplicated transmural myocardial infarction had echocardiography 5 to 10 days after myocardial infarction and assessment of clinical variables including peak creatine kinase and sum of electrocardiographic ST segment elevation.
 Left ventricular dimensions were measured from the echocardiogram in the parasternal view and also in the apical four and two chamber views at the level of the mitral leaflets, papillary muscles and apex.
 A cardiac wall motion score was obtained by segmental analysis of the apical views.
 Echocardiographic left ventricular volume was measured after 1 year from the apical views with use of a Simpson's rule method.
 Initial clinical and echocardiographic variables were correlated with the left ventricular volume at 1 year.
 There was a significant relation between the initial four and two chamber end-diastolic dimensions and the left ventricular volume at 1 year, particularly for dimensions measured at the apical level (four chamber R2 = 0.66, p = 0.0001, two chamber R2 = 0.61, p = 0.0001).
 Other clinical variables, parasternal left ventricular dimensions and cardiac wall motion score were not significantly related to left ventricular volume.
 A powerful three variable model obtained by multiple regression and including the initial two chamber apical dimension, cardiac wall motion score and body surface area accounted for 82% of the variation in left ventricular volume at 1 year.
