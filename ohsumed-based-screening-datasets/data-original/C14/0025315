Coronary artery stenting after angioplasty with self-expanding parallel wire metallic stents.
 Parallel wire stents were implanted over exchange guide wires at percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty sites in 27 canine coronary arteries that were predilated with slightly oversized balloons.
 Stents were stainless steel, self-expandable, 3.5 to 4.5 mm in diameter, 9 to 12 mm in length, and were made of 10 wires that were longitudinally laser-welded in a zig-zag design.
 The compressible stent was delivered by the withdrawal of a Teflon outer catheter (4.2 to 4.9F) and the push of a polyethylene inner catheter.
 Aspirin, 80 mg per day, was given from the day before the study began, and heparin (150 U/kg) was administered during implantation.
 Quantitative angiography and pathologic examinations were performed at day 0 and at weeks 2, 4, 12, 26 and 52.
 The coronary angiographic diameter at the stent site immediately after stenting marginally increased from diameter before stenting: 3.22 +/- 0.40 mm versus 3.14 +/- 0.37 mm (p = 0.03), and during a mean of 14 weeks of follow-up, remained unaltered from immediate post-stenting: 3.29 +/- 0.43 mm versus 3.22 +/- 0.40 mm (p = NS) with no stent displacement.
 Comparisons of patency and thrombosis between heparin-coated and uncoated stents, between left anterior descending and circumflex arteries, and among the three different diameters of stents showed uniformly good results.
 At microscopy, the wires were oriented perfectly and embedded in the arterial wall, and by 2 weeks they were covered by mucopolysaccharide ground substance, smooth muscle cells, and an almost complete monolayer of neoendothelial cells.
