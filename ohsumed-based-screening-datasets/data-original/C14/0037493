Smoking and hypertension: risk factors for carotid stenosis.
 The prevalence of smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus was assessed in 221 patients suffering from internal carotid stenosis and compared with the prevalences in two sex- and age-matched control groups composed of subjects having normal Doppler findings and from non-neurological outpatients.
 Of the subjects with carotid stenosis 27.6% were hypertensive smokers in comparison with 9.5% and 17.2% in the two control groups.
 The difference of the stenosis cohort from the two control groups was significant (P less than 0.01 and P = 0.016 respectively).
 There was no statistically significant differences between the occurrence of diabetes and hypertension in non-smokers and patients who smoked.
 In 394 investigated patients suffering from carotid stenosis or occlusion an obstruction index, based on the Doppler shift frequency, was calculated.
 This index was lowest in the normotentive non-smokers.
 It was only insignificantly higher in the hypertensive non-smokers but significantly so in the normotensive smokers.
 The index was highest in the hypertensive non-smokers.
 It was concluded that cigarette smoking, especially if associated with hypertension, is a determinant risk factor for carotid stenosis and occlusion.
