Relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic factor and urinary kallikrein excretion in essential hypertensives.
 In order to seek possible relationships between renal kallikrein and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF), we measured urinary kallikrein (UK) and ANF in 84 normal subjects (NS) and in 104 uncomplicated essential hypertensives (HP).
 Atrial natriuretic factor was significantly higher in HP than in NS (38.5 +/- 1.3 vs 29.0 +/- 1.3 pg/mL, P less than .01), whereas UK was significantly lower in HP than in NS (11.1 +/- 0.9 v 15.3 +/- 0.6 nkatal/24 h, P less than .01).
 Calculating the 95% of the percentile distribution of the single values of UK in the group of NS we were able to show that 24 out of 104 HP had a UK which fell below the lowest limit (4.5 nkat/24 h) of the normal range.
 We therefore divided our HP into two subgroups: patients with normal kallikrein excretion (NK) (n = 80; mean UK 13.8 +/- 0.8 nkat/24 h) and patients with low kallikrein excretion (LK) (n = 24; mean UK 2.3 +/- 0.3 nkat/24 h).
 Normal kallikrein patients had a mean plasma ANF value of 31.9 +/- 1.2 pg/mL which was almost superimposable to that found in NS; on the contrary, the mean plasma level of ANF in LK patients (50.7 +/- 2.2 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that measured in NK patients and in NS (P less than .01 v NK patients and NS, respectively).
 Since a low urinary kallikrein excretion may represent a marker of an impaired production of renal kallikrein, the high levels of ANF found in the LK subgroup could be the result of a compensatory response of the atrium attempting to maintain sodium and volume homeostasis.
