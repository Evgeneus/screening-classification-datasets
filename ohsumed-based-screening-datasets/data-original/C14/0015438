Right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale caused by pulmonary hypertension associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome: a case report.
 This case report presents a fifty-four-year-old woman with right-to-left shunt in the atrium.
 It seemed clinically at first that the shunt was due to atrial septal defect.
 However, she also had pulmonary disease associated with rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome.
 At autopsy atrial septal defect was not evident, but a patent foramen ovale and pulmonary artery disease were observed.
 This case suggests that pulmonary hypertension secondary to rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren's syndrome could lead to right-to-left shunting through a patent foramen ovale.
