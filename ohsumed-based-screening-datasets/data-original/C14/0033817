Abnormal left ventricular diastolic filling in eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy of obesity.
 Left ventricular (LV) diastolic filling pattern of obese subjects with eccentric LV hypertrophy was studied.
 Findings were compared with those of normal control subjects and hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy.
 M-mode, 2-dimensional and Doppler echocardiograms were recorded in 11 obese (body mass index greater than 30 kg/m2) normotensive patients with eccentric LV hypertrophy, 10 normal control subjects, and 18 nonobese, hypertensive patients with concentric LV hypertrophy whose antihypertensive medications were discontinued 2 weeks before study.
 LV hypertrophy was defined as LV mass/height greater than 143 g/m.
 Hypertrophy in the obese patients was eccentric: Their LV internal dimension (61 +/- 3 mm) was greater than that of hypertensive patients (55 +/- 5 mm, p less than 0.001) and normal control subjects (55 +/- 2 mm, p less than 0.01); their septal (10.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and posterior (10.9 +/- 0.6 mm) wall thicknesses were smaller than those of the hypertensive patients (12.2 +/- 1.7 mm, p less than 0.05 and 11.7 +/- 1.2 mm, respectively, difference not significant).
 Pulsed-wave Doppler echocardiographic filling indexes were used to evaluate LV diastolic filling.
 Obese patients had a higher peak velocity of atrial filling (69 +/- 14 vs 54 +/- 15 cm/s, p less than 0.05), lower early/atrial filling velocity ratio (1.0 +/- 0.26 vs 1.32 +/- 0.21, p less than 0.05), prolonged deceleration half-time (108 +/- 9 vs 86 +/- 15 ms, p less than 0.01) and lower peak filling rate corrected to stroke volume (4.08 +/- 0.68 vs 4.96 +/- 0.88 stroke volume/s, p less than 0.05) than normal control subjects.
