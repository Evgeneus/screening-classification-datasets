Evaluation of different systems for clinical quantification of varicose veins.
 One hundred twenty-five lower limbs with varicose veins were studied clinically, essentially by palpation.
 Two specialists in venous pathology scored the severity of the varicose veins from 0 to 20.
 Comparison between the different clinical parameters and the scores of the specialists showed that two systems of clinical quantification gave good results and were easy to use.
 One system is the maximum diameter of the largest varicose vein; the other system is the sum of maximum diameters over 7 sections (3 for thigh, 3 for leg, 1 for foot).
 This latter system gives a more precise evaluation of the clinical severity of the varicose veins.
