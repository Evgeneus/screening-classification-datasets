Intra-arterial streptokinase infusion in acute lower limb ischaemia.
 Between 1986 and 1988, 38 patients (29 men and nine women), median age 65 years (range 38-85 years), underwent local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy for acute lower limb ischaemia.
 Three patient groups were identified: 15 with acute on chronic ischaemia (group 1), 12 postangioplasty (group 2) and 11 postfemorodistal bypass (group 3).
 Distal arteriographic run-off was a significant discriminant between success and failure in group 1 (n = 15, chi 2 = 11.5, P = 0.001) and in the overall group (n = 38, chi 2 = 17.2, P less than 0.001).
 In group 2, four patients with good run-off had an unsuccessful outcome; this was due in all cases to technical problems (haemorrhage in two and intimal dissection in two).
 In group 3, two patients with good run-off had unsuccessful streptokinase infusions.
 In both cases the graft failed in the early postoperative period (less than 30 days).
 By contrast, the four patients whose grafts occluded after 30 days had successful streptokinase infusions and long-term graft patency was achieved by further surgery and balloon dilatation.
 In all groups, no patient with a poor run-off had a successful outcome following streptokinase administration.
 The role of local intra-arterial streptokinase therapy in the critically ischaemic limb remains controversial, but these results suggest that an adequate run-off is an important factor in the selection of patients for treatment.
