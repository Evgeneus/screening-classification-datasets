Rapid improvement in a patient with leukocytoclastic vasculitis with secondary mixed cryoglobulinemia treated with cryofiltration.
 A patient with leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) with secondary mixed cryoglobulinemia was treated by cryofiltration in an effort to stop the progression of the disease despite the use of high dose prednisone.
 Three cryofiltration procedures within one week were performed on this patient.
 Clinical assessments made through the course of this therapy and the followup period showed excellent response.
 Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transformation functions (MNC-TF) were evaluated at the pre-1st and post-2nd cryofiltration treatment.
 MNC-TF pretreatment were significantly suppressed.
 Post-2nd cryofiltration, MNC-TF were improved.
 Our study demonstrates that cryofiltration is a safe and effective treatment of a patient with LCV with secondary mixed cryoglobulinemia, without requiring plasma replacement products.
