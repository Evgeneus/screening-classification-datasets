Intermittent claudication as a manifestation of silent myocardial ischemia: a pilot study.
 One hundred consecutive patients with intermittent claudication were screened noninvasively with electrocardiography chest wall mapping stress test and transcutaneous aortovelography during bicycle ergometry.
 Electrocardiographic chest wall stress testing indicated three-vessel coronary disease in 25 patients and left anterior descending plus circumflex (left main stem equivalent) disease in seven.
 In these 32 patients transcutaneous aortovelography demonstrated a decrease in stroke distance (an index of cardiac stroke volume) (median, -28%; 90% range, +5% to -48%), and coronary angiography confirmed the presence and severity of the disease.
 The claudication distance ranged between 50 and 250 meters.
 After myocardial revascularization or medical therapy a significant increase occurred in the stroke distance after exercise (median, +20; 90% range, +40% to -25%); also a significant increase in the postexercise pressure index and a reduction in the recovery time (p less than 0.01).
 No change occurred in the ankle/pressure index at rest.
 Twelve patients were able to walk without being limited by claudication; 15 reported improvement with a two to tenfold increase in claudication distance.
 No change occurred in three.
 The results indicate that silent myocardial ischemia is a common finding in patients with intermittent claudication.
 It produces left ventricular dysfunction and a decrease in stroke volume leading to a large fall in ankle pressure and early onset of claudication during exercise.
 Niltrates and myocardial revascularization tend to reverse this.
