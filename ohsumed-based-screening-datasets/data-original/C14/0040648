Blunted renal sodium excretion during acute saline loading in normotensive men with positive family histories of hypertension.
 The natriuretic and intra-arterial blood pressure response to an acute saline load (1000 mL 0.9% NaCl), was studied in normotensive young men with positive (n = 11) and negative (n = 21) family histories of hypertension.
 The age-matched (36 +/- 5 years) control group with negative family histories of hypertension was subdivided into two groups, one matched for body mass index (BMI) to the subjects with positive family histories of hypertension (n = 10), and another lean control group (n = 11).
 Baseline blood pressure was significantly higher in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension and in controls matched for BMI as compared with lean controls.
 Sodium excretion increased in all three groups during the saline infusion, while subjects with positive family histories of hypertension disclosed a diminished natriuretic response as compared with the two control groups.
 Systolic blood pressure increased significantly during the saline load in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension, while in subjects with negative family histories of hypertension, no significant change in blood pressure was observed.
 Plasma renin activity, angiotensin II, serum aldosterone, plasma noradrenaline, blood volume, and ouabain-sensitive erythrocyte sodium efflux rate constant did not differ between the three groups at baseline.
 A significant negative correlation was found between baseline sodium excretion and sodium efflux rate constant in subjects with positive family histories of hypertension.
 We conclude that the subjects with positive family histories of hypertension exhibit a blunted natriuretic and an exaggerated blood pressure response to an acute saline load as compared with the two control groups with negative family histories of hypertension.
 This could be of neuronal and/or hormonal origin.
