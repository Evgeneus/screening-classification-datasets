Association of human leukocyte class II antigens with rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease in a Brazilian population.
 BACKGROUND.
 The incidence of rheumatic heart disease is great in Brazil.
 We analyzed the distribution of human leukocyte (HLA) antigens in a Brazilian population sample with rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease, with the aim of better understanding the mechanisms involved.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 HLA class I (A, B, and C) and class II (DR and DQ) antigen distribution was studied in 40 patients with diagnosis of rheumatic fever or rheumatic heart disease and compared with a control group of 617 healthy individuals for class I typing, from which 118 were drawn for class II typing.
 A strong correlation between rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease and HLA-DRw53 (72.9% in the disease group versus 39% in the control group: p = 0.00061, relative risk, 4.2; etiologic fraction, 0.43) was found.
 We also found an increase in the frequency of HLA-DR7 (57.5% in the disease group versus 26.3% in control group: p = 0.00715; relative risk, 3.8; etiologic fraction, 0.56).
 HLA class I and HLA-DQ typing did not point to any association with these diseases.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 HLA-DR7 and HLA-DRw53 are markers for susceptibility to rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease in Brazil.
 These results could be explained by genetic differences resulting from racial or geographical diversity.
