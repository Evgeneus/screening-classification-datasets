Gallbladder varices: imaging findings in patients with portal hypertension.
 A retrospective review of the medical and imaging records of 50 patients with portal hypertension examined in the authors' department during a 2-year period identified six patients with gallbladder wall varices.
 Imaging studies performed in these patients included computed tomography (CT) (four patients), duplex and color Doppler flow (five patients), and magnetic resonance (MR) (four patients).
 Five of six patients with gallbladder varices had portal vein thrombosis.
 Anechoic areas within the gallbladder wall detected with ultrasonography could be distinguished from intramural edema by using duplex or color Doppler flow imaging in all five patients in whom it was used.
 Contrast material enhancement of these varices was detected with CT in three patients, two of whom also had adjacent mesenteric collaterals.
 Gradient-echo MR imaging (fast imaging in steady precession/fast low-angle shot) showed flow-related enhancement within the gallbladder wall in two patients.
 The presence of gallbladder wall varices may imply the presence of portal vein thrombosis.
 Since these varices can be a source of major blood loss, surgeons must be made aware of them when operating on patients with portal hypertension.
