Perioperative myocardial ischemia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery--II: Incidence and severity during the 1st week after surgery. The Study of Perioperative Ischemia (SPI) Research Group.
 Because of the importance of postoperative myocardial ischemia and because substantial physiologic changes can occur for prolonged periods postoperatively, the incidence, severity and temporal course of myocardial ischemia were studied in 100 high risk patients during the 1st week after major noncardiac surgery.
 Electrocardiographic (ECG) changes consistent with ischemia were continuously monitored using ambulatory solid state ECG in the 100 patients with or at risk for coronary artery disease.
 Ischemic episodes were defined as reversible ST segment depression greater than or equal to 1 mm or elevation greater than or equal to 2 mm above the baseline value, with the baseline adjusted for respiratory and positional variation and temporal drift.
 All ischemic episodes were confirmed by three independent blinded investigators using hard-copy recordings.
 Total ECG monitoring time was 10,445 h.
 Twenty-seven patients (27%) developed 437 episodes of ischemia during the 1st week after surgery.
 The total duration of ischemia was 18,658 min, or 1.8 min of ischemia/h monitored.
 Ischemia was most severe during the early (days 0 to 3) versus late (days 4 to 7) postoperative period: 284 versus 153 episodes; 2.2 versus 1.2 min of ischemia/h.
 The greatest severity occurred on postoperative day 3: 109 episodes, 3.4 min of ischemia/h monitored, 1.5 mm mean ST change and 130 min mean duration.
 However, in 8% of patients, severe episodes also occurred late: postoperative day 6 = 44 episodes, 1.7 min of ischemia/h monitored, 1.3 mm mean ST change (59% greater than or equal to 2 mm) and 92 min mean duration.
 Most ischemic episodes (57%) were associated with tachycardia.
