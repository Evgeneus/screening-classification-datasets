Regulation of expression of M, B, and mitochondrial creatine kinase mRNAs in the left ventricle after pressure overload in rats.
 Pressure overload of the left ventricle induces synthesis of creatine kinase isoenzymes.
 To determine whether this response is associated with an altered pattern of creatine kinase gene expression, we induced arterial hypertension in rats by suprarenal aortic banding.
 After 4 days, left ventricular myocardium from hypertensive (n = 7) and normotensive, sham-operated (n = 5) rats was analyzed for isoenzyme activities by chromatography; M and B creatine kinase subunit protein by Western blot; and M, B, and mitochondrial creatine kinase mRNA by Northern blot.
 Although total creatine kinase activity increased in hypertensive (1,096 +/- 214 IU/g left ventricle) compared with normotensive rats (648 +/- 81 IU/g left ventricle, p less than 0.01), the relative proportions of the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoenzymes did not change.
 The mass of M and B subunits increased 1.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively, in hypertensive compared with control rats.
 Similarly, the mRNA for M and B subunits as well as mitochondrial creatine kinase increased 2.6-, 1.6-, and 1.8-fold, respectively, in hypertensive rats compared with control rats.
 Thus, increased energy requirements in acute pressure overload are met by generalized induction of creatine kinase mRNA and subunit protein and not by an isoenzyme switch.
