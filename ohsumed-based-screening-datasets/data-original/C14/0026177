Fifteen-year results of ambulatory compression therapy for chronic venous ulcers.
 A nonoperative approach to venous stasis ulceration of the lower extremity, consisting of initial bedrest, ulcer cleansing, dressing changes, and ambulatory elastic compression stocking therapy, has been maintained for over 15 years.
 All patients had class III, severe chronic venous insufficiency.
 One hundred five of 113 patients (93%) experienced complete ulcer healing in a mean of 5.3 months.
 One hundred two patients were compliant with elastic compression stockings, and 11 patients were noncompliant.
 Complete ulcer healing occurred in 99 of 102 patients (97%) who were compliant versus six of 11 patients (55%) who were noncompliant (p less than 0.0001).
 The influence of noncompliance, previous venous ulceration, previous venous surgery, previous known deep venous thrombosis, peripheral arterial insufficiency (ankle brachial systolic blood pressure index less than or equal to 0.60), pretreatment ulcer duration, ulcer size, age, sex, diabetes, smoking, and photoplethysmography venous refill time on ulcer healing was determined by logistic regression analysis.
 Only noncompliance with elastic compression stockings (p less than 0.0001) and a pretreatment ulcer duration of more than 9 months (p = 0.02) significantly decreased initial ulcer healing.
 Posthealing follow-up was available in 73 patients for a mean of 30 months.
 Fifty-eight patients (79%) continued to be compliant with stockings; 15 patients were noncompliant.
 Total ulcer recurrence in patients who were compliant was 16%.
 Five-year lifetable recurrence was 29%.
 All patients who were noncompliant had recurrent ulceration by 36 months.
 Previous ulceration, previous venous surgery, and peripheral arterial insufficiency had no effect on ulcer recurrence (p greater than 0.05).
