Unilateral aortofemoral bypass: a safe and effective option for the treatment of unilateral limb-threatening ischemia.
 To determine whether unilateral aortofemoral (AUF) bypass is a safe and effective option for the treatment of unilateral limb-threatening ischemia in patients with aortic or bilateral iliac occlusive disease, we reviewed the results of 42 AUF bypasses performed using polytetrafluoroethylene grafts in patients operated on for limb salvage; 11 (26%) of the patients also underwent femoropopliteal or femorodistal (FP/D) bypasses.
 The indications for surgery were tissue necrosis or ulceration in 18 (43%) patients and rest pain in 17 (40%) patients.
 The 5-year primary graft patency and limb salvage rates for AUF bypass were 74% and 84%, respectively.
 The perioperative mortality rate was 5%.
 There were no significant differences in the primary graft patency or limb salvage rates in patients who underwent AUF bypass with or without FP/D bypass.
 Only 3 of 41 (7%) AUF bypass patients required subsequent femorofemoral bypass.
 We conclude that: (1) AUF bypass is a safe and effective surgical option in patients with unilateral limb-threatening ischemia and aortic or bilateral iliac occlusive disease; (2) the routine performance of an aortobifemoral or axillobifemoral bypass in patients with unilateral limb-threatening ischemia may be unnecessary; and (3) AUF bypass facilitates the combined inflow and infrainguinal operations that are frequently required for limb salvage in these patients.
