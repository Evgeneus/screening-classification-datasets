Expression of atrial natriuretic factor in the human ventricle is independent of chamber dilation 
 This study investigated the presence of atrial natriuretic factor in ventricular tissue obtained from humans with dilated or restrictive heart disease.
 In 17 patients with ventricular dilation and impaired systolic function and in 8 patients with restrictive heart disease and preserved systolic function, the presence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was investigated in tissue obtained by ventricular endomyocardial biopsy.
 The objective of the study was to determine if the ventricular presence of atrial natriuretic factor is dependent on ventricular dilation.
 Left ventricular end-diastolic volume index was greater in the group with dilated cardiomyopathy than in the group with restrictive cardiomyopathy (134 +/- 13 versus 78 +/- 5 ml/m2, p less than 0.05); end-diastolic pressure was elevated in the two groups (20 +/- 2 versus 25 +/- 4 mm Hg, p = NS).
 With the use of immunohistochemical techniques, ventricular atrial natriuretic factor was clearly detected in 15 of the 17 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and in 6 of the 8 patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy.
 This study demonstrates the high prevalence of ventricular atrial natriuretic factor in living patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction.
 Whereas in the atria, stretch or dilation may be an important stimulus, atrial natriuretic factor in the ventricular chamber occurs independent of dilation.
