Pericarditis with tamponade due to cytomegalovirus in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 A 35-year-old male homosexual with AIDS presented with headache and fever and was found to have cryptococcal meningitis.
 During the patient's hospital course, his hemodynamic status deteriorated as a result of pericardial tamponade.
 Antemortem analysis of the fluid was unrevealing; however, postmortem examination of the pericardium revealed typical intranuclear inclusions of cytomegalovirus infection.
 Cytomegalovirus should be included in the differential diagnosis of pericardial effusion in patients with AIDS.
