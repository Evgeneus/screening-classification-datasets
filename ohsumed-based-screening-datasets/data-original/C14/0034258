 A 41-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of right-sided chest pain.
 Two-dimensional echocardiographic examination revealed a ruptured right atrium and a localized pericardial effusion.
 Color Doppler echocardiography and contrast echocardiography showed blood flow from the right atrium into pericardial effusion, which was confirmed at emergency surgery.
 The pathologic specimen from the right atrium showed a spindle cell angiosarcoma.
