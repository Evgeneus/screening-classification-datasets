Intraosseous vascular malformations of the orbit.
 Intraosseous vascular malformations are rare benign tumors involving the bones of the orbit.
 The diagnosis should be considered when a patient presents with an enlarging mass fixed to bone in the upper face, and the characteristic x-ray appearance should be looked for on plain films.
 Treatment is local excision of the bone containing the tumor and immediate reconstruction with autogenous bone.
