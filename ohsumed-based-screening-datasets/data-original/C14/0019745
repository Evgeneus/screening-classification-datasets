Spinal cord injury after subclavian flap aortoplasty. An experimental study in piglets.
 Paraplegia is a rare but much feared complication of corrective surgery for coarctation of the aorta.
 The problem was studied in 31 newborn pigs submitted to subclavian flap aortoplasty.
 The aortic cross-clamping time ranged from 9-25 min.
 Twenty-three piglets with clamping times 9-18 min were neurologically intact, whereas eight with aortic clamping for 18-25 min became paraplegic.
 The clinical implications for newborn children with symptomatic aortic coarctation are discussed with regard to these experimental findings.
