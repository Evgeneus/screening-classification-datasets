A lesson from the controversy about heart rate adjustment of ST segment depression.
 To summarize the literature review, the heart rate adjustment appears to be able to perfectly discriminate patients with different numbers of diseased coronary vessels in one center, to increase the diagnostic accuracy of three-vessel or left main disease in eight centers, and unable to improve accuracy in seven centers.
 To explain those differences, several methodological and statistical biases have been considered.
 However, a recent report regarding the application of the method in eight centers and a meticulous literature review could not explain the superior performance in some laboratories.
