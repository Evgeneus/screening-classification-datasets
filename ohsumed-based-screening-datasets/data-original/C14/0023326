Effect of subarachnoid hemorrhage on serotonin uptake and release in the rabbit basilar artery.
 This study analyzes the changes induced by subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) uptake and release evoked in rabbit basilar arteries by tyramine.
 Rabbits were injected with 5 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna to produce SAH.
 Tritium accumulation in basilar arteries was measured after 30 minutes of incubation with 10(-7) M [3H]5-HT and a subsequent 120-minute superfusion (1 ml/min) period.
 The uptake of 5-HT by arteries 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after SAH was found to be 109%, 69%, 57% (P less than 0.05), and 67% (P less than 0.05) (n = 4, 4, 9, and 6; P less than 0.05) of control (n = 13; 16.8 +/- 1.2 X 10(2) dpm/mg tissue), respectively.
 The neuronal (cocaine-sensitive) uptake of 5-HT in the arteries 3 days after SAH decreased to approximately 38% of control, whereas the extraneuronal (cocaine-insensitive) uptake of both groups had almost the same absolute value (n = 6 and 6; 4.4 +/- 0.4 and 4.8 +/- 0.4 X 10(2) dpm/mg).
 Autoradiographic study disclosed that dense clusters of silver grains in the adventitia were not observed after treatment with cocaine (3 X 10(-5) M), although a diffuse distribution of grains was present throughout the vascular wall.
 The labeled arteries were stimulated by superfusion of tyramine, which is known to replace amines in the sympathetic nerve ending.
 Tyramine (10(-6) and 10(-4) M)-induced 3H efflux was significantly potentiated by SAH (n = 6) and was suppressed by treatment with cocaine.
