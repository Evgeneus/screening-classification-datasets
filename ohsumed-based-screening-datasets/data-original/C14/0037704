Comparative effect of heparin treatment with and without strenuous exercise on treadmill capacity in patients with stable effort angina.
 It has recently been demonstrated that treadmill capacity and collateral circulation improve as a result of exercise with heparin pretreatment in patients with effort angina.
 In the present study, we assessed whether heparin alone is effective in increasing treadmill capacity in 14 patients with effort angina.
 Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: (1) group A--20 treadmill exercise periods with standard Bruce protocol twice a day for 10 days with heparin (5000 IU intravenously) pretreatment (seven patients) or (2) group B--10 injections of heparin calcium (10,000 IU subcutaneously) once a day for 10 days (seven patients).
 In group A, total exercise time was increased from 6.9 +/- 1.2 (SD) to 9.9 +/- 1.9 minutes (p less than 0.0005), as was the maximal double product, from 21,700 +/- 3,500 to 27,000 +/- 4,800 mm Hg/min (p less than 0.05).
 The double product at the onset of angina was also increased by 34% (p less than 0.05), and the double product at which ST depression (0.1 mV) first appeared was 22% (p less than 0.05) greater after treatment.
 In contrast, in group B, all of the above-mentioned parameters of treadmill capacity remained unchanged.
 These data indicate that heparin does not serve as an angiogenic factor by itself, but that it potentiates the ischemia-derived angiogenic factor.
