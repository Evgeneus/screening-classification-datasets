Effect of beta-blockade on low heart rate-related ischemia during mental stress.
 To explore the effect of beta-adrenergic blockade on low heart rate-related (mental stress) ischemia, 19 patients with coronary artery disease were randomized into a double-blind crossover trial of metoprolol, 100 mg twice daily, and underwent serial mental stress/bicycle exercise studies.
 Mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities occurred at a lower heart rate than exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities during placebo administration (81 +/- 16 vs.
 123 +/- 20 beats/min, p less than 0.05).
 Metoprolol reduced the mean magnitude of exercise-induced wall motion abnormalities (2.8 +/- 2.0 vs.
 1.6 +/- 2.4, p = 0.003); improvement was related to the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade effect.
 Metoprolol did not significantly reduce the mean magnitude of mental stress-induced wall motion abnormalities (3.0 +/- 2.2 vs.
 2.6 +/- 2.2), although individual responses predominantly either improved (50%) or worsened (29%).
 Unlike exercise, the magnitude of hemodynamic beta-blockade did not predict mental stress response and metoprolol did not block mental stress-induced blood pressure elevations.
 Patients with abolition of exercise-induced ischemia were more likely to have reduction of mental stress-induced ischemia.
 Patients whose ischemia worsened with metoprolol during mental stress had more easily inducible ischemia, as assessed by exercise-induced placebo wall motion abnormality, chest pain and prior myocardial infarction.
 Beta-blockade was associated with a lowering of ischemia-related hemodynamic thresholds compared with placebo.
 These results suggest that beta-blockade has a variable effect on low heart rate-related ischemia that may be due to a lack of effect on mental stress-induced blood pressure elevation in patients with easily induced ischemia or to effects on coronary vasomotor tone, or both.
