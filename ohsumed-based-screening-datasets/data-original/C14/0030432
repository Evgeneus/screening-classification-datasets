Current surgical technique to repair Fallot's tetralogy with absent pulmonary valve syndrome.
 The experience with surgical repair of Fallot's tetralogy and absent pulmonary valve syndrome is reviewed.
 Twenty-two patients aged 1 day to 8 years were treated between 1982 and 1989 using one surgical technique.
 This consisted of resection of the main pulmonary artery and large parts of the anterior wall of the right and left pulmonary artery.
 The ventricular septal defect was closed with a patch, and an aortic or pulmonary homograft (size, 8 to 24 mm) was interposed between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery.
 Two of the 8 infants operated on died; there was one late death.
 All 14 older children survived the operation.
 All survivors are well up to 7 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 3.6 years).
 We recommend early treatment of infants; older children can be treated electively.
 The technique used in our series gives excellent results.
