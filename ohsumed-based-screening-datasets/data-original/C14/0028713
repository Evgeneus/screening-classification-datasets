Role of arteriography in the preoperative evaluation of carotid artery disease.
 This retrospective study was undertaken to determine the role of arteriography in the treatment of patients being considered for carotid endarterectomy.
 The results of preoperative classification of disease severity by duplex ultrasound and arteriography were compared, and the impact of arteriography on patient management was ascertained.
 We reviewed the records of 83 patients who had carotid surgery planned on the basis of their clinical history and duplex scan results and who then underwent arteriography.
 Duplex scan results agreed with the classification of stenosis by arteriography in 87% of evaluated sides and were within one category in 98%.
 In 87% of the cases reviewed, the clinical presentation and duplex scan findings were sufficient for appropriate patient management.
 In the instances that arteriography was useful (13%), the need for arteriography was evident when the duplex scan (1) was technically inadequate or equivocal; (2) showed an unusual distribution of disease, atypical anatomy, or a recurrent lesion; or (3) demonstrated an internal carotid artery with diameter-reducing stenosis of less than 50% in a patient with hemispheric neurologic symptoms despite antiplatelet therapy.
