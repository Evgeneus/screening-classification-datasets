Morphological observations late (greater than 30 days) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty.
 This report describes clinical, morphological, and histological findings late (1.6-24.1 months [average, 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 necropsied patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis.
 Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 (70%) of patients, including six patients with sudden coronary death.
 Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had cardiac causes of death and six (30%) had noncardiac causes of death.
 Two major subgroups of histological findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%) and 2) atherosclerotic plaques only.
 Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaques only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions.
 No morphological evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, or tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaques only.
 Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup.
 On the basis of these morphological findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for coronary artery balloon angioplasty restenosis are proposed.
