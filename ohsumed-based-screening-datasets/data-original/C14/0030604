Long-term results after balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.
 BACKGROUND.
 The objective of this study was to determine the long-term outcome of patients after percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) treatment of congenital pulmonary valve stenosis.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 This study represents a case series with duration (mean +/- SD) of follow-up of 4.6 +/- 1.9 years.
 Forty-six patients with a median age of 4.6 years (range, 3 months to 56 years) had BPV at one academic institution between June 1981 and December 1986.
 Mean peak systolic pressure gradients from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery were as follows: before BPV, 70 +/- 36 mm Hg; immediately after BPV, 23 +/- 14 mm Hg; at intermediate follow-up by cardiac catheterization or Doppler echocardiography at less than 2 years after BPV, 23 +/- 16 mm Hg (n = 33); and at long-term follow-up by Doppler at more than 2 years after BPV, 20 +/- 13 mm Hg (n = 42).
 BPV acutely reduced the gradient to less than 36 mm Hg for 41 of 46 (89%) patients.
 Available gradients at long-term follow-up were less than 36 mm Hg for 36 of 42 (86%) patients without additional procedures.
 A patient age of less than 2 years at the initial BPV was a significant risk factor for gradients over 36 mm Hg at follow-up.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 BPV provides long-term relief of pulmonary valvular obstruction in the majority of patients.
 Close follow-up of patients who require BPV at less than 2 years of age is warranted.
