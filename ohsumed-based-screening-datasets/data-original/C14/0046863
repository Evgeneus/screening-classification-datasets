Increased plasma level of endothelin-1 and coronary spasm induction in patients with vasospastic angina pectoris 
 To elucidate the pathogenic contribution of a potent vasoconstrictor, endothelin-1, to coronary artery spasm, we provoked spasm with intracoronary administration of acetylcholine or ergonovine and performed sensitive immunoassays of plasma levels of endothelin-1 and atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) in the peripheral vein and coronary sinus of patients with a tentative diagnosis of vasospastic angina (VSA, n = 19).
 The validity of coronary sinus blood sampling was verified by simultaneous measurement of the ANF level.
 The plasma endothelin-1 levels in venous and coronary sinus blood of the spasm-provoked patients (n = 12) were 1.71-fold and 2.16-fold higher, respectively, than those of nonprovoked cases (n = 5, p less than 0.01).
 During left coronary spasm, the endothelin-1 level in coronary sinus transiently decreased from 2.27 +/- 0.14 to 1.76 +/- 0.14 pg/ml (p less than 0.01) and returned to the control level (1.98 +/- 0.20 pg/ml) after the spasm resolved, whereas the change was equivocal during right coronary spasm.
 In contrast, the patients in whom spasm was not provoked showed no changes and maintained low endothelin-1 levels both before and after the maximal provocation (0.90 +/- 0.13 versus 0.90 +/- 0.13 pg/ml).
