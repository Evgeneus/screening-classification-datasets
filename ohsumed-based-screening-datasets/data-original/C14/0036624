Reversibility of blue-gray cutaneous discoloration from amiodarone.
 A 45-year-old man had severe blue-gray cutaneous discoloration during amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation.
 Therefore, this drug regimen was discontinued, and long-term anticoagulation and digoxin therapy were used.
 The patient was advised to avoid exposure of his skin to sunlight, and a bleaching agent was prescribed.
 After 18 months of follow-up, the blue-gray hyperpigmentation had diminished.
 Although photosensitivity reactions from amiodarone occur in more than 50% of patients, blue-gray cutaneous discoloration occurs in less than 10% of patients on prolonged therapy with amiodarone.
 The presence of high concentrations of iodine, detected by electron probe analysis, suggests that the cutaneous deposits are amiodarone itself or a metabolite.
 The slow rate of elimination of amiodarone and a high uptake by fat-associated tissues may explain the delayed disappearance of cutaneous photosensitivity and late resolution of the blue-gray discoloration.
 Our current case supports the reversibility of these adverse effects on long-term follow-up.
