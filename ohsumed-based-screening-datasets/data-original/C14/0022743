Discordant nephron function. A pathogenic factor in hypertension and its vascular complications of stroke and heart attack.
 Morphologic evidence from patients with essential hypertension and Goldblatt-type hypertension reveals a subpopulation of narrowed afferent arterioles to ischemic nephrons.
 These ischemic nephrons, responding individually to their perception of underperfusion, secrete renin.
 In response, the normal nephrons are in adaptive natriuresis and have appropriately shut off their renin production.
 Nevertheless, they are affected adversely by the discordant renin-angiotensin II arising from the ischemic nephrons' presence, which exerts an unwanted sodium-retaining effect on the proximal tubules of the adapting nephrons.
 The end result is elevated blood pressure from too much sodium retention for the level of renin activity, that is, an abnormal renin-sodium product.
 Thus, "normal" renin levels in a hypertensive individual are abnormal because healthy kidneys shut off renin production entirely when blood pressure rises.
 This construction explains why angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition often corrects "normal" renin hypertension.
 Although such hypertension may be partly sodium-mediated as a consequence of inappropriate sodium retention by the normal and ischemic nephrons, the source of the problem lies in the renin production from ischemic nephrons.
 The correct treatment, then, is an antirenin therapy designed to block renin synthesis or secretion or angiotensin II formation or action.
 In view of modern studies suggesting that renin excesses also correlate with an increased risk of heart attack and stroke, the role of antirenin and antiangiotensin agents in treatment assumes additional relevance.
