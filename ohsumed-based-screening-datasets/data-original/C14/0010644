Thiazide diuretics and the risk of hip fracture. Results from the Framingham Study.
 Thiazide diuretics may preserve bone mass and prevent elderly women's osteopenic fractures, but studies have not distinguished between thiazide preparations or examined former users.
 We performed a case-control study looking at thiazide use and subsequent hip fracture in postmenopausal female members of the Framingham Study cohort.
 Cases who had experienced a first hip fracture (n = 176) were compared with age-matched controls (n = 672).
 Results showed a modest protective effect of any recent thiazide use (not significant).
 However, recent pure thiazide users experienced significant protection against fracture (adjusted odds ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.11 to 0.88), whereas recent users of combination drugs containing thiazides experienced no protection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 3.05).
 Combination drugs generally contained only 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide, suggesting that the small amount of thiazide was insufficient to preserve bone mass.
 Former thiazide users were not protected against fracture.
 In sum, recent pure thiazide use in women protects against hip fracture.
