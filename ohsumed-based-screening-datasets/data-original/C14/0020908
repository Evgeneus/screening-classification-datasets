The failure of serial pneumatic cuff venous occlusion plethysmography to predict patients at risk for pulmonary emboli after trauma.
 Over a three month period, attempts to perform serial Pneumatic Cuff Venous Occlusion Plethysmography (VP) were carried out in 51 severely injured patients felt to be at risk for Pulmonary Embolus (PE).
 Studies could not be performed in 25 of these patients due to the nature of their injuries.
 Of the remaining 26 patients, two showed evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).
 Venography confirmed the diagnosis in only one of these patients.
 Serial VP failed to predict PE in all five patients in whom it was diagnosed.
 This article concludes that serial VP is not an effective predictor of PE in these patients.
