Outcome after major dissection during coronary angioplasty using the perfusion balloon catheter.
 Coronary artery dissection is an infrequent but serious complication of coronary angioplasty that can lead to periprocedural vessel occlusion, emergency bypass surgery, myocardial infarction or death.
 Recently, a perfusion balloon catheter was developed that permits passive perfusion of blood through the central lumen of the catheter.
 It enables prolonged balloon inflations to be performed and has been used to provide distal blood flow after coronary occlusion.
 To evaluate the effectiveness of the perfusion balloon catheter in patients with major coronary dissections, 36 consecutive patients treated with the perfusion balloon catheter were compared with 46 consecutive patients treated before its availability.
 The 2 groups were similar in terms of clinical, angiographic and initial procedural characteristics.
 Use of the perfusion balloon catheter permitted a significantly longer inflation than standard balloon inflation (average 18 +/- 5 min).
 Angiographic success was significantly greater with the perfusion balloon catheter (84 vs 62% for conventional therapy), whereas complications were markedly reduced (48 vs 78%).
 With the perfusion balloon catheter there were fewer deaths (2 vs 6%), myocardial infarctions (14 vs 40%) and emergency bypass operations (11 vs 25%).
 The findings of this retrospective comparison demonstrate that the perfusion balloon catheter is effective for the management of major dissections after coronary angioplasty.
 The use of the perfusion balloon catheter should be considered when a major coronary dissection occurs and when emergency bypass surgery is contemplated.
