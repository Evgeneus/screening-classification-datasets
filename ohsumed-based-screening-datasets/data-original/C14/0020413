Digital cutaneous vascular responses to histamine and neuropeptides in Raynaud's phenomenon.
 The pathophysiology of Raynaud's phenomenon is not well defined, but active cutaneous microvascular vasoconstriction and emptying must occur to account for the pallor and are reasons for studying the microvasculature.
 It has been proposed that there may be a defect in a local histamine vasodilator mechanism.
 The role of the peptidergic nervous system in Raynaud's phenomenon has not been previously investigated.
 To study the histaminergic and peptidergic axes in Raynaud's phenomenon, we measured the cutaneous microvascular responses of patients with Raynaud's phenomenon to digital intradermal injections of saline, histamine, the histamine-releasing agent, compound 48/80, substance P, and calcitonin gene-related peptide.
 We compared these results with those obtained in normal subjects.
 Intradermal cutaneous microvascular blood flow responses were quantified by planimetry and laser Doppler flowmetry.
 The results show: a) that in primary Raynaud's phenomenon there is no evidence of local deficiency in histamine release or insensitivity to histamine in the cutaneous microvasculature; and b) that patients with Raynaud's phenomenon react normally to the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P, providing a rationale for treating Raynaud's phenomenon with vasoactive peptides.
