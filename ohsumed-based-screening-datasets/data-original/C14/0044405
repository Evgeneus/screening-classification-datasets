Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system: involvement of penetrating vessels at the base of the brain.
 Isolated angiitis of the central nervous system (IAC) was diagnosed in a 40-year-old Caucasian male by histological examination of a leptomeningeal biopsy specimen, and the exclusion of systemic inflammatory or infective disease.
 Therapy with prednisone 30 mg/day and cyclophosphamide 100 mg/day resulted in clinical and radiological improvement, which have been maintained for an 8-month follow-up period.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed lesions implicating involvement of specific penetrating vessels at the base of the brain, an unusual complication of IAC, and allowed an accurate MRI-clinical correlation.
