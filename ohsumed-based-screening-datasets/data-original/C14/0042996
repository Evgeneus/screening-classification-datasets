Iliofemoral venous thrombectomy followed by percutaneous closure of the temporary arteriovenous fistula.
 Iliofemoral venous thrombosis treated by anticoagulants alone almost invariably results in postthrombotic sequelae with deep venous reflux alone or combined with an outflow obstruction.
 This study evaluates the result of iliofemoral venous thrombectomy with temporary proximal arteriovenous fistula (AVF) performed on 48 consecutive patients.
 In 10 patients the thrombus extended in the inferior vena cava, and the thrombectomy was combined with inferior vena cava interruption.
 The AVF closed spontaneously in 8 of 48 patients (patency rate, 84%).
 An attempt to close the AVF by placing a detachable balloon percutaneously under radiographic control was made 6 to 12 weeks later (success rate, 87%; complications, rare).
 A preclosure arteriovenography of the femoro-iliaco-caval segment revealed 34 of 38 segments open (patency rate, 89%).
 Four patients had severe stenosis of the iliac segment, and a transvenous percutaneous dilatation was successfully performed in three of the four patients, keeping the fistula.
 At AVF closure 4 weeks later the arteriovenography showed sustained dilatation in only two patients.
 Thirty-seven patients were followed for 3 to 48 months (median, 24 months) and 30 of 37 patients (81%) who had no symptoms were not using compression stockings.
 Doppler investigation revealed patent and competent femoral and popliteal veins and normal photoplethysmography in 56% of the patients.
 Four iliac veins were occluded (patency rate, 88%).
 No recurrence of fistula had occurred.
 Venous iliofemoral thrombectomy seems to better preserve valve function.
 The percutaneous balloon closure of the AVF has decreased the complication rate, facilitated venographic evaluation of the result, and made possible the performance of percutaneous interventions under the protection of the AVF.
