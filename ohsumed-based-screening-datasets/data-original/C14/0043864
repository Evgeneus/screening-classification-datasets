Quantitative analysis of signal-averaged P waves in idiopathic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.
 Detailed analysis of the QRS complex can identify patients at risk from ventricular arrhythmias, but similar techniques applied to the atria have been disappointing.
 This study attempts to quantitate differences in the fine morphology of P waves in a group of 9 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) versus 15 control subjects.
 Atrial triggered signal-averaging was combined with a detailed investigation of P-wave duration, high-frequency spatial voltage and spatial velocity.
 Signal-averaged P-wave duration was significantly increased in patients with paroxysmal AF (135 +/- 8 vs 126 +/- 4 ms, p less than 0.05).
 The root-mean-square voltage at frequencies greater than 35 Hz in these patients was also significantly greater (16 +/- 3 vs 12 +/- 1 microV, p less than 0.05).
 Similar observations were made at frequencies greater than 40 Hz (10 +/- 3 vs 7 +/- 1 microV, p less than 0.05).
 These differences appeared to be confined to the third quarter of the P wave (third quarter root-mean-square voltage at greater than 40 Hz expressed as a ratio of total P-wave root-mean-square voltage, 1.4 +/- 0.1 vs 1.2 +/- 0.1, p = 0.005).
 Spatial velocity was also increased in the paroxysmal AF group (peak spatial velocity 6.4 +/- 1.8 vs 4.6 +/- 0.5 mV/s, p less than 0.05).
 These observations support previous intracardiac data that implicate delay and fragmentation of intraatrial conduction in the pathogenesis of paroxysmal AF.
