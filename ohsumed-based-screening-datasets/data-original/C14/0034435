Spontaneous thrombosis of iatrogenic femoral artery pseudoaneurysms: documentation with color Doppler and two-dimensional ultrasonography.
 Two-dimensional ultrasonography and color Doppler were used over an 18-month period for the diagnosis and management of femoral artery pseudoaneurysms in six patients with pulsatile groin masses found after catheterization.
 A diagnosis of pseudoaneurysm was made when color Doppler demonstrated pulsatile systolic flow into echolucent masses.
 One patient underwent surgical repair of a symptomatic pseudoaneurysm after the initial Doppler study.
 Serial color Doppler studies were performed in five subjects, all of whom showed resolution of flow after a mean of 18 days (range 7 to 42).
 Despite an absence of flow, one patient underwent surgical drainage of persistent hematoma.
 After a mean interval of 233 days (range 84 to 552) all patients have remained free of other complications or symptoms related to the pseudoaneurysm.
 This experience suggests that urgent surgical repair is not required in all cases of small iatrogenic pseudoaneurysms, and that asymptomatic patients can be safely followed with serial color Doppler examinations.
