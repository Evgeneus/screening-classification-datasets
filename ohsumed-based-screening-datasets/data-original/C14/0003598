Disappearance of renin-induced proteinuria by an ACE-inhibitor: a case report.
 A 55-year-old man developed renovascular hypertension that was characterized by high plasma renin activity.
 This was accompanied by nephrotic range proteinuria.
 Treatment with nifedipine and furosemide lowered the blood pressure to normal values, but proteinuria persisted.
 However, treatment with an ACE-inhibitor brought resolution of the proteinuria, suggesting a role for angiotensin II in urinary protein loss.
