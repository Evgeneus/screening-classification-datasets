Aortic sepsis: is there a role for in situ graft reconstruction?
 Conventional extraanatomic reconstruction for aortic sepsis is associated with a significant risk of operative death, as well as frequent late complications.
 We evaluated in situ aortic grafting in the treatment of primary or graft-related aortic infection.
 Eleven selected patients underwent in situ aortic graft reconstruction in the setting of mycotic aneurysm (n = 5), secondarily infected aortic aneurysm (n = 1), primary aortoenteric fistula (n = 1), and secondary aortoenteric fistula (n = 4).
 All patients survived: follow-up from 10 to 130 months reveals no evidence for graft thrombosis, pseudoaneurysm, new or recurrent aortoenteric fistula, or subsequent aortic operations in any patient.
 A literature review produced 110 cases of aortic sepsis managed by in situ aortic reconstruction during the last decade.
 Thirty-two patients (29%) either died in the operative period or suffered a lethal late complication associated with their aortic reconstruction.
 This mortality rate declined to 21% if patients undergoing incomplete removal of a contaminated graft were excluded, and to 19% with the addition of our 11 patients.
 Both our experience and that described in the literature suggest that, in properly-selected patients, in situ aortic graft replacement may be a rational treatment option for localized or circumscribed aortic sepsis.
