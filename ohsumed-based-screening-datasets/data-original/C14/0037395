Effects of a meal on hemodynamic function at rest and during exercise in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 Many patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy experience postprandial exacerbation of their symptoms.
 The vasodilation associated with eating may be deleterious in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, especially during exercise.
 To examine the hemodynamic effects of a meal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, 11 patients were studied with invasive hemodynamic monitoring during exercise testing in the fasting state and 45 min after a 740 kcal (3,100 J) meal.
 The meal induced a decrease in systemic vascular resistance index at rest (mean +/- SD, -17 +/- 14%), increases in mean right atrial (31 +/- 21%), mean pulmonary artery (14 +/- 14%) and mean pulmonary capillary wedge (17 +/- 14%) pressures and an increase in cardiac index (18 +/- 10%) due to an increased heart rate without any significant change in stroke volume.
 During postprandial exercise, heart rate, rate-pressure product, cardiac index and cardiac filling pressures were higher than during fasting exercise and one patient had a decrease in exercise blood pressure compared with the fasting test.
 Five patients with postprandial exacerbation of symptoms in everyday life had a lesser increase in systemic arterial pressure and stroke volume during both exercise tests and a smaller increase in cardiac index after the meal than did the six patients without postprandial symptom exacerbation, suggesting more severe cardiac disease.
 It is concluded that patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy have an abnormal hemodynamic response to food, in which stroke volume fails to increase and pulmonary capillary wedge and pulmonary artery pressures increase.
 These adverse changes persist during postprandial exercise and may predispose to exertional collapse in certain patients.
