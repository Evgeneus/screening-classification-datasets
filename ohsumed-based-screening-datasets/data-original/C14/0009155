Recanalization of chronic total coronary arterial occlusions by percutaneous excimer-laser and laser-assisted angioplasty.
 A low primary success and high restenosis rate after recanalization of chronic total occlusions by conventional coronary angioplasty have encouraged the application of new interventional techniques like excimer-laser angioplasty.
 In 39 patients with a coronary occlusion for 1 to 12 months, recanalization was attempted by laser angioplasty through a multifiber-catheter coupled to a pulsed XeCl excimer laser.
 After successful passage of the occlusion by a standard guidewire in 27 patients (69%), the laser catheter was advanced over the central guidewire and crossed the occlusion in 25 patients (64%).
 In 2 patients with unsuccessful passage of the laser catheter, the subsequent attempt with a low profile balloon catheter also failed.
 In 19 of the 25 patients with successful laser recanalization, the residual stenosis exceeded 50% and was therefore followed by additional balloon angioplasty.
 The average residual stenosis after laser was 61 +/- 17% of the vessel diameter, and after balloon angioplasty 28 +/- 9% (n = 19), whereas after laser angioplasty alone it was 38 +/- 5% (n = 6).
 No complications associated with the laser application were observed.
 Angiographic control after 24 hours showed a reocclusion of 2 (8%) recanalized vessels.
 In this pilot study, laser angioplasty proved to be a safe and feasible method for the treatment of chronic total coronary occlusions.
 Because it was necessary to guide the catheter by a central wire, the primary success was limited by a successful passage of the wire of the occlusion.
 The rate of stand-alone laser angioplasty has to be increased by future improvements of the technique to enable a comparative evaluation of this method with conventional angioplasty.
