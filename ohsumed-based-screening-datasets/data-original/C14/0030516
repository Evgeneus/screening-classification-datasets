Salmonella: a rare cause of subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis.
 A 36 year old woman had emergency pericardectomy because of subacute effusive-constrictive pericarditis.
 The pericardial fluid and tissue culture showed that this was caused by infection with Salmonella enteritidis.
 Cardiac involvement with salmonella does not usually present in such an aggressive manner and it has not previously been reported to cause this rare type of cardiac constriction.
