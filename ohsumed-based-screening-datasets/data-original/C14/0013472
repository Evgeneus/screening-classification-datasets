Is routine preoperative hemodynamic evaluation of nonagenarians necessary?
 An Incidence of co-morbid cardiac disease in the elderly surgical patient as high as 66% has been previously reported.
 Even in the absence of clinically significant cardiac disease, advanced age alone is often considered sufficient indication for Swan-Ganz placement, hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid states, and inotropic support.
 Yet data clearly documenting the need for this evaluation and therapy are difficult to obtain.
 All major general surgical and orthopedic operations in non-agenarians were reviewed in our institution from July 1, 1987 through December 31, 1988.
 Fifty-one procedures were performed on 46 patients.
 None of these patients had preoperative Swan-Ganz catheterization or hemodynamic evaluation.
 Eighteen general surgical, 30 orthopedic, 2 neurosurgical, and 1 gynecological procedures were performed.
 Forty-three were performed under general anesthesia, 7 under spinal anesthesia, and 1 with local anesthesia.
 Seven out of 51 patients (14%) experienced major complications, and 16 out of 51 (31%) experienced minor complications.
 Thirty-day mortality was 0%, and 6-month survival was 92%.
 Only one complication occurred within 48 hours of surgery that might possibly have been prevented with hemodynamic evaluation, adjustment of fluid status, inotropic support, and intensive care unit monitoring.
