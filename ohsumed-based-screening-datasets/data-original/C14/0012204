Lower extremity arterial disease in systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Lupus vasculitis primarily affects microvascular circulation, and large-vessel thrombosis is a rare complication of this disease.
 Large-vessel occlusive disease in systemic lupus erythematosus is most likely related to hypercoagulability in addition to immune complex-mediated endothelial damage.
 We describe the 11th and 12th patients reported to have systemic lupus erythematosus and macrovascular occlusive disease of the lower extremities.
 Our experience and a review of the literature suggest that, while aortoiliac disease is amenable to bypass or endarterectomy, infrainguinal disease is rarely correctable surgically, and amputation becomes necessary in most of these patients.
