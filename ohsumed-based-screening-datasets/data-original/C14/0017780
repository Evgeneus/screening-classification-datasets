Coronary angioplasty following cardiac transplantation: a case report and review of the literature.
 A 23-year-old man underwent successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of a severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery 25 months after orthotopic heart transplantation.
 Four months later restenosis of the same lesion was treated by repeat PTCA.
 Angiography 11 months later showed no restenosis.
 In selected cases, PTCA may be useful in treating allograft coronary disease.
