Operations for subaortic stenosis in univentricular hearts 
 Optimal prevention and treatment of subaortic stenosis (SAS) in the univentricular heart with subaortic outlet chamber and high pulmonary blood flow remains controversial, especially when complicated by aortic arch obstruction.
 Herein we analyze our surgical results.
 Group 1 consisted of 11 infants (mean age, 10 days) with univentricular heart and SAS.
 Ten required repair of interrupted aortic arch (n = 7) or coarctation with hypoplastic arch (n = 7).
 Four patients had relief of SAS by either Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection (n = 2) or aortopulmonary window (n = 2), with three operative deaths and one late death.
 Six had one-stage arterial switch and atrial septectomy with arch repair (5/6) with one operative death and one late death.
 Two survivors have progressed to bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt, a third has had a Fontan operation, and a fourth awaits Fontan.
 In group 2, 11 children required operation for acquired SAS after pulmonary artery banding.
 Nine have progressed to Fontan operation with either staged (n = 3) or concurrent (n = 6) relief of SAS by Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection or subaortic resection.
 Fontan mortality was 11% (70% confidence limits, 2% to 32%).
 Group 3 consisted of 3 patients without pulmonary artery banding who had SAS diagnosed at Fontan evaluation.
 All 3 survived Fontan operation and relief of SAS by Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection or subaortic resection.
 Group 4 consisted of 1 patient with previous pulmonary artery banding (no SAS) who underwent Fontan operation but required Damus-Kaye-Stansel connection 30 months later for SAS.
