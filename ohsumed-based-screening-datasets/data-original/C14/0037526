Giant cell arteritis presenting as limb claudication. Report and review of the literature.
 Upper limb claudication and pulselessness is an uncommon presentation of giant cell arteritis (GCA), often resulting in delayed diagnosis.
 We describe such a case diagnosed by angiography, in which a temporal artery biopsy showed classic GCA, despite the absence of local signs or symptoms.
 A review of 26 similar cases revealed that in 81% of patients where the only manifestation of GCA was upper limb findings, temporal artery biopsy yielded positive findings.
 Steroid therapy clinically improved 24/26 patients.
 These findings suggest that a consideration of temporal artery biopsy early in the investigation will hasten diagnosis and appropriate therapy.
