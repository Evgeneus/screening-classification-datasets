Temporal relationship between the decrease in arterial pressure and sodium retention in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis.
 It has been proposed that the initial event of sodium retention in cirrhosis is a peripheral arteriolar vasodilation causing underfilling of the arterial vascular compartment and stimulation of the renin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems.
 To test this hypothesis, systolic blood pressure, sodium balance and urinary excretion of sodium and aldosterone were sequentially measured in 13 conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats submitted to a cirrhosis induction program with carbon tetrachloride and phenobarbital and in 14 control hypertensive animals.
 No significant differences were found between control and cirrhotic rats in any of the measured parameters during the first 7 wk of the study.
 The eighth week sodium retention developed in cirrhotic rats as indicated by a positive sodium balance and a marked decrease of sodium excretion.
 At the same time a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure and a great increase in urinary excretion of aldosterone were detected.
 These changes were more marked the ninth week of the study.
 In cirrhotic rats there was a highly significant direct correlation between systolic blood pressure and urinary sodium excretion.
 Postmortem examination showed a histological picture of cirrhosis in all animals given carbon tetrachloride and ascites in six of them.
 These results indicate that the onset of hyperaldosteronism and sodium retention in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced cirrhosis is chronologically related to a significant decrease in arterial pressure, thus supporting the "peripheral arterial vasodilation hypothesis" of ascites.
