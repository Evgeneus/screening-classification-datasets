Possible regulation of atrial natriuretic factor by neutral endopeptidase 24.11 and clearance receptors.
 The effects of a clearance receptor ligand Arg-Ser-Ser-Cys-Phe-Gly-Gly-Arg-Ile-Asp-Arg-Ile-Gly-Ala-Cys-NH2 with a disulfide bridge between the two cycteines [C-ANF(4-23)] and the potent neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor SQ 28,603 on mean arterial pressure (MAP), plasma atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) concentration and renal excretion of sodium and cyclic GMP were determined in conscious deoxycorticosterone acetate/salt hypertensive rats and normotensive rats.
 In the hypertensive rats, i.v.
 infusion of C-ANF(4-23) produced depressor responses of approximately 25 mm Hg, but did not significantly affect plasma ANF concentration or stimulate cyclic GMP excretion.
 In contrast, SQ 28,603 (300 mumol/kg i.v.) significantly reduced MAP and increased excretion of sodium and cyclic GMP.
 When C-ANF(4-23) was administered in combination with SQ 28,603, the depressor activity was additive and plasma ANF concentrations were significantly increased.
 The excretion of cyclic GMP was slightly enhanced, but, was not significantly different from the effects of SQ 28,603 alone.
 Neither SQ 28,603 nor C-ANF(4-23) affected MAP or plasma ANF in the normotensive rats.
 Finally, the in vitro hydrolysis of C-ANF(4-23) by NEP was prevented by SQ 28,603, indicating that inhibition of NEP may protect peptides recognized by the clearance receptors as well as the biological receptors for ANF.
 Therefore, the additive effects of C-ANF(4-23) and SQ 28,603 may be due to blockade of separate pathways which inactivate ANF or to the inhibition of C-ANF(4-23) degradation by NEP.
