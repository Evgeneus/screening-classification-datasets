Effects of mental exercise in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. An echocardiographic Doppler study.
 To assess the effects of mental stress on left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure, nine patients aged 57 +/- 12 years with dilated cardiomyopathy (end-diastolic volume, more than 110 ml/m2; ejection fraction, less than 40%; mean, 28 +/- 8%) and congestive heart failure in New York Heart Association functional class II or III and 14 normal volunteers (mean age, 49 +/- 8 years) were studied during mental arithmetic lasting 10 minutes with echocardiographic Doppler monitoring of transmitral flow velocity.
 During mental arithmetic, the ratio of peak flow velocity in early versus late diastole (E/A) and deceleration time of early diastole did not change in normal controls.
 However, E/A increased significantly (from 1.6 +/- 1.5 to 1.9 +/- 1.7; p less than 0.01) and deceleration time markedly decreased (from 156 +/- 49 to 108 +/- 31 msec; p less than 0.001) in patients with congestive heart failure.
 In 16 postinfarct patients with ejection fraction of less than 40% studied during mental arithmetic with simultaneous hemodynamics and Doppler recordings, good correlations were found between pulmonary wedge pressure and Doppler parameters (wedge pressure versus E/A, r = 0.89; wedge pressure versus deceleration time, r = -0.87).
 During mental arithmetic, the pulmonary wedge pressure-E/A correlation was weaker (r = 0.67), whereas the correlation between pulmonary wedge pressure and deceleration time was stronger (r = 0.91).
 The value of 153 msec in deceleration time was the best cutoff point in predicting 12 mm Hg pulmonary wedge pressure, both at rest and during mental arithmetic: the higher the deceleration time, the lower the pulmonary wedge pressure, and vice versa.
 Among patients with congestive heart failure, five showed normal baseline deceleration time (195 +/- 21 msec; pattern 1), and the remaining four showed a short (less than 153 msec) deceleration time (108 +/- 13 msec; pattern 2).
 During mental arithmetic, deceleration time markedly decreased to as short as 119 +/- 20 msec in all patients except one with baseline pattern 1.
 Deceleration time further decreased to 75 +/- 6 msec in all patients with baseline pattern 2.
 Mental arithmetic induces changes in left ventricular diastolic function in patients with congestive heart failure.
 Transmitral echocardiographic Doppler provides a simple noninvasive method of estimating and monitoring pulmonary wedge pressure in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction.
