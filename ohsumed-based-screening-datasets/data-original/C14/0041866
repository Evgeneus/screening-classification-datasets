Successful medical treatment of presumed Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants.
 Few infants have been reported who survived fungal endocarditis; all have required both surgical and intensive antifungal therapy.
 We describe three infants, two weighing less than 1000 gm, who survived Candida endocarditis without surgery.
 Two had Candida parapsilosis, an agent not previously reported as a cause of neonatal endocarditis.
 All three infants were treated with amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine.
 Despite administration of 44, 38, and 48 mg/kg amphotericin B, respectively, no nephrotoxicity was noted; 5-flucytosine therapy was stopped in one infant because of thrombocytopenia.
 One infant died of an unrelated cause 6 months later; there was no evidence of Candida or endocarditis at autopsy.
 The other two infants are thriving 2 and 3 years after the completion of antifungal therapy; no remaining evidence of endocarditis is present on echocardiography.
 We conclude that antifungal therapy without surgery is an option for Candida endocarditis in critically ill infants.
