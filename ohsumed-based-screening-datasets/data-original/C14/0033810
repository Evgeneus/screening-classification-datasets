Effect of bisoprolol on blood pressure and arterial hemodynamics in systemic hypertension.
 Blood pressure, heart rate, common carotid and brachial arterial hemodynamics using pulsed Doppler flowmetry and pulse wave velocity determinations were evaluated using a double-blind crossover design versus placebo in 14 patients with sustained essential hypertension treated by the selective beta 1 blocking agent bisoprolol.
 Blood pressure and heart rate significantly decreased after bisoprolol, whereas no significant change occurred in the diameter, the blood flow and in the vascular resistance of the carotid and brachial circulations.
 Pulse wave velocity significantly decreased in the brachioradial and the carotid femoral areas.
 The decrease in the latter was -1.6 +/- 0.8 m/s with bisoprolol and -0.06 +/- 0.80 m/s with placebo (p = 0.001).
 Brachial artery compliance significantly increased from 117 +/- 49 to 205 +/- 84 cm4 x dynes-1 x 10(9) (p = 0.001), indicating that the antihypertensive effect of beta 1 blockade is associated with an improvement in the viscoelastic properties of the brachial artery wall.
