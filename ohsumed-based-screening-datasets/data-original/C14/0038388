The porcine model for the understanding of thrombogenesis and atherogenesis.
 The hypothesis originated by Carl Rokitansky a century ago that thrombosis contributes substantially to atherosclerosis has been rekindled by accumulating experimental and clinical evidence.
 On the basis of our experience with the experimental porcine model, several important biologic determinants of thrombosis have been identified.
 The degree of vascular injury seems to be the primary determinant of the thrombotic response.
 In addition, hemodynamic shear stress and the presence of the von Willebrand factor have important roles in the process of thrombosis.
 Although there is little evidence that thrombosis is a factor in the initiation of spontaneous, or naturally occurring, atherosclerosis, substantial evidence suggests that thrombosis has an essential role in the progression of spontaneous atherosclerosis and also in the early pathogenic process of the syndromes of accelerated atherosclerosis-namely, heart transplant atherosclerosis, vein graft disease, and coronary restenosis after angioplasty.
 Advances in the understanding of vascular injury and of the interactions of blood cells with the vascular wall have allowed development of new experimental antithrombotic strategies and subsequent clinical applications in the prevention of these vascular diseases.
