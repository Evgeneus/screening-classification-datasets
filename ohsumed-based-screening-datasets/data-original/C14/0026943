Abnormally high level of C4b binding protein and deficiency of free fraction of protein S in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and recurrent thromboses.
 A patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and numerous thrombotic accidents was found to have a deficiency of the free fraction of protein S, most likely due to an abnormally high level of C4b binding protein.
 These abnormalities, unique in comparison to 4 other patients with hypercoagulation states, were partially corrected with cyclophosphamide.
 There was no evidence of a consumption of complement components.
 The interactions between the hemostasis system and the complement cascade are discussed.
