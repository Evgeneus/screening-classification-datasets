Calcium-regulating hormones in hypertension: vascular actions.
 The vascular and potentially hypertensive actions of the calcium-regulating hormones 1,25-dihydroxychole-calciferol [1,25(OH)2D3], parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcitonin and related factors such as parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) are discussed.
 1,25(OH)2D3 has inotropic and calciotropic actions on isolated vascular tissue whereas PTH is a vasodilator.
 PHF, which has been reported in plasma of humans with essential hypertension and spontaneously hypertensive rats, has both pressor and calciotropic actions.
 Calcitonin is without vascular effects and CGRP is a potent vasodilator.
 It is concluded that several of the hormones responsible for maintaining Ca2+ homeostasis modulate vascular Ca2+ metabolism and force generating capacity.
 These substances may be long-term modulators of vascular function and play a role in the determination of peripheral vascular resistance.
