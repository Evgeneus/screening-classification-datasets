Nuclear exercise testing and the management of coronary artery disease.
 Three hundred seventy-eight patients referred for nuclear exercise testing were classified using demographics and symptoms into low, intermediate, and high coronary disease likelihood categories.
 These likelihood groups constituted 15%, 41%, and 15% of referrals, respectively.
 Patients with prior infarction or disease at angiography (proven disease) made up the remaining 29% of patients.
 Only 2% of low likelihood patients had typical angina, but physicians diagnosed coronary disease in 64%, prescribed antianginal therapy in 50%, and were considering catheterization in 28% of these patients, all as frequently as for patients with intermediate or high likelihoods for disease.
 Patients with proven disease were treated differently in that 79% were receiving antianginal therapy and 56% were considered for catheterization (p less than 0.001).
 Nuclear exercise test results reduced the perceived need for catheterization in all groups, on average by 49%.
 Nuclear exercise tests are a standard by which patients are managed, sometimes substituting for the traditional role of the history in physician decision making.
