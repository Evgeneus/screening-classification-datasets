Chronic subcorneal pustulosis with vasculitis: a variant of generalized pustular psoriasis in black South Africans.
 A rare, but distinctive chronic eruption in six female black South Africans is reported.
 The original diagnosis of subcorneal pustular dermatosis of Sneddon and Wilkinson in these patients was refuted by the subsequent histological observation of both spongiform pustules and an underlying vasculitis.
 This may represent a previously undocumented form of generalized pustular psoriasis.
