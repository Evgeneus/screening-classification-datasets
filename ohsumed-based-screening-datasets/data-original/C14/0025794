Hepatic perfusion index (HPI) in mesenteric angina and following successful revascularization.
 This is a case report of a 45 year old man who had previously undergone a small bowel resection for acute mesenteric ischaemia.
 He subsequently suffered from mesenteric angina due to stenosis of the origin of the superior mesenteric artery and intermittent claudication due to aorto-iliac atheroma.
 The patient underwent a successful aorto-bifemoral Y graft and small bowel revascularization with a saphenous vein graft between the Y graft and the accessible proximal portion of the superior mesenteric artery.
 Before vascular reconstruction, the hepatic perfusion indices (HPI) in both the fasted and fed states were elevated; after mesenteric revascularization the HPI values were substantially lowered.
 The hepatic perfusion index may, by demonstrating functional abnormality, be useful in the diagnosis of mesenteric ischaemia and also in the assessment of treatment.
 Further evaluation of HPI in patients with suspected mesenteric ischaemia is therefore required.
