Pericardial haemorrhage causing right atrial compression after cardiac surgery: role of transoesophageal echocardiography.
 After cardiac surgery transoesophageal echocardiography showed a large thrombus compressing the right atrium in three hypotensive patients.
 No satisfactory images were obtained by transthoracic imaging, which is often difficult in ventilated patients after cardiac surgery.
 Transoesophageal echocardiography, however, provided rapid diagnostic information and permitted prompt surgical intervention.
