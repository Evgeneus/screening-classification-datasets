Transient prolonged postischemic ventricular dilatation documented by 99mTc MIBI scan.
 We describe two cases of prolonged postischemic ventricular dilatation during myocardial scintigraphy with 99mTc MIBI, the new perfusion tracer that has only negligible redistribution.
 Ventricular dilatation, caused by true chamber dilatation and/or subendocardial ischemia, was still present over two hours after the induced ischemic episode, suggesting a prolonged duration of such a commonly believed fleeting scintigraphic finding.
