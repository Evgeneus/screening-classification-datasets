Left ventricular shape as a determinant of functional mitral regurgitation in patients with severe heart failure secondary to either coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
 The relation between left ventricular (LV) shape and functional mitral regurgitation (MR) was evaluated in 39 patients with congestive heart failure.
 Heart failure was due to coronary artery disease in 23 patients (group I) and to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy in 16 (group II).
 LV shape was quantitated based on the ratio of LV major-to-minor axis and LV sphericity index calculated at end-systole and end-diastole.
 In group I, 9 patients had angiographic evidence of MR and 14 did not.
 In group II, 10 patients had MR and 6 did not.
 Within each group, there were no differences between patients with and without MR with regard to LV chamber volume and regional segmental wall motion abnormalities.
 In both groups, however, a significant difference was observed between patients with and without MR with respect to end-systolic and end-diastolic LV shape indexes.
 In group I, the end-systolic major-to-minor axis ratio was lower in patients with (1.42 +/- 0.04) than without (1.72 +/- 0.05) MR (p less than 0.001).
 Similar differences were observed in group II (1.41 +/- 0.06 vs 1.69 +/- 0.04) (p less than 0.01).
 In group I, the end-systolic sphericity index was also greater in patients with (0.32 +/- 0.02) than without (0.25 +/- 0.01) MR (p less than 0.02).
 Similar differences were observed in group II (0.37 +/- 0.03 vs 0.26 +/- 0.01) (p less than 0.02).
 These data indicate that in patients with severe heart failure, functional MR is present in those who manifest a more spherical LV cavity.
