Intravenous adenosine: continuous infusion and low dose bolus administration for determination of coronary vasodilator reserve in patients with and without coronary artery disease.
 To assess the use of adenosine as an alternative agent for determination of coronary vasodilator reserve, hemodynamics and coronary blood flow velocity were measured at rest and during peak hyperemic responses to continuous intravenous adenosine infusion (50, 100 and 150 micrograms/kg per min for 3 min) and intracoronary papaverine (10 mg) in 34 patients (17 without [group 1] and 17 with [group 2] significant left coronary artery disease), and in 17 patients (11 without and 6 with left coronary artery disease) after low dose (2.5 mg) intravenous bolus injection of adenosine.
 The maximal adenosine dose did not change mean arterial pressure (-10 +/- 14% and -6 +/- 12% for groups 1 and 2, respectively) but increased the heart rate (15 +/- 18% and 13 +/- 16, respectively).
 For continuous adenosine infusions, mean coronary flow velocity increased 64 +/- 104%, 122 +/- 94% and 198 +/- 59% and 15 +/- 51%, 110 +/- 95% and 109 +/- 86% in groups 1 and 2, respectively for each of the three doses.
 Mean coronary flow velocity increased significantly after 100 and 150 micrograms/kg of adenosine and 10 mg of intracoronary papaverine (48 +/- 25, 52 +/- 19 and 54 +/- 21 cm/s, respectively; all p less than 0.05 vs.
 baseline) and was significantly higher than in group 2 (37 +/- 24, 32 +/- 16, 41 +/- 23 cm/s; all p less than 0.05 vs.
 group 1).
 The coronary vasodilator reserve ratio (calculated as the ratio of hyperemic to basal mean flow velocity) for adenosine and papaverine was 2.94 +/- 1.50 and 2.94 +/- 1.00, respectively, in group 1 and was significantly and similarly reduced in group 2 (2.16 +/- 0.81 and 2.38 +/- 0.78, respectively; both p less than 0.05 vs.
 group 1).
 Low dose bolus injection of adenosine increased mean velocity equivalently to that after continuous infusion of 100 micrograms/kg, but less than after papaverine.
 There was a strong correlation between adenosine infusion and papaverine for both mean coronary flow velocity and coronary vasodilator reserve ratio (r2 = 0.871 and 0.325; SEE = 0.068 and 0.189, respectively; both p less than 0.0005).
 No patient had significant arrhythmias or prolongation of the corrected QT (QTc) interval with adenosine, but papaverine increased the QT (QTc) interval from 445 +/- 44 to 501 +/- 43 ms (p less than 0.001 vs.
 both maximal adenosine and baseline) and produced nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in one patient.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).
