Efficacy of slow-release nifedipine on myocardial ischemic episodes in variant angina pectoris.
 To evaluate the efficacy of slow-release nifedipine (a single dose of 20 mg given at 10 P.M.
 or 2 doses of 20 mg at 10 P.M.
 and 6 A.M.) on ischemic episodes in patients with variant angina, a single-blind crossover study with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring was performed in 15 patients (13 men and 2 women, mean age 63 years).
 In all, there were 646 ischemic episodes detected with ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring during the study period, and 618 episodes of them occurred during placebo periods with a circadian variation.
 Sixty-nine percent of the episodes in placebo periods were asymptomatic.
 The number of anginal attacks, nitroglycerin tablets taken, ST-segment elevation and the total ischemic duration significantly decreased during nifedipine therapy compared with results after the placebo therapy period, respectively (p less than 0.01 or 0.05).
 Twenty-eight ischemic episodes occurred during nifedipine therapy when the plasma level of nifedipine was low.
 Thus, asymptomatic ischemic episodes more frequently occur than symptomatic episodes and the administration of slow-release nifedipine is highly effective in suppressing not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic myocardial ischemia in patients with variant angina.
 The timing of the administration of slow-release nifedipine is an important factor in suppressing ischemic episodes.
