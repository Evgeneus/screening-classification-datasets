Induction of the protooncogene c-fos and recovery of cytosolic adenosine triphosphate in reperfused liver after transient warm ischemia: effect of nitrone free-radical spin-trap agents.
 Ischemia and reperfusion stimulate several adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent processes involving release of substances including free radicals.
 This cellular response is mediated through receptors responsive to transcriptional products of gene expression; c-fos acts as a transcriptional factor involved in the regulation of genes associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation.
 We hypothesized that nitrone free-radical spin traps promote restoration of cytosolic ATP during reperfusion and prevent c-fos induction.
 Four control rats had no ischemia.
 Global hepatic ischemia was induced in 19 rats in four groups: saline solution, phenyl-N-tert-butyl nitrone (PBN), alpha 1-pyridyl-N-oxide N-tert-butyl nitrone (POBN), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO).
 ATP and intracellular pH were measured at intervals before, during, and after ischemia.
 At 90 minutes of reperfusion, liver c-fos mRNA was measured.
 A fourfold elevation of c-fos occurred in the saline-treated group (p less than 0.001).
 PBN and POBN groups did not differ from the saline group.
 DMPO resulted in significantly less induction of c-fos than did NS.
 ATP depletion and recovery in all treatment groups was similar to that of the saline group.
 We conclude that (1) nitrone spin traps do not prevent c-fos induction or alter the pattern of ATP recovery after hepatic ischemia and reperfusion and (2) c-fos induction is not necessary for restoration of ATP, but the rate of ATP restoration is inversely related to c-fos induction.
