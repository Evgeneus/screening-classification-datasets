Evaluation of right ventricular regional perfusion with technetium-99m-sestamibi SPECT.
 To evaluate technetium-99m-sestamibi as a right ventricular perfusion imaging agent, 25 normal volunteers and 25 patients with suspected coronary disease were studied with both sestamibi and thallium-201 SPECT.
 All patients underwent cardiac characterization.
 Compared to thallium-201 images, visualization of the right ventricle was superior for sestamibi in all cases.
 After computer masking of the left ventricle, count profiles for each 6-mm right ventricular short-axis slice were extracted and plotted in a bull's-eye type polar map with images normalized to maximal right ventricular counts.
 On sestamibi right ventricular polar maps, 7 of 11 patients (64%) with right coronary stenosis had fixed or reversible inferior right ventricular defects.
 None of the 25 volunteers or patients without right coronary stenosis had right ventricular defects (true-negative rate = 100%).
 We conclude that sestamibi SPECT provides an accurate means to assess right ventricular regional perfusion, with data presentation and interpretation facilitated by the polar map display.
