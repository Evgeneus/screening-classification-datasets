Is the pressure rate quotient a predictor or indicator of myocardial ischemia as measured by ST-segment changes in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery?
 Perioperative myocardial ischemia is associated with an increased risk of perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI).
 Several attempts have been made to define intraoperative hemodynamic predictors of myocardial ischemia.
 In a canine preparation with coronary stenosis, a pressure rate quotient (PRQ = mean arterial pressure/heart rate) less than one (PRQ less than 1) indicated subendocardial myocardial ischemia.
 The authors tested this hypothesis in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG), using electrocardiogram (ECG) ST-segment changes (leads II/V5) to diagnose myocardial ischemia.
 Sixty (n = 60) patients having CABG surgery were prospectively studied before initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Calibrated ECG leads II and V5 (diagnostic mode) were monitored continuously and recorded with the use of a Hewlett-Packard computer ST-segment analyzer.
 In addition, arterial and pulmonary artery pressures were monitored.
 Ischemia was defined as new-onset ST deviation (greater than or equal to 1 mm from the baseline ECG).
 ECG and hemodynamic data were stored at 2-min intervals for subsequent computer analysis.
 Serial creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) X MB (%) determinations and 12-lead ECGs were collected for the initial 3 postoperative days.
 Of the 3,463 intervals (2 min) available for study, 3,322 (96%) were satisfactorily recorded for 60 patients.
 Ischemia occurred during 65 intervals in 9 patients (9 of 60), of which only 34% (22 of 65) were associated with a PRQ less than 1 (P less than 0.01).
 In contrast, there were 466 intervals during which PRQ was less than 1, but without ECG evidence of ischemia.
