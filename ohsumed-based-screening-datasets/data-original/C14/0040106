Exercise supplementation of dipyridamole for myocardial perfusion imaging [editorial; comment]
 The substitution of intravenous dipyridamole for symptom-limited treadmill exercise has provided a non-invasive means to diagnose coronary artery disease with 201Tl scintigraphy in patients unable to adequately exercise.
 Limitations of dipyridamole/thallium imaging are primarily due to suboptimal image quality secondary to hepatic tracer concentration and decreased test sensitivity in patients who are dipyridamole "non-responders." Low-level treadmill exercise supplementation improves image quality, whereas handgrip has little, if any, benefit.
 The effect of low-level exercise in augmenting coronary blood flow is unknown and reports regarding the effect of handgrip are conflicting.
 The diagnostic benefit of these maneuvers in improving test sensitivity and decreasing the number of "non-responders" has not been documented.
 The combination of maximal, symptom-limited treadmill exercise and intravenous dipyridamole is a theoretically attractive option to improve overall test sensitivity, but the physiologic consequences and potential side effects should be more thoroughly investigated.
