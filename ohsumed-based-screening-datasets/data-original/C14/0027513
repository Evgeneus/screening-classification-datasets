Ruptured aneurysm of the descending thoracic and thoracoabdominal aorta. Analysis according to size and treatment.
 Acute rupture was confirmed at operation in 117 patients treated for descending thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Descending thoracic (n = 80) aortic rupture occurred into lung or esophagus in 8, the pleural cavity in 49, and the mediastinum in 23.
 Upper abdominal aortic (n = 37) rupture occurred into peritoneal cavity in 3 and into retroperitoneal tissues in 34.
 Aneurysmal size (range, 5 to 17 cm; median, 8 cm) could be determined retrospectively in 86 patients; 59 (74%) descending thoracic and 27 (73%) abdominal aorta.
 Size (external diameter) in the former was 8 (14%), 5 to 6 cm; 21 (36%), 6 to 8 cm; 23 (39%), 8 to 10 cm; and 7 (12%) greater than 10 cm.
 Size at the abdominal site was similar.
 Thus size was not greater than 10 cm in 52 (88%) (range, 5 to 10 cm), which contradicts opinions that thoracic aneurysms rupture only when size exceeds 10 cm.
 Twenty-nine patients (25%) were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure less than 100 mmHg), of whom 16 (55%) had cardiac arrest before operation.
 Associated conditions included advanced age (greater than or equal to 75 years) in 26 (22%), coronary artery disease in 41 (35%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 46 (39%), renal insufficiency in 25 (21%), and cardiovascular disease in 22 (18%).
 The overall early survival rate (30-day) was 89 of 117 patients (76%); 69% in patients with hypotension, 56% of patients with cardiac arrest, 88% in good-risk patients.
 Five-year (Kaplan-Meier) survival was 28%.
 Because elective operation is associated with 92% survival, this should be considered before rupture when aneurysm is 5 cm or larger in good-risk patients, in patients with symptomatic aneurysms, and in most patients with larger aneurysms.
