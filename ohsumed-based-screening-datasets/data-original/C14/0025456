Comparative efficacy of daptomycin, vancomycin, and cloxacillin for the treatment of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis in rats and role of test conditions in this determination.
 The in vivo efficacy of daptomycin, a new cell wall-active anti-gram-positive-bacterial agent, was compared to those of cloxacillin and vancomycin in a rat model of Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.
 Both methicillin-susceptible S.
 aureus (MSSA) and methicillin-resistant S.
 aureus (MRSA) strains were used.
 When therapy was initiated early (8 h) after infection, at the time when valvular bacterial counts were relatively low (approximately 10(6) CFU/g of vegetation), 3 days of therapy was found to be effective against the MSSA strains whatever the antibiotic regimen.
 In contrast, when the onset of therapy was delayed up to 15 h after infection, so that higher bacterial counts could develop on the valves (approximately 10(9) CFU/g of vegetation), a longer period of treatment (6 days) was required to cure infection.
 Under these conditions after 3 days of therapy, daptomycin was more effective than cloxacillin and vancomycin against the MSSA strains.
 Similarly, daptomycin showed a greater activity than vancomycin against the MRSA strain after 3 days of treatment, but after 6 days both antibiotics were equally effective.
 Decreasing doses of daptomycin showed decreasing activity: 10 mg/kg of body weight every 12 h (q12h) was better than 5 mg/kg q12h, whereas 5 mg/kg q24h (providing drug levels in blood detectable only during the first 12 h) failed to cure infection.
 In vitro, daptomycin was highly bactericidal at high concentrations (25 and 60 micrograms/ml, corresponding to peak levels in serum after doses of 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively) and bacteriostatic at lower concentrations (0.5 to 2.5 micrograms/ml, corresponding to trough levels in serum).
