Native right atrial tamponade with the Jarvik total artificial heart.
 Following a massive myocardial infarction culminating in cardiogenic shock, a 61-year-old man underwent implantation of the Jarvik 70-ml total artificial heart.
 On the fifth postoperative day, hemodynamic instability coupled with subtle radiographic changes and impaired mechanical right ventricular diastolic inflow were instrumental in establishing the diagnosis of localized native right atrial tamponade.
 To our knowledge, this report is the first detailed discussion of this phenomenon.
