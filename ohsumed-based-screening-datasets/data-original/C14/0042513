Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging for assessment and follow-up of patients with valve disease.
 Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging now offers a powerful means of assessing a variety of clinically important parameters in patients with valvular heart disease.
 NMR approaches will probably be most useful in patients with chronic valvular regurgitation, in which there continues to be uncertainty regarding the optimum timing for surgical intervention.
 In these patients it is possible to simultaneously assess both the valvular regurgitation and the resulting changes in myocardial structure and function.
 In patients with aortic stenosis, NMR can be applied to the assessment of left ventricular mass, both before and after valvuloplasty or valve replacement.
 In mitral stenosis, NMR may be applied to the assessment of right ventricular volumes and function.
 NMR may be used for the detection of prosthetic valve regurgitation when Doppler studies are equivocal.
 Finally, NMR imaging may be applied in patients with congenital or aortic root disease to evaluate valvular function in addition to diagnostic assessment of such patients.
 The future development of isotropic three-dimensional acquisition approaches, ultrafast imaging strategies, automated surface detection techniques, and more rapid function and flow analysis could considerably enhance the use of the current NMR approaches.
 The application of spectroscopic techniques could provide a means of monitoring myocardial metabolic abnormalities in ventricles exposed to chronic overload.
 Meanwhile, in patients with valvular regurgitation and stenosis, it would seem timely to initiate long-term serial NMR studies to further define natural history and the effects of various medical regimens and to ultimately help determine optimum medical and interventional regimens.
