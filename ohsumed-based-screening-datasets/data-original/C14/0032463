Follicular accentuation of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in an HIV-seropositive man. Report of a case and review of the literature.
 Palpable purpura in a follicular localization developed in association with acute epididymitis in a white man who was seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 Biopsy specimens revealed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with follicular accentuation.
 With antibiotic therapy the vasculitis resolved, but it recurred during repeated episodes of the epididymitis.
 Follicular accentuation of skin disease is often seen in HIV-seropositive patients.
 Leukocytoclastic vasculitis with a follicular localization may be the presenting skin manifestation of HIV infection.
