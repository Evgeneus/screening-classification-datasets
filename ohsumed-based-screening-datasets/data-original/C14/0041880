Limitations of balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis.
 Vein graft stenosis remains an important contributing factor to the failure of infrainguinal arterial reconstruction.
 Repair of these lesions before graft occlusion provides sustained patency, yet the optimal method of repair has not been established.
 Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty of these vein graft lesions has been repeatedly advocated as an alternative to surgical revision.
 Balloon angioplasty was used in 30 patients with 54 stenotic lesions occurring in autogenous vein grafts after infrainguinal reconstruction.
 The primary 5-year cumulative patency rate was 18% overall, with no significant differences observed among patency rates based on initial indication, length of stenotic lesion, or requirement for preliminary thrombolytic therapy.
 The 3-year patency rate associated with vein graft lesions requiring only a single angioplasty proved significantly higher (59%) than those requiring repetitive dilations (6%).
 It is our conclusion that balloon angioplasty for vein graft stenosis has significant limitations in providing sustained secondary patency.
