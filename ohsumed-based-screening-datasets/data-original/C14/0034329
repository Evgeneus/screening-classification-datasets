Preventive maintenance of the aging heart.
 Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of mortality in the elderly.
 Important risk factors include hypercholesterolemia, systolic and diastolic hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperglycemia, and obesity.
 Elderly patients with existing CHD should be treated aggressively to control these risk factors, along with other medical therapies to treat myocardial ischemia.
 For elderly patients without recognized CHD, however, a more conservative approach is recommended and includes behavioral interventions when appropriate and pharmacologic therapy for higher risk patients with persistent, uncontrolled risk factors.
