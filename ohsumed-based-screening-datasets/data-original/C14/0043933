Concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance in patients with preeclampsia and its relation to severity of pregnancy-induced hypertension.
 Digoxin-like immunoreactive substance (endoxin) was measured in pregnant patients with pregnancy-induced hypertension.
 The mean level was significantly higher than that in healthy control subjects (p less than 0.001).
 Patients with eclampsia had a significantly higher concentration than did women with preeclampsia (p less than 0.03).
 A positive significant correlation was found between concentration of digoxin-like immunoreactive substance and the value of the index of gestosis of von Goecke and Schwabe (p less than 0.03).
 Analysis of patterns during various kinds of therapy revealed that nitrendipine was most effective in lowering endoxin concentration.
 Although an insignificant correlation was found between maternal concentration and both birth and placental weights, the compartmental differences observed seem to suggest fetoplacental origin of this substance.
