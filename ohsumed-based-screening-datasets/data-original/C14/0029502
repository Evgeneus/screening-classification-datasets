The perception of angina in diabetes: relation to somatic pain threshold and autonomic function.
 Silent ischemia is common in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease.
 These patients may also have more subtle alteration in the perception of angina as reflected by prolongation of anginal perceptual threshold--the time from onset of 0.1 mV ST segment depression to the onset of chest pain during treadmill exercise.
 Silent ischemia may be associated with a generalized hyposensitivity to pain, although the pathophysiologic mechanism is obscure.
 The purpose of the present study was to determine whether diabetic patients with prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds are also hyposensitive to painful stimuli and to investigate whether this is associated with autonomic neuropathy.
 Nineteen diabetic and 25 nondiabetic patients with exertional angina were exercised on a treadmill to measure anginal perceptual threshold.
 Somatic pain threshold was measured by calf sphygmomanometry.
 The cuff was inflated rapidly until pain occurred, and six repeat inflations were done to test reproducibility.
 Because there was no significant difference between measurements (coefficient of variation = 0.156) the mean value for each patient provided a measure of somatic pain threshold.
 The diabetic group had a longer anginal perceptual threshold (138 +/- 64 seconds vs 34 +/- 51 seconds, p less than 0.001), which correlated positively with the somatic pain threshold (r = 0.5, p = 0.03); patients with more prolonged anginal perceptual thresholds tended to have higher somatic pain thresholds.
 In the diabetic group anginal perceptual (r = -0.3, p = NS) and somatic pain (r = -0.4, p = 0.05) thresholds tended to increase as the ratio of peak to minimal heart rate during the Valsalva maneuver fell below 1.21, but these variables were unrelated in the nondiabetic group.
