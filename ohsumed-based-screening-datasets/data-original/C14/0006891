Ultrasonic debridement during mitral valve reconstruction for calcified mitral stenosis.
 An ultrasonic device in conjunction with open mitral commissurotomy was applied in 8 patients with heavily calcified, stenosed mitral valves.
 In 6 patients, reconstruction of the mitral valve by debridement of the leaflet calcification with the device was successful.
 Two patients required valve replacement because of an increase in preexistent mitral regurgitation caused by excessive decalcification.
 The ultrasonic device proved to be a useful and effective adjunct for salvaging the heavily calcified mitral valve, which would otherwise have to be replaced.
