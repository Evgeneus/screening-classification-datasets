Smoking cessation following admission to a coronary care unit.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an episode of serious cardiovascular disease on smoking behavior and to identify factors associated with smoking cessation in this setting.
 DESIGN: Prospective observational study in which smokers admitted to a coronary care unit (CCU) were followed for one year after hospital discharge to determine subsequent smoking behavior.
 SETTING: Coronary care unit of a teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS: Preadmission smoking status was assessed in all 828 patients admitted to the CCU during one year.
 The 310 smokers surviving to hospital discharge were followed and their smoking behaviors assessed by self-report at six and 12 months.
 INTERVENTION: None.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Six months after discharge, 32% of survivors were not smoking; the rate of sustained cessation at one year was 25%.
 Smokers with a new diagnosis of coronary heart disease (CHD) made during hospitalization had the highest cessation rate (53% vs.
 31%, p = 0.01).
 On multivariate analysis, smoking cessation was more likely if patients were discharged with a diagnosis of CHD, had no prior history of CHD, were lighter smokers (less than 1 pack/day), and had congestive heart failure during hospitalization.
 Among smokers admitted because of suspected myocardial infarction (MI), cessation was more likely if the diagnosis was CHD than if it was noncoronary (37% vs.
 19%, p less than 0.05), but a diagnosis of MI led to no more smoking cessation than did coronary insufficiency.
 CONCLUSION: Hospitalization in a CCU is a stimulus to long-term smoking cessation, especially for lighter smokers and those with a new diagnosis of CHD.
 Admission to a CCU may represent a time when smoking habits are particularly susceptible to intervention.
 Smoking cessation in this setting should improve patient outcomes because cessation reduces cardiovascular mortality, even when quitting occurs after the onset of CHD.
