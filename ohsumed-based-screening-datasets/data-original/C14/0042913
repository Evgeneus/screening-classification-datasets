Dissecting aneurysm of the posterior cerebral artery: spontaneous resolution.
 Dissecting aneurysms of the intracranial arteries display vascular pathological features that appear sporadically, generally affecting young adults.
 The clinical features of this condition may involve both ischemic episodes and hemorrhages.
 Posterior circulation is affected less than the rest of the intracranial arteries, and it is extremely rare to find the posterior cerebral arteries only affected.
 Mortality is high in patients where the lesion is located in the posterior intracranial circulation, although dissecting aneurysms limited to the posterior cerebral arteries may, to a certain extent, be benign.
 We report the case of a young woman with ischemia in the territory of the posterior cerebral artery that occurred subsequent to a dissecting aneurysm that resolved spontaneously to a complete remission, both clinically and as demonstrated by angiography.
 A review of the literature is made, analyzing the pathogenic, clinical, angiographic, and therapeutic characteristics of such lesions.
