The natural history of non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy.
 Seventy one patients with non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy were studied retrospectively.
 Sixty three (89%) were followed to the end of the study or death, mean follow up time was 5.3 years.
 Whilst twenty (28%) had diabetes or hypertension, in thirty nine (55%) no predisposing condition was identified.
 In those who had monocular disease at presentation (68), subsequent involvement of the second eye occurred in seventeen (25%), seven within the first year.
 Nineteen patients died within the study period.
 Of these, nine died from myocardial infarction and four from cerebrovascular disease.
 This is a significant increase above figures calculated from the Office of Population Census and Surveys (p less than 0.001 for all causes, p less than 0.002 for myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular disease).
 Such an increase in mortality has not been previously reported, and implies that this condition carries a more sinister systemic prognosis than is frequently supposed.
