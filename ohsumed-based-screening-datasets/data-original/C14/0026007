Increased negative inotropic effect of calcium-channel blockers in hypertrophied and failing rabbit heart.
 The effects on ventricular function of calcium channel blockers and isoproterenol were studied in isovolumically beating perfused control rabbit hearts and in hearts subjected to a double pressure plus volume overload studied at the early phase of heart failure.
 In control hearts, isoproterenol produced an increase of systolic ventricular function and relaxation that was maximal at 10(-7) M.
 In failing hearts, inotropic state increase in response to isoproterenol was significantly smaller (P less than .01) with no observed lusitropic effect.
 In control hearts, verapamil and diltiazem produced dose-dependent decreases of ventricular function which were larger with verapamil than with diltiazem (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was, respectively, 1163 +/- 131 nM and 4524 +/- 451 nM, P less than .001).
 In failing hearts, contractility decrease was larger than in control hearts (median drug concentration50 of developed pressure was 604 +/- 69 nM and 2691 +/- 580 nM with verapamil and diltiazem, respectively).
 In contrast, Ro 40-5967, a new calcium-channel blocker, did not produce reductions of inotropic state with concentrations up to 10(-5) M.
 All three calcium-channel blockers produced a 2-fold increase of coronary flow at 10(-6) M.
 We conclude that the deleterious effect of verapamil and diltiazem in heart failure is due, at least in part, to a direct depressant effect of these drugs on contractility, which is larger than in control hearts.
 Additionally, the in vivo sympathetic compensation is probably reduced, as indicated by the decreased ventricular responsiveness to isoproterenol.
