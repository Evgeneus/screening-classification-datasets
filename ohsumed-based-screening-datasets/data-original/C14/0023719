Palliative repair of aortic atresia associated with tricuspid atresia and transposition of the great arteries.
 Successful palliative repair of aortic atresia and hypoplastic aortic arch associated with tricuspid atresia in a neonate is described.
 The repair consisted of reconstruction of the hypoplastic aortic arch with an equine pericardial patch, division of the patient ductus arteriosus, connection of the pulmonary artery to the aorta, implantation of the proximal part of the ascending aorta into the main pulmonary artery, and anastomosis of a polytetrafluoroethylene graft 5 mm in diameter between the right ventricular outflow tract and the central pulmonary artery, which was transferred anteriorly to the main pulmonary artery.
