Effects of hemoperfusion during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty on left ventricular function.
 The effect of autologous blood perfusion, delivered through an angiographic power injector, on alleviating left ventricular (LV) hemodynamic deterioration during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was examined.
 LV systolic and diastolic pressures, LV peak positive and peak negative first derivative of LV pressure (dP/dt), and ST-segment shift were recorded in 9 patients with and without hemoperfusion.
 Hemoperfusion resulted in an improved LV hemodynamic profile during balloon occlusion, as reflected in LV systolic pressure (127 +/- 14 vs 120 +/- 15 mm Hg, p = 0.01), LV end-diastolic pressure (17 +/- 14 vs 25 +/- 6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), peak positive (1,237 +/- 240 vs 1,149 +/- 225 mm Hg/s, p less than 0.05) and peak negative (1,666 +/- 357 vs 1,485 +/- 385 mm Hg/s, p = 0.003) dP/dt.
 Hemoperfusion provides substantial protection for significant LV dysfunction induced by conventional PTCA in 1-vessel angioplasty and is a feasible option to protect against potential cardiovascular collapse in high-risk PTCA.
