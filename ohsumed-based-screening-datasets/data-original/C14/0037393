Interactive effects of ST-T wave abnormalities on survival of patients with coronary artery disease.
 Previous studies have documented a reduced survival time in patients with an electrocardiographic (ECG) ST-T wave abnormality.
 This study was designed to determine the clinical, hemodynamic and angiographic correlates of this observation.
 Data from 9,731 patients undergoing cardiac catheterization from 1976 through 1986 were analyzed; 5,531 had severe (greater than 70%) obstruction of at least one major coronary artery, 1,706 had mild (10 to 69%) obstruction and 2,494 had no obstruction.
 Of the patients with severe obstruction, 2,536 were treated medically and 2,995 were treated by surgical revascularization.
 Patients with an ST-T abnormality had more clinical risk factors (including older age and greater prevalence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and prior myocardial infarction) and greater left ventricular dysfunction (including higher end-diastolic pressure and ventricular volume, reduced ejection fraction and greater prevalence of contraction abnormality) than did those without this ECG pattern.
 Survival time was significantly (p less than 0.01) reduced in subsets of patients with an ST-T abnormality and with severe or mild coronary artery disease; in those without coronary disease, ST-T changes did not correlate with reduced survival.
 Stepwise regression analysis was applied to each group to determine the independent predictors of 5-year survival.
 In patients with severe disease or no disease, an ST-T abnormality was not chosen as an independent predictor of 5-year survival; in the group with mild disease, ST-T changes were an independent predictor of reduced survival.
 Thus, the independent impact of an ST-T abnormality on survival is dependent on the severity of underlying coronary artery disease.
