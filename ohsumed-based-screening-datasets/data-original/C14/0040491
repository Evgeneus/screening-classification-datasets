Hemodynamic effects of celiprolol in essential hypertension.
 The immediate and short-term (2 week) hemodynamic and humoral effects of the beta-1 antagonist, beta-2 agonist, celiprolol, were compared with those of more prolonged atenolol therapy in 12 patients with essential hypertension.
 Celiprolol produced an immediate dose-dependent decrease in mean arterial pressure (113 +/- 3 to 102 +/- 2 mm Hg; p less than 0.001) and total peripheral resistance (49 +/- 3 to 38 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.005) that was associated with an increased heart rate (67 +/- 1 to 73 +/- 2 beats/min; p less than 0.01) and cardiac index (2,347 +/- 129 to 2,708 +/- 111 ml/min/m2; p less than 0.01).
 Both celiprolol and atenolol reduced mean arterial pressure with short-term treatment (p less than 0.01); this was associated with a reduced total peripheral resistance with celiprolol (from 24 +/- 1 to 21 +/- 1 U/m2; p less than 0.02) and was not observed with atenolol.
 Moreover, in contrast with atenolol, celiprolol did not change heart rate or stroke and cardiac indexes.
 Splanchnic and forearm vascular resistances decreased with celiprolol (p less than 0.05) but not with atenolol; neither beta-blocking drug altered renal blood flow.
 These results demonstrate that the hemodynamic effects of celiprolol were strikingly different from atenolol; celiprolol reduced arterial pressure and total peripheral and certain vascular resistances without altering heart rate, cardiac index or regional blood flows.
 These effects may be explained by celiprolol's cardiac beta-1 receptor inhibitory and peripheral beta-2 receptor agonistic effects.
