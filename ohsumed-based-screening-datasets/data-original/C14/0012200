Orthostatic hypotension after spinal cord injury: treatment with fludrocortisone and ergotamine.
 We report a case of a 28-year-old woman with C5 quadriplegia, unresponsive to conservative treatment for orthostatic hypotension.
 Ergotamine, daily combined with fludrocortisone, successfully prevented symptomatic hypotension.
 In this report, neural, renal, and hormonal blood pressure regulatory mechanisms are described.
 Experiences obtained from this case and the existing literature suggest that (1) in persons with quadriplegia, plasma catecholamine levels show little increase with sitting, indicating an inability to activate baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, (2) elevated plasma aldosterone and renin levels indicate a renal compensatory response to decreased renal perfusion secondary to low plasma volume and/or chronic hypotension, and (3) the net effect of ergotamine and fludrocortisone is probably a combination of plasma volume expansion and direct peripheral vasoconstriction.
