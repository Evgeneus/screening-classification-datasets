Coronary artery narrowing due to extrinsic compression by myocardial abscess.
 A case of aortic valve endocarditis complicated by perivalvular abscess extending into myocardium is presented.
 Echocardiography and aortography failed to detect the abscess, but coronary angiography revealed its presence by extrinsic compression of left anterior descending and diagonal arteries.
 Morphological features of this rare cause for coronary narrowing are described.
