Reduction of post-traumatic swelling and compartment pressure by impulse compression of the foot.
 Following the discovery of a powerful venous pump in the foot that is activated by weight-bearing independently of muscular action, a pneumatic impulse device was developed to actuate this pump artificially.
 In a multicentre international trial the device was shown to reduce post-traumatic and postoperative swelling; pain also was alleviated.
 Evidence is also presented that dangerously high compartment pressures may be reduced to acceptable levels and fasciotomy avoided.
 We present an explanation of the clinical effects of activation of the venous footpump, based on recent improved understanding of the physiology of the microcirculation.
 The hyperaemic response that follows the liberation of endothelial-derived relaxing factor (EDRF) by sudden changes of pressure after weight-bearing or impulse compression is particularly important.
