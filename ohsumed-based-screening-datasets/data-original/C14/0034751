Assessment of the extent of jeopardized myocardium during acute coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion in man using technetium-99m isonitrile imaging.
 We tested the feasibility of technetium-99m methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (Tc-MIBI) imaging for delineating jeopardized myocardium during acute coronary occlusion and reperfusion in man.
 This new perfusion agent was injected in 25 patients during elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of a single-vessel left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis.
 Distinct perfusion defects were present on "occlusion" images but not on "open vessel" images obtained 20 to 24 hours later in 21 patients (84%).
 The extent and severity of perfusion defects were significantly smaller in patients with distal versus proximal LAD occlusions (3.4 +/- 1.2 versus 5.2 +/- 1.5 segments; p less than 0.001).
 The only factor that was significantly related to the presence or absence of such "ischemic" perfusion defects was the absence or presence of visible collateral vessels to the LAD (p less than 0.03).
 The site of occlusion, presence of wall motion abnormalities, or occlusion time did not influence the results significantly.
 Thus the myocardial area at risk could be visualized and quantitated by Tc-MIBI imaging even after occlusion times as short as 15 seconds, but functioning collateral vessels are capable of protecting jeopardized myocardium in this setting.
