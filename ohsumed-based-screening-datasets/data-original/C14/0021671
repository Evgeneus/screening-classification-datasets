Proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulating middle cerebral artery occlusion.
 We describe 12 cases of acute stroke in which clinical features of proximal posterior cerebral artery occlusion simulated the clinical syndrome of middle cerebral artery occlusion.
 The majority of patients developed contralateral hemiparesis, homonymous hemianopia, hemispatial neglect, and sensory loss or sensory inattention.
 All 8 patients with dominant hemisphere lesions were aphasic.
 Accurate diagnosis in each case was achieved only after a head CT, showing occipital lobe, thalamic, and inferomesial temporal lobe infarction.
 "Cortical" signs are probably explained by thalamic involvement.
 Recognition of this syndrome has implications for management and prognosis.
