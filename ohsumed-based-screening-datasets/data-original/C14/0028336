Low energy catheter ablation of right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia.
 A 38 year old woman with a structurally normal heart presented with near syncope and had right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia.
 She was intolerant of antiarrhythmic medication and underwent low energy catheter ablation.
 Six non-arcing shocks of 25 J were delivered to the right ventricular outflow tract.
 No further ventricular tachycardia occurred during a follow up of seven months without antiarrhythmic treatment.
