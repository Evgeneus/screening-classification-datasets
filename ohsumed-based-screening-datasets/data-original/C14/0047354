Lowering of HDL2-cholesterol and lipoprotein A-I particle levels by increasing the ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids.
 The protective role of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) has been attributed to the subfractions HDL2 (according to the density) and lipoprotein A-I (LpA-I) (according to the composition in apolipoproteins).
 We investigated the effect of a high ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids (P:S) on these subfractions in a homogeneous group of young adult males.
 Two prescribed diets were consumed successively at the subjects' homes for 3 wk each in a random order; one diet contained 70 g butter (P:S 0.2, diet B), the other contained 70 g sunflower margarine (P:S 1.1, diet M).
 Total calorie, fat, and cholesterol intakes were similar for the two diets.
 Cholesterol and apolipoprotein B in serum and in low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) were lower with diet M than with diet B.
 However, significant decreases in protective subfractions of HDL, HDL2, and LpA-I were observed.
 This undesirable effect of the diet with a high P:S could cancel the benefits of lowering the LDL-cholesterol concentrations.
