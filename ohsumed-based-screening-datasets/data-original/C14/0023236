Self-report of physical activity and patterns of mortality in Seventh-Day Adventist men.
 The Adventist Mortality Study provides 26-year follow-up through 1985 for 9484 males who completed a lifestyle questionnaire in 1960.
 The relationship of self-reported physical activity and all cause and disease-specific mortality was examined by survival analysis and with the Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for demographic and lifestyle characteristics.
 Moderate activity was associated with a protective effect on cardiovascular and all cause mortality in both analyses.
 In the Cox model, age-specific estimates of relative risk (RR) were obtained for several endpoints due to a significant interaction between level of physical activity and attained age (age at death or end of follow-up).
 This model permits calculation of the age at which the RR = 1.0, or the age at crossover of risk.
 For moderate activity, this age was 95.6 years (95% confidence intervals, 81.7-109.4 years) for all cause mortality and 91.5 years (95% confidence intervals, 79.0-104.0 years) for cardiovascular mortality.
 While the protective effect on mortality associated with moderate activity decreased with increasing age, it remained significant to the verge of the present life span.
