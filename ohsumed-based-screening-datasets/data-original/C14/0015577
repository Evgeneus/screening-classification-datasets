A 5.3-kb deletion including exon XIII of the protein S alpha gene occurs in two protein S-deficient families.
 Genomic DNA samples from 12 protein S-deficient families with hereditary thrombophilia were analyzed by Southern hybridization using protein S cDNA probes.
 Protein S-deficient members of families A and B possessed identical restriction fragment length polymorphisms, which suggest the absence of 5.3 kb from one of their protein S alpha alleles.
 The abnormal alleles from individuals A7 and B1 were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction using a forward primer in intron K and a reverse primer in exon XIV.
 The amplified DNA was cloned and sequenced.
 Sequence comparison with the normal protein S alpha gene showed that most of intron L (roughly 4.7 kb), the entire exon XIII (151 bp), and about a quarter of intron M (407 bp) were missing from both the A7 and B1 clones.
 Exon XIII contains all three potential N-glycosylation sites in human protein S.
 This deletion may result in RNA transcripts in which exon XII is spliced to exon XIV.
 Such an arrangement would generate a stop codon at position 463 and consequently produce a nonglycosylated protein S molecule truncated by 173 amino acids.
