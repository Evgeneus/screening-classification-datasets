Fluoroscopic guidance in transseptal catheterization for percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy.
 A percutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (PMBV) was attempted on 190 patients with fluoroscopic guidance of atrial septal puncture for transseptal catheterization; in 3 cases, the procedure could not be performed.
 The left atrium was always reached on the first attempt, when the relationship of the Brockenbrough needle to the aortic catheter was previously observed in 3 fluoroscopic views: anteroposterior, 45 degrees right anterior oblique, and lateral.
 The atrial septal puncture site was located immediately below the aortic valve level, probably in the fossa ovalis, for the first 80 patients, and at mid distance between the aortic valve level and the diaphragm for the last 110.
 Hemodynamic data were similar in both groups.
 Fluoroscopic guidance for atrial septal puncture seemed capital for patients with scoliosis or in whom a vascular distortion (e.g., advanced pregnancy, right inferior vena cava absence) prevented a perfect parallelism between the needle curve and the needle outer index.
