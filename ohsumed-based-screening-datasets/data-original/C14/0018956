Hemolysis due to branch pulmonary stenosis after the arterial switch procedure.
 An infant with d-transposition of the great arteries underwent arterial switch operation using the modified Jatene technique.
 Severe bilateral branch pulmonary artery stenosis and mechanical hemolysis subsequently developed.
 The hemolysis resolved after surgical repair of the stenotic arteries.
 Probable causes are discussed.
