Lipoprotein (a) blood levels in unstable angina pectoris, acute myocardial infarction, and after thrombolytic therapy.
 Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] appears to be involved in atherogenesis and in vitro studies have suggested that it may interfere with thrombolysis.
 In this study, Lp(a) serum levels were determined by radioimmunoassay in 124 patients with ischemic heart disease.
 Of these, 47 had acute myocardial infarction, 13 had unstable angina, and 64 were age-matched patients with stable angina.
 Of the 60 patients with acute coronary artery disease, 34 received thrombolysis and 26 did not.
 In addition to Lp(a), serum plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin, fibrinogen, and D-dimer (cross-linked fibrin degradation products) levels were measured.
 These tests were repeated after 6 hours in patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina.
 No significant difference was found for admission Lp(a) levels among patients with myocardial infarction (0.324 +/- 0.047 g/liter), unstable angina (0.435 +/- 0.123 g/liter) and stable angina (0.431 +/- 0.023 g/liter), between patients with myocardial infarction with or without thrombolytic treatment, nor between late and early measurements in patients with unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction.
 Plasminogen, alpha 2 antiplasmin and fibrinogen values decreased significantly after thrombolytic treatment.
 The size of this decrease correlated positively with higher Lp(a) blood levels (p less than 0.05).
 Patients with Lp(a) greater than 0.25 g/liter had a 66% decrease in fibrinogen and a 53% decrease in anti-plasmin, compared with 35 and 32%, respectively, in patients with Lp(a) level less than or equal to 0.25 g/liter (p less than 0.05).
 Plasminogen levels revealed a similar trend, with a 61% decrease for the higher values and a 45% decrease for the lower values.
