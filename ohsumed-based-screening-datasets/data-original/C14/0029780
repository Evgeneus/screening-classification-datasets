The JH/LVOH method in the quantification of aortic regurgitation: how the cardiac sonographer may avoid an important potential pitfall.
 Color flow Doppler allows for methods in which to quantitate the severity of valvular regurgitation.
 In particular, the regurgitant jet height/left ventricular outflow tract height (JH/LVOH) method of quantitating the severity of aortic regurgitation has been validated and is routinely used in the adult echocardiography laboratory.
 A potential pitfall exists in the measurement of the LVOH.
 This article points out this potential source of error and, in addition, proposes steps that may be taken by the cardiac sonographer to avoid this potential measurement pitfall.
