Cardiovascular risk factor levels in ethnic Hawaiians.
 We report a cardiovascular risk factor survey of "native" Hawaiians 20-59 years old (70 percent, or 257), living on the Hawaiian Homestead lands on the island of Molokai, Hawaii.
 More than 60 percent of both sexes were overweight.
 Among males, 42 percent were smokers.
 The percent of the population with systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or a diastolic pressure greater than 90 mm Hg or taking hypertensive medications was 14 percent of those ages 20-39 and 36 percent of those ages 40-59.
 The percent with serum cholesterol greater than or equal to 6.2 mmol/L ranged from 8 percent of those 20-29 years old to 46 percent in those 50-59 years old.
 Two percent of those ages 20-29 had a history of diabetes, or 2 + or greater glycosuria by dipstick, as did 23 percent of those ages 50-59.
 The majority of the known diabetics exhibited glycosuria and elevated glycohemoglobin levels, indicating poor control.
 Hypertension, although usually known to the participant, was frequently uncontrolled.
 From these data, it appears that among this group of Hawaiians major risk factors for cardiovascular disease were frequent, while at the same time the levels of awareness and/or control for most of these factors were low.
