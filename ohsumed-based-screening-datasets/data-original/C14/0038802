Coronary heart disease in rhesus monkeys with diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis.
 Diet-induced coronary artery atherosclerosis develops in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta).
 The goal of this study was to establish the rhesus monkey as an animal model of coronary heart disease (CHD).
 From a colony of 160 rhesus monkeys fed an atherogenic diet, we identified 14 monkeys with electrocardiographic and echocardiographic evidence of CHD.
 When compared with 14 rhesus monkeys matched for age, gender, and dietary history with normal electrocardiograms and echocardiograms, monkeys with CHD had higher arterial blood pressures (mean +/- SEM, 92 +/- 4 mm Hg vs 75 +/- 5 mm Hg, respectively), lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 1.70 +/- 0.25 mmol/L vs 2.32 +/- 0.28 mmol/L [66 +/- 10 mg/dL vs 90 +/- 11 mg/dl]), and lower A-l apolipoprotein concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 200 +/- 17 mg/dL vs 252 +/- 15 mg/dL).
 Monkeys with CHD tended to have higher total plasma cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 11.6 +/- 1.55 mmol/L vs 9.36 +/- 0.93 mmol/L [450 +/- 60 mg/dL vs 362 +/- 36 mg/dL]) and higher low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (mean +/- SEM, 8.71 +/- 1.75 mmol/L vs 6.12 +/- 0.90 mmol/L [337 +/- 68 mg/dL vs 237 +/- 35 mg/dl]) than monkeys with normal electrocardiograms and echocardiograms.
 We conclude that rhesus monkeys, like human beings, develop CHD as a complication of coronary artery atherosclerosis.
 Furthermore, risk factors for CHD in rhesus monkeys and human beings are similar.
