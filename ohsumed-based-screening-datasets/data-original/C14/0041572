Adenosine use during pregnancy.
 Adenosine is a naturally occurring endogenous nucleoside that suppresses atrioventricular nodal conduction time, terminates supraventricular tachycardia, and restores sinus rhythm.
 Its use has been reported in children and adults but not in pregnant patients.
 This case documents the successful termination of a supraventricular tachycardia in a 39-week pregnant hypotensive patient.
 Emergency physicians may wish to consider adenosine use in pregnant patients needing emergency therapy or when conventional therapy fails.
