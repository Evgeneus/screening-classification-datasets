Temporal arteritis: an atypical presentation.
 Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is a systemic granulomatous vasculitis primarily involving branches of the carotid arteries in patients aged 50 years and greater.
 Its classic symptoms and signs are headache and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), but this is not the only presentation.
 This case is the first reported in a Korean, whose chief complaint was pain in the tongue and headaches and whose ESR was normal.
 The diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy.
 Her symptoms abated when treated with prednisone, but she developed diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and compression fracture of lumbar vertebrae while being treated.
 Primary physicians should become aware of the atypical features of this disease, as well as the potential complications of treatment.
