Value and limitations of secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene.
 Secondary femoropopliteal bypasses with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) grafts are widely regarded to be of questionable value.
 This has prompted some to abandon all attempts at secondary revascularization with PTFE and others to recommend that primary femoropopliteal bypasses be performed preferentially with PTFE grafts so that vein may be used for secondary procedures.
 Because we questioned both of these views, we reviewed all femoropopliteal bypasses done at our institution in the past 12 years and identified 73 secondary PTFE femoropopliteal procedures performed after a failed ipsilateral infrainguinal bypass (69 failed femoropopliteal; 4 failed femorodistal).
 Seventy (96%) secondary bypasses were performed for limb salvage and 3 (4%) for severe disabling claudication.
 Insertion of grafts to the popliteal artery was above the knee in 26 (36%) and below the knee in 47 (64%).
 Primary life-table graft patency at 4 years was only 38%.
 Forty-eight reinterventions in 34 limbs were required to restore or maintain graft patency in thrombosed or failing grafts.
 For thrombosed grafts, 20 interventions consisted of 9 simple thrombectomies and 11 thrombectomies with additional revision procedures (5 distal or proximal extensions, 6 patch angioplasties).
 Twenty-eight lesions threatening graft patency were treated by percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in 3, proximal or distal extensions in 20, and patch angioplasty in 5.
 As a result of these reinterventions, the overall secondary patency rate was 55% at 4 years, and the limb salvage rate was 74% at 4 years.
 Although aggressive follow-up and reintervention may be required, the use of secondary PTFE conduits in the femoropopliteal position is a viable option in patients undergoing limb salvage procedures who are at high risk.
