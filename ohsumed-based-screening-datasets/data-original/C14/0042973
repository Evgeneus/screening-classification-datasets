Occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts: MR imaging differentiation with nonionic Gd-DTPA-BMA.
 To increase the time during which effective contrast exists between normal and infarcted myocardium, a high dose (0.6 mmol/kg) of the nonionic contrast medium gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (Gd-DTPA-BMA) was used to distinguish between occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarctions in rats.
 After administration of Gd-DTPA-BMA, there was clear and persistent demarcation of both occlusive and reperfused infarcts on T1-weighted MR images.
 In occlusive infarcts, normal, infarcted, and periinfarcted myocardium could be identified.
 High signal intensity was evident for 60 minutes in a band straddling the border between infarcted and normal myocardium, namely, the periinfarction zone.
 In the reperfused infarct, normal and infarcted myocardium could be identified.
 The reperfused zone was immediately enhanced after injection of Gd-DTPA-BMA.
 A differential pattern of enhancement between occlusive and reperfused myocardial infarcts was evident for 1 hour.
 Thus, Gd-DTPA-BMA has the potential to allow (a) depiction of occlusive and reperfused acute myocardial infarcts, (b) documentation of reperfusion of myocardial infarction, and (c) distinction between occlusive and reperfused infarction.
