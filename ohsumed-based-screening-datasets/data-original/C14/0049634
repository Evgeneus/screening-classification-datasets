Lack of effect of PN 200-110 on neuronal injury and neurological outcome in middle cerebral artery-occluded rats.
 We evaluated the influence of a continuous intravenous infusion of 0.24 mg/kg PN 200-110 started 20 minutes before the induction of ischemia and continued for 2 hours on infarct size, histopathology, and neurological outcome in middle cerebral artery-occluded rats treated with PN 200-110 (n = 8), placebo (n = 7), or saline (n = 8).
 Neurological examination was performed 24 hours after occlusion.
 We quantified infarct size by 2,3,5-triphenyl-tetrazolium chloride, hematoxylin and eosin, and Nissl staining and by computerized analysis of tracings of the infarcted areas and evaluated neuronal injury at the infarct periphery.
 The different types of ischemic cell damage were quantified by direct visual counting.
 We found no differences among saline-, placebo-, and PN 200-110-treated rats regarding infarct size, amount of neuronal alteration, and neurological outcome.
 Our results indicate the lack of a significant protective effect of this drug in experimental focal ischemia.
