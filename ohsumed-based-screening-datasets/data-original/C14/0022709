Long-term psychosocial adjustment to coronary artery disease.
 Personality hardiness, which has been conceptualized as a potential internal resource facilitating stress resistance, was examined in conjunction with Type A behavior, perceived family cohesion and adaptability, and sociodemographic and medical variables to assess the independent differential correlations of these factors with long-term psychosocial adjustment to coronary artery disease.
 One hundred twenty-eight patients completed the third generation Hardiness Scale, together with questionnaires measuring Type A behavior, perceived family cohesion and adaptability, and psychosocial adjustment to illness.
 The results showed that personality hardiness was the most salient correlate of psychosocial adjustment.
 High hardiness scores were associated with good adjustment to the various life domains.
 Angina severity accounted for the variance in social domains, but not the psychologic distress domain.
 Type A behavior, both dimensions of perceived family dynamics, and the sociodemographic variables did not have a significant role in explaining the variance in psychosocial adjustment.
 We conclude that personality hardiness could serve as a valid indicator of long-term psychosocial adjustment in patients with coronary artery disease.
