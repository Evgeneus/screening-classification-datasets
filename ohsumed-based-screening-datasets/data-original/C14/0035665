Purification of parathyroid hypertensive factor from plasma of spontaneously hypertensive rats.
 Parathyroid hypertensive factor (PHF) is a newly described hypertensive factor that may be related to elevation of blood pressure in 30-40% of North American essential hypertensive patients.
 PHF is also found in several animal models of hypertension, including spontaneously hypertensive rats, and deoxycorticosterone acetate salt hypertensive rats.
 Plasma collected from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) was used in the present study for purification of PHF.
 Plasma was dialyzed at a molecular mass cutoff of 1 kDa, and then ultrafiltered at a molecular mass cutoff of 5 kDa.
 PHF activity, as determined by bioassay (characteristic delayed hypertensive response in normotensive rat) was retained in the fraction that was greater than 1 kDa and less than 5 kDa.
 Dialyzed and ultrafiltered SHR plasma was fractionated by molecular-exclusion chromatography, either with Bio-Gel P-6 liquid chromatography, or TSK 2000 SW HPLC.
 The biological activity was detected in a discrete region corresponding to a molecular mass of 2.5-3 kDa.
 When the molecular-exclusion fraction was subsequently fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC, biological activity was located in a single discrete peak, which did not occur in plasma from normotensive rats prepared in a similar manner.
 The biologically active fraction of PHF was inactivated by trypsin; this and its UV spectrum indicate the presence of a peptide structure.
