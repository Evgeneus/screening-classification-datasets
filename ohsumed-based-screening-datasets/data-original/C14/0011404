Infective endocarditis and an embolomycotic aneurysm in a 25-month-old child.
 Infective endocarditis in young children is uncommon, especially where there is no underlying structural heart disease.
 While septic embolization in adults occurs in up to 43% of the cases of endocarditis, there is little data on systemic embolization in cases of children.
 We present an unusual case of a 25-month-old child with infective endocarditis and an embolomycotic aneurysm treated by mitral valve replacement and aortoiliac reconstruction.
