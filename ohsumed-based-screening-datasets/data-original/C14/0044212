Cerebral balloon angioplasty for treatment of vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 Percutaneous transluminal balloon angioplasty can offer marked improvement to selected patients with ischemic deficits caused by cerebral vasospasm.
 Vasospasm resulting from subarachnoid hemorrhage related to aneurysmal rupture or occurring during detachable balloon embolization therapy for treatment of an aneurysm has responded to angioplasty when conventional methods have failed.
 Indications, appropriate timing, patient selection, and nursing implications for cerebral angioplasty are discussed in this article.
