Inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11) leads to an atrial natriuretic factor-mediated natriuretic, diuretic and antihypertensive response in rodents.
 1.
 Atrial natriuretic factor is metabolized by neutral endopeptidase (atriopeptidase; EC 3.4.24.11) in vitro.
 Inhibitors of this enzyme have been reported to prolong the half-life of atrial natriuretic factor in vivo and to potentiate the renal and haemodynamic effects of exogenous atrial natriuretic factor.
 2.
 (+/-)-Candoxatrilat, a selective neutral endopeptidase inhibitor, potentiated the natriuretic and diuretic response to volume loading in anaesthetized rats.
 Part of the response to volume loading and the potentiation by (+/-)-candoxatrilat was prevented by a polyclonal atrial natriuretic factor antiserum.
 The diuretic and natriuretic responses evoked by hydrochlorothiazide were not altered by the antiserum.
 3.
 (+/-)-Candoxatrilat reduced systolic blood pressure of one-kidney deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt hypertensive rats for over 5 h.
 This response was abolished by pretreatment with atrial natriuretic factor antiserum.
 4.
 These data demonstrate that the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor (+/-)-candoxatrilat has natriuretic/diuretic and antihypertensive effects in rodents, and that these effects are mediated via endogenous atrial natriuretic factor.
