A five-year appraisal and hemodynamic evaluation of the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve.
 Two hundred forty-four Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valves were implanted in 225 consecutive patients from October 1983 to December 1988.
 Aortic valve replacement was performed in 90 patients, mitral valve replacement in 118, and double valve replacement in 16 patients.
 One patient had tricuspid valve replacement.
 There were 100 female patients and 125 male patients with a mean age of 54 years (range 2 to 71 years).
 Present data were completely available for all patients.
 The cumulative follow-up was 541 patient-years with a mean of 2 years, 5 months.
 The closing date for follow-up was July 1989, and the closing interval was 2 months.
 The early mortality rate was 3.1%, and the late mortality rate, 3.1%.
 The 5-year survival rate was 88% +/- 2.0%: 87% +/- 3.0% for aortic valve replacement, 91% +/- 3.3% for mitral valve replacement, and 75% +/- 9.6% for double valve replacement.
 The actuarial rates of freedom from thromboembolism at 5 years were 93% +/- 3.2% for aortic, 96% +/- 1.4% for mitral, and 94% +/- 6.1% for double valve replacement.
 There were no instances of structural valve deterioration.
 Actuarial rate of freedom from valve-related morbidity and mortality was 86% +/- 2.0% at 5 years: 86% +/- 9.5% for aortic, 87% +/- 3.3% for mitral, and 75% +/- 7.3% for double valve replacement.
 Effective valve areas (average) of 12 mitral and 12 aortic valve prostheses were calculated at rest and during bicycle exercise: 2.4 cm2 at rest and 2.8 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm aortic valves, 2.4 cm2 at rest and 3.0 cm2 during exercise in 25 mm aortic valves, 2.0 cm2 at rest and 2.4 cm2 during exercise in 27 mm mitral valves, and 2.6 cm2 at rest and 2.5 cm2 during exercise in 29 mm mitral valve.
 On the basis of our follow-up period of 5 years, we have judged the Bjork-Shiley Monostrut valve reliable, with a low incidence of valve-related morbidity and with acceptably satisfactory hemodynamic characteristics at rest and during exercise.
