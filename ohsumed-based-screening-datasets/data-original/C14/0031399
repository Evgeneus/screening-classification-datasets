Effect of antihypertensive drugs on insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism.
 The close relationship between diabetes and hypertension has been recognized for decades.
 New information indicates that resistance to insulin action on glucose uptake in peripheral tissues is a common underlying mechanism in hypertension and diabetes.
 In prospective trials, the effects of antihypertensive agents on insulin sensitivity and lipoprotein metabolism have been evaluated.
 Both beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics worsen insulin resistance and deteriorate lipoprotein metabolism.
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Ca2(+)-channel blockers, and alpha-blockers are neutral or improve these factors.
 These data may explain the unexpectedly high incidence of the development of diabetes among treated hypertensives and the poor effect on risk for coronary heart disease in intervention trials.
