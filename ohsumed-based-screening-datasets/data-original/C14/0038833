Plasma norepinephrine concentrations during resuscitation in the dog.
 The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the adrenal glands contribute to the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, by releasing norepinephrine and/or by secreting epinephrine that facilitates the release of norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve endings via stimulation of presynaptic beta receptors.
 The experiments were performed in adrenalectomized and in sham-operated dogs.
 In adrenalectomized dogs the increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during cardiopulmonary arrest and basic life support (BLS) was markedly smaller than in sham-operated dogs.
 Intravenous infusion of physiologic doses of epinephrine during BLS in adrenalectomized animals did not influence the plasma norepinephrine concentrations.
 These data indicate that, as suggested by others, the marked increase in plasma norepinephrine concentrations during BLS in dogs is mainly of adrenomedullary origin.
 They also suggest that presynaptic facilitation of norepinephrine release by epinephrine is not important, but further experiments using higher doses of epinephrine are necessary.
