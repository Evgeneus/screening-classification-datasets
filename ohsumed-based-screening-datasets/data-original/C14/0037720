Percutaneous coronary mid-infra-red laser angioplasty.
 A pilot study was performed to determine the safety and efficacy of coronary pulsed mid-infra-red laser angioplasty.
 The laser was coupled with a novel 2.0 mm multifiber catheter consisting of 37 optical fibers of 150 microns each arranged concentrically around a 0.018-inch central lumen and a soft leading tapered distal tip to maintain coaxial alignment and position plaque in front of fibers.
 The laser was operated at 500 millijoules/pulse, 3.5 Hz, and 250 microseconds/pulse.
 Twenty-three patients with stenosis or occlusion of the left anterior descending or right coronary artery were selected for laser treatment.
 In three patients the catheter could not be positioned against the obstruction.
 In the 20 remaining patients laser angioplasty increased the diameter of the lumen from 0.3 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.4 +/- 0.3 mm and reduced the stenosis from 91 +/- 8% to 57 +/- 10%.
 In three patients "stand-alone" laser treatment was sufficient.
 In 17 patients balloon dilatation further reduced the stenosis to 20 +/- 18%.
 In two patients who had previously undergone unsuccessful balloon angioplasty with high inflation pressure, laser angioplasty allowed subsequent successful dilatation with low inflation pressure.
 There were no deaths, perforations, dissections, or arrhythmias.
 One patient had abrupt reclosure 24 hours after the procedure.
 Spasm occurred in four patients, and six patients had chest sensations during laser emission.
 Thus mid-infra-red pulsed coronary laser angioplasty is safe and effective for recanalization of stenosed and totally occluded arteries.
 The efficacy may be sufficient for "stand-alone" laser treatment.
 The technique may improve the efficacy of balloon angioplasty in cases of unsuccessful primary dilatation.
