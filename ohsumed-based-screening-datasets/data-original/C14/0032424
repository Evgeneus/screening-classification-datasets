Claudication: an unusual side effect of DHE administration.
 DHE is effective in the treatment of acute and chronic migraine.
 The side effects most commonly observed are abdominal discomfort, muscle pain, diarrhea and anxiety.
 DHE is a dehydrogenated amino acid ergot alkaloid and, as such, causes only limited vasoconstriction; indeed, its overall effects include peripheral vasodilation.
 The literature is replete with reports of clinical vasospasm and claudication occurring with therapeutic doses of ergotamine.
 There has not been any previous description of claudication caused by DHE.
 This paper describes pulselessness in two patients during relatively short courses of DHE.
 Treatment consisted of calcium channel blockers and discontinuation of DHE.
 Recovery was complete.
