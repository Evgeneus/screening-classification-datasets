Emergency department echocardiography in the diagnosis and therapy of cardiac tamponade.
 A 44-year-old male presented to the emergency department in shock with jugular venous distension and upper chest cyanosis.
 Superior vena cava syndrome was ruled out by computed tomography (CT scan).
 However, a large pericardial effusion was found on CT scan and confirmed by sonography.
 Pericardial tamponade was diagnosed by emergency physicians and sonography-guided pericardiocentesis was performed with marked improvement in symptomatology.
