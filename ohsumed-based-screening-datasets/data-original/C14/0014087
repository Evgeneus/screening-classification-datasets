 We report a case of acute colitis temporally associated with smoking crack.
 Colonoscopy revealed a patchy left-sided hemorrhagic inflammation from the rectosigmoid colon to the splenic flexure.
 Biopsy specimens were consistent with resolving ischemic colitis.
 This entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis of acute bloody diarrhea in recreational drug users.
