Light reflection rheography: an effective non-invasive technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis.
 Light reflection rheography is a simple non-invasive technique for assessing venous function in the leg.
 One hundred and twenty-four patients referred for venography with a clinically suspected deep venous thrombosis were investigated by light reflection rheography to determine the accuracy of the technique in diagnosing acute thrombosis.
 In half of the patients venography confirmed a deep venous thrombosis.
 Light reflection rheography had a sensitivity of 92 per cent and a specificity of 84 per cent in detecting acute thrombosis.
 The technique had a negative predictive value of 92 per cent in selecting those patients with no thrombosis.
 Light reflection rheography can be performed at the bedside or in the radiography department which makes it a suitable technique for screening patients with suspected deep venous thrombosis.
