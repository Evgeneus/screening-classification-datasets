Lateral parabrachial nucleus and angiotensin II-induced hypertension.
 The objective of this study was to determine if ablation of the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) would prevent angiotensin II-induced hypertension in rats.
 Thirteen male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied.
 Bilateral electrolytic lesions in the LPBN were produced in six rats; the remaining seven rats were subjected to sham lesion surgery only.
 All rats were instrumented with vascular catheters and housed in metabolism cages.
 Daily measurements during the 16-day protocol included arterial pressure, heart rate, water intake, urine output, and urinary sodium excretion.
 Periodically throughout the protocol depressor responses to ganglion blockade and to blockade of V1-type vasopressin receptors also were measured.
 The protocol was divided into three control-period days, 10 days of continuous (24 hr/day) angiotensin II infusion (10 ng/min i.v.), and three recovery-period days.
 There were no significant differences between the two groups of rats for any variable during the control period.
 During angiotensin II infusion, sham-lesion rats exhibited a progressive increase in arterial pressure and the depressor response to ganglion blockade and a decrease in urinary sodium excretion.
 No other variable was significantly changed.
 In rats with LPBN lesions, arterial pressure was significantly increased only on days 1 and 3 of angiotensin II infusion.
 No other variable was affected.
 It was concluded that ablation of the LPBN in rats prevented sustained hypertension during intravenous infusion of angiotensin II by interfering with neurogenic pressor mechanisms normally activated by the peptide.
