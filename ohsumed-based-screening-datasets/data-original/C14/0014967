Total left main coronary artery occlusion after aortic aneurysm repair and valve replacement.
 A 38-year-old woman with complete occlusion of the left main coronary artery secondary to cannulation during aortic valve replacement is presented.
 The clinical course was characterized by progressive left ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure.
 Recognition of this potential problem when it occurs is important as to institute therapeutic measures which may interrupt a patient's progressive clinical deterioration.
