Mycotic aneurysms of the carotid arteries--case report and review of the literature.
 Mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are rare.
 We report a new case with a mycotic aneurysm of the carotid bifurcation associated with acute bacterial endocarditis of the aortic valve.
 A concomitant treatment of both lesions was performed.
 Twenty-six cases of mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries have been reported in the literature.
 We present a review of all these cases.
