Atrial fibrillation in patients with an accessory pathway: importance of the conduction properties of the accessory pathway.
 To investigate how the electrophysiologic properties of the accessory pathway affect the occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, programmed stimulation data of 57 patients with overt pre-excitation and 33 patients with a concealed accessory pathway with documented circus movement tachycardia were reviewed.
 Atrial fibrillation had occurred spontaneously in 31 (54%) of the 57 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and in 1 (3%) of the 33 with a concealed accessory pathway (p less than 0.001).
 Sustained atrial fibrillation was induced in 23 of 31 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and spontaneous atrial fibrillation (Group A), in 7 of 26 patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome without spontaneous atrial fibrillation (Group B) and in 5 of 33 patients with a concealed accessory pathway (Group C).
 The anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway was shorter in Group A than in Group B (252 versus 297 ms, p less than 0.001).
 There were no differences among groups in PA interval, right to left atrium conduction time, cycle length of tachycardia and atrial and retrograde accessory pathway effective refractory period.
 Atrial fibrillation is more frequent in patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome than in those with a concealed accessory pathway.
 Patients with overt pre-excitation and atrial fibrillation have a shorter anterograde accessory pathway refractory period.
 It seems therefore that the anterograde rather than the retrograde conduction properties of the accessory pathway are the critical determinants of atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
