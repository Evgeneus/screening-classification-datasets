Cardiac arrhythmias from a malpositioned Greenfield filter in a traumatic quadriplegic.
 A case study is presented of premature Greenfield filter discharge with intracardiac migration and resulting life-threatening arrhythmias.
 These arrhythmias also interfered with the patient's transition from ventilatory support via orotracheal intubation to noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilatory support methods.
 The patient's arrhythmias were controlled by a demand cardiac pacemaker and cardiac glycoside therapy.
 No anticoagulants were used.
 She had no further filter migration nor significant complications for 16 months after hospital discharge.
