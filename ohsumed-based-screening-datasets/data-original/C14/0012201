Silent myocardial ischemia during rehabilitation for cerebrovascular disease.
 In asymptomatic patients the importance of silent ischemic ST-T wave changes on Holter monitoring is known to be a significant predictive variable for one-year mortality of postmyocardial infarction patients.
 This case report represents the uses of ambulatory ECG to detect ischemic ST changes in patients who have had recent strokes.
 The cases reported here of silent myocardiac ischemia in stroke patients reflect previous reports in which 70% of the ischemic episodes in patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease are not associated with angina and in which approximately 10% to 15% of acute myocardial infarctions are silent.
 We now believe that the incidence of "silent" ischemia may be precipitated in poststroke patients during their rehabilitation program.
 This belief is supported by two main factors.
 First, a high level of personally relevant mental stress exists which activates the sympathoadrenal system, which may lead to myocardial ischemia.
 Second, some stroke patients become aphasic and are unable to communicate adequately even if they experience angina symptoms.
 We have found that poststroke, most patients could not undergo exercise treadmill testing secondary to a variety of factors: inability to coordinate limbs, poor endurance, inability to follow directions, and/or lack of attention.
 We now propose that 24-hour monitoring for ST-T wave changes poststroke should be considered as part of a vigorous investigation for myocardial ischemia during the rehabilitation of these patients because they have an increased risk of cardiac morbidity.
