Protection against infarction afforded by preconditioning is mediated by A1 adenosine receptors in rabbit heart.
 BACKGROUND.
 Preconditioning (5 minutes of ischemia followed by 10 minutes of recovery) renders the heart very resistant to infarction from subsequent ischemia.
 This study tests whether adenosine receptors might mediate preconditioning protection.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 We examined the effect on infarct size of pretreatment with either of two adenosine receptor antagonists in both control and preconditioned in situ rabbit hearts.
 Hearts underwent 30 minutes of regional ischemia plus 3 hours of reperfusion, and infarct size was measured with tetrazolium.
 Infarct size averaged 39% of the zone at risk in controls but only 8% in preconditioned hearts.
 Preconditioned and nonpreconditioned hearts receiving either blocker had infarcts not different in size from the controls.
 A 5-minute intracoronary infusion of adenosine was as effective as 5 minutes of ischemia in protecting parabiotically perfused isolated hearts against infarction from a 45-minute ischemic insult.
 Similarly, intracoronary infusion of N6-1-(phenyl-2R-isopropyl)adenosine, an A1-selective adenosine receptor agonist, at a dose that delayed conduction but did not dilate the coronary vessels, also limited infarct size.
 The protection disappeared when we reduced the coronary concentration of drug by intravenous infusion of adenosine, indicating that cardiac rather than peripheral receptors were involved in the protection.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 We conclude that adenosine released during the preconditioning occlusion stimulates cardiac A1 receptors, which leaves the heart protected against infarction even after the adenosine has been withdrawn.
