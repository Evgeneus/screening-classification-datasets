Assessing drugs for the treatment of heart failure.
 The aims of treatment in patients with heart failure, as with any other condition, are to relieve symptoms and prolong life.
 A secondary objective is to do so at the lowest possible economic cost.
 When treatment of the cause of heart failure is possible--which usually means some form of surgery, but could include treatment of a primary disease, such as thyrotoxicosis--then this is obviously the treatment of choice.
 In patients for whom there is no such definitive treatment, a wide and increasing variety of drugs are available.
 When new antifailure drugs are to be developed there are therefore two problems: first, to ensure that they are more effective than placebo treatment, and second, to compare them with existing drugs.
 Both of these tests can present ethical difficulties, for it is unreasonable to withhold established effective treatment in order to conduct a placebo-controlled trial, and when drugs are being compared, it is unlikely that any new medication will be dramatically superior to an old one.
 The more effective the treatments already available, the harder it becomes to evaluate a new drug.
