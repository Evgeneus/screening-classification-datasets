The value of Doppler echocardiography in the management of patients with valvular heart disease: analysis of one year of clinical practice.
 Management recommendations based on Doppler echocardiographic examination and cardiac catheterization were compared in a prospective study in 100 consecutive patients who were admitted for evaluation and treatment of suspected valvular heart disease during 1988.
 Management recommendations were provided independently after both Doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization by different and blinded investigators.
 Criteria for severe (clinically significant) and moderate to mild (insignificant) valvular lesions and management recommendations were agreed on in advance.
 There was disagreement on the severity of aortic stenosis based on the aortic valve area and maximum instantaneous pressure gradient in 1 of 54 patients, which resulted in differing management recommendations.
 Mitral stenosis was severe (valve area less than or equal to 1 cm2) at Doppler echocardiography but not at cardiac catheterization in 5 of 14 patients.
 Because pulmonary artery pressure increase during exercise at cardiac catheterization also suggested severe obstruction, management recommendations were similar.
 There was a potentially significant disagreement on the severity of aortic regurgitation in 9 of 76 patients and of mitral regurgitation in 14 of 90 patients; however, this did not produce differing management recommendations because with most patients coexistent valvular lesions or an impaired ventricular function mainly determined the ultimate management decision.
 Although of good quality, Doppler echocardiographic examination was nonconclusive for clinical decision-making in 15% of the study population because of uncertainty about the severity of mitral regurgitation or aortic regurgitation or because of problems in assessing the degree of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with severe regurgitation.
