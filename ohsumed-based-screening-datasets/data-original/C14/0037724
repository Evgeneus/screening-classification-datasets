Acute effects of intravenous nicardipine on hemodynamics and cardiac function in patients with a healed myocardial infarction and no evidence of congestive heart failure.
 Acute effects of intravenous nicardipine (10 micrograms/kg) on systemic hemodynamics and cardiac function were evaluated in 17 patients with a healed myocardial infarction and no evidence of congestive heart failure.
 Mean New York Heart Association functional class was 1.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- standard deviation).
 Aortic systolic pressure (p less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure decreased (10 +/- 3 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg, p less than 0.01), and systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly (p less than 0.001), whereas pulmonary and right atrial pressure and pulmonary arteriolar resistance did not change.
 Cardiac and stroke indexes showed biphasic changes.
 Although positive and negative maximal rate of left ventricular pressures decreased significantly (p less than 0.05 and p less than 0.01, respectively), they did not change significantly when aortic systolic pressure was corrected.
 There was a significant inverse correlation between the negative rate of left ventricular pressure/aortic systolic pressure before nicardipine infusion and its maximal percent increase after infusion (r = -0.56, p less than 0.05), indicating a beneficial effect on diastolic relaxation in patients with impaired diastolic function.
 Our data show that a low dose (10 micrograms/kg) of intravenous nicardipine exerts a favorable effect on impaired diastolic function, but depresses left ventricular pump function with much less effect on right heart circulation.
