Copper deficiency in a genetically hypertensive cardiomyopathic rat: electrocardiogram, functional and ultrastructural aspects.
 The effect of copper deficiency on cardiac function and structure was studied in a strain of rats (SHHS/Mcc-cp) known to develop cardiac failure as adults.
 Restriction of dietary copper (less than or equal to 1 mg/kg vs.
 6 mg/kg in adequate diets) at weaning in both sexes for a 6-wk period produced cardiac hypertrophy.
 Male rats developed more severe copper-deficiency symptoms than their female counterparts.
 In both sexes of copper-deficient rats, there was an increase in cardiac length, width, free ventricular wall thickness and septum thickness.
 Electrocardiographic tracings revealed greater QRS height among male copper-deficient rats.
 Heart rate also was substantially reduced in this group.
 The increased volume of myocardium occupied by mitochondria in the copper-deficient male rats might result in increased electrical resistance that would increase the QRS height; hypertrophy or anemia also could be contributory.
 Some male copper-deficient rats had prolongation of the QRS in a bundle branch block pattern.
 Maximal rates of rise and fall for left ventricular pressure were reduced in male copper-deficient rats.
 The gross histology indicated that this type of heart failure was more concentric than eccentric.
 The copper-deficient male rat may serve as a useful model for studying the concentric cardiac hypertrophy that occurs in humans.
