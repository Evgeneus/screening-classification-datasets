Submaximal endurance exercise performance during enalapril treatment in patients with essential hypertension.
 In a double-blind randomized crossover study of 10 patients with mild essential hypertension, the influence of antihypertensive treatment with the angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril (a single dose of 10 mg.day-1) on submaximal endurance exercise performance at a work rate eliciting a heart rate of 150 beats/min was studied.
 Resting and exercise blood pressure were significantly reduced during enalapril therapy.
 Heart rate was unaffected.
 Submaximal endurance exercise performance was reduced by 12% (p = 0.06).
 Plasma lactate concentrations were significantly increased and serum nonesterified fatty acid concentrations were decreased during exercise in patients receiving enalapril treatment.
 Plasma glucose and potassium levels and serum glycerol concentrations were not influenced by enalapril treatment.
 Because the impairment of endurance performance during enalapril treatment is relatively small compared with the reductions caused by other antihypertensive agents, such as beta-adrenoceptor blocking agents or diuretics, it is of minor clinical importance for most physically active patients with hypertension.
