Clinical and anatomical considerations for nonoperative therapy in tibial disease and the results of angioplasty.
 For a 6-year period, 96 patients had 146 below-knee angioplasties.
 There were 31 total occlusions and 95 multiple stenoses.
 All patients had distal ischemia, and 40% had gangrene.
 The primary success rate was 97%, and the 2-year limb salvage rate was 83%.
 The ankle/brachial index increased from a mean of 0.25 before the procedure to 0.62 afterward.
 At 2 years (35 patients), the mean ankle/brachial index was 0.55.
 For the same period, 320 femorodistal bypasses were performed.
 The results of angioplasty are comparable to those of surgery, but angioplasty is only suitable in about 20-30% of patients presenting with isolated tibial disease.
 Suitable lesions are five or fewer stenoses and occlusions 5 cm or less in length.
