Transcatheter treatment of splenic artery aneurysms (SAA). Report of two cases.
 Splenic artery embolization with steel coils was performed in two patients who both had large splenic artery aneurysms and hepatic cirrhosis complicated by hypersplenism.
 A good clinical effect was noticed after the procedure.
 It was concluded that this treatment is safe and effective and decreases the risk of splenic artery rupture.
 It also corrects hypersplenism.
 Transcatheter embolization appears to be a preferable alternative to surgery in such cases.
