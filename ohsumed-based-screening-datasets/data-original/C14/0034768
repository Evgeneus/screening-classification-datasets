Radiation exposure of pediatric patients and physicians during cardiac catheterization and balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.
 Thermoluminescent dosimeters were applied to various areas of 61 pediatric patients and physicians to measure radiation doses during routine cardiac catheterization and during 4 cases of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty.
 Radiation doses were measured during chest roentgenography, fluoroscopy and cineangiography.
 Average skin dose to the chest was 121 microGy during chest x-ray, 5,182 microGy during catheterization and 641 mGy during valvuloplasty.
 For the eyes, thyroid and gonads of the patients, the exposure during routine catheterization was equal to 0.4, 6 and 0.2 chest x-rays, respectively.
 Radiation dose of the operator was 3 microGy for the eyes and 6 miCroGy in the thyroid.
 About 56% of the operator's dose could be reduced by thyroid shields, and 80% by lead aprons.
 The assistant received only 1 microGy outside the thyroid shield.
 Therefore, we have concluded that the patients' dose during routine catheterization is largely based on our experimental results, but the dose is acceptable based on the risk factor analysis.
 The skin dose to the right lateral chest of the patient during valvuloplasty is extremely high, perhaps as high as the equivalent of 1,000 chest x-rays.
 Besides the clinical benefits of valvuloplasty, the long-term radiation-related hazards to the patient should be carefully monitored.
