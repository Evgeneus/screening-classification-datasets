Platelet-free calcium and vascular calcium uptake in ethanol-induced hypertensive rats.
 This study examined the effect of moderate ethanol intake on systolic blood pressure, platelet cytosolic free calcium, aortic calcium, and rubidium-86 uptake in Wistar-Kyoto rats.
 Twelve Wistar-Kyoto rats, aged 6 weeks, were given 5% ethanol in drinking water the first week followed by 10% ethanol in drinking water for the next 6 weeks.
 Twelve control animals were given regular tap water.
 Systolic blood pressure in the ethanol-treated rats was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) than that in controls after 1 week and remained higher throughout the study.
 At 13 weeks of age, platelet cytosolic free calcium and calcium uptake by aortas were significantly higher (p less than 0.001) in ethanol-treated animals as compared with those in controls.
 Ethanol intake did not affect aortic ouabain-sensitive 86Rb uptake.
 The in vitro effect of ethanol on calcium-45 and 86Rb uptake was also investigated in aortas of untreated Wistar-Kyoto rats at 13 weeks of age.
 In vitro ethanol (2.5-20 mmols/l) did not significantly affect 45Ca and 86Rb uptake in rat aortas.
 The increases in systolic blood pressure, platelet cytosolic free calcium, and vascular calcium uptake suggest that increases in cytosolic free calcium and calcium uptake mechanisms are associated with ethanol-induced hypertension.
