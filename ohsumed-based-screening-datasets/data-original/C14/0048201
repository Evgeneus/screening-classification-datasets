Effects of isradipine on platelet function in hypertension at rest and during exercise.
 The effects of eight weeks of treatment with isradipine (1.25 mg twice daily for four weeks, followed by 2.5 mg twice daily for four weeks) on ex vivo platelet function were investigated in ten male patients with hypertension.
 Systolic and diastolic blood pressures, platelet aggregation in response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), serum thromboxane B2, and beta-thromboglobulin levels were significantly decreased (P less than .05) at rest before exercise ergometry, during exercise, and at rest after exercise.
 The platelet count and plasma levels of 6-oxo-prostaglandin F1 alpha (PGF1 alpha) were not affected by isradipine.
 It is concluded that treatment of hypertension with a compound that lowers blood pressure and inhibits platelet activation may be of clinical benefit when routinely applied in hypertensive patients.
