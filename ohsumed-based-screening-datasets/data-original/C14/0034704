Late cardiac tamponade after open-heart surgery.
 Late cardiac tamponade occurred in 74 patients 5-287 (median 16) days after open-heart surgery and was treated with pericardiocentesis or surgery.
 The overall incidence of late cardiac tamponade was 1.3%.
 After valve operations it was 2.6% and after isolated coronary surgery 0.7% (53/2,028 vs.
 18/2,661, p less than 0.002).
 The diagnosis was assessed by echocardiography in 93% of cases.
 Pericardiocentesis, attempted in 65 cases (88%), was curative in 80% but failed in 20%.
 Eight of the latter 13 underwent emergency surgery and five were medically treated.
 Failure of pericardiocentesis was associated with posterior location of fluid, clots, echo-free space less than 20 mm or myocardial insufficiency.
 The subxiphoid part of the wound was surgically re-entered in ten cases and the entire sternotomy in seven.
 Four patients (5%) died within 30 days of the primary intervention.
 All hospital survivors were observed for a median of 44 (range 11-115) months.
 Three (4%) had recurrent pericardial effusion requiring repeat pericardiocentesis, but none had pericardial constriction.
 The 5-year survival rate was 73%.
