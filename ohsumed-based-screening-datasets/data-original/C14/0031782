Screening for unruptured asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms in patients undergoing coronary angiography.
 In screening for unruptured asymptomatic intracranial aneurysms, an intracranial intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (IA-DSA), posteroanterior view, was obtained in 72 consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography for workup of angina pectoris.
 In cases where an aneurysm was suspected from IA-DSA, conventional intracranial angiography was obtained.
 Five asymptomatic unruptured aneurysms were detected in four of these cases.
 The aneurysms ranged from 4 to 16 mm in diameter.
 There were no complications associated with the coronary angiography nor with the additional intracranial IA-DSA, which required less than 5 minutes to perform in all cases.
 The value of performing intracranial IA-DSA in patients undergoing coronary angiography to screen for unruptured asymptomatic aneurysm is discussed, as is the possible racial differences in the frequency of aneurysms.
