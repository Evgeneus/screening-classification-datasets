The acute and chronic antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be explained by blockade of vascular serotonin, type 2, receptors or alpha 1-adrenergic receptors.
 The mechanism underlying the antihypertensive effect of acute and chronic administration of ketanserin was investigated in eight hypertensive patients.
 Intrabrachial artery infusions of serotonin and the selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor agonist methoxamine were given before and 1 hour after a single oral dose of 20 mg ketanserin and after 4 weeks of treatment with 20 to 40 mg twice daily.
 Blood pressure was reduced by ketanserin both after the initial dose (p less than 0.01) and after 4 weeks of treatment (p less than 0.01).
 During placebo, serotonin, 1 ng/kg/min, increased forearm blood flow by 51% +/- 9% (p less than 0.01), whereas the highest dose induced a decrease in flow (-33% +/- 6%; p less than 0.01).
 Methoxamine elicited a vasoconstriction (p less than 0.001).
 These effects of serotonin and methoxamine were not influenced by either the initial dose of ketanserin or after 4 weeks of treatment.
 It is concluded that serotonin cannot be considered a general endogenous pressor agent in these patients.
 The antihypertensive effects of ketanserin cannot be attributed to either vascular alpha 1-receptor or serotonin, type 2, receptor blockade.
