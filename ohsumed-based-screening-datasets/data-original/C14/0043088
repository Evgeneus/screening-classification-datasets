Adult chronic lead intoxication. A clinical review.
 A stained-glass artisan with depression and a retired junkyard worker with congestive cardiomyopathy had increased mobilizable body burdens of lead by calcium ethylenediaminetetaacetic acid testing.
 Although both patients improved with several months of intramuscular chelation therapy, the efficacy of such therapy in chronic lead poisoning is controversial.
 Recognition of unusual manifestations of chronic lead poisoning may at least interrupt further exposure, even if specific therapy is not undertaken.
