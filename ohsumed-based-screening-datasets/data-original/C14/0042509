Quantification of valvular regurgitation by Doppler echocardiography.
 One of the widest uses of color Doppler echocardiography is for the quantification of valvular regurgitation.
 In this article we review the physics and instrumentation factors related to the most commonly applied method, that of planimetering areas of regurgitant jet spray within the receiving chamber, and relate features such as instrument gain, pulse repetition frequency, and important physical parameters such as receiving chamber compliance and driving pressure to the application of this method for precordial as well as transesophageal echocardiography.
 New approaches to the quantification of valvular insufficiency, such as measurement of the momentum of the jet and study of the acceleration flow in the proximal flow convergence region within the chamber of origin of an insufficiency jet and proximal to the orifice, are described and preliminary results given for a new method of quantification of volume flow across regurgitant orifices.
