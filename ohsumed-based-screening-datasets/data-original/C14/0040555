Acute cutaneous vasculitis associated with prolonged intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride therapy.
 A patient with twin gestation was hospitalized because of preterm labor and treated with intravenous ritodrine hydrochloride (Yutopar, Astra Pharmaceutical Products, Westborough, Mass.).
 After greater than 4 weeks of therapy, the patient had a petechial rash and prolonged bleeding time, which were diagnosed and confirmed by skin biopsy at cesarean section as vasculitis.
 This is the first documented case of vasculitis associated with ritodrine use.
