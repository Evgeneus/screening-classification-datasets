Frequency of low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in hospitalized patients with "desirable" total cholesterol levels.
 Because the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines suggest that levels of total serum cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) are "desirable," we performed a retrospective observational analysis to determine the prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) and the prevalence of total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) in patients with CAD by angiography.
 Cholesterol levels less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) were found in 1,084 of 2,535 patients (42%) having cholesterol measured on hospital admission; 690 of these 1,084 (64%) had CAD.
 These patients were mostly men, had a family history of premature CAD, and 60% (414 of 690) had high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl).
 In a separate group of patients defined from the same admission population but having angiographically established CAD, 32% (424 of 1,197) had a total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl), 59% of whom (252 of 424) had HDL less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl).
 An analysis of persons admitted electively for angiography (to exclude any effects of hospitalization per se on serum lipids) revealed a similar proportion of persons with total cholesterol less than 5.17 mmol/liter (200 mg/dl) (35%), CAD (82%), and HDL less than 0.90 mmol/liter (35 mg/dl).
