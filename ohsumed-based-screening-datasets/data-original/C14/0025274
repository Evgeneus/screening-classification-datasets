1990 ARRS Executive Council Award. Intravascular sonography in the detection of arteriosclerosis and evaluation of vascular interventional procedures.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of intravascular sonography for the detection of arteriosclerosis and to determine the effects of vascular interventional procedures on the arterial wall.
 A catheter-based 20-MHz transducer was used.
 Forty patients were studied.
 Twelve had clinical evidence of peripheral vascular disease, 13 were healthy renal donors, and 15 underwent vascular interventional procedures.
 The aorta and the ipsilateral iliac artery were examined in real time under fluoroscopic guidance and the results were compared with angiography.
 Sonography in eight of the 13 renal donors showed arterial wall abnormalities in the absence of angiographic evidence of disease.
 Sonography of the 15 patients after angioplasty or atherectomy demonstrated plaque fractures, intramural dissections, or atherectomy grooves.
 Our experience suggests that intravascular sonography is of value in reducing the use of angiography to monitor progress or complications of vascular interventional procedures.
