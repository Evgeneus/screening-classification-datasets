Myocardial perfusion imaging with technetium-99m-labeled agents.
 Thallium-201 (201Tl) is suboptimal as a single-photon emitting agent for myocardial perfusion imaging, in view of its low-energy photons and long half-life.
 To circumvent these limitations, two new myocardial perfusion imaging agents labeled with technetium-99m (99mTc) have been developed.
 They are Tc-sestamibi and Tc-teboroxime.
 Clinical trials of myocardial perfusion with both tracers have shown results similar to those obtained with 201Tl for detection of coronary artery disease.
 Results to date indicate that Tc-sestamibi accurately detects and locates myocardial infarction and can accurately assess both left and right ventricular ejection fractions by the first-pass technique.
 In addition, research has shown that rest-stress studies can be performed on the same day and that Tc-sestamibi can be used to assess the results of thrombolytic therapy.
 Tc-teboroxime has excellent myocardial tracer uptake characteristics but is cleared very rapidly from the myocardium.
 These features make Tc-teboroxime well suited to rapid serial studies.
 These new technetium myocardial perfusion agents have just become available for routine clinical use and are likely to replace 201Tl in many of its clinical applications.
