Estimation of myocardial infarct size with ultrasonic tissue characterization.
 BACKGROUND.
 Ultrasonic tissue characterization (UTC) can distinguish normal from infarcted myocardium.
 Infarcted myocardium shows an increase in integrated backscatter and loss of cardiac cycle-dependent variation in backscatter.
 The cyclic variation of backscatter is closely related to regional myocardial contractile function; the latter is a marker of myocardial ischemia.
 The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that intramural cyclic variation of backscatter can map and estimate infarct size.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Transmural myocardial infarction was produced in 12 anesthetized, open-chest dogs by total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 4 hours.
 A real-time ultrasonic tissue characterization instrument, which graphically displays integrated backscatter Rayleigh 5, cardiac cycle-dependent variation, and patterns of cyclic variation in backscatter, was used to map infarct size and area at risk of infarction.
 Staining with 2,3,4-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and Patent Blue Dye was used to estimate infarct size and the area at risk, respectively.
 The ratio of infarct size to area at risk of infarction determined with UTC correlated well with that determined with TCC (r = 0.862, y = 23.7 +/- 0.792x).
 Correlation coefficients for infarct size and area at risk were also good (r = 0.736, y = 12.3 +/- 737x for infarct size and r = 0.714, y = 5.80 +/- 1.012x for area at risk).
 However, UTC underestimated both infarct size and area at risk.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Ultrasonic tissue characterization may provide a reliable, noninvasive method to estimate myocardial infarct size.
