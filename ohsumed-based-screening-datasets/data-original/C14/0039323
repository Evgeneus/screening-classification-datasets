Selenium deficiency and cardiomyopathy in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Selenium deficiency is common in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and may contribute to the development of cardiomyopathy.
 A 5-year-old boy with congenital human immunodeficiency virus infection developed cardiomyopathy.
 Evaluation for reversible causes of cardiomyopathy was notable for the diagnosis of selenium deficiency.
 Cardiac function improved on selenium supplementation.
 The role of selenium in cardiac dysfunction and the need for nutritional evaluation and supplementation of malnourished patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome is discussed.
