Platelet aggregation is not necessary for occurrence of Raynaud's phenomenon: a clinical history and laboratory results.
 "Raynaud's phenomenon (R.P.) is characterized by a spastic vasoconstriction of hand and/or feet extremities leading to painful ischemic attacks.
 In the pathogeny of this syndrome the role of a platelet hyperactivation was evidenced.
 Nevertheless, the responsibility of platelet aggregation remains controversial.
 We report here the case of a patient presenting with a Glanzmann thrombasthenia defined by the complete lack of platelet aggregation, and showing a typical RP which was confirmed by the measurement of hand temperature and the decrease of digital and hand blood flow.
 Thus, the description of this case shows that platelet aggregation by itself is not necessary for the occurrence of RP, and encourages for therapeutic purposes the development of vasodilatators rather than platelet antiaggregants agents.".
