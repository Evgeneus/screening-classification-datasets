Costal fringe.
 Costal fringe consists of a bandlike pattern of venous telangiectases along the anterolateral costal margins.
 It is a common and easily recognized entity, usually seen in elderly men.
 Association with underlying disease is not well established.
 To assess the frequency of costal fringe in a healthy young adult population, we examined 1523 active duty Air Force personnel (1203 men and 320 women) between the ages of 17 and 34 years.
 All subjects were human immunodeficiency virus seronegative; none had known hyperestrogenic or other disease states.
 Costal fringe was present in only three individuals, all men, a frequency of 0.2%.
 Costal fringe is a rare finding in healthy young adults.
