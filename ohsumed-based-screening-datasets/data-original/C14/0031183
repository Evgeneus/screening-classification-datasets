Effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, coronary blood flow, and mechanical properties of cardiac muscle in renovascular hypertensive rats.
 We studied the effects of perindopril on left ventricular hypertrophy, systemic and coronary hemodynamics, and mechanical cardiac performance in renovascular hypertensive rats (Goldblatt, two-kidneys, one-clip).
 Systemic and coronary hemodynamics, before and after carbochrome infusion, were assessed by radioactive microspheres injection via an atrial catheter in conscious rats.
 Mechanical performance was measured on isolated papillary muscle from the same animal.
 Twelve treated hypertensive rats were compared with 10 nontreated hypertensive rats and nine sham-operated normotensive rats of the same age.
 Perindopril treatment induced a complete control of blood pressure (mean blood pressure from 156 +/- 22 mm Hg in the untreated group to 100 +/- 24 mm Hg in the treated group (P less than .01), compared to 106 +/- 18 mm Hg in the sham group).
 This was associated with a nearly complete regression of left ventricular hypertrophy (left ventricular mass/body weight 2.26 +/- 0.38 mg/g in the treated group v 3.1 +/- 0.6 in the untreated group [P less than .01], compared to 2 +/- 0.25 mg/g in the sham group [p = NS]).
 Minimal left ventricular coronary resistances after carbochrome were slightly higher in the hypertensive group compared both to sham and treated group.
 A reversal of impaired myocardial mechanical parameters towards control values was observed, except for some parameters of relaxation.
 We conclude that perindopril allows in this model a complete control of blood pressure, and a regression of left ventricular hypertrophy with normalization of coronary hemodynamics and contractile function.
