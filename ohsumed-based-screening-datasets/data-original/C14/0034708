Revascularization of infarcted vs. viable myocardium. Effects on symptoms, physical performance and global/regional left ventricular function.
 Symptoms, physical performance and global vs.
 regional left ventricular (LV) function were reviewed in 25 patients with postinfarction anterior-apical akinesia and minor dyskinesia who subsequently underwent revascularization of all graftable stenotic vessels.
 The observed postoperative improvement in functional NYHA capacity and physical performance was not related to significant change in any systolic or diastolic variable of global LV function.
 'Nonspecific postoperative septal hypokinesia' developed in most cases.
 The regional ejection fraction showed slight (nonsignificant) mean increase in the infarcted apex and low anterior wall supplied by the left anterior descending artery, but marked increase in the noninfarcted lateral wall supplied by the left circumflex branch.
 Hearts with grafted left circumflex artery showed on average lower preoperative and postoperative ejection fraction in the lateral wall than did hearts without such grafting, but the rise in regional ejection fraction was significant only after left circumflex grafting.
 The clinical response to coronary artery surgery is attributed mainly to functional improvement of non-infarcted myocardium.
 Revascularization of viable myocardium occurs directly via bypass grafts, but collateral vessels may also contribute.
