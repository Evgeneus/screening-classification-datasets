Calcium metabolism and dietary calcium in salt sensitive hypertension.
 Evidence has accumulated over the past decade that suggests a relationship between low calcium intake, abnormalities in cation metabolism and hypertension in certain segments of the essential hypertension population.
 This evidence has been developed from epidemiological data, calcium intervention trials and observations related to biochemical alterations suggestive of a calcium deficiency in certain patients with hypertension and in animal models of essential hypertension.
 It is becoming increasingly evident that salt sensitive individuals are especially likely to be characterized by abnormalities of calcium metabolism and blood pressure responses to dietary calcium.
 In this review the role of calcium in the regulation of blood pressure is examined with an emphasis on epidemiological, biochemical, hemodynamic and dietary intervention data in the salt sensitive hypertensive patient.
