A modified technique of pre-operative aortography to demonstrate the complete arterial tree of the lower limb.
 One hundred consecutive aortograms were studied to establish the efficacy of conventional arteriography in demonstrating distal vessels and the pedal arch.
 The standard technique was modified by using a long injection time, a large volume of contrast material (iopamidol 370), prolonged filming and multiple exposures of the feet.
 On the basis of these examinations each limb was classified as having aorto-iliac disease (18 limbs), superficial femoral disease (103 limbs), combined segment disease (28 limbs) or generalised disease (51 limbs).
 Calf and ankle arteries were seen in 196 of the 200 limbs (98%).
 Patency of the pedal arch was established in 184 (92%).
 Fourteen percent of the group of patients with combined segment disease did not have their pedal arch visualised and this group contained most of the examination failures.
 This modified method of aortography can demonstrate the entire arterial tree from the aorta to the foot in 92% of limbs with symptomatic chronic atherosclerotic disease.
 This allows the majority of peripheral vascular reconstructions to be planned and performed without the need for intra-operative arteriography.
