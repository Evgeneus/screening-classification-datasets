Effects of percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy on levels of plasma atrial natriuretic peptide during exercise.
 To clarify the factors that influenced the secretion of human atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) during exercise, we studied the relations between the changes in ANP, transmitral pressure gradient, heart rate and blood pressure at exercise in 16 patients with mitral stenosis before and after percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC).
 Before PTMC, ANP levels increased from 107 +/- 70 to 183 +/- 96 pg/ml during exercise testing (p less than 0.01), concomitant with the increment in mean transmitral pressure gradient, heart rate and systolic blood pressure.
 After PTMC, ANP levels also increased from 78 +/- 43 to 117 +/- 64 pg/ml, concomitant with the increment of those parameters.
 However, increments of ANP, mean transmitral pressure gradient and heart rate after PTMC were lower than those before PTMC.
 Because the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP was unclear, the differences between these parameters were calculated at submaximal exercise before and after PTMC.
 There was a significant relation only between the change in ANP and mean transmitral pressure gradient (r = 0.70, p less than 0.01).
 These results suggest that the most important factor influencing the secretion of ANP during exercise is the change in transmitral pressure gradient in patients with mitral stenosis.
