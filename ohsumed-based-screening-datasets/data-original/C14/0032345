Primary Raynaud's phenomenon in early childhood.
 Three young children, aged 17 months, 26 months and 29 months, presented with primary Raynaud's phenomenon.
 One was treated with nifedipine.
 Raynaud's phenomenon is rare in children and as a result experience in its treatment limited.
 Previously reported cases of childhood Raynaud's are reviewed, and approaches to management discussed.
