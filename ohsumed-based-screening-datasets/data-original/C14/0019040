Complications in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty: relationships with patient age.
 Five hundred consecutive attempted lower limb angioplasties for ischaemic disease (370 patients, mean age 65.6 years, range 33-91 years) were reviewed.
 Significant complications occurred in 44 cases (8.8%).
 Nine patients (1.8%) underwent emergency surgery related to a complication.
 A further 12 patients (2.4%) underwent elective surgery related to a complication.
 In addition, four patients died within 30 days of the procedure; one following surgery performed because of a complication of angioplasty, one following a myocardial infarction, one following severe bleeding associated with subsequent thrombolytic therapy and one during emergency surgery related to a complication of angioplasty.
 A correlation was found between complication rate and age.
 This relationship was independent of the approach to, the position of, and the severity of the treated lesion.
 Elderly patients are at increased risk of complication in lower limb angioplasty.
