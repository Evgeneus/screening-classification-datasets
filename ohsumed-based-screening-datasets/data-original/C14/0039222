Early heparin therapy in patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage.
 In 68 patients with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage the effect of heparin treatment beginning on the second, fourth or tenth day was investigated.
 Early (day 2) low-dose heparin medication significantly lowered the incidence of pulmonary embolism.
 An increase in the number of patients with rebleeding was not observed.
 The results indicate that the early use of heparin in these patients is safe and can be recommended for the prevention of thromboembolic complications.
