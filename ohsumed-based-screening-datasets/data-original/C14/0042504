Value of planar 201Tl imaging in risk stratification of patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction.
 Although exercise ECG testing has been shown to have important prognostic value after acute myocardial infarction, exercise 201Tl scintigraphy offers several potential advantages, including: 1) increased sensitivity for detecting residual myocardial ischemia; 2) the ability to localize ischemia to a specific area or areas subtended by a specific coronary artery; 3) the ability to identify exercise-induced left ventricular dysfunction, which is manifested by increased lung uptake or transient left ventricular dilation; and 4) more reliable risk stratification of individual patients.
 The more optimal prognostic efficiency of 201Tl scintigraphy partially results from the fact that the error rate in falsely classifying patients as low risk is significantly smaller with 201Tl scintigraphy than with stress ECG.
 Because of these substantial advantages, there seems to be adequate rationale for recommending exercise perfusion imaging rather than exercise ECG alone as the preferred method for evaluating mortality and morbidity risks after acute myocardial infarction.
