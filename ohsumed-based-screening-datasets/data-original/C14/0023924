Patients with two types of atrioventricular junctional (AV nodal) reentrant tachycardia. Evidence that a common pathway of nodal tissue is not present above the reentrant circuit.
 BACKGROUND.
 The site of the reentrant circuit in atrioventricular (AV) junctional reentrant tachycardia has not been defined; in particular, the existence of a common pathway of AV nodal tissue above the reentrant circuit is controversial.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Two types of AV junctional reentrant tachycardia were induced in each of three patients at electrophysiological study.
 In one type of tachycardia (anterior), the onset of atrial activity occurred from 0 to 12 msec before the onset of ventricular activation, and earliest atrial activity was recorded near the His bundle.
 In the second type of tachycardia (posterior), the ventriculoatrial intervals were longer (76-168 msec), and earliest atrial activity was recorded near the mouth of the coronary sinus.
 In individual patients, the two types of tachycardia had different cycle lengths.
 Posterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia was not a fast-slow form of AV junctional reentry in at least two of the three patients.
 Surgical cure was attempted in two patients.
 In one patient, anterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia was abolished by dissection of the anterior perinodal atrium, but posterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia could still be induced.
 At reoperation 4 months later, dissection of the posterior perinodal atrium abolished posterior AV junctional reentrant tachycardia while preserving AV conduction.
 CONCLUSION.
 Differences in ventriculoatrial intervals and cycle lengths and the results of selective surgery suggest that the two types of AV junctional reentrant tachycardia used different reentrant circuits.
 These observations imply that a common pathway of AV nodal tissue is not present above the reentrant circuit and suggest that perinodal atrium is part of these circuits.
