The significance of portal vein thrombosis after distal splenorenal shunt.
 The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of portal vein thrombosis after the distal splenorenal shunt, to identify any predictive factors, and to assess the clinical significance of this complication.
 Preoperative and postoperative angiograms and clinical evaluation were reviewed in 124 patients who underwent distal splenorenal shunts.
 Total and partial portal vein thrombosis were seen on 13 (10.5%) and 22 (17.7%) postoperative angiograms, respectively.
 The only preoperative variable correlating with development of portal vein thrombosis was portal venous perfusion, which was significantly lower in patients with than in those without portal vein thrombosis.
 In six of 10 patients with postoperative pancreatitis, portal vein thrombosis developed.
 The frequency of early postoperative complications was significantly greater in patients with total portal vein thrombosis than in those with partial or no thrombosis.
 Long-term follow-up has shown no significant effects of portal vein thrombosis on late ascites, encephalopathy, or survival.
