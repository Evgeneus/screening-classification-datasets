Closed heart cryoablation of the His bundle using an anterior septal approach.
 His bundle cryosurgical ablation using a closed heart anterior septal approach was used in 6 patients.
 There were 3 men and 3 women, aged 24 to 73 years.
 Three patients had atrial fibrillation and 2 patients had atrial flutter (2 with combined episodes of atrial tachycardia).
 One patient had atrial tachycardia.
 Five patients had no structural heart disease and 1 patient had left ventricular dilatation (ejection fraction, 0.35).
 All patients undergoing His bundle cryosurgical ablation had permanent heart block without intraoperative complications (mean follow-up, 25 months).
 Closed heart anteroseptal cryoablation of the His bundle is effective and is an alternative to attempted catheter ablation.
