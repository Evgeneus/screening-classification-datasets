Recurrent intracaval renal cell carcinoma: the role of intravascular ultrasonography.
 The presence of extension into the vena cava does not preclude curative resection for extensive renal cell carcinomas.

 The following report describes the successful use of intravascular ultrasonography in the preoperative evaluation of a patient with recurrent renal cell carcinoma with vena caval extension.
