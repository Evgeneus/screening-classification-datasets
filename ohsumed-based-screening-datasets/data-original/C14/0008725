Anaesthetic hazards of aortocaval fistula.
 A 66-yr-old man was anaesthetized for repair of a suspected ruptured aortic aneurysm.
 He became deeply cyanosed and suffered two episodes of asystole as the surgeons entered the abdomen.
 After the aorta was cross-clamped his condition improved markedly and no further problems ensued.
 Surgical exploration demonstrated intact aneurysms of the aorta and left iliac artery, the former containing a 3-4 cm long aortocaval fistula.
 The aneurysms and fistula were repaired and his further course was uncomplicated.
 Potential causes for the cyanosis and cardiac arrest in this patient are discussed.
