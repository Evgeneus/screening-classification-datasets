Valve-related complications with the Hancock I porcine bioprosthesis. A twelve- to fourteen-year follow-up study.
 Valve-related morbidity and mortality after heart valve replacement with the Hancock I porcine bioprosthesis has been retrospectively analyzed.
 From June 1974 through December 1976, 253 Hancock I bioprostheses (150 mitral and 103 aortic) were inserted in 220 selected patients who survived the operation and had follow-up until June 1989 (mean follow-up 13.5 years, with an accumulative follow-up of 2956.4 patient-years).
 One hundred seventeen patients had mitral valve replacement, 70 had aortic valve replacement, and 33 had combined mitral and aortic valve replacement.
 There were 27 thromboembolic events.
 The probability of being free from thromboembolism at 14 years was 81.0% +/- 7.4% for the mitral valve replacement group, 85.4% +/- 6.7% for the aortic group, and 67.1% +/- 18.4% for the mitral-aortic group.
 Fifteen episodes of prosthetic valve endocarditis occurred.
 There were 10 instances of nonstructural dysfunction (paravalvular leaks) in seven mitral valves (4.6%) and in three aortic valves (2.9%).
 One hundred twenty-two bioprostheses in 106 patients resulted in structural deterioration.
 The probability of freedom from structural deterioration at 14 years was 37.2% +/- 3.9% for the mitral group, 43.9% +/- 7.1% for the aortic group, and 30.1% +/- 8.9% for the mitral-aortic group.
 The logistic regression analysis between age at the time of operation and bioprosthetic life (structural deterioration-free period) demonstrates a linear regression curve (r = 0.53).
 There were 56 late deaths (27 patients died at reoperation).
 The actuarial survival rate (including hospital mortality) at 14 years was 57.2% +/- 5.4% for the entire series, with no statistically significant difference between groups.
 The probability of remaining free from valve-related morbidity and mortality at 14 years was 16.7% +/- 4.8% for the mitral group, 20.8% +/- 6.2% for the aortic group, and 14.0% +/- 7.0% for the mitral-aortic group.
 The long-term results of this series show that the clinical performance of the Hancock I porcine valve appears satisfactory during the first 6 years.
 The behavior of this bioprosthesis at 14 years' follow-up changes drastically, because only a minor group of patients is free from valve-related complications, justifying the restriction of its use for selected patients.
