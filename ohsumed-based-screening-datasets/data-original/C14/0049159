Coronary recanalization rate after intravenous bolus of alteplase in acute myocardial infarction.
 The demonstration in animals that recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator produces prolonged thrombolysis after its clearance from the circulation has prompted a few pilot studies of bolus administration in patients.
 Alteplase (bolus dose of 70 mg) resulted in the highest recanalization rate in our previous pilot study comparing bolus doses of 50, 60 and 70 mg of alteplase in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
 The aim of the present trial was to assess the efficacy and safety of the same bolus dose in a larger number of patients.
 A further objective was to study the angiographic reocclusion rate at 12 to 24 hours in patients who had a recanalized infarct-related coronary artery at 90 minutes and were randomized at that time to a bolus dose or an infusion for 3 hours of 30 mg of alteplase.
 Sixty patients with acute myocardial infarction and angiographically documented total occlusion of the infarct-related coronary artery before thrombolysis were treated within 5 hours of onset of symptoms with an intravenous 70-mg bolus dose of alteplase (or 80 mg if body weight was greater than or equal to 90 kg).
 Each patient received 5,000 IU of heparin intraarterially and 100 mg of aspirin by mouth before administration of alteplase.
 Coronary angiography was repeated 60 and 90 minutes after alteplase administration.
 The recanalization rate of the infarct-related coronary artery was 55% (95% confidence interval, 43 to 66%) at 60 minutes and 48% (95% confidence interval, 37 to 60%) at 90 minutes.
 Pretreatment levels of lipoprotein (a) were not significantly related to recanalization.
