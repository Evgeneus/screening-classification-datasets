Peripheral arterial occlusion in infants--a report of two cases treated conservatively.
 The occlusion of major arteries in newborns is usually associated with catheterization of the umbilical vessels.
 It occurs very rarely instead as a primary disorder, and the cause is still unclear.
 We present two new cases of newborns with this type of disease, which were resolved with the only medical treatment.
 The literature is reviewed, and the usefulness of the different diagnostic procedures is discussed.
