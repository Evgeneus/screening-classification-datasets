Evaluating South Carolina's community cardiovascular disease prevention project.
 A community cardiovascular disease prevention program was undertaken as a cooperative effort of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and the Centers for Disease Control of the Public Health Service.
 As part of the evaluation of the project, a large scale community health survey was conducted by the State and Federal agencies.
 The successful design and implementation of the survey, which included telephone and in-home interviews as well as clinical assessments of participants, is described.
 Interview response rates were adequate, although physical assessments were completed on only 61 percent of those interviewed.
 Households without telephones were difficult and costly to identify, and young adults were difficult to locate for survey participation.
 The survey produced baseline data for program planning and for measuring the success of ongoing intervention efforts.
 Survey data also have been used to estimate the prevalence of selected cardiovascular disease risk factors.
