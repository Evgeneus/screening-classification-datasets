Blunt trauma-induced pacemaker failure.
 A 54-year-old man with an artificial pacemaker sustained blunt trauma to his chest when he was struck with a baseball bat.
 Within 15 minutes after the injury, the patient experienced cardiovascular collapse.
 His pacemaker failed, and he required insertion of a temporary transvenous pacemaker.
 At surgery, the defect was traced to failure of the pulse generator, a rare cause of pacemaker failure.
 Emergency department evaluation should include prompt and continuous ECG monitoring, an overpenetrated chest radiograph, and telemetry evaluation after discharge.
