Identification of the proximal neck of giant paraclinoidal aneurysms. Technical note.
 Introduction of a double-lumen Swan-Ganz balloon catheter into the parent artery facilitated precise identification of the proximal neck in two giant paraclinoidal aneurysms.
 Reduction of the flow rate as low as possible and positioning of the patient's head were the most important factors in this procedure.
