Estimation of Doppler gradients at rest and during exercise in patients with recoarctation of the aorta.
 In patients with suspected recoarctation of the aorta the estimation of the pressure difference between the arms and legs is an important part of the examination.
 Because this difference is often augmented when the circulation is stressed by exercise, exercise tests are a useful part of the evaluation.
 Doppler echocardiography was used to estimate this pressure difference in 16 adult patients in whom simultaneous pressure and Doppler recordings were made both at rest and during exercise.
 There was a close correlation between the invasive peak instantaneous gradient and the Doppler gradient both at rest and during exercise.
 There was only a moderate correlation between the invasive peak to peak gradient and the Doppler gradient at rest and during exercise.
 Doppler echocardiography is recommended as an easy and accurate method of estimating the peak instantaneous gradient both at rest and during exercise in patients with suspected recoarctation.
