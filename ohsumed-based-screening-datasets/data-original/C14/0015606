Immunogenetic heterogeneity in rheumatoid disease as illustrated by different MHC associations (DQ, Dw and C4) in articular and extra-articular subsets.
 Genetic variants at DRB1 (Dw subtypes), DQB, and C4 loci were compared in rheumatoid disease subjects with or without the extra-articular feature of Felty's syndrome or major vasculitis.
 DR4 positive subjects with rheumatoid arthritis alone showed no preferential associations with DQB or Dw variants or with C4 null alleles.
 Felty's subjects showed associations with the DQB encoded DQw7 allele and with the C4B null allele but no preferential associations with any Dw subtype of DR4.
 By contrast DR4 +ve rheumatoid-vasculitic subjects showed associations with the Dw14 as well as with DQw7 and the C4A null allele.
 These different MHC associations in different clinical disease subsets show that rheumatoid disease is immunogenetically heterogeneous and suggest that MHC genes outside the DRB1 locus may also influence susceptibility or modify expression of the rheumatoid disease process.
