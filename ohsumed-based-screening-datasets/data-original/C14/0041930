The influence of preoperative shock on outcome in sequential endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia.
 Sequential endocardial resection was used in 92 consecutive patients to treat ventricular tachycardia.
 All patients had coronary artery disease with previous myocardial infarction.
 All patients had repeated cycles of mapping and resection of arrhythmogenic foci in the normothermic beating heart until ventricular tachycardia was no longer inducible.
 Eighty-six patients (93%) survived to hospital discharge.
 The survival rate in patients normotensive at the time of operation was 98% and in patients in shock at the time of operation, 43%.
 By Cox regression analysis, preoperative shock was the significant predictor (p less than 0.001) of operative mortality.
 Seventy-four of the 86 operative survivors (86%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at initial postoperative electrophysiologic study when receiving no antiarrhythmic drugs.
 Eighty-three of the 86 operative survivors (97%) had no sustained ventricular tachycardia at final postoperative electrophysiologic study when using antiarrhythmic drugs as needed.
 After a median follow-up of 21 months (range 1 to 79 months) there were 4 sudden cardiac deaths, 12 other cardiac deaths, and 3 noncardiac deaths.
 There were no documented nonfatal episodes of sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia after hospital discharge.
 Use of the sequential endocardial resection technique is effective in curing ventricular tachycardia with low operative morbidity and mortality.
