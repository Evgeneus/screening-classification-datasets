Effects on quality of life with comprehensive rehabilitation after acute myocardial infarction.
 This investigation was designed to determine the impact of a brief period of cardiac rehabilitation, initiated within 6 weeks of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), on both disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life, exercise tolerance and return to work after AMI.
 With a stratified, parallel group design, 201 low-risk patients with evidence of depression or anxiety, or both, after AMI, were randomized to either an 8-week program of exercise conditioning and behavioral counseling or to conventional care.
 Although the differences were small, significantly greater improvement was seen in rehabilitation group patients at 8 weeks in the emotions dimension of a new disease-specific, health-related Quality of Life Questionnaire, in their state of anxiety and in exercise tolerance.
 All measures of health-related quality of life in both groups improved significantly over the 12-month follow-up period.
 However, the 95% confidence intervals around differences between groups at the 12-month follow-up effectively excluded sustained, clinically important benefits of rehabilitation in disease-specific (limitations, -2.70, 1.40; emotions, -4.86, 1.10, where negative values favor conventional care and positive values favor rehabilitation) and generic health-related quality of life (time trade-off, -0.062, 0.052; quality of well-being, -0.042, 0.035) or in exercise tolerance (-38.5, 52.1 kpm/min); also, return to work was similar in the 2 groups (relative risk, 0.93; confidence interval, 0.71, 1.64).
