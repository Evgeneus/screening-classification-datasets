One gram of aspirin per day does not reduce risk of hospitalization for gallstone disease.
 Data from 4524 patients in a randomized, controlled trial of aspirin were analyzed to determine if aspirin reduced the risk for hospitalization for gallstone disease.
 Aspirin at a dose of 1000 mg/day did not reduce the risk of hospitalization for gallstones.
 Hospitalization rates for gallstone disease were consistent with national rates, and the data confirmed previous associations of gallstone disease with age, elevated serum triglycerides, obesity, and female gender.
