Dilated cardiomyopathy complicated by a pedunculated and mobile left ventricular thrombus on ruptured false tendons.
 A 68-year-old man was admitted with congestive heart failure.
 He was treated with diuretics and digitalis; thereafter, the two-dimensional echocardiogram suggested a pedunculated and mobile left ventricular thrombus.
 He underwent surgical thrombectomy because of the high risk of systemic embolization.
 To our knowledge, this is the first case of dilated cardiomyopathy with a mobile left ventricular thrombus that was attached to ruptured false tendons.
