Reduction of central nervous system ischemic injury by monoclonal antibody to intercellular adhesion molecule.
 Activated leukocytes appear to be directly involved in potentiating ischemic central nervous system (CNS) injury.
 Adhesion of leukocytes to endothelium is essential for their migration and requires the binding of adhesion receptors of the leukocyte (CD 18) to an intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) on endothelium.
 Monoclonal antibodies to an ICAM can block leukocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration.
 To determine the efficacy of anti-ICAM antibody treatment in preserving neurological function after CNS ischemia, two animal models were used.
 A 1-mg/kg dose of anti-ICAM was given to rabbits 30 minutes before induction of ischemia either in the spinal cord using temporary aortic occlusion or in the brain using intra-arterial microspheres.
 In this study, treatment with anti-ICAM produced a significant reduction in neurological deficits in the reversible spinal cord ischemia model but not in the irreversible brain ischemia model.
 This protective effect supports the active role of leukocytes in CNS reperfusion ischemic injury and offers potential for future therapy.
