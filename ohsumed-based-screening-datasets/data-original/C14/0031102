Transient myocardial ischemia during Holter registration before and after coronary angioplasty.
 PURPOSE: Revascularizing procedures like percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) aim at reducing the incidence and severity of myocardial ischemia.
 To evaluate this, continuous Holter ST analysis is a possible method.
 DESIGN: 41 patients (35 men, 6 women) with stable angina pectoris had continuous twenty-four-hour two-channel Holter registration (V5/aVF-analogous leads) recorded before and after PTCA.
 Transient myocardial ischemia (TM) was defined as 0.1 mV ST depression or more 80 msec after the J point for one minute or more.
 FINDINGS: PTCA was successful for 37 patients (90%).
 Eleven of these had a total of 53 episodes of TM, 36 (68%) before and 17 (32%) after PTCA (p less than 0.05).
 Fifteen episodes (28%) were symptomatic, and 38 (72%) were asymptomatic.
 Six patients had TM after successful PTCA, 5 of whom had one-vessel disease and a clinically uncomplicated course.
 One patient had multivessel disease, with only one vessel dilated.
 Follow-up angiograms for 9 of the 11 patients with TM revealed 5 restenoses.
 There was no significant correlation between TM after PTCA and subsequent restenosis (p greater than 0.05).
 IMPLICATIONS: TM is common in patients with stable angina pectoris.
 The incidence significantly decreases after successful PTCA, but TM is seen also with a clinically uncomplicated course.
 In multivessel disease this is consistent with incomplete revascularization, whereas in single-vessel disease the most likely cause is intermittent spasm or thrombosis.
 TM after successful PTCA does not seem to be a predictor of restenosis.
