Isolated lung transplantation for pulmonary fibrosis.
 The peri-operative anaesthetic management of 11 patients with pulmonary fibrosis undergoing single-lung transplantation is presented.
 Intra-operative problems, the early postoperative phase of recovery and intensive care, and other incidents in which general anaesthesia was required for the management of complications, are featured.
 Results, both short- and long-term, are mentioned.
 Major intra-operative events that cause concern appear to be related to the severity of the presenting illness and the development of respiratory failure.
 Others have reported the development of intra-operative cardiac failure.
 All cases were successfully managed operatively using conventional one-lung anaesthesia, although resort to partial cardiopulmonary bypass may have been indicated in some.
 The indications and attitudes to utilising cardiopulmonary bypass in the evolution of techniques for facilitating single-lung transplantation are reviewed.
