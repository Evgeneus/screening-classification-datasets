The prevention of the maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia by intensive antihypertensive treatment.
 The purpose of the study was to determine if reduction of pregnancy hypertension to normal prevented the clinical maternal manifestations of pre-eclampsia.
 Thirty-six women with hypertension, but without proteinuria, were allotted at random to a test group of 17 who received intensive treatment, and a control group of 19 who were managed according to routine methods by hospital staff unconnected with the study.
 The development of proteinuria was chosen as an indicator of pre-eclampsia.
 Proteinuria developed significantly more often in the control group (in six of the 19 women) than in the test group (in one of the 17 women).
