Impact of changing attitudes in carotid surgery on community hospital practice.
 In 1985, institutional guidelines for the evaluation and performance of carotid surgery were established in our community hospital.
 During the 5-year period from 1985 through 1989, 159 carotid reconstructions were done.
 There were four major strokes (3%), one eventually resulting in death, with the second death in this series from a myocardial infarction (mortality 1%).
 The combined mortality/major stroke morbidity incidence was 3%.
 Three transient ischemic attacks (2%) postoperatively cleared promptly without residua.
 During the latter 1980s, an increasing number of vascular surgeons were doing less carotid surgery.
 Monitoring institutional quality assurance and individual surgeon performance within the community hospital is becoming a reality.
 Our experience with institutional guidelines for the evaluation and conduct of carotid surgery, together with an assessment of results and ongoing individual surgeon performance, is presented.
 Maintaining acceptable morbidity and mortality statistics can be enhanced by having a plan for assessment, management, and concurrent review.
