Coronary vasospasm secondary to labetalol in a patient with aortic dissection.
 A 66-year-old hypertensive woman presented with epigastric and scapular pain on the basis of type 3 aortic dissection.
 Appropriate therapy with a combined alpha-adrenergic and beta-adrenergic antagonist agent prevented further ongoing dissection and amelioration of symptoms.
 On day 5, an episode of coronary vasospasm occurred presumably due to beta-blockade with unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity.
