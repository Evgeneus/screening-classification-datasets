MR imaging of the portal venous system: value of gradient-echo imaging as an adjunct to spin-echo imaging.
 We evaluated the use of gradient-echo (GRE) as an adjunct to spin-echo (SE) MR imaging of the portal venous system.
 GRE imaging was performed in 31 subjects, 15 normal volunteers and 16 patients with documented portal venous disease (15 cases) or suspected disease (one case).
 Eight of 16 patients had venous thrombosis, five had focal thrombus, and three had complete occlusion.
 Six patients had extrinsic venous compression by tumor.
 Of the two other patients, one had an arteriovenous fistula and the other a falsely positive angiogram, suggesting portal vein occlusion.
 In normal subjects, GRE scans had excellent visualization of the portal venous system with high intravascular signal compared with surrounding tissues.
 Nine (60%) of 15 normal subjects and three patients had an artifact consisting of a curvilinear area of decreased signal that could mimic clot.
 In three of five patients with focal thrombus, clot was identified on GRE but not on SE images.
 In all three patients with occlusion, SE and GRE images demonstrated similar findings.
 In five of the six patients with extrinsic venous compression by tumor, SE and GRE studies showed similar findings.
 Of the two patients, an arteriovenous fistula was seen on GRE MR in one, and in the other, patency of the left portal vein was seen on SE and GRE images after angiography had suggested portal vein occlusion.
 Collateral vessels were seen in nine of 16 patients.
 In five of nine cases, GRE MR demonstrated more extensive collaterals than did SE MR.
 In summary, GRE MR provides a useful adjunct to standard SE MR imaging.
 Benefits include high contrast between vascular structures and surrounding tissues, reduced motion artifact, and rapid scanning within a breath-hold.
