Native valve Staphylococcus epidermidis endocarditis: report of seven cases and review of the literature.
 This report describes seven patients from three university hospitals whose native valve infective endocarditis was caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis.
 The literature on endocarditis caused by S.
 epidermidis is also reviewed and the clinical features of patients with native valve endocarditis due to this organism are compared with those of patients from a general series of infective endocarditis cases.
 Compared with infective endocarditis caused by other organisms, S.
 epidermidis endocarditis tends to occur more frequently in male patients.
 Patients with S.
 epidermidis endocarditis exhibit fewer embolic complications and skin manifestations.
 The frequency of congestive heart failure is lower in this group.
 The relative indolent course and apparent rarity of native valve S.
 epidermidis endocarditis necessitate a high index of suspicion for early diagnosis.
