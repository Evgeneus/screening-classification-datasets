Effect of intracoronary diltiazem on infarct size and regional myocardial function in the ischemic reperfused canine heart 
 This study was designed to investigate whether intracoronary diltiazem given before reperfusion could enhance myocardial salvage in the canine heart.
 Twenty-five dogs were subjected to 90 min of coronary occlusion followed by 4 h of reperfusion.
 The dogs were assigned to one of three experimental groups.
 The early diltiazem group received intracoronary diltiazem into the distal coronary bed at the onset of coronary occlusion and for 60 min after reperfusion.
 The late diltiazem group received the same amount of drug beginning 15 min before reperfusion and the control group received saline solution for 90 min of occlusion and 60 min of reperfusion.
 Infarct size expressed as a percent of the area at risk was significantly smaller in the early and late diltiazem groups (15.6 +/- 3.6% and 21.2 +/- 5.1%, respectively) than in the control group (49 +/- 4.6%) (p less than 0.05).
 Intracoronary diltiazem restored systolic function of the stunned, previously ischemic tissue to essentially normal preocclusion values.
 Segmental shortening after reperfusion averaged 21.6% in the early diltiazem group versus 0 +/- 1.7% and 7.3 +/- 4% for the control and late diltiazem groups, respectively (p less than 0.05).
 Low dose intracoronary diltiazem did not alter hemodynamic variables or myocardial blood flow but did improve segmental shortening 2 and 6 h after reperfusion.
 These data indicate that intracoronary diltiazem given during occlusion or just before reperfusion increases the salvage of myocardium compared with the salvage achieved by reperfusion alone.
 These results also suggest that intracoronary diltiazem given during the ischemic period enhances systolic contractile function of postischemic stunned myocardium.
