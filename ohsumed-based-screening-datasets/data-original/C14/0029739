Postphlebitic syndrome and general surgery: an epidemiologic investigation.
 Of a random sample comprising 4581 subjects from The Copenhagen County, 3608 (79%) attended an interview and a general health examination.
 The subjects were defined as suffering from subjective postphlebitic syndrome if they claimed of lower extremity pain or cramps at rest and from objective postphlebitic syndrome if varicose veins, edema, lower extremity ulcers, or skin changes were present.
 By means of logistic regression analysis, subjective postphlebitic syndrome was found independently associated with previous thromboembolism, obesity, increasing age, female sex, hormonal therapy, varicose veins, and previous major abdominal surgery.
 Objective postphlebitic syndrome was associated with previous thromboembolism, obesity, former birthgiving, and high social status.
 The findings support the view that subclinical deep venous thrombosis in connection with previous surgery may give rise to symptoms in the lower extremities.
