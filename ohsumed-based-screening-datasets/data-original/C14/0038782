Long-term bridge to transplantation with the Symbion acute ventricular assist device system.
 A 48-year-old man was supported for 164 days with Symbion biventricular assist devices.
 During that time, his cytotoxic antibody screen fell from 97% positivity to less than 10%, enabling cardiac transplantation.
 Complications during the implantation included a 3-minute episode of amaurosis fugax, one positive blood culture, and anemia, which responded to decreased frequency of blood drawing.
 He is now alive 7 months after transplantation.
