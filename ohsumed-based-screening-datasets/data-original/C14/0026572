Stress testing in the period after infarction.
 Dipyridamole echocardiography is gaining popularity as an exercise-independent diagnostic method in patients with suspected or demonstrable coronary artery disease.
 To assess its safety, feasibility, and diagnostic accuracy in patients recovering from uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction, 131 patients had the test before hospital discharge.
 The results were compared with those of maximum treadmill testing.
 We found that dipyridamole-induced transient asynergy remote from the infarct zone was more sensitive (74% versus 53%, p less than 0.05) and specific (97% versus 68%, p less than 0.01) than treadmill testing for detecting multivessel coronary artery disease.
 In a subgroup of 42 patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, dipyridamole echocardiography was able to detect in 27 the presence of jeopardized but viable myocardium in the infarct zone.
 An excellent correlation was found between dipyridamole echocardiography responses and infarct vessel patency.
 Finally, the prognostic impact of dipyridamole echocardiography on patients recovering from acute myocardial infarction was assessed in a consecutive series of 151 patients.
 Eighteen months of event-free survival was significantly different in patients with positive versus negative dipyridamole echocardiography results (76.1% versus 50.8%, p less than 0.01).
 The test was also superior to treadmill testing in predicting cardiac events.
 Thus, dipyridamole echocardiography performed early after acute myocardial infarction is safe, feasible, and accurate for predicting the extent of coronary artery disease and 18-month clinical outcome.
