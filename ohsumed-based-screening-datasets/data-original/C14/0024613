Double-blind placebo-controlled trial of buflomedil in the treatment of Raynaud's phenomenon: six-month follow-up.
 The efficacy of buflomedil in reducing the mean daily frequency and severity of winter ischemic attacks has been shown in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including 31 patients (16 in the buflomedil group, 15 in the placebo group) suffering from idiopathic Raynaud's phenomenon and followed up for six months.
 The efficacy was confirmed by nail fold capillaroscopy, which showed a significant alleviation of hemodymanic disturbances and background pallor in comparison with the placebo.
 Results in terms of clinical and laboratory safety parameters assessed over a six-month period were satisfactory, thus demonstrating the possibility of a long-term treatment.
