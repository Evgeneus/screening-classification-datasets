Is hypertension an insulin-resistant state? Metabolic changes associated with hypertension and antihypertensive therapy.
 In this review, the relationship between hypertension and abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is explored.
 A review of the current literature reveals that people with hypertension are also likely to suffer from insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and hyperinsulinemia.
 Likewise, hypertension is prevalent in obese and diabetic patients.
 Deficiency of insulin at the cellular level may be a common mechanism in the development of hypertension in patients with type I or type II diabetes mellitus.
 Essential hypertension appears to be an insulin-resistant state.
 Insulin resistance may engender hypertension by increasing peripheral vascular resistance as well as by increasing salt retention at the level of the kidney.
 Therefore effective antihypertensive therapy should include agents that do not adversely affect carbohydrate metabolic abnormalities.
 Commonly used antihypertensive agents, such as thiazide, thiazide-like diuretics, and beta-blockers, are associated with glucose intolerance and increased insulin resistance.
 In contrast, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, calcium antagonists, and peripheral alpha-blockers (such as prazosin and terazosin) do not adversely affect glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity.
 In addition, alpha-blockers have a positive effect on the serum lipid profile.
 The entire multifactorial cardiac risk profile must be considered when choosing therapeutic agents for conditions that have an impact on cardiovascular disease.
