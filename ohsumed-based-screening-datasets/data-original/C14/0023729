New operative method for distal aortopulmonary septal defect.
 A new technique is described for repairing distal aortopulmonary septal defect with aortic origin of the right pulmonary artery in a 26-day-old neonate.
 To prevent the narrowing of the proximal right pulmonary artery in the distal aortopulmonary septal defect caused by conventional intraluminal prosthetic patch reconstruction, rerouting of the right pulmonary artery using native aortic wall tissue without artificial material was performed.
 This method seems to be superior to the conventional method, especially during the neonatal period.
