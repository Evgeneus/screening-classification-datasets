Reducing the risk of stroke: identifying patients to refer for carotid endarterectomy.
 The most common causes of stroke are two diseases of aging: hypertension and atherosclerosis.
 Therefore, although stroke may occur at any age, the incidence is highest among the elderly population.
 Noninvasive efforts to reduce the risk of stroke in the elderly include control of hypertension and diabetes, smoking cessation, low-cholesterol dietary habits, and moderate exercise.
 Routine low-dose aspirin also provides some protective effect.
 High-risk patients (with asymptomatic high-grade stenosis, TIAs, or prior stroke) should be considered candidates for carotid endarterectomy in the absence of contraindications to surgery.
