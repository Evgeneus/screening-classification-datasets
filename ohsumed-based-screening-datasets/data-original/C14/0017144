Duchenne's cardiomyopathy in a canine model: electrocardiographic and echocardiographic studies.
 Thirteen dogs affected with X-linked Duchenne's muscular dystrophy and 11 female carrier dogs were studied by electrocardiography (ECG) and echocardiography.
 Twelve of the affected dogs were studied as immature animals and followed at 1 to 6 month intervals until they were 7 to 46 months of age.
 Compared with control dogs, affected dogs had significantly increased (p less than 0.02) Q/R ratios in ECG leads II, III, aVF, CV6LL (V2) and CV6LU (V4).
 Carrier dogs had significantly increased (p less than 0.02) Q/R ratios in leads V2 and V4.
 The Q/R ratio increased in three of six dogs followed up from age 6 months to greater than 2 years.
 The PR intervals were significantly shorter (p less than 0.02) in affected dogs.
 Ventricular arrhythmias were identified in four of six mature affected dogs.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography revealed distinctive hyperechoic lesions in 12 of the 13 affected dogs and in 6 of the 11 carrier dogs.
 Hyperechoic lesions corresponded to calcified myocardium and surrounding dense connective tissue.
 This study establishes the dog affected with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy as an animal model of Duchenne's cardiomyopathy and demonstrates that the heart in carrier dogs is affected by the dystrophic process.
