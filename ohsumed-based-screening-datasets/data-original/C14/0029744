Usefulness of leg-crossing for maintaining blood pressure in a sitting position in patients with orthostatic hypotension--case reports.
 The authors report a case with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension in which the patient prevents his blood pressure from falling to a symptomatic level by leg-crossing in a sitting position.
 Including 4 other patients with orthostatic hypotension and 5 normal subjects, their study found that the changes in blood pressure with leg-crossing inversely correlated with those induced by assuming seated posture from a supine position.
 Leg-crossing may, therefore, be one of the useful nonpharmacologic measures for maintaining blood pressure in a sitting position in patients with orthostatic hypotension.
