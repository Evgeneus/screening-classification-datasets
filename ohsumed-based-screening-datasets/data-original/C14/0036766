Arterial T and Y grafts.
 Presented is the use of an autogenous arterial T graft for the salvage of a thrombosed arterial end-to-side anastomosis.
 The T-graft concept also offers the possibility of replacing a segment of artery in patients with arterial vessel wall defects, stenosis, obliteration, or disease during free latissimus dorsi or scapular flap transfer.
 The arterial T graft is harvested from the axilla and consists of segments of the subscapular, circumflex scapular, and thoracodorsal arteries.
 The large diameter of these vessels offers a good match with the arteries of the lower leg and forearm.
 The arterial Y graft consists of the same arteries and is used as an interpositional graft to revascularize two distal vessels from one proximal vessel.
