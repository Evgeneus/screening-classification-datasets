Timing for implantation and transplantation in mechanical bridge to transplantation.
 The implantation of a mechanical blood pump in a deteriorating candidate for heart transplantation is indicated in general if the cardiac index is less than 1.9 L/min/m2 despite maximal inotropic support.
 Deterioration of end organ function may be taken as a second factor indicating the need for mechanical support as patients with acute onset of shock may react differently from patients with chronic deterioration.
 Preoperative need for dialysis largely reduces the chances of long-term survival.
 The time on support should be long enough to normalize or at least improve secondarily damaged organ systems, but with time infectious and thromboembolic complications will increase.
 So optimal periods for artificial heart support range between two days and four weeks.
 Age less than 40 years is a positive predictor for outcome in TAH bridging.
 The general guidelines, however, do not preclude a favourable outcome in complicated cases, as we show in our own series.
