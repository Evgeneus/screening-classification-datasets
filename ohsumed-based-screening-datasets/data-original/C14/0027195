Linkage of a cardiac arrhythmia, the long QT syndrome, and the Harvey ras-1 gene 
 Genetic factors contribute to heart disease.
 In this study, linkage analyses have been performed in a family that is predisposed to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias, the long QT syndrome (LQT).
 A DNA marker at the Harvey ras-1 locus (H-ras-1) was linked to LQT with a logarithm of the likelihood ratio for linkage (lod score) of 16.44 at theta = 0, which confirms the genetic basis of this trait and localizes this gene to the short arm of chromosome 11.
 As no recombination was observed between LQT and H-ras-1, and there is a physiological rationale for its involvement in this disease, ras becomes a candidate for the disease locus.
