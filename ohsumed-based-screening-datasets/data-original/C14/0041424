Positive and negative exercise test results with and without exercise-induced angina in patients with one healed myocardial infarction: analysis of baseline variables and long-term prognosis.
 The prognostic implications of exercise test results with and without exercised-induced angina are not completely understood.
 In the Program On the Surgical Control Of the Hyperlipidemias (POSCH), 838 subjects with hyperlipidemia who had one healed myocardial infarction were studied and followed for 6 to 13 years (mean 8.6).
 Of the 417 control subjects, 279 had a treadmill exercise test result that was definitely positive or negative.
 Angina was also induced by exercise in 30% (45/150) and 8% (10/129) of those with a positive and a negative test result, respectively (p less than 0.0001).
 The data showed no difference between subjects with a positive or a negative test result with or without angina as regards levels of blood lipids, type of myocardial infarction (Q or non-Q wave), left ventricular function, or prognosis as defined by death, atherosclerotic coronary heart disease death, or myocardial infarction.
