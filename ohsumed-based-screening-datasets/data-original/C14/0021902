Effects of prolonged infusion of human alpha calcitonin gene-related peptide on hemodynamics, renal blood flow and hormone levels in congestive heart failure.
 We have previously demonstrated that short-term infusion of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) has beneficial effects in congestive heart failure.
 The effects of prolonged infusion of CGRP on hemodynamic functions, plasma hormones and renal blood flow were studied in 9 patients with congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV, ejection fraction less than 35%).
 Hemodynamic variables were measured at 30-minute intervals for 8 hours during CGRP infusion (8 ng/kg/min) and for 2 hours after discontinuation.
 CGRP caused a decrease in right atrial (28%, p less than 0.05), pulmonary artery (22%, p less than 0.02), pulmonary artery wedge (37%, p less than 0.001) and systemic arterial (18%, p less than 0.05) pressures.
 Systemic vascular resistance decreased more than pulmonary vascular resistance.
 Cardiac output (72%, p less than 0.001) and stroke volume (60%, p less than 0.02) increased.
 Heart rate did not change.
 There was no evidence of tolerance throughout the infusion.
 The hemodynamic effects were lost within 30 minutes of stopping CGRP.
 Renal blood flow (34%, p less than 0.01) and glomerular filtration rate (43%, p less than 0.01) increased.
 Atrial natriuretic peptide decreased (p less than 0.05), while plasma cortisol (p less than 0.02) increased.
 Plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, renin activity, aldosterone and growth hormone were unchanged.
 It is concluded that in patients with severe congestive heart failure, CGRP has sustained beneficial effects on hemodynamic functions and has no adverse effects on hormones.
 Unlike many other vasodilators, CGRP also increases renal blood flow and glomerular filtration.
