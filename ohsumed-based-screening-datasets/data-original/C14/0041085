Superselective embolization of superior gluteal artery pseudoaneurysms following intramuscular injection: case report.
 Two bleeding superior gluteal artery pseudoaneurysms occurred in a patient with advanced malignant disease following an intramuscular injection.
 This was diagnosed by angiography and successfully managed by superselective embolization.
 This avoided further surgery and no additional complication from the pseudoaneurysm occurred up to the time of the patient's demise.
