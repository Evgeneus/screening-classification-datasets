Strokes in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans.
 Stroke in Asian and Pacific-Islander populations remains the principal cause of death among adults, but its incidence in the United States approximates that of Caucasians.
 Although controversial, uncontrolled hypertension in certain population groups (e.g., northern Japanese) and high dietary saturated fat in others (e.g, Pacific-Islanders) are believed to be responsible for the high stroke incidence rates.
 The recent reduction in stroke frequency rates in these areas is thought to be the result of better hypertension control.
 In the Ni-Hon-San Study, the level of hypertension and its frequency were similar in Hawaii and Japan, but ischemic infarction and intracerebral hemorrhage were less frequent in Hawaii.
 Reduced meat and fat intake may contribute to small vessel disease in Japan.
 Stroke is the third major cause of death among Hispanic-Americans and Native Americans, yet there is a paucity of information, especially about stroke, in subgroups of these populations.
 There is also considerable ignorance and controversy about risk factors for stroke in these populations.
 The need for additional research is urgent.
