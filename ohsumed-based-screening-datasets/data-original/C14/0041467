Long-term assessment of right ventricular diastolic filling in patients with pulmonic valve stenosis successfully treated in childhood.
 Patients with severe pulmonic stenosis (PS) have right ventricular (RV) diastolic filling abnormalities detectable by tricuspid valve pulsed Doppler examination.
 To determine if these abnormalities persist long term after successful therapy of PS, 19 patients were examined 8 +/- 3 years after PS therapy.
 At the time of follow-up Doppler examination, the PS gradient was 15 +/- 8 mm Hg.
 From the tricuspid valve inflow Doppler study, the following measurements were obtained at peak inspiration: peak velocities at rapid filling (peak E) and during atrial contraction (peak A), ratio of peak E to peak A velocities, RV peak filling rate normalized for stroke volume, deceleration time, the fraction of filling in the first 0.33 of diastole as well as under the E and A waves, and the ratio of E to A area.
 Data from PS follow-up patients were compared with our previously reported data from 12 age-related control subjects and 14 untreated patients with PS.
 Patients with PS who were followed up had higher peak E velocity (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.59 +/- 0.21 m/s), lower peak A velocity (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.64 +/- 0.28 m/s), higher E/A velocity ratio (1.65 +/- 0.33 vs 1.11 +/- 0.52), higher 0.33 area fraction (0.52 +/- 0.08 vs 0.34 +/- 0.14), lower A area fraction (0.29 +/- 0.06 vs 0.45 +/- 0.21) and higher E/A area ratio (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 1.73 +/- 1.05) than PS patients without treatment (p less than 0.03).
 All Doppler indexes of the patients with PS who were followed up were the same as those of the control subjects except for the peak E velocity that was slightly higher (0.75 +/- 0.14 vs 0.63 +/- 0.11 m/s), the peak A velocity that was slightly higher (0.47 +/- 0.09 vs 0.38 +/- 0.09 m/s) and the E/A area ratio that was slightly lower (2.48 +/- 0.82 vs 3.50 +/- 1.25) (p less than 0.03).
 Thus, at long-term follow-up, all RV diastolic filling indexes in successfully treated patients with PS improved compared with the untreated patients and approached values found in normal subjects.
