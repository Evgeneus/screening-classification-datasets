Immediate and short-term cardiovascular effects of fosinopril, a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, in patients with essential hypertension.
 Immediate and short-term cardiovascular effects of a new angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, fosinopril, were assessed in 10 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
 Administration of a 10 mg oral dose of fosinopril reduced mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.001) as a result of a 24% fall in total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.001).
 Short-term therapy (12 weeks) maintained the decrease in mean arterial pressure (p less than 0.05) by decreasing total peripheral resistance (p less than 0.01), without reflexive cardiac stimulation or expanding intravascular volume.
 Renal vascular resistance decreased (p less than 0.05) while renal blood flow, glomerular filtration rate and filtration fraction remained unchanged.
 The response pattern to mental, isometric and orthostatic stress was similarly unchanged.
 Left ventricular mass diminished by 11% (p less than 0.01); myocardial contractility was unaffected.
 Afterload was reduced (p less than 0.05), and velocity of circumferential fiber shortening and stroke volume increased (p less than 0.05).
 Thus, arterial pressure reduction produced by fosinopril was associated with improved systemic and renal hemodynamics and reduced left ventricular mass.
