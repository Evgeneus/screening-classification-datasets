Obstruction of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta: results of treatment with balloon angioplasty.
 Our experience in the treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta with balloon angioplasty in 27 patients is reported.
 Clinical findings were lower limb claudication (all patients), impotence (eight patients), and blue-toe syndrome (two patients).
 The underlying disease was atherosclerosis in 24 patients and nonspecific aortoarteritis in three patients.
 Dilatation was successful in all patients.
 Embolic occlusions of the left common iliac artery (one patient) and left superficial femoral artery (one patient) were the only major complications.
 Claudication in the affected limb continued in the first patient; the second died when diagnostic angiography, performed 3 months after angioplasty, caused a severe atheroembolus.
 Of the other 25 patients, nine of the 10 followed up for 13-48 months and all seven followed up for 3-8 months were free of symptoms.
 Six of eight patients with sexual dysfunction had normal function after angioplasty.
 Seven patients still awaited follow-up and one was lost to follow-up.
 Our experience suggests that balloon angioplasty is an effective treatment of stenoses of the infrarenal portion of the abdominal aorta.
