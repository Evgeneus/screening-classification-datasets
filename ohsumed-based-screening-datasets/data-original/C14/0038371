Celiomesenteric anomaly and aneurysm: clinical and etiologic features.
 The development of aneurysmal disease involving the rarely encountered celiomesenteric anomaly is extremely unusual.
 Aneurysmal disease of the celiac or superior mesenteric arteries is itself an extremely uncommon finding, accounting for less than 10% of all visceral artery aneurysms.
 The existence of aneurysmal disease involving a celiomesenteric anomaly has been alluded to only briefly in two previous clinical reports.
 We review the case of a young woman with aneurysmal disease involving a common celiomesenteric trunk.
 The patient underwent excision of the aneurysm with successful vascular reconstruction.
 Although extremely unusual, the development of this extremely rare lesion can be predicted on the basis of specific etiologic theories.
 Variations in the patterns of embryologic formation of the visceral arteries account for the development of celiomesenteric anomalies, whereas atherosclerosis, medial degeneration, and infection lead to the development of most visceral aneurysms.
 Surgical treatment of celiac or mesenteric aneurysms is almost always indicated.
 Awareness of potential vascular anomalies and patterns of collateral circulation are necessary for appropriate surgical intervention.
