Subacute bilateral coronary ostial stenoses following cardiac catheterization and PTCA.
 Accelerated coronary ostial stenosis is an infrequent late complication of coronary artery catheter instrumentation during aortic valve surgery, PTCA, or coronary angiography.
 We report the first case of bilateral coronary artery ostial stenoses developing after cardiac catheterization and right coronary artery PTCA.
 In patients with worsening angina following cardiac catheterization or PTCA, accelerated ostial stenoses should not be over-looked in the differential diagnosis.
