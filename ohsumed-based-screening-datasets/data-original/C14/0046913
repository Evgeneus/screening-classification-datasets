Comparison of indium-111 antimyosin antibody and technetium-99m pyrophosphate localization in reperfused and nonreperfused myocardial infarction 
 Recent imaging studies suggest that technetium-99m (Tc-99m) pyrophosphate yields a considerably larger estimate of myocardial infarct size than does indium-111 (In-111) monoclonal antimyosin antibody.
 To determine whether Tc-99m pyrophosphate may be taken up by reversibly injured myocytes, particularly in the setting of coronary reperfusion, the tissue localization of Tc-99m pyrophosphate and antimyosin antibody was compared in 11 dogs 24 to 68 h after anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (4 dogs with permanent occlusion, 7 with reperfusion).
 Technetium-99m pyrophosphate and In-111 antimyosin antibody content was determined in serial 2 to 3 mm wide endocardial and epicardial samples taken through the infarct zone in multiple short-axis left ventricular slices.
 The number of samples with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody (defined as greater than or equal to mean + 2 SD of normal) was not significantly different from that with increased Tc-99m pyrophosphate.
 This was true in both reperfused and nonreperfused infarcts.
 However, the intensity of uptake of Tc-99m pyrophosphate exceeded that of In-111 antimyosin antibody, particularly in the border zones of reperfused infarcts, and the area with moderate to marked increase in tracer uptake (greater than or equal to 2 times normal) was significantly larger with Tc-99m pyrophosphate than In-111 antimyosin antibody (p less than 0.001).
 A specific zone of abnormal Tc-99m pyrophosphate with normal In-111 antimyosin antibody content could not be identified.
 Histologic evidence of myocardial necrosis was found in virtually every sample with increased In-111 antimyosin antibody, Tc-99m pyrophosphate, or both.
