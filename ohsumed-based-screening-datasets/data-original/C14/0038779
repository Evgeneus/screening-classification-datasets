Single-lung transplantation with atrial septal defect repair for Eisenmenger's syndrome.
 Heart-lung transplantation has been used successfully for patients with pulmonary vascular disease but its application has been very limited due to the scarcity of donors.
 We report a patient with Eisenmenger's syndrome who underwent right single-lung transplantation with closure of atrial septal defect; postoperative convalescence was uneventful.
 Serial magnetic resonance imaging examinations demonstrate improved right heart function.
