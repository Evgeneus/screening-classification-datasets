Cardiac rehabilitation services: what are they and are they worth it?
 The objectives of cardiac rehabilitation include lowering mortality but, more importantly, increasing functional capacity so reducing disability and potentially improving quality of life.
 The data suggest that cardiac rehabilitation services are worth the patient's costs and efforts and as such, they should be considered an integral component of comprehensive cardiovascular care by cardiologists and primary care physicians.
 While there is considerable agreement on the roles of exercise testing and training in the three position stands, there are also substantiated, and important, differences in their recommendations on other cardiac rehabilitation services, such as counseling and risk factor management.
 The challenge for the 1990's is not only to continue to better define the effectiveness of cardiac rehabilitation services, but more urgently, how to deliver effective services most efficiently.
 This will help physicians provide optimum care for their patients, will improve the patient's likelihood of regaining for themselves an active and productive life, and should generate a more equitable and accountable reimbursement system for quality health care.
