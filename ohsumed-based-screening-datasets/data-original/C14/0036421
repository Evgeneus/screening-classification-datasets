Improved detection of hypotension by automated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring.
 This study was undertaken to determine whether the use of automated noninvasive blood pressure monitoring altered the frequency of detection of intraoperative hypotension.
 We retrospectively reviewed 1,861 anesthetic records from a period in 1987, when blood pressure was obtained manually by auscultation.
 We compared the records from 1987 with 1,716 anesthetic records from 1989, when automated blood pressure monitors were used universally.
 The incidences of hypotension requiring vasopressor therapy were determined during the two periods and compared using Student's two-tailed t test.
 The data revealed that the incidence of detected hypotension increased from 2.4 to 5.2% with the use of automated blood pressure monitors (P less than 0.00002).
 We conclude that at our hospital the use of automated noninvasive blood pressure monitors increases the incidence of detection of intraoperative hypotension as compared with the use of manual blood pressure measurement.
