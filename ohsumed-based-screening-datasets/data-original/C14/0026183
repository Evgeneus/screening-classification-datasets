Complete external iliac artery disruption after percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty in two young children: successful repair with hypogastric artery transposition.
 The majority of vascular injuries in young children are iatrogenic.
 This is a report of two complete external iliac artery disruptions occurring during percutaneous transfemoral balloon aortic valvuloplasty in a 2-year-old and a 5-year-old child.
 The damaged external iliac artery was bypassed by extensively mobilizing the hypogastric surgery and rotating it upward to anastomose it to the proximal common femoral artery.
 Normal limb pulses, function, and growth were noted in follow-up.
