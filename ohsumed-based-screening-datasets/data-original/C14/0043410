Postural change in blood pressure associated with age and systolic blood pressure. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey II.
 The prevalence of postural change in blood pressure and its association with age and systolic blood pressure were examined in data from 8,574 White nondiabetic persons aged 25-74 who participated in the second National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1976-1980).
 Postural change in blood pressure was defined as a drop of 20 mm Hg or more on change from supine to seated position.
 In subjects on no antihypertensive medications (n = 7,316), the prevalence of postural change in blood pressure increased with older age and with higher blood pressure levels, regardless of age.
 However, systolic blood pressure levels also increased with age.
 In logistic regression models, level of supine systolic blood pressure was strongly related to postural change in blood pressure (Relative odds (RO) = 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.49, 1.70 for a 10 mm Hg increase in systolic blood pressure) whereas age was not related to postural change in blood pressure (RO for age = 1.07, Cl = .89, 1.19 for a 10-year increase in age).
 Results were similar for those medicated for hypertension.
 All results were unchanged by addition of health status indicators, including reports of hospitalization and number of medical conditions, to the model.
 These data suggest that the age-related increase in the prevalence of postural hypotension previously reported may be partially explained by age-associated increases in systolic blood pressure.
