Coronary heart disease risk factor profiles in black patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus: paradoxic patterns.
 PURPOSE: Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) in black Americans consists of two variants: one with insulin resistance and one with normal insulin sensitivity.
 This study examined whether cardiovascular disease risk factors are significantly different between the two variants.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two black patients with NIDDM in near-normoglycemic remission who were receiving no pharmacologic therapy for NIDDM were evaluated for insulin sensitivity by the euglycemic insulin clamp, plasma insulin levels, degree of obesity, glucose metabolism, serum total, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and fasting plasma triglyceride levels.
 RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of these patients had normal insulin sensitivity (glucose disposal rate in response to a 1 mU.kg-1.minute-1 insulin infusion greater than 6.0 mg.kg-1.minute-1).
 The insulin-sensitive patients were less obese (body mass index [BMI] 26.5 +/- 0.6 versus 30.8 +/- 0.9 kg/m2) and had lower fasting plasma insulin levels (56.9 +/- 7.8 versus 88.0 +/- 6.0 pmol/L), lower serum cholesterol (4.47 +/- 0.30 versus 6.39 +/- 0.26 mmol/L), lower serum LDL cholesterol (2.77 +/- 0.31 versus 4.51 +/- 0.27 mmol/L), and lower fasting plasma triglyceride levels (0.83 +/- 0.08 versus 1.45 +/- 0.16 mmol/L) than the insulin-resistant patients.
 Serum HDL cholesterol was not different between the two groups and was in the high-normal range (1.31 +/- 0.08 and 1.19 +/- 0.07 mmol/L).
 Univariate analysis demonstrated that serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and fasting plasma triglycerides were highly correlated with insulin-mediated glucose disposal and fasting plasma insulin.
 The differences in insulin sensitivity and lipid profiles were independent of obesity, as they were present in six insulin-resistant and six insulin-sensitive patients matched for BMI.
 CONCLUSIONS: Black patients with the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM have a low risk factor profile for cardiovascular disease as compared with those with the insulin-resistant variant, who have a high risk factor profile.
 A high prevalence of the insulin-sensitive variant of NIDDM in the black population might explain the lower prevalence of angina and myocardial infarction in black patients with NIDDM as compared with white patients with NIDDM.
