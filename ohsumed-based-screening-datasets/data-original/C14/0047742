Five-hour balloon inflation to resolve recurrent reocclusion during coronary angioplasty [published erratum appears in Cathet Cardiovasc Diagn 1991 May;23(1):71]
 A 63-year-old male presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction with initial clinical reperfusion following thrombolysis.
 Due to recurrent reocclusion, emergency catheterization was performed, demonstrating a 90% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.
 Angioplasty was complicated by multiple reocclusions, ultimately requiring 5-h autoperfusion balloon inflation to maintain patency.
