Prevalence of Type A behavior in untreated hypertensive individuals.
 Type A behavior has been associated with coronary heart disease as well as high cholesterol and smoking, major risk factors for coronary heart disease, but the data indicating a similar association with hypertension are inconsistent.
 Since past studies have usually based hypertension on a single blood pressure assessment or have often included treated hypertensive patients, this inconsistency is not surprising.
 The current study compared the prevalence of Type A behavior (assessed by Rosenman's structured interview) between 109 untreated hypertensive subjects and 109 age-, sex-, ethnic-, and occupation-matched normotensive subjects.
 Hypertension status was based on five repeated assessments over a 5-month period.
 Results indicated that Type A behavior is more prevalent in untreated, mildly hypertensive employed individuals than occupationally matched normotensive subjects.
 Type A component analysis confirmed the importance of hostility and certain vigorous voice stylistics in predicting cardiovascular conditions.
 These findings, taken together with the evidence linking Type A behavior with high cholesterol and cigarette smoking, further support the view that this behavior pattern is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease.
