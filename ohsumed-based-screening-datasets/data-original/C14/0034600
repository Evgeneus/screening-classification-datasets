Management of hypertension. Useful nonpharmacologic measures.
 Hypertension is a chronic problem commonly seen by primary care physicians.
 Inadequate treatment may result in significant morbidity and even death.
 Therefore, all patients with hypertension or at risk for hypertension should be educated about nonpharmacologic measures to control blood pressure.
 Weight reduction and sodium restriction are cornerstones of nonpharmacologic management of hypertension.
 Although studies of the effects of aerobic exercise on blood pressure are not well designed, data confirm the value of such exercise.
 Relaxation therapy has been shown to lower blood pressure, but effects may be transient.
 Potassium and calcium supplementation has lowered blood pressure, but because study results are contradictory, the exact clinical criteria for use of such supplements have not been determined.
 Vegetarians have lower blood pressure than nonvegetarians, but no specific dietary components (eg, fiber, fat) have been documented as the beneficial factors.
 Because of its significant pressor effect, alcohol should be avoided by hypertensives.
 A low-fat diet is recommended to decrease cardiovascular risk and assist in weight control.
