Conservative management of aortic lacerations due to blunt trauma.
 Three patients with angiographically documented thoracic aortic lacerations were managed conservatively over 8 years due to the nonthreatening appearance of the injuries in two and the presence of an associated major closed head injury in a third.
 The lesion(s) resolved in one, diminished in another, and remained unchanged in the third.
 At least ten other cases managed similarly are recorded in the literature.
 In certain selected circumstances this approach may represent a viable alternative to the current standard of immediate surgical correction of aortic injuries.
