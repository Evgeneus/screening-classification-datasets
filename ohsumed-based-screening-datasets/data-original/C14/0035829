Teicoplanin pharmacokinetics in intravenous drug abusers being treated for bacterial endocarditis.
 The pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin were determined after multiple 30-min intravenous infusions of 10 to 15 mg/kg every 12 to 24 h in 11 intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) patients being treated for bacterial endocarditis.
 Multiple serum samples were obtained over 7 to 14 days.
 Twenty-four-hour urine collections were obtained on days 1 and 5.
 Serum concentration-time data were analyzed by using multiple-dose pharmacokinetic analysis (NONLIN84).
 Results were compared with pharmacokinetic parameters derived from previous studies in normal healthy volunteers following multiple intravenous infusions of teicoplanin (3 to 6 mg/kg/day).
 Total and renal clearances of teicoplanin in IVDA patients were found to be significantly greater and more highly variable than those observed previously in normal healthy volunteers.
 As a result, predicted steady-state trough concentrations in serum may vary up to fivefold.
 The mechanism responsible for this variation appears to be related to the glomerular filtration rate.
 In IVDA patients, individualized teicoplanin dosage may be required in the treatment of bacterial endocarditis.
