Excimer laser-facilitated balloon angioplasty of a nondilatable lesion.
 Preliminary clinical experience with excimer laser coronary angioplasty shows that it is a safe and effective means of achieving nonsurgical coronary revascularization in selected patients but specific indications for its use are as yet undefined.
 In the present report a specific indication is proposed for the use of the excimer laser: to facilitate balloon inflation in a rigid stenosis that fails to dilate despite high balloon inflation pressures.
