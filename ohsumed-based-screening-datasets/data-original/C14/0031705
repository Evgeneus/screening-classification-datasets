Effects of felodipine ER and hydrochlorothiazide on blood rheology in essential hypertension--a randomized, double-blind, crossover study.
 The haemorheological effects of felodipine extended release (ER), a new dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, were compared with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) in 28 mild to moderate hypertensives (18 men and 10 women, aged 30-70 years) in a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial.
 Antihypertensive drugs were gradually discontinued.
 Felodipine Er, 10 mg, was given once daily for 2 weeks, and after another wash-out period of 1 week, patients were switched to 25 mg HCTZ, once daily, and vice versa.
 Whole blood viscosity (BV) at three different shear stresses, haematocrit (Hct), plasma viscosity (PV), red blood cell (RBC) aggregation, RBC deformability, and fibrinogen were measured under standardized conditions 2.5 h after medication, and after 2 week of treatment (24 h post-dosing).
 Felodipine ER improved BV acutely, but not during treatment over a 2-week period.
 By contrast, HCTZ did not affect BV, but decreased RBC deformability 2.5 h after medication intake.
 After 2 weeks of treatment, the negative effect on RBC deformability had increased slightly.
 Furthermore, fibrinogen and PV were significantly elevated at this stage.
 In summary, felodipine ER did not improve blood rheology over a 2-week treatment period in this study.
 HCTZ exhibited marginal but significant negative effects on fibrinogen, PV and indices of RBC deformability, but not on RBC aggregation.
