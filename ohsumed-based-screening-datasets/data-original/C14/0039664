Abnormal expression of histocompatibility and mitochondrial antigens by cardiac tissue from patients with myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy.
 Autoantibodies against the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), the branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKD) complex proteins, and myosin have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).
 Cardiac tissue from patients with DCM and, for control purposes, cardiac tissue from patients with other forms of cardiomyopathy and from patients with no history of cardiac disease were stained with heterologous and ANT-, BCKD-, and myosin-specific affinity-purified sera from DCM patients.
 Data demonstrate that although anti-myosin stains tissues from both patients and normal controls, the ANT- and BCKD-specific heterologous and affinity-purified sera from DCM patients stain only cardiac tissues from DCM patients.
 Intense staining in patchy areas of cardiac tissue suggests that abnormal increased expression of these putative autoantigens occurs in discrete areas of cardiac myocytes.
 The reactivity of the antisera was organ specific and only seen in tissues from DCM patients.
 The organ and disease specificity of these findings suggests that such expression may play an important role in the pathogenesis of human DCM.
