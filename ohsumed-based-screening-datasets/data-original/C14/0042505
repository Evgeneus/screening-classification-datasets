Risk stratification after myocardial infarction with exercise and Doppler echocardiography.
 Exercise testing early after myocardial infarction has been shown to be of further risk stratification value among otherwise low-risk patients on the basis of an uncomplicated clinical course.
 The addition of cardiac imaging modalities to exercise testing has augmented this capacity.
 Exercise echocardiographic imaging before and immediately after treadmill exercise can be accomplished in 85-95% of patients.
 New or worsening wall motion abnormalities identify 63-80% of patients who will suffer cardiac events and correctly predict 78-95% of those who will not.
 In addition, exercise echocardiography can detect multivessel coronary artery disease with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%.
 These results are superior to those obtained by analyzing global left ventricular function during exercise, exercise aortic Doppler velocity profiles, or exercise electrocardiography.
 How exercise echocardiography compares with 201Tl perfusion imaging after myocardial infarction awaits a systematic study.
 Therefore, the choice between exercise echocardiography and perfusion imaging depends on physician preference, availability, cost, and service.
