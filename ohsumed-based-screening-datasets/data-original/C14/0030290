Orthostatic vital signs in emergency department patients.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To examine the variability and define the normal ranges of orthostatic vital signs in an emergency department population.
 DESIGN: Descriptive.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: Adult ED patients with no history of recent blood or fluid losses.
 MEASUREMENTS: Lying and standing heart rate and blood pressure measured by an automated instrument.
 RESULTS: In 132 presumed euvolemic patients, the statistical normal ranges (mean +/- 2 SD) of orthostatic vital signs were wide: on standing, the heart rate range was from decreases 5.0 to increases 39.4 beats per minute; for systolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 20 to increases 25.7 mm Hg; and for diastolic blood pressure, the range was decreases 6.4 to increases 24.9 mm Hg.
 In this sample, 43% had "positive" orthostatic vital signs according to currently accepted values.
 CONCLUSION: The data from this study indicate that there is a wider than expected variation in orthostatic vital signs among presumed euvolemic ED patients.
