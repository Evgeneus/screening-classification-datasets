Similar prevalence of renovascular hypertension in selected blacks and whites.
 Renovascular hypertension is a potentially curable form of high blood pressure that is thought to be extremely rare among blacks.
 We demonstrate, however, that in a clinically selected population, the prevalence of renovascular hypertension is similar in blacks and whites.
 We prospectively evaluated 167 hypertensive subjects who had one or more clinical features known to be associated with renovascular hypertension.
 All subjects had captopril-stimulated peripheral renin measurements and conventional renal arteriography.
 All significant renal artery stenoses (greater than 50% luminal narrowing) were treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or surgery.
 Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed if there was a blood pressure response to interventional therapy, according to the criteria established by the Cooperative Study of Renovascular Hypertension.
 Of the total group evaluated, 24% (39 of 167) had renal artery stenosis and 14% (23 of 167) had renovascular hypertension.
 Renal artery stenosis or occlusion was found in 27% (26 of 97) of whites and 19% (13 of 67) of blacks (p = 0.27).
 Renovascular hypertension was diagnosed in 18% (17 of 97) of whites and 9% (6 of 67) of blacks evaluated (p = 0.25).
 Renovascular hypertension was associated with severe or refractory hypertension and with smoking, but there were no racial differences in these associations.
 Blacks with renovascular hypertension tended to have low captopril-stimulated peripheral renin activity.
 We conclude that blacks with clinical features suggestive of renovascular hypertension should be evaluated with angiography.
 Captopril-stimulated plasma renin may not be useful in detecting blacks with renovascular hypertension, but this and other potential screening tests require further evaluation.
