Mesh-constricted varicose and dilated veins used as arterial bypass grafts.
 To avoid non-autogenous vascular prostheses in coronary and peripheral vascular procedures, otherwise unusable dilated, varicose or thin-walled veins can be implanted as naturally endothelialized grafts after being calibrated by insertion into mesh tubes.
 In six sheep the 14 mm diameter jugular vein was inserted into a 12 cm long, 6 mm diameter Dacron mesh tube and implanted as a femoropopliteal graft.
 On the contralateral side the femoral vein with a maximal diameter of 7 to 8 mm was implanted.
 At control angiography after two months all grafts were patent, none of the wrapped grafts showed wrinkles or signs of anastomotic hyperplasia.
 Segments of wrapped veins were casted in paraffin under physiological pressure and cut transversely.
 In all cases the vein wall was pressed against the mesh tubes without forming folds.
 Mesh-wrapped varicose veins were used for three femorocrural and seven femoropopliteal reconstructions.
 All grafts showed a smooth flow surface at control angiography.
 Indentations occurred only at sites where thick-walled side branches had been ligated rather than oversewn.
 One popliteo-pedal reconstruction occluded after two months and one patient with a crural reconstruction died two months after surgery with a patent graft.
 The remaining grafts were patent after 11 (2-32) months.
 Oversized veins can be considerably constricted by tubes without forming wrinkles.
 By this technique varicose veins can be used as bypass grafts and in general vein grafts can be matched in size to the recipient vessel.
