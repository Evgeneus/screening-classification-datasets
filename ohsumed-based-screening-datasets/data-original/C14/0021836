Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy from the inferior vena cava.
 The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy was used in 10 dogs with acute thrombosis and two dogs with chronic thrombosis.
 In eight of these animals, the clots were trapped with the clot-trapper device, then a mechanical thrombectomy device was used to destroy the clots.
 In 10 animals, including eight with in vitro thrombi and two with in situ thrombi, thrombi were efficiently trapped with the clot-trapper device.
 In two animals, pulmonary embolism occurred because of a discrepancy between the diameter of the inferior vena cava and the diameter of the bag opening.
 After increasing the size of the loop to match the diameter of the inferior vena cava, trapping of all thrombi was possible in both experiments (acute and chronic thrombosis).
 The clot-trapper device, in conjunction with an embolectomy balloon catheter and/or a mechanical thrombectomy device, facilitates the removal of thrombi from the inferior vena cava and iliac veins.
