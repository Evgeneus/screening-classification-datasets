Bilateral central retinal vein occlusion as an initial manifestation of pseudotumor cerebri.
 Pseudotumor cerebri, or benign intracranial hypertension, is known to produce visual symptoms.
 Central retinal vein occlusion has been linked with pseudotumor cerebri but rarely as an initial manifestation.
 We describe a 46-year-old patient--who was obese and mildly hypertensive with bilateral central retinal vein occlusions--who was subsequently diagnosed as having pseudotumor cerebri.
 In patients with simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusions, unusual underlying systemic conditions such as pseudotumor cerebri should be considered in the diagnostic evaluation.
