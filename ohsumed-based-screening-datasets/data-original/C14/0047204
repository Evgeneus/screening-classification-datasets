Home blood pressure monitoring for mild hypertensives.
 A clinical trial of 204 untreated patients with mild hypertension was conducted to assess the effect of home blood pressure monitoring on blood pressure level, pharmacologic treatment, reduction of risk factors, and use of health services.
 After 1 year, no statistically significant differences were found between the treatment and control groups.
 The findings indicate that, while home blood pressure monitoring may be useful, it has no measurable short-term impact on these aspects of blood pressure management for patients with mild hypertension.
