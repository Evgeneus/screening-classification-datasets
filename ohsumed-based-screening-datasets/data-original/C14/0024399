Arterial stent placement with use of the Wallstent: midterm results of clinical experience.
 Self-expandable stents of the Wallstent type were used in 26 iliac and 15 femoropopliteal artery lesions of 31 patients to treat stenoses or occlusions.
 The indications were confined to complex lesions, including residual stenoses and dissections after percutaneous procedures or previous surgery in the iliac artery lesions, and long-segment (mean, 13.5 cm) occlusions with inadequate response to percutaneous recanalization in the femoropopliteal artery lesions.
 In the iliac artery group, after stent placement, 96% of the lesions were patent at a mean follow-up of 16 months (range, 6-30 months).
 In the femoropopliteal artery group, of 11 patients available for follow-up, only six had patent stents at 7-26 months (mean, 20 months).
 Four of these six patients required one to three secondary interventions.
 Self-expanding endoprostheses are of great value in complex iliac artery lesions where simple balloon dilation is insufficient.
 Stent placement for long femoral artery lesions should be performed with utmost reserve, and the extent of stent placement should be as short as possible.
