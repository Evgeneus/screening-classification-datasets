Right ventricular systolic function during exercise with and without significant coronary artery disease.
 To evaluate the effects of exercise and coronary artery disease on right ventricular (RV) systolic function, rest and exercise biplane RV angiograms were recorded in 20 patients undergoing diagnostic cardiac catheterization.
 Thirteen patients had exercise angiograms of sufficient quality to undergo analysis and were classified into 2 groups.
 Group 1 had no or only mild coronary artery disease; group 2 had significant coronary artery disease as manifested by new, exercise-induced, left ventricular regional wall motion abnormalities.
 RV systolic pressure increased in both groups during exercise: 33 to 57 mm Hg in group 1 (p = 0.0002) and 33 to 55 mm Hg in group 2 (p = 0.0004).
 Pulmonary resistance did not change in group 1 during exercise but increased in group 2 (3.2 to 4.8 Wood units, p = 0.04).
 RV ejection fraction increased slightly, but not significantly, during exercise in group 1, but decreased in group 2 (73 vs 58% with exercise [p = 0.01]).
 The change in RV ejection fraction from rest to exercise correlated closely with the change in pulmonary resistance from rest to exercise (r = -0.89, p less than 0.0001).
 RV regional wall motion analysis demonstrated a generalized decline in regional ejection fraction in group 2 during exercise, even in patients without right coronary artery disease.
 In conclusion, there is a decline in RV ejection fraction during exercise in patients with significant coronary artery disease.
 The generalized reduction in regional RV ejection fraction coupled with the close correlation with the change in pulmonary resistance suggests that increased afterload, rather than RV ischemia, is the cause.
