Improving compliance in an inner-city hypertensive patient population.
 Because hypertension is a "silent" disease process, compliance with therapy is always a problem.
 In the inner city, where socioeconomic factors such as poverty, illiteracy, and substance abuse raise additional barriers to effective health care, poor compliance with antihypertensive regimens can reach epidemic proportions--as it did in our clinic in the early 1970s.
 After identifying the major causes of poor compliance in our patients, we instituted measures that led directly to greatly improved compliance and control, among them the expansion of clinic hours, the expediting of laboratory services, and the training of nurse-therapists to assume many of the responsibilities of running the clinic.
 In recent years a number of new antihypertensive agents have been introduced, and these new drugs have afforded patients better blood pressure control through less complex drug regimens with fewer serious side effects.
 Indeed, we observed a strong correlation between patient compliance and the administration of agents with longer dosing intervals and improved side effects profiles.
 This observation led us to consider whether transdermal clonidine--which requires weekly, rather than daily, administration--might not be an especially effective means of controlling blood pressure in inner-city patients.
 To test this hypothesis, we enrolled 20 patients, all of them blacks, in a pilot study of this unique delivery system.
 Blood pressure was adequately controlled in all 18 patients who completed the study, and patients were uniformly enthusiastic about this alternative to daily dosing.
 As a result, compliance with this mode of therapy was excellent.
