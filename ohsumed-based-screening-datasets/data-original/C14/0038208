Renal arteriolar diameters in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Vascular cast study.
 The relation between the arteriolar diameters and hypertensive glomerulosclerosis was studied by using microvascular casts and histological evaluation.
 Spontaneously hypertensive rats 4 weeks of age were divided into three groups: nontreated, captopril (40 mg/kg/day)-treated, and trichlormethiazide (1 mg/kg/day) with hydralazine (20 mg/kg/day)-treated.
 Wistar-Kyoto rats served as controls.
 At 6 weeks old, the captopril-treated rats showed a lower blood pressure and a larger afferent arteriolar diameter compared with the control rats.
 At 20 weeks old, the nontreated group exhibited hypertension and a lower arteriolar diameter ratio (afferent to efferent, 0.89 versus 1.22 in control group) because of afferent constriction and efferent dilatation, seen equally in the outer and inner cortexes.
 Glomerulosclerosis was accentuated only in the inner cortex of the nontreated group (score, 63 versus 29 in control group).
 In the two treated rat groups, the blood pressure was reduced and arteriolar diameter ratios were similar to those in the control group (1.18 and 1.26).
 The sclerosis score in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats (score, 26) was lower than in the nontreated rats but not the captopril-treated rats (score, 36).
 These results indicated that 1) in the hypertensive rats, despite a reduced diameter ratio, glomerulosclerosis was more severe in the inner cortex; 2) two therapies reduced blood pressure and reversed the arteriolar changes, but a decrease in glomerulosclerosis was seen only in the trichlormethiazide with hydralazine-treated rats; and 3) for development of glomerulosclerosis, factors other than hemodynamics may be important in addition to intraglomerular pressure.
