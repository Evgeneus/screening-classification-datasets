Operations for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
 Forty-six patients with symptomatic tachycardia underwent operations to divide 55 atrioventricular accessory pathways.
 Mean age was 29 years (range 11 to 63).
 Ten patients (22%) had associated cardiac disease, including two with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus and six (13%) who had concomitant surgical procedures.
 A bipolar hand-held electrode was used in 22 operations, and simultaneous multisite mapping in the last 24 operations.
 Ten patients (22%) had multiple accessory pathways.
 A modified endocardial approach was used.
 The overall patient success rate was 93% with 91% to 93% of accessory pathways successfully divided.
 The perioperative morbidity was 17%.
 There were two reoperations.
 There were no early or late deaths.
 Patients have been followed up for a mean of 16 months.
 There were five recurrences of preexcitation (two early, three late).
 Two of these patients (both with a congenital diverticulum of the coronary sinus) had reoperation.
 One patient had late recurrence of atrial fibrillation.
 Operation for the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome has a high probability of success with a low operative risk.
