Myocardial infarction: assessment with an intravascular MR contrast medium. Work in progress.
 The effect of a new intravascular magnetic resonance (MR) contrast medium (gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid [DTPA] polylysine) was evaluated in acute, subacute, and chronic myocardial infarctions in rats.
 Signal intensity (SI) was measured before and after intravenous administration of Gd-DTPA polylysine.
 Before administration of contrast material, chronic infarctions had lower SI than normal myocardium.
 With Gd-DTPA polylysine, three zones were identified in acute and subacute stages of myocardial infarction, but in the chronic stage, images demonstrated two zones.
 In acute and subacute infarctions, Gd-DTPA polylysine produced greater enhancement (over 60 minutes) in the peri-infarction zone than in the normal or infarcted myocardium.
 In chronic infarctions, Gd-DTPA polylysine had no discernible effect on the SI of the central infarction zone.
 Overall, it caused no significant hemodynamic effects.
 MR imaging with Gd-DTPA polylysine produced differential tissue enhancement in myocardial infarctions, which varied according to the age of the infarction.
