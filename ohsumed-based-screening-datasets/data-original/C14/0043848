The heart in fatal unstable angina pectoris.
 Compared to patients with sudden coronary death and acute myocardial infarction, relatively little morphologic data has been reported in patients with unstable angina pectoris.
 This article reviews necropsy data collected from one laboratory on unstable angina pectoris.
 From these data, several observations are appropriate: (1) Patients with unstable angina as a group have more coronary narrowing by atherosclerotic plaque than do patients with sudden coronary death or acute or healed myocardial infarction.
 (2) Patients with unstable angina have a much higher frequency of severe narrowing of the left main coronary artery than do patients in other coronary subsets.
 (3) The coronary atherosclerotic plaques in unstable angina consist primarily of fibrous tissue, and they are more similar to those found in patients with sudden coronary death than in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
 (4) The frequency of acute coronary lesions (thrombi, plaque rupture, and plaque hemorrhage) is similar to that observed in patients with sudden coronary death and significantly less than that observed in acute myocardial infarction.
 (5) The frequency of multiluminal channels throughout the major coronary arteries is significantly higher in unstable angina compared to sudden coronary death or acute myocardial infarction.
 (6) The major epicardial arteries and the heart are smaller in patients with unstable angina than in patients with sudden coronary death or acute myocardial infarction.
 (7) The left ventricular cavity is usually of normal size in patients with unstable angina and therefore left ventricular function is usually normal.
