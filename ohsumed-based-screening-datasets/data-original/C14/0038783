Pulmonary origin of left anterior descending coronary artery in tetralogy of Fallot.
 We report the case of a 4-year-old girl with an anomalous origin of the left anterior descending coronary artery from the pulmonary artery in association with tetralogy of Fallot.
 Creation of an intrapulmonary tunnel from a newly created aortopulmonary window to the coronary ostium in the pulmonary trunk and total repair of tetralogy of Fallot were successfully carried out.
 The advantage of intrapulmonary tunnel technique (Takeuchi method) for this very rare combination is stressed.
