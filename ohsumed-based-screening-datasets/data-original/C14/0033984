Rocker-soled shoes and walking distance in patients with calf claudication.
 Calf claudication is the major clinical manifestation of peripheral vascular occlusive disease in a significant number of patients.
 Although claudication causes substantial patient disability, most patients are treated conservatively because of the risks of surgical therapy and the uncertain efficacy of drug therapy.
 It was hypothesized that rocker-soled shoes would decrease the work of the plantar flexors and therefore increase walking distance in patients with calf claudication.
 To test this hypothesis, walking distances in patients with calf claudication using rocker-soled shoes and a placebo shoe insert were compared.
 Rocker-soled shoes significantly increased both the total distance walked and the distance at which patients were initially bothered by symptoms by 77m (37%, p less than .0005) and 89m (91%, p = .003), respectively.
 It was concluded that rocker-soled shoes may reduce disability in patients with calf claudication by increasing walking distance.
