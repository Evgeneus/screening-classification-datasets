Imaging of vascular complications associated with renal transplants.
 Vascular complications associated with renal transplants are a significant cause of graft dysfunction.
 The most common complications are arterial and venous stenoses and thromboses and intrarenal and extrarenal arteriovenous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms.
 Although angiography is the imaging gold standard for the diagnosis of these disorders, Doppler sonography, scintigraphy, and occasionally CT are capable of detecting them.
 An awareness of the different imaging appearances of each complication will aid in their early detection and treatment.
 In this review, we present this information and provide a perspective on the relative roles of these techniques in the detection of vascular complications from renal transplants.
