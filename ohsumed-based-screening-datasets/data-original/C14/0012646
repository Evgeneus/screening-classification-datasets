Kidney function and cardiovascular risk factors in non-insulin-dependent diabetics (NIDDM) with microalbuminuria.
 Microalbuminuria in non-insulin-dependent diabetes (NIDDM) is a strong predictor of increased mortality.
 The major causes of death are cardiovascular, whereas end-stage renal failure is of low frequency.
 To define kidney function and the presence of some assumed cardiovascular risk factors, we compared a group of 19 microalbuminuric NIDDM patients (M), of mean age (+/- SD) 65 +/- 4 years, and known duration of diabetes 8 +/- 7 years, with 19 randomly selected matched normoalbuminuric patients (N).
 Seven microalbuminuric patients (P) were also studied.
 Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) did not differ between N and M, whereas kidney volume was increased in M (260.3 +/- 54.1 ml 1.73 m-2) compared to N (220.4 +/- 44.8 ml 1.73 m-2; P = 0.018).
 The frequency of cardiac disease increased with increasing albuminuria.
 Glycaemic control did not differ between the groups, but fasting plasma C-peptide levels increased from 2.8 +/- 1.1 micrograms l-1 in N, to 3.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms l-1 in M (P = 0.08), and to 4.2 +/- 1.9 micrograms l-1 (P = 0.03) in P.
 The lipoprotein profile showed no significant differences, although the LDLcholesterol/HDLcholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) ratio tended to rise.
 A significant correlation was found between C-peptide and LDL-C/HDL-C (r = 0.5; P less than 10(-3].
 In conclusion, GFR was not increased, and did not differ between N and M, whereas kidney volume was enhanced in M.
 Several assumed cardiovascular risk factors showed values of M intermediate between those of N and P.
