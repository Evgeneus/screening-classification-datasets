Using anticoagulants safely. Guidelines for therapeutic and prophylactic regimens [published erratum appears in Postgrad Med 1991 Sep 1;90(3):48]
 Heparin and warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) are used most often to treat acute and recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, arterial disease, valvular heart disease, and atrial fibrillation.
 These agents along with dextran, pneumatic compression devices, and gradient stockings are also used to prevent deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients at high risk (eg, those with venous stasis, lower limb or spinal cord trauma, clotting abnormalities).
 Anticoagulation therapy is monitored by maintaining the activated partial thromboplastin time and the prothrombin time in the therapeutic range.
