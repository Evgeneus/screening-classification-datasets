Clinical pharmacology of calcium antagonists.
 There have been major advances in the understanding of the basic pharmacology of drugs acting upon voltage-dependent and receptor-activated calcium channels using patch-clamp techniques.
 The structure of the L channel is known and the (different) binding sites for various calcium antagonists have been identified using the methods of molecular biology.
 Although calcium slow-channel antagonists are very widely used in the treatment of hypertension, advances in the clinical pharmacology of angina and, to a lesser extent, cardiac arrhythmias, have not kept up with the basic research in molecular biology.
 All of the calcium antagonists in current use dilate arteries, and their therapeutic action largely depends on this property.
 There is evidence of differences in response between arteries and veins, and some degree of selectivity between vascular territories, but the goal of much more specific or localized vasodilation has not been achieved.
 The most prominent difference between the three main classes of antihypertensive drugs is the mild reflex increase of heart rate seen with the dihydropyridines and the bradycardia seen with verapamil.
 Most of the side effects of calcium antagonists are also based on vasodilatation, such as flushing and headache.
 The mild edema often seen with the dihydropyridines probably depends on the changes in capillary pressure brought about by arterial dilatation.
 Despite their undoubted efficacy as vasodilators, there are no studies thus far which allow any conclusions as to the long-term effect of calcium antagonists on the morbidity and mortality due to hypertension.
