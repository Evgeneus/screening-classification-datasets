Surgical epicardial ablation of left ventricular pathway using sling exposure 
 We report our experience with 43 consecutive patients with left free wall pathways operated on since December 1988 using a modified direct epicardial approach through a medial sternotomy, without the adjunct of normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass.
 The left atrioventricular sulcus is exposed by dislocating the heart cephalad and to the right using a sling made of a large sponge passed around the ventricle through the transverse sinus.
 While the arterial pressure is monitored, the heart is positioned to obtain adequate exposure without compromising the ventricular function.
 The left atrioventricular junction is exposed using a direct approach.
 The epicardium is incised along the ventricular edge and a plane of dissection is identified and opened using blunt dissection over the ventricular wall.
 The entire left atrioventricular junction can be exposed.
 After dissection, electrophysiological testing is repeated to assess accessory pathway conduction.
 Epicardial cryoablation was used when accessory pathway conduction was not present (42 patients).
 Transmural cryoablation was used under normothermic cardiopulmonary bypass when accessory pathway conduction persisted after dissection (subendocardial pathway).
 In all, cardiopulmonary bypass was not used in 41 patients.
 There was one early relapse that required transmural cryoablation.
 There were no complications.
