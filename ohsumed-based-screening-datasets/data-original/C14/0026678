Initial blood pressure fall on stand up and exercise explained by changes in total peripheral resistance.
 To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of the initial fall in blood pressure on standing upright from the supine position, we measured the beat-to-beat changes in intra-arterial pressure in eight healthy male subjects in response to standing.
 Changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance were computed from the pressure waveform using a pulse contour method.
 To determine possible mechanisms for the changes observed on standing, similar measures were made on passive tilting and a brief (3-s) bout of cycle exercise.
 Standing elicited a transient 25% (23-mmHg) fall in mean blood pressure as a result of a 36% fall in total peripheral resistance.
 Head-up tilt elicited a gradual change in haemodynamic parameters, which reached plateau levels in 20-30 s.
 Cycling elicited a transient 17% (18-mmHg) fall in blood pressure and a 41% fall in total peripheral resistance.
 In addition, we measured right atrial and esophageal pressures in two subjects on standing and cycling and found a 10- to 15-mmHg rise in right atrial pressure without a corresponding change in esophageal pressure.
 This points to the cardiopulmonary reflex as the primary effector of peripheral vasodilation, but we cannot exclude the possibility that 1) local metabolic vasodilation and 2) central command-mediated cholinergic vasodilation contributed to the fall in vascular resistance.
