Comparative angiographic quantitative analysis of the immediate efficacy of coronary atherectomy with balloon angioplasty, stenting, and rotational ablation.
 Interventional cardiology has branched in two directions: devices that primarily dilate coronary stenoses and those that debulk coronary tissue.
 Presently the optimum coronary intervention has not been found.
 While patients are awaiting randomized trials, a comparison based on matched quantitative coronary analysis may be useful to evaluate results of new interventional techniques.
 Therefore we compared 51 patients undergoing atherectomy with individually matched patients who were undergoing balloon angioplasty and stenting.
 The lesions were matched according to location of stenosis and reference diameter.
 Atherectomy and stenting resulted in larger gains in minimal luminal diameter compared with conventional balloon angioplasty.
 The minimal luminal diameter was increased from 1.2 +/- 0.4 mm to 2.6 +/- 0.4 mm in the atherectomy group and from 1.2 +/- 0.3 mm to 1.9 +/- 0.4 mm in the angioplasty group (p less than 0.00001).
 Atherectomy and stenting resulted in similar gains in minimum luminal diameter (1.4 mm vs 1.3 mm, p = NS).
 In addition, atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective in resisting elastic recoil because of tissue removal and an intrinsic dilating effect, respectively.
 In matched populations directional atherectomy and stenting appear to be more effective intracoronary interventional devices than balloon angioplasty based on the immediate results.
 However, atherectomy is limited in smaller coronary vessels because of its larger size.
