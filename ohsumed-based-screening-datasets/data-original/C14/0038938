Direct myocardial revascularization without extracorporeal circulation. Experience in 700 patients 
 Between May 1978 and March 1990, 700 patients were operated on with direct coronary surgery without extracorporeal circulation (ECC): 529 (76 percent) were male and 171 (24 percent) were female.
 The average age was 64 years (range, 35 to 86 years), 454 (65 percent) had unstable angina, 163 (23 percent) had stable angina, 51 (7 percent) had postmyocardial infarction angina, and 32 (5 percent) had acute myocardial infarction at the moment of the operation.
 In this series of patients, all branches of the coronary arteries were bypassed; the mammary artery was used in 40 percent of the cases, the average bypass per patient was 2.2 (range, 1 to 5), and 26 percent had associated disease of high risk to undergo ECC.
 The morbidity was 4 percent and the mortality for this series of patients was 1 percent; the probability of survival at seven years was 90 percent.
 This experience shows us that this surgery is an alternative in the treatment of coronary disease, especially for aged patients with associated disease, in some cases of acute transmural infarction, and also for patients who need coronary angioplasty.
 Also, it can improve the relation cost/benefit in coronary surgery.
