Effect of potassium intake on blood pressure.
 Epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical studies suggest that potassium is an important regulator of blood pressure.
 Surveys conducted in widely divergent geographic locations indicate higher prevalence of hypertension in populations ingesting diets low in potassium.
 Amelioration of hypokalemia lowers blood pressure in mineralocorticoid-induced hypertension in rats and in essential hypertensive patients receiving thiazide diuretics.
 We observed that in normotensive subjects ingesting normal amounts of sodium, short-term potassium depletion increases the mean arterial pressure from 90.9 +/- 2.2 mm Hg to 95.0 +/- 2.2 mm Hg (P less than 0.01).
 Furthermore, acute sodium loading increases blood pressure in potassium-depleted subjects but it had no effect in subjects ingesting normal amounts of potassium.
 Preliminary studies indicate that short-term potassium depletion also elevates blood pressure in hypertensive patients.
 Potassium supplementation lowers blood pressure in hypertensive patients ingesting normal amounts of sodium.
 Blacks appear to be more sensitive to the hypotensive effects of potassium.
 The mechanism of potassium-induced changes in blood pressure is not well understood.
 Potassium depletion consistently induces sodium retention.
 The hypertensive effects of potassium depletion and hypotensive effects of potassium supplementation are not observed when sodium intake is kept low.
 Direct vasoconstrictive effects of hypokalemia may contribute to the pressor effect of potassium depletion.
 The role of altered vascular sensitivity to vasoactive hormones and alterations in divalent cation metabolism in mediating the potassium-induced changes in blood pressure require further study.
