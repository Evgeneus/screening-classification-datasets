Clinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias.
 The purposes of this study were to describe the clinical decision making of critical care nurses managing computer-simulated tachydysrhythmias and to assess the major sources of error related to the management of two tachydysrhythmias: atrial flutter and ventricular tachycardia.
 In this descriptive study, 142 critical care nurses each completed four computerized clinical simulations (two atrial flutter and two ventricular tachycardia).
 Simulation performance was measured by proficiency score (comparison with expert performance), patient outcome (cure or die), and amount of data collected before the first intervention.
 Mean proficiency scores were 51% for atrial flutter and 35% for ventricular tachycardia.
 Thirteen percent of the atrial flutter and 35% of the ventricular tachycardia simulations ended in patient death.
 Failure to recognize ventricular tachycardia and unfamiliarity with second- and third-line treatments were major sources of error.
 Medication errors were the cause of death in 87% of the simulations ending in patient death.
 These results document the need for emphasis on dysrhythmia management in the critical care curriculum.
