Long-term efficacy and safety of terazosin alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
 This open, multicenter phase III study was designed to assess the efficacy and long-term safety of terazosin (1 to 40 mg/day), alone or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs, in 364 patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
 Compared with baseline values, long-term terazosin monotherapy or combination therapy resulted in consistent decreases in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures, with a mean reduction in supine diastolic pressure of 12 to 14 mm Hg.
 The numbers of patients with controlled blood pressure at the last evaluable visit of each therapy period were as follows: terazosin alone, 106 of 245 (43%); terazosin with added diuretic, 70 of 112 (63%); diuretic with added terazosin, 47 of 88 (53%); and terazosin plus diuretic with added beta-blocker, 22 of 32 (69%).
 Most adverse events were mild or moderate in severity.
 Only pain in extremities had a higher incidence during long-term treatment (6%, 181 to 360-day period) than during initial short-term treatment (5%, 1 to 90-day period).
 Three of six syncopal events occurred during the initial 180 days of treatment; this 0.8% (3/364) incidence was comparable with that reported previously for short-term studies.
 Only one case of syncope occurred during terazosin monotherapy.
 Terazosin was judged to be a safe and effective long-term medication for the treatment of hypertension.
