Relative accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction: a correlative study with ultrafast computed tomography.
 The accuracy of three scintigraphic methods for determination of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) was tested in 29 patients using ultrafast computed tomography (UFCT) as the gold standard.
 RVEF measurements by the ECG-gated first-pass approach showed excellent correlation with the UFCT results (r = 0.96, y = 0.06 + 0.91x), while both the standard gated acquisition blood-pool imaging (r = 0.71, y = 0.14 + 0.59x) and the nongated first-pass curve approach (r = 0.63, y = 0.18 + 0.37x) significantly underestimated RVEF.
 The error can be ascribed to partial inclusion of the atrial activity in the region assigned to the right ventricle.
 The tricuspid valve plane was found to move by a distance equal to 9%-33% (mean = 20%) of the right ventricular long-axis between systole and diastole.
 This translational motion was more pronounced with higher EFs.
