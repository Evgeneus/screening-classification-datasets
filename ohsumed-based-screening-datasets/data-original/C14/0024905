Efficacy of multiple balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures. The Mansfield Scientific Aortic Valvuloplasty Registry Investigators.
 To determine the efficacy of a second balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedure in comparison with the original procedure, 47 patients (18 men, 29 women; mean age 77 +/- 10 years) who underwent two balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures over a mean interval of 6.4 months between procedures (range 2 days to 15 months) were retrospectively examined.
 The mean pressure gradient across the aortic valve was significantly higher before the first than before the second valvuloplasty procedure (62 +/- 21 vs.
 53 +/- 21 mm Hg; p less than 0.05) and after the first compared with after the second procedure (32 +/- 13 vs.
 28 +/- 14 mm Hg; p less than 0.05).
 The cardiac output and stroke volume after the first procedure were significantly greater than the values for these variables after the second procedure (4.4 +/- 1.1 vs.
 3.8 +/- 1.1 liters/min; p less than 0.05; and 54 +/- 17 vs.
 47 +/- 15 ml/beat; p less than 0.05, respectively).
 There were no significant differences in the change observed in any variable between the first and second procedures.
 At a mean follow-up interval of 5.3 months (range 6 days to 15 months) after the second procedure 18 (38%) of the 47 patients had died, 12 (25%) required surgical valve replacement and 4 (8%) required a third valvuloplasty procedure.
 Overall, 31 (66%) of 47 patients met clinical failure end points after the second procedure.
 Three patients had two failure end points.
 The 47 patients were divided into two groups on the basis of the interval between valvuloplasty procedures.
