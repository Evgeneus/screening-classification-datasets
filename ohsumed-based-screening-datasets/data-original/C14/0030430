Hypertrophy of nodules of Arantius and aortic insufficiency: pathophysiology and repair.
 Aortic insufficiency (AI) due to fibrosis and thickening of the nodules of Arantius in the otherwise normal aortic valve was found in 11 adults (age range, 41 to 65 years) between 1976 and 1988.
 Nine had concomitant mitral stenosis; 2 had coronary artery disease.
 In 6 patients AI was graded 3+ or greater; in 5 it was less than 3+.
 Correction of AI and restoration of cuspid flexibility and apposition by shaving the hypertrophied nodules was accomplished in all, with postrepair AI graded as 1+ or less.
 There was one hospital death, a patient who had prior mitral operation.
 Mean follow-up was 68 +/- 56 months.
 Only 1 patient had late (6 years) recurrent serious (3+) AI.
 Nine continued to have 1+ or less AI, based on echocardiography or catheterization (n = 6) or on physical examination performed at a mean of 74 months.
 We conclude that thickening of the nodules of Arantius may cause AI.
 Long-term correction can be accomplished by sculpturing of the involved cusps.
