Gonococcal endocarditis: twenty-five year experience.
 Gonococcal endocarditis is a devastating albeit rare complication of disseminated gonorrhea.
 It virtually disappeared as a disease entity with the advent of antibiotic therapy.
 Recently, it has reappeared with surprisingly high frequency for unclear reasons.
 Since 1983, the authors have observed six episodes of this disease in five patients, the largest series reported to date.
 It is predominantly a disease of young people without underlying valvular heart disease.
 Characteristic clinical features include a high frequency of congestive heart failure and nephritis and a proclivity for aortic valve involvement, commonly with associated ring abscess, and large vegetations.
 Genitourinary symptoms, arthralgias, and rash are uncommon.
 Previously undescribed features include involvement of all four valves simultaneously, recurrence on an aortic valve prosthesis, and a high frequency of terminal complement deficiencies.
 Precipitous hemodynamic deterioration despite appropriate therapy is not uncommon, and overall mortality rate remains an alarming 19%.
