Coronary thrombosis: pathogenesis and clinical manifestations.
 The majority (greater than 75%) of major coronary thrombi are precipitated by a sudden rupture of the surface of an atherosclerotic plaque (plaque fissuring) causing platelet aggregation where thrombogenic subendothelial tissue has been exposed.
 Whether the thrombus remains mural and limited, just sealing the rupture, or evolves into an occlusive thrombus seems to depend on: (1) the amount and character of exposed thrombogenic material; (2) the actual thrombotic-thrombolytic equilibrium; and (3) local flow disturbances due to preexisting atherosclerotic stenosis.
 Thrombus formation may take place within the stenosis, where blood velocity and shear forces are highest, or it may take place or extend poststenotically, where flow separation, recirculation, and turbulence prevail.
 Platelet aggregation within the stenosis is responsible for the primary flow obstruction, but fibrin subsequently enmeshes the platelets and thus stabilizes the thrombus.
 Most thrombi have a layered structure, indicating an episodic growth that may alternate with thrombus fragmentation and peripheral embolization: thrombosis and thrombolysis are dynamic processes occurring simultaneously.
 If the platelet-rich thrombus at the rupture site evolves into an occlusive thrombus, the blood proximal and distal to the occlusion may stagnate and coagulate, giving rise to a secondarily formed red stagnation thrombosis consisting predominantly of erythrocytes held together by fibrin membranes.
 A ruptured plaque with a dynamic thrombosis superimposed (with or without spasm) seems to underlie the great majority of acute ischemic syndromes: unstable angina, acute infarction, and sudden death.
 The clinical presentation and the outcome depend on the severity and duration of ischemia: whether the obstruction is occlusive or nonocclusive, transient or persistent--modified by the magnitude of collateral flow.
