Isradipine, a calcium antagonist, in the control of hypertension following coronary artery-bypass surgery.
 Arterial hypertension is common after coronary artery-bypass grafting (CABG) surgery and may lead to postoperative complications.
 Therefore, the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine were studied in 10 postoperative CABG patients who had a mean arterial pressure (MAP) above 100 mm Hg.
 Isradipine, given as a continuous infusion, reduced MAP to the range of 85 +/- 5 mm Hg in all patients within 15 min.
 Systemic vascular resistance fell and cardiac output increased in all patients.
 A slight increase in heart rate was seen in some, but not all, patients.
 There were no adverse effects.
 In conclusion, isradipine appears to be a useful agent in the treatment of postoperative hypertension following CABG surgery.
