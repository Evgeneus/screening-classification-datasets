Percutaneous transaortic closure of postinfarctional ventricular septal rupture.
 We report a case of successful closure of a postinfarctional ventricular septal defect by means of the transaortic approach with a balloon catheter.
 This method brought about substantial improvement in cardiopulmonary function before an elective operation and made it possible to successfully perform the operation on the patient, an 81-year-old woman, on the 22nd day of admission.
