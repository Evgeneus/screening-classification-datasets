Through-knee amputation in high-risk patients with vascular disease: indications, complications and rehabilitation.
 During a 10-year period 104 patients (mean age 72 years) had 106 through-knee amputations.
 Indications for surgery were: limb gangrene, 67 (64 per cent); ischaemic ulceration, 22 (21 per cent); rest pain, 9; knee contractures, 6.
 Thirty patients had had previous unsuccessful vascular reconstructive surgery and five had had a failed femoral embolectomy.
 The through-knee disarticulation used lateral skin flaps.
 The mortality was 21 (20 per cent).
 Of the 83 survivors, 59 (71 per cent) underwent uncomplicated primary wound healing; 36 (43 per cent) of the survivors were unsuitable for rehabilitation on a prosthesis.
 The remaining 47 (57 per cent) were walking before discharge 30-130 days (mean 68 days) after amputation.
 Through-knee amputation is a rapid, relatively bloodless, amputation and is a useful debridement procedure.
 The many surgical and functional advantages, in conjunction with the recent reports of better rehabilitation compared with the above-knee or Gritti-Stokes amputation, suggests that the through-knee amputation deserves greater consideration.
