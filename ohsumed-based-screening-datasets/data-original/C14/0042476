Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of aorta. Immediate and long-term results 
 BACKGROUND.
 As angioplasty techniques have been refined and larger low-profile balloons developed, a nonsurgical approach to recoarctation has become available.
 Several reports have documented both the efficacy and safety of this procedure.
 However, there are little data available on the long-term follow-up of these patients.
 This report details the initial results and long-term evaluation of both the relief of obstruction and the presence of hypertension after balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Balloon angioplasty for recurrent coarctation of the aorta was performed 29 times in 26 patients at a median age of 4 years and 9 months (range, 4 months to 29 years), with eight patients less than 1 year old.
 Initial surgical techniques were end-to-end anastomosis in 11 patients, subclavian flap aortoplasty in 11 patients, and patch aortoplasty in four patients.
 Angioplasty was performed at a median interval of 2 years and 7 months (range, 4 months to 23 years) after surgery.
 Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the coarctation decreased from 40.0 +/- 16.8 to 10.3 +/- 9.5 mm Hg (p less than 0.05) after the initial angioplasty, and mean diameter of the aortic lumen at the coarctation site increased from 5.8 +/- 3.5 to 9.0 +/- 4.3 mm (p less than 0.05).
 There was no mortality, and only one patient developed an aneurysm (4%).
 Three patients underwent repeat angioplasty for a pressure difference of more than 20 mm Hg.
 Long-term follow-up is available on 24 of 26 patients with a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 24 months (range, 12-88 months).
 Mean peak systolic pressure difference across the area of coarctation decreased from 40.3 +/- 17.4 before angioplasty to 8.5 +/- 8.3 mm Hg after final angioplasty (p less than 0.05) and 7.5 +/- 7.5 mm Hg at follow-up.
 Mean peak systolic blood pressure in the upper extremities decreased from 133.1 +/- 14.9 before angioplasty to 111.1 +/- 14.1 mm Hg at long-term follow-up (p less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Balloon angioplasty should be considered the treatment of choice for relief of recurrent aortic coarctation.
