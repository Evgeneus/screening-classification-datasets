Association between plasma viscosity and blood pressure. Results from the MONICA-project Augsburg.
 The relationship between determinants of blood viscosity and blood pressure (BP) variables was studied in a large sample of a population aged 25 to 64 years.
 Plasma viscosity, hemoglobin, and total serum protein were examined.
 Systolic and diastolic BP and the prevalence of hypertension showed a crude positive association with plasma viscosity levels in both sexes.
 Age, body mass index, and total serum protein appeared to have a confounding effect on this relationship, whereas hemoglobin, smoking behavior, and alcohol consumption did not.
 A crude positive association was also found between total serum protein levels and the prevalence of hypertension in men and women; however, since total serum protein was treated as a covariable, no further analyses were carried out.
 In contrast to findings reported in the literature, hemoglobin levels were not correlated with BP variables in either sex.
 After adjusting for all confounders, a significant main effect of plasma viscosity still was found.
 However, the magnitude of the effect was not as large as for body mass index, a well-established risk variable for hypertension.
 These results indicate that BP is positively associated with plasma viscosity.
 Whether increased plasma viscosity in hypertension constitutes a primary or a secondary phenomenon remains to be answered.
 Since plasma viscosity is significantly associated with hypertension but any BP variable, increased levels of plasma proteins (particularly fibrinogen as the main determinant of plasma viscosity) may represent the cause for elevated plasma viscosity.
 This might contribute to persistently increased resistance to blood flow on the microcirculatory level in arterial hypertension.
