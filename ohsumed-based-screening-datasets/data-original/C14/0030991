Hemodynamic and metabolic effects of venoarterial cardiopulmonary support in coronary artery disease.
 Coronary angioplasty was performed on 14 high-risk patients supported with venoarterial partial cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Hemodynamic, metabolic and physiologic parameters were monitored to assess the effect of cardiopulmonary support in conscious patients.
 Cardiopulmonary support caused a decrease in systolic (45 +/- 17 to 27 +/- 14 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), diastolic (23 +/- 12 to 14 +/- 8 mm Hg, p less than 0.005) and mean (29.7 +/- 13.2 to 18 +/- 9 mm Hg, p less than 0.001) pulmonary artery pressures.
 Aortic systolic (129 +/- 18 to 106 +/- 17 mm Hg, p less than 0.001), mean (89 +/- 19 to 84 +/- 19 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and pulse (64 +/- 17 to 37 +/- 16 mm Hg, p less than 0.00001) pressures also decreased.
 Heart rate and aortic diastolic pressures were unchanged.
 End-systolic wall stress (122 +/- 48 x 10(3) to 96 +/- 44 x 10(3) dynes/cm2, p less than 0.001) and left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (5.7 +/- 0.8 to 5.5 +/- 0.9 cm, p less than 0.05) were reduced during partial cardiopulmonary bypass.
 After initiation of cardiopulmonary support, normal lactate extraction across the coronary circulation was diminished or converted to lactate production (38 +/- 23 to 2 +/- 29%, p less than 0.005).
 There was a marked reduction in hematocrit (41 +/- 4 to 28 +/- 5%, p less than 0.0001) and platelet count (259,000 +/- 57,600/ml to 145,900 +/- 46,000/ml, p less than 0.0001) after bypass.
 Cardiopulmonary bypass successfully supported all patients during balloon inflation, for an optimal angioplasty result.
