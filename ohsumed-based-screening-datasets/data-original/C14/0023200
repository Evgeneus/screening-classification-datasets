Effects of chronic administration of a vasopressin antagonist with combined antivasopressor and antiantidiuretic activities in rats with left ventricular dysfunction.
 The present experiments were designed to study the long-term aquaretic effect of [d(CH2)5-D-Tyr(Et)VAVP], an antagonist to arginine vasopressin (AVP) with combined vascular (V1) and renal (V2) receptor inhibiting properties, in rats with left ventricular dysfunction resulting from myocardial infarction (MI).
 The continuous intravenous infusion of the AVP antagonist (36 micrograms/12 microliters/day) via osmotic minipumps over 11 days resulted in an increase in urine volume and a decrease in urinary osmolality by approximately 10-fold on the first day, but in subsequent days this response decreased in both the post-MI (n = 7) and normal (n = 6) rats.
 Nevertheless, the daily urine volume remained significantly higher and the urinary osmolality lower in the post-MI rats than in the normal ones throughout the study (p less than 0.05).
 In two other groups of post-MI (n = 5) and normal (n = 6) rats, intermittent intraperitoneal injections of the AVP antagonist (100 micrograms/kg) every third day resulted in a profound diuresis that was reproducible by each injection and was again significantly greater in the post-MI rats than in the normal rats (p less than 0.05).
 The cumulative urinary output over the first 10-day period of each treatment was greater with intermittent injections than with continuous infusion in both the post-MI and normal rats, but the difference was significant only in the post-MI rats (398.82 +/- 12.87 ml vs 309.07 +/- 32.44 ml, intermittent vs continuous, respectively, p less than 0.05), even though the cumulative dose of AVP antagonist given intermittently was only about one third of that given continuously.
