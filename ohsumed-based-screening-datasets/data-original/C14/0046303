Expression and distribution of atrial natriuretic peptide in human hypertrophic ventricle of hypertensive hearts and hearts with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 To investigate the ventricular expression of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) in human hypertrophic hearts, we conducted an immunohistochemical study of 130 endomyocardial biopsy specimens obtained from the right side of the ventricular septum (RVB), left ventricular free wall (LVB), or both from a total of 80 patients: 44 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), 14 with apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (APH), 13 with hypertensive hearts (HHD), and nine without hypertrophy (controls).
 No patients had apparent congestive heart failure.
 ANP was not seen in ventricular myocytes in controls but was identified in biopsy specimens of hypertrophic hearts, and its distribution was characteristic in each hypertrophic group: 15 RVB (37%) and two LVB (7%) of the HCM group, one RVB (7%) and two LVB (18%) of the APH group, and zero RVB (0%) and five LVB (46%) of the HHD group.
 Clinical data (including echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and angiographic data) were not directly related to ventricular ANP expression in HCM, APH, or HHD with one exception.
 In HHD patients, LVB specimens with ANP showed greater ventricular wall thickness than LVB specimens without ANP.
 According to histological data, however, the ANP-present RVB specimens of HCM or ANP-present LVB specimens of HHD had greater myocyte size than did the ANP-absent specimens.
 In addition, in HCM patients, the ANP-present RVB specimens showed more severe fibrosis and myofiber disarray than did the ANP-absent specimens.
 We conclude that a failing state and hemodynamic overload are not likely to be indispensable for ANP expression in human hypertrophic ventricles and that ventricular ANP expression occurs as a response to disease-specific changes: hemodynamic overload in HHD and histological changes such as myocardial fiber disarray, hypertrophy of myocytes, and fibrosis in HCM, which may reflect the characteristic distribution of intraventricular ANP.
