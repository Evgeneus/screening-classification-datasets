Congenital arteriovenous communications and the development of two types of leaking retinal macroaneurysms.
 We treated a patient with a rare combination of congenital arteriovenous communications and the development of leaking macroaneurysms of different types.
 Initially, leaking macroaneurysms developed in the shunt area of the arteriovenous communication; later, a preexistent fusiform macroaneurysm in the afferent arteriole of the congenital communication started leaking.
 Because exudates and fluid from the leaking macroaneurysms reached the fovea, laser treatment was performed to obliterate the macroaneurysms.
 We assume that after obliteration of the macroaneurysms with laser in the shunt area, the increase of hydrostatic pressure on the thin wall of the fusiform aneurysm of the afferent artery led to its leaking.
 We saw no signs of vascular occlusion after laser treatment.
