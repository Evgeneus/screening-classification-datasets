Natural history and effectiveness of aspirin in asymptomatic patient with cervical bruits. The Asymptomatic Cervical Bruit Study Group.
 We report a multicenter study in progress involving a prospective follow-up of asymptomatic patients with cervical bruits.
 The project consists of two components.
 All patients meeting clinical criteria for eligibility undergo duplex ultrasonography at the time of entry into the study.
 Those with a carotid stenosis of 50% or greater are enrolled in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of aspirin.
 All other patients are followed up in a natural history study, also involving biannual clinical and duplex ultrasonographic examinations.
 Both clinical and anatomic outcomes are assessed.
 The project consists of a 3-year accrual phase and a 3-year follow-up phase with completion planned for May 1994.
 Total anticipated enrollment is 588 patients.
