Gonadal vein thrombosis in patients with acute gastrointestinal inflammation: diagnosis with CT.
 During a 31-month period, evidence of gonadal vein thrombosis (GVT) was demonstrated by computed tomography (CT) in seven patients who had a broad spectrum of acute gastrointestinal inflammatory lesions, including diverticulitis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn disease, appendicitis with abscess, and perforated appendix with pseudomembranous colitis.
 All patients had lower abdominal pain, tenderness, fever, and leukocytosis.
 CT demonstrated thrombus through the length of the gonadal vein in each patient; the entire lumen of the vein was filled.
 No symptoms relating to GVT were present.
 GVT may resolve with treatment of the underlying enteric disease alone, and anticoagulant therapy may not be necessary.
