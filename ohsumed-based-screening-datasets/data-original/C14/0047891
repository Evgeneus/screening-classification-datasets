Effect of intrathecal fibrinolysis on cerebrospinal fluid absorption after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 The effect of intrathecal fibrinolysis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption was investigated after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
 In 11 cats, SAH was induced by intracisternal application of 1 to 4 ml of fresh autologous blood.
 Thirty minutes after the experimental SAH, the CSF outflow resistance was found to be elevated from a median of 77 mm Hg/ml/min (range 41.3 to 109 mm Hg/ml/min) to a median of 580 mm Hg/ml/min (range 104 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min).
 A logarithmic relationship could be demonstrated between the volume of subarachnoid blood and the elevation of the CSF outflow resistance.
 The intrathecal application of 2 mg of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), which is a fibrinolytic substance suitable for lysis of subarachnoid blood clots in man, resulted in an almost total restoration of CSF absorption after experimental SAH.
 The CSF outflow resistance after SAH was lowered by application of rt-PA from a median of 1028.05 mm Hg/ml/min (range 394 to 7000 mm Hg/ml/min) to 79 mm Hg/ml/min (range 56.7 to 223 mm Hg/ml/min).
 It is concluded that the impairment of CSF absorption after SAH may play an important role in the pathogenesis of post-hemorrhagic vasospasm.
