Retrograde suction decompression of an ophthalmic artery aneurysm using balloon occlusion. Technical note.
 A large ophthalmic artery aneurysm was ligated using a modification of the retrograde suction technique described by Batjer and Samson.
 Temporary proximal occlusion of the internal carotid artery was accomplished with a double-lumen balloon catheter, and distal occlusion was performed with a temporary clip.
 The aneurysm was collapsed by gentle aspiration through the distal lumen of the balloon catheter.
 This greatly facilitated dissection and clip ligation of the aneurysm.
