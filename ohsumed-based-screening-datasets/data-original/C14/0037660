Pretreatment with a nontoxic derivative of endotoxin induces functional protection against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion injury.
 We hypothesized that low-dose pretreatment of an intact animal with a nontoxic derivative of endotoxin, monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL), would induce protection against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury.
 The purposes of this study were to investigate whether MPL pretreatment would induce functional protection against cardiac I/R injury, to delineate the temporal induction of protection, and to examine antioxidant enzyme induction as a mechanism of protection.
 Rats were administered a 5 mg/kg dose of MPL at 2 hours and 24 hours before a 25-minute, global, 37 degrees C ischemic insult followed by reperfusion (modified Langendorff).
 At 40 minutes of reperfusion, ventricular function was assessed (ventricular balloon; developed pressure, rate of contraction, rate of relaxation).
 Hearts from rats pretreated with MPL 24 hours before isolation exhibited preservation of ventricular function (p less than 0.05).
 After I/R, hearts from rats pretreated with MPL 24 hours before isolation had increased (p less than 0.05) catalase activity compared to saline pretreated controls and rats pretreated with MPL 2 hours before isolation.
 We conclude that (1) pretreatment with MPL induces functional protection against cardiac I/R injury, (2) protection (not evident at 2 hours) is maximal at 24 hours, suggesting enzyme induction, and (3) increased catalase activity correlates with the functional protection.
