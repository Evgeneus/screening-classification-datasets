Effect of infarct location on myocardial salvage assessed by technetium-99m isonitrile.
 To investigate the influence of infarct location on myocardial salvage, technetium-99m isonitrile was injected into 43 patients with a first myocardial infarction before early reperfusion therapy.
 Primary coronary angioplasty was performed in 22 patients and successful intravenous thrombolytic therapy was given to 15 patients, both within 6 h of the onset of chest pain.
 Patency of the infarct-related artery was confirmed by angiography in all 37 patients.
 In the remaining six patients (three with and three without early thrombolytic therapy) the infarct-related artery remained occluded.
 Single photon emission computed tomography was performed within 6 h of the administration of technetium-99m isonitrile and repeated at the time of hospital discharge.
 Radionuclide ejection fraction at discharge was significantly lower for patients with anterior infarction (0.41 +/- 0.12) than for those with inferior infarction (0.56 +/- 0.09, p less than 0.001).
 Early perfusion defect size, a measure of myocardium at risk, was greater in patients with anterior than in those with inferior infarction (52 +/- 9% vs.
 18 +/- 10% of the left ventricle, p = 0.0001) as was final defect size (30 +/- 20% vs.
 9 +/- 8%, p less than 0.01).
 The change in myocardial perfusion, an estimate of myocardial salvage, was also greater in patients with anterior infarction (24 +/- 16% vs.
 10 +/- 7%, p less than 0.01).
 However, the proportion of jeopardized myocardium salvaged (salvage index) was not significantly different between patients with anterior or inferior infarction (0.49 +/- 0.34 vs.
 0.59 +/- 0.35, p = NS).
