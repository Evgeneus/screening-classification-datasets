Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy: a treatable neuropathy.
 Paraneoplastic vasculitic neuropathy has been recently described.
 We report the first case of this disorder which responded both clinically and electrophysiologically to cyclophosphamide treatment.
 A 54-year-old woman with a history of metastatic endometrial carcinoma in remission had asymmetrical polyneuropathy, electrophysiological findings consistent with a diffuse axonal neuropathy, high sedimentation rate and spinal fluid protein, and microvasculitis with axonal degeneration on nerve biopsy.
 The patient was treated with 150 mg of cyclophosphamide daily with gradual clinical and electrophysiological improvement.
