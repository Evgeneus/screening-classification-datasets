Turner's syndrome, fibromuscular dysplasia, and stroke.
 We report a 43-year-old woman who presented with a right frontoparietotemporal ischemic stroke.
 She had been diagnosed with Turner's syndrome during childhood and had a history of chronic estrogen therapy.
 Cerebral angiography showed lesions characteristics of fibromuscular dysplasia involving the right internal carotid and right vertebral arteries.
 We are not aware of any previous reports describing an association between fibromuscular dysplasia and Turner's syndrome.
 Although chronic estrogen therapy cannot be ruled out as a cause of this patient's stroke, we suggest a possible etiologic relation between these two entities.
