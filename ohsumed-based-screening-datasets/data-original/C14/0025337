Use of the robust sib-pair method to screen for single-locus, multiple-locus, and pleiotropic effects: application to traits related to hypertension.
 Robust sib-pair linkage analysis can be used as a screening tool in the search for the potential involvement of single-loci, multiple-loci, and pleiotropic effects of single loci underlying phenotypic variation.
 Four large families were each ascertained through one adult white male with essential hypertension.
 The robust sib-pair method was used to screen these families for evidence of linkage between 39 quantitative traits related to hypertension and 25 genetic marker loci.
 All traits were analyzed on the untransformed, square-root and log-transformed scales.
 Among other findings, there is a suggestion of linkage between the 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase locus on chromosome 1p36 and mean fifth-phase diastolic blood pressure.
 There may also be linkage between the following markers and traits: the adenylate kinase-1 marker and/or the Lewis blood group marker and the traits height, weight, and biacromial breadth; the glyoxylase I marker and the traits upper-arm circumference and suprailiac skinfold thickness; the ABO blood group and adenylate kinase-1 markers on chromosome 9q34 and the third component of complement marker on chromosome 19p13 and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase; and the P1 blood group and the traits weight and 1-h postload serum glucose level.
