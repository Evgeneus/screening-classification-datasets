Hypertension-induced changes of platelet-derived growth factor receptor expression in rat aorta and heart.
 Hypertension-associated growth of vascular smooth muscle cells might be mediated in vivo by platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF).
 Our previous investigations in hypertensive rats failed to demonstrate changes in aortic steady-state mRNA levels of PDGF A or B chains.
 The current studies were performed to determine whether hypertension might affect the expression of PDGF receptors.
 We studied PDGF alpha- and beta-receptor gene expression by Northern analysis using human and rat cDNA probes.
 Studies of tissue distribution revealed that PDGF beta-receptor mRNA was most abundant in total aorta and aortic media, whereas the PDGF alpha-receptor mRNA was most abundant in the lung and was expressed at low levels in aortic tissue.
 Deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertension induced a threefold increase in aortic steady-state PDGF beta-receptor mRNA levels.
 Aortic PDGF beta-receptor expression also was higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) when compared with age-matched normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls.
 Aortic PDGF alpha-receptor steady-state mRNA levels were unchanged in DOCA-salt hypertension and were expressed at similar levels in WKY rats and SHRs.
 Unlike the findings with aorta, cardiac PDGF beta- and alpha-receptor and PDGF B-chain expressions were unchanged in the DOCA-salt model and were decreased in SHRs.
 These findings indicate that hypertension can increase aortic steady-state mRNA levels for PDGF beta-receptor.
 They also indicate that tissue-specific expression of the genes of the PDGF ligand/receptor system are differentially regulated in hypertension.
