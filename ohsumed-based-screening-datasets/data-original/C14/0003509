Late potentials and inducible ventricular tachycardia in surgically repaired congenital heart disease.
 We compared signal-averaged electrocardiography with invasive electrophysiological study in patients after surgical repair of congenital heart disease to determine if potentially useful correlations exist between the two methods for assessment of risk for ventricular tachycardia.
 Thirty-one patients (age, 1-49 years; mean, 10.6 years) with congenital heart disease repaired with right ventriculotomy or postrepair right bundle branch block (77% postoperative tetralogy of Fallot) who had electrophysiological study were studied with signal-averaged electrocardiography.
 Patients were classified by electrophysiological study results as having no inducible ventricular tachycardia, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or sustained ventricular tachycardia.
 Signal-averaged electrocardiograms were examined for the duration of low-amplitude (less than or equal to 40 microV) QRS signal, duration of total QRS, and root-mean-square voltage of the terminal 40 msec of the QRS.
 Low-amplitude terminal root-mean-square voltage of 100 microV or less had 91% sensitivity and 70% specificity for ventricular tachycardia inducible by electrophysiological study.
 Similar sensitivity but less specificity were seen using the criterion of 20 msec or more total low-amplitude QRS signal (initial plus terminal) or using total QRS duration of 128 msec or more.
 There was a weaker association between terminal low-amplitude QRS signal of 15 msec or more and inducible ventricular tachycardia.
