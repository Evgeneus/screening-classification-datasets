Electrocardiographic correlates with left ventricular morphology in idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
 The purpose of the present study was to verify whether the electrocardiographic pattern of patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) might be useful in predicting measurements of left ventricular (LV) morphology.
 A total of 12 electrocardiographic criteria for LV enlargement were evaluated in 67 patients with IDC, aged 14 to 68 years (mean 48), and were correlated to LV wall thickness, volume and mass, as assessed at angiography (all patients) and echocardiography (50 patients).
 Linear regression analysis showed weak correlations between multiple electrocardiographic criteria and LV wall thickness, volume and mass.
 Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that total 12-lead QRS amplitude, voltage criteria of Sokolow and Lyon, overshoot and U-wave inversion were the variables significantly related to LV wall thickness, as assessed by angiography (r = 0.55, p less than 0.005) and echocardiography (r = 0.43, p less than 0.025).
 The sum of T/R-wave ratios, the RV6/RV5 ratio and the Romhilt-Estes score were predictors of LV end-diastolic volume, as determined by angiography (r = 0.83, p less than 0.001) and echocardiography (r = 0.77, p less than 0.005).
 Total 12-lead QRS amplitude and the sum of T/R-wave ratios were the only independent predictors of LV mass, either angiographically (r = 0.81, p less than 0.001) or echocardiographically measured (r = 0.71, p less than 0.025).
 It is concluded that a single electrocardiographic criterion for prediction of LV morphology in patients with IDC is barely effective.
 Multiple electrocardiographic criteria should be utilized to better predict LV mass and distinguish reliably between LV wall thickening and dilatation.
