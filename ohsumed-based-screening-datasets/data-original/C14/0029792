Transesophageal echocardiography: detection of an acquired left ventricular-right atrial shunt.
 Communication between the left ventricle and right atrium has a reported prevalence of less than 1%.
 Acquired left ventricular--right atrial shunt is caused by chest trauma or valvular surgery.
 A case of acquired left ventricular--right atrial shunt after aortic valve surgery is reported.
 The detection was possible by use of echo-Doppler, color flow imaging, and transesophageal echocardiography.
 Combined use of these modalities and multiple transducer positions when transthoracic echocardiography is used are recommended to make the diagnosis.
