Proximal tubular alpha 2-adrenoceptor density in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
 In the kidney of the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), alpha 2-adrenoceptors are increased and may be related to hypertension.
 We measured alpha 2-adrenoceptor density and characteristics in a proximal tubule suspension with the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, 3H-rauwolscine.
 SHR had a significantly greater density of alpha 2-adrenoceptors when compared to their normotensive controls, the Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (146 +/- 13 v 58 +/- 7 fmol/mg protein; P less than .001).
 Competition experiments determined the alpha 2-adrenoceptor to be an alpha 2B-subtype.
 Agonist competition curves were shallow and exhibited pseudo-Hill slopes of less than 1, indicating that they bind to both high and low affinity receptor sites.
 In summary, alpha 2-adrenoceptors are increased in the proximal tubule of SHR and appear to be of the alpha 2B-subtype.
 An increase in alpha 2-adrenoceptors may be related to abnormalities in hypertension.
