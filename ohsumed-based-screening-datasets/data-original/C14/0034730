Does ventricular dysfunction occur during liver transplantation?
 In conclusion, we believe that ventricular dysfunction occurs infrequently during liver transplantation, except for the very short period of "cardioplegia" of the heart on reperfusion in some patients.
 There is no evidence that prolonged cardiac dysfunction is a common problem during liver transplantation.
 Understanding the physiologic changes that occur during liver transplantation should allow the anesthesiologist to correct many factors that might otherwise cause hemodynamic instability.
