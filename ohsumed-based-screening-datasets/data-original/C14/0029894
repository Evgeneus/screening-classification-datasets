Pacemaker-lead puncture of the tricuspid valve. Successful diagnosis and treatment.
 During insertion, a transvenous pacing lead pierced the tricuspid valve in a 66-year-old man, causing progressive tricuspid insufficiency and congestive heart failure.
 The defect remained undiagnosed for ten years and was then repaired.
 To our knowledge, this is the first case in which this problem has been successfully treated rather than being diagnosed at autopsy.
