Removal of massive right atrial thrombus guided by transesophageal echocardiography.
 Formation of massive right atrial thrombi around a peritoneovenous shunt is a known complication of these devices.
 Removal of an obstructive right atrial thrombus requires cardiopulmonary bypass and has been associated with a high morbidity and mortality.
 Transesophageal echocardiography was used in this case to diagnose and guide the surgical removal of a massive right atrial thrombus.
