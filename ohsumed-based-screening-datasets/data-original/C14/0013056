Effect of hemodialysis on protein C, protein S, and antithrombin III levels.
 We studied the effect of hemodialysis on natural coagulation inhibitors including protein C (PC), protein S (PS), and antithrombin III (AT III), as well as the correlations between the antigen level (immunological activity) and functional activity of individual coagulation inhibitor.
 Plasma AT III, PS, and PC were measured in 20 uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis immediately before, during, and after dialysis treatment.
 These values were compared with those obtained from 20 matched healthy controls.
 Plasma PC and total PS antigen levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay.
 The plasma AT III antigen level was determined by Laurell rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
 Functional activities of PC and AT III were determined by the amidolytic method.
 Free PS antigen level was quantitated by measuring the free PS-related antigen after the sample was treated with polyethylene glycol to remove the C4b-binding protein.
 Uremic patients on maintenance hemodialysis had a higher total PS antigen level, but a lower free PS antigen level compared with the controls.
 Both the antigen level and functional activity of AT III in uremic patients were significantly lower than those of controls.
 Their predialysis plasma PC antigen level and functional activity were not different from those of normal controls.
 A significant correlation between the antigen level and functional activity of PC, PS, and AT III was demonstrated in healthy controls, but not in hemodialysis patients.
 No significant change in the level of AT III or PS was observed with hemodialysis, but a progressive increase of functional activity of PC was documented with hemodialysis.
 Furthermore, the coefficient of correlation between the antigen level and functional activity of PC improved significantly with dialysis treatment.
