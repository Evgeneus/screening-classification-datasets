Fibrinolytic activity of the arms and legs of patients with lower limb venous disease.
 Clearance of subcutaneous 125I-labelled fibrin was prolonged from the legs but not from the arms of patients with uncomplicated varicose veins and patients with healed ulcers, compared with controls.
 The euglobulin clot lysis time (ECLT) of blood from the arms and legs of those with healed ulcers was prolonged; venous congestion significantly shortened the ECLT of blood from all limbs except legs with healed ulcers.
 The clearance of interstitial fibrin of both legs and arms correlated with the response of the ECLT to venous congestion (P less than 0.05).
 The clearance of interstitial 125I-labelled albumin in five patients with healed ulcers was faster from the legs than from the arms, whereas the clearance of interstitial 125I-labelled fibrin was faster from the arms in all cases.
 These results suggest that there is a defect in interstitial fibrinolytic activity as well as vein wall production of plasminogen activator in legs with chronic venous insufficiency.
