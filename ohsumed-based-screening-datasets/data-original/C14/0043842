Thrombolysis in refractory unstable angina.
 Multiple drug therapy, including nitrates, beta blockers, calcium antagonists, aspirin, and heparin, has been advocated as effective in the treatment of unstable angina, a syndrome with a multifactorial pathogenesis.
 Recently, plaque rupture and thrombosis have been demonstrated as the most important pathogenetic mechanisms.
 Nevertheless, clear-cut results on the effects of thrombolytic treatment in unstable angina are still lacking.
 Some possible explanations why the medical treatment of unstable angina has still not yet been standardized, whereas that of myocardial infarction has, are suggested.
 A review of randomized and nonrandomized studies published on this topic evaluating the role of different thrombolytic agents in unstable angina is presented.
 In addition the role of coronary angiography is discussed.
 In view of the disappointing results of coronary artery bypass surgery performed in the acute phase of the disease, one of the goals of clinical research is to identify subsets of patients at high and low risk and who undergo different types of therapeutic interventions.
 To support published data suggesting that total myocardial ischemia has a significant impact on prognosis, we present our results of a study carried out on patients with refractory unstable angina treated with thrombolytic therapy and evaluated with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the attempt to correlate total myocardial ischemia with short-term prognosis.
 Data in favor of the prognostic role of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in unstable angina are also reviewed.
 Finally, we propose some suggestions that might be useful for future studies.
