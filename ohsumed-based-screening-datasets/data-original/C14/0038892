Proximal rupture and intracoronary entrapment of a rotating device during low-speed rotational coronary angioplasty.
 While attempting to recanalize a right coronary artery obstruction by using a low-speed rotating catheter (Rotacs), proximal rupture of the catheter body occurred with entrapment of the blunt tip in the obstruction.
 To retrieve the device, it was necessary to severe the guiding catheter and the flexible tube of the Rotacs.
 At low-speed rotation the flexible segment of the catheter was then pulled back.
