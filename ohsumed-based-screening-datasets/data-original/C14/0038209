Abnormal platelet and lymphocyte calcium handling in prehypertensive rats.
 We have reported that the basal and stimulated cytosolic free calcium concentrations [( Ca2+]i) are elevated in platelets isolated from 12-14-week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) as compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.
 To determine whether altered cell calcium metabolism precedes the development of overt hypertension, we measured [Ca2+]i under resting and stimulated conditions in blood platelets and thymic lymphocytes isolated from 4-week-old prehypertensive SHR and WKY rats.
 Blood pressure was similar in both groups (SHR 95 +/- 8 versus WKY rats 92 +/- 7 mm Hg).
 Basal [Ca2+]i in platelets was higher in SHR than WKY rats (63.4 +/- 3.9 versus 54.8 +/- 3.1 nM, p less than 0.003).
 Also the [Ca2+]i response to thrombin was greater in SHR than WKY rats in both the presence and absence of extracellular calcium.
 For lymphocytes, although no difference was detected in basal [Ca2+]i, the concanavalin A-induced peak [Ca2+]i was higher for SHR than WKY rats in both calcium-containing and calcium-free media.
 These results suggest that agonist-stimulated calcium influx and calcium discharge from intracellular stores are enhanced in both platelets and lymphocytes of 4-week-old SHR.
 We conclude that abnormalities in calcium metabolism in two different cell types precede the development of overt hypertension in the SHR.
