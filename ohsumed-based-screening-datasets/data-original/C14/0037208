Comparison of the electrical properties of arterial smooth muscle in normotensive rats and rats with deoxycorticosterone acetate-salt-induced hypertension: possible involvement of (Na(+)-K(+)-Cl-) co-transport.
 1.
 Hypertension was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by left unilateral nephrectomy and deoxycorticosterone acetate--salt administration.
 After 5 weeks, arterial systolic blood pressure was significantly elevated in these animals (191.5 +/- 6.0 mmHg, mean +/- SD, n = 17) compared with age-matched, unoperated control animals (134.0 +/- 4.2 mmHg, n = 8, P less than 0.001).
 2.
 The membrane potential of femoral artery vascular smooth muscle measured in vitro was -55.1 +/- 6.3 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 154) for normotensive and -50.8 +/- 5.7 mV (n = 82) for hypertensive animals.
 The difference in membrane potential was significant (P less than 0.001).
 3.
 The relationship between the log of the extracellular K+ concentration and membrane potential was nonlinear over the extracellular K+ concentration range 2.5-20 mmol/l, and showed a small positive shift with hypertension.
 4.
 Tenfold reductions in the extracellular concentrations of Na+ or Cl- resulted in a membrane potential hyperpolarization in vascular smooth muscle from normotensive animals (4.9 +/- 2.0 mV, n = 13 and 12.1 +/- 1.3 mV, mean +/- SD, n = 14, respectively).
 In vascular smooth muscle from hypertensive animals, the hyperpolarization in low-Na+ media was significantly increased to 12.2 +/- 2.6 mV (mean +/- SD, n = 5), but that in low-Cl- media was unaffected (2.7 +/- 1.6 mV, n = 6).
 5.
 The loop diuretic, bumetanide (10 mumol/l), hyperpolarized the membrane potential in vascular smooth muscle from both normotensive and hypertensive rats, but not in low-Na+ or low-Cl- media.
