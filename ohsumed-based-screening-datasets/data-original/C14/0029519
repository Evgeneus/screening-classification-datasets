Left atrial ball thrombus: review of clinical and echocardiographic manifestations with suggestions for management.
 Left atrial ball thrombus is an infrequent clinical syndrome, which can have a catastrophic outcome but can be readily treated when recognized.
 It is usually a complication of long-standing rheumatic mitral stenosis.
 Symptomatic presentation is variable: fragmentation of the thrombus followed by peripheral embolization will produce ischemia or infarction of myocardium, brain, viscera, or extremities; random, intermittent, partial, or total occlusion of the mitral valve orifice may cause syncope, pulmonary congestion, and occasionally sudden death in other patients.
 Embolic and obstructive phenomena may also occur together.
 Cardiac physical findings usually suggest mitral stenosis; variability in the intensity of the diastolic rumble is common.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography is the gold standard for identifying ball thrombus.
 Cardiac catheterization provides assessment of coronary artery status when needed.
 The outcome of untreated ball thrombus is unlikely to be favorable.
 The results of anticoagulation and thrombolysis are unpredictable and potentially as harmful as no treatment at all.
 Current evidence although scant suggests that prompt surgical removal of the free thrombus, often in conjunction with mitral valve repair or replacement, is the appropriate therapeutic course in most patients.
