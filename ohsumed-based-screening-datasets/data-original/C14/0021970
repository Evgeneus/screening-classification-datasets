The role of intracaval filters in patients with COPD and DVT.
 A retrospective study of the Coney Island Hospital experience with Greenfield filters over a five-year period was undertaken.
 During this period, a total of 78 intracaval filters were placed in 76 patients.
 The patients' charts were reviewed for (1) indication for Greenfield filter placement, (2) complications of the procedure, (3) associated medical problems, and (4) follow-up information.
 The data revealed one statistically significant subpopulation within the group that had particularly poor survival statistics after intracaval filter insertion.
 These were patients who had a pulmonary embolism and also had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
 Considering the low morbidity associated with this procedure, it is the author's feeling that prophylactic intracaval filters in patients with deep vein thrombosis and COPD may be warranted.
