Arterial revascularization by laser angioplasty: first Italian experiences.
 Eighty-seven laser angioplasty procedures were performed on 85 patients (73 men and 12 women).
 In the first phase (54 patients) a broad selection process included long occlusions (23.9 cm avg) and vessels with heavy calcification; in the second phase (31 patients) the authors treated vessels with shorter occlusions (10 cm avg) and less calcific.
 The primary success rate, based on number of procedures (73.5% overall) was 69% in the first phase but reached 81.3% in the second phase.
 There were 14 perforations (16%), 8 dissections (9.4%), and 4 peripheral emboli (4.7%).
 Six-month follow-up shows that the Winsor index maintained its initial improvement in 76.5% of all patients, or 62% in just the long occlusions.
 These data and a review of the cases suggest that no more of 10-20% of patients with claudication in lower extremities can be treated by laser angioplasty; the authors consider ideal candidates those patients who noncalcific lesions in the common iliac or superficial femoral arteries at the III medium level with obstructions shorter than 8 cm and good runoff.
