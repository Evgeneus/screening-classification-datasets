Effects of lipoprotein (a) on success rate of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction.
 Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and plasminogen share a high degree of homology as recently evidenced by amino acid and deoxyribonucleic acid analysis.
 As Lp(a) is enzymatically inactive, it has been suggested that high levels of Lp(a) may suppress the profibrinolytic activity at the cell surface and increase the risk for arteriosclerosis and thrombosis by competitive inhibition of plasminogen.
 The present study evaluated whether high levels of Lp(a) influence thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction.
 Forty-one patients with acute myocardial infarction received a combination low-dose thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and human single-chain urokinase-type plasminogen activator (scu-PA).
 This regimen did not induce plasminemia or a lytic state as indicated by well-maintained levels of fibrinogen.
 Coronary patency was assessed angiographically 90 minutes after initiation of treatment.
 Thrombolysis was successful in 30 and unsuccessful in 11 patients.
 Patients with high Lp(a) levels (greater than or equal to 25 mg/dl) (n = 9) responded equally well to thrombolytic therapy (8 of 9, patency 89%) as did patients with normal or low levels of Lp(a) (22 of 32, patency 70%, difference greater than 0.1).
 Lp(a) levels did not differ significantly between patients with successful and unsuccessful thrombolysis.
 Our results demonstrate that high levels of Lp(a) do not affect thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction when low-dose pharmacologic concentrations of rt-PA and scu-PA are applied in combination.
