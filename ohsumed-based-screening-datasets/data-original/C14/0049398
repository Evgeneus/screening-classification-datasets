Cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive treatment. General considerations.
 Cost-effectiveness analysis, a set of methods for estimating the costs and health effects of medical interventions, helps decision makers to compare alternative treatments and to decide which interventions are appropriate in which situations.

 The discussion focuses primarily on the newer drugs like angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, alpha-adrenergic receptor blockers, and calcium antagonists.
