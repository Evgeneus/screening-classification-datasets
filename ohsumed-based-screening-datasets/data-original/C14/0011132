Nd:YAG laser with sapphire tip combined with balloon angioplasty in peripheral arterial occlusions. Long-term results 
 In 167 patients with complete occlusion (greater than 3 cm) of the femoropopliteal artery, percutaneous transluminal laser angioplasty (PTLA) was performed after an unsuccessful attempt at crossing with a guide wire and was immediately followed by balloon dilatation.
 An Nd-YAG laser and an optical fiber delivery system with a sapphire tip serving as a contact probe were used for PTLA.
 In 132 of 167 (79%) patients, the occluded segment was successfully reopened.
 Clinical symptoms improved in 126 of 167 (75%) patients.
 PTLA was unsuccessful in 35 patients, and in 15 of these, injury of the vessel wall occurred.
 In one patient, surgical drainage of a large hematoma became necessary.
 All patients in whom recanalization had been achieved were randomized to receive long-term treatment with either phenprocumarol or acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) plus dipyridamole to prevent rethrombosis.
 At 36 months of follow-up, the cumulative patency rate (CPR) was 63%.
 A complete reobstruction in 32 patients (24%) and a partial reobstruction in 15 patients (11%) were found angiographically.
 The CPR after 36 months was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients younger than 60 years of age (54%) than in patients older than 60 (68%); it was also significantly lower (p less than 0.05) in patients with reduced peripheral runoff (55%) due to obstructed arteries of the lower leg than in patients with unaffected runoff (73%).
 The CPR was 65% in recanalized segments shorter than 7 cm and was 62% in recanalized segments longer than 7 cm.
