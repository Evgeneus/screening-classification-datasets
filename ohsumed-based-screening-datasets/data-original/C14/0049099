Coronary thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator. Intracoronary vs intravenous administration.
 We employed a canine model of coronary thrombosis, induced by injection of radioactive blood clot, via a catheter placed in the left anterior descending coronary artery, to compare effects of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) administered intravenously and administered directly into the coronary circulation.
 A control group did not receive rtPA.
 Compared with controls, both rtPA regimens induced coronary thrombolysis.
 However, compared with intravenous administration, rate and extent of coronary thrombolysis were increased with intracoronary administration.
 Most likely, the enhanced thrombolysis with intracoronary administration is explained by an increase in delivery of the drug to the thrombus.
