Large mediastinal mass secondary to an aortocoronary saphenous vein bypass graft aneurysm.
 A case of a 62-year-old man with a large mediastinal mass who had undergone aortocoronary bypass grafting 17 years earlier is presented.
 Computed tomography showed a 13-cm extrinsic cystic mass believed to represent a pericardial cyst or teratoma.
 Intraoperatively, the patient was noted to have an aneurysm of his right coronary artery bypass graft.
 We were able to find 4 other cases seen in this manner.
