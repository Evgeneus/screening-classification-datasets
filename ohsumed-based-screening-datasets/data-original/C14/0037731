Outcome of infants and children with dilated cardiomyopathy.
 A review of 81 infants and children with dilated, poorly contracting left ventricles without associated structural abnormalities was undertaken to identify risk factors for poor outcome, which could be used in selecting candidates for cardiac transplantation.
 Significant atrial or ventricular dysrhythmias, or both, were detected on presentation or during follow-up in 24 patients.
 Arrhythmias were present in only 8 of 51 survivors (16%) but were detected in 16 of 30 patients (53%) who died (p less than 0.05).
 Patients dying suddenly were even more likely to have had documented dysrhythmias (8 of 11, p less than 0.05).
 Left ventricular shortening fraction was similar in survivors and nonsurvivors (14.9 +/- 1.0% vs 15.3 +/- 1.7%).
 Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in 44 patients who had cardiac catheterization averaged 20.8 +/- 1.6 mm Hg.
 Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was significantly higher in patients who died than in those who survived (29.5 +/- 2.2 vs 15.0 +/- 1.6 mm Hg, p less than 0.001).
 Analysis of actuarial survival revealed that mortality was highest during the first 6 months after presentation (19% mortality).
 Survival declined more gradually thereafter and was 70% at 2 years, 64% at 5 years and 52% after 11.5 years.
 Age at initial presentation did not have any significant impact on survival.
 However, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure greater than 25 torr was associated with a significantly increased mortality rate (p less than 0.05).
 Early cardiac transplantation should be considered in patients with markedly elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure or complex atrial or ventricular arrhythmias.
