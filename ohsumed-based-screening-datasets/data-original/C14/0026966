Embolization of cardiac myxomas masquerading as polyarteritis nodosa.
 Cardiac myxomas are rare tumors which can mimic other diseases.
 We describe a 19-year-old man who presented clinically with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN).
 Muscle biopsy showed vasculitis, but corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy was initially effective.
 Cardiac myxomas were found by echocardiogram when the disease relapsed and were resected surgically.
 Segmental arterial aneurysms and stenoses were found on angiography after leg ischemia.
 We suggest that echocardiography should be performed in all cases of clinically suspected PAN.
