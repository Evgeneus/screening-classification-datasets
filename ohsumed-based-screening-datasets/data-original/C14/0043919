Recurrent mild abruptio placentae occurring immediately after repeated electroconvulsive therapy in pregnancy.
 We present a case in which electroconvulsive therapy was performed repeatedly in pregnancy because of severe depression with psychotic features and failure of chemical treatment.
 Each electroconvulsive treatment was immediately followed by uterine contractions and active uterine bleeding, possibly representing recurrent abruptio placentae occurring in association with the treatment.
 Transient acute episodes of maternal hypertension between 180/90 and 190/100 mm Hg, documented within minutes after application of each electroconvulsive treatment, might explain the abruptio placentae manifested by active uterine bleeding and uterine hyperstimulation.
