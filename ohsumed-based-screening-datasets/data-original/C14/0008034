Renal secretion and hepatic clearance of human multiple renin forms.
 Human active renin can be separated into at least five forms by isoelectric focusing.
 The present study assessed the preferential renal secretion and hepatic degradation of renin forms in humans.
 The renin form profile of secreted renal renin was determined before transplant in an ex vivo kidney donor perfusion system and compared with the peripheral plasma multiple renin form profile of normal subjects.
 The effect of hepatic degradation on renin forms was assessed in hepatic vein plasma in comparison with infrarenal vena cava plasma in hypertensive patients during renal vein renin studies.
 The results revealed a significantly greater proportion of the more basic forms in the perfusate of donor kidneys compared with normal plasma.
 In hypertensive patients the proportion of the more basic renin forms in the hepatic vein was significantly decreased in comparison with the infrarenal vena cava.
 Thus, the human kidney may preferentially secrete the more basic renin forms.
 In contrast, the liver preferentially degrades the more basic forms, giving these forms a shorter plasma half-life.
 The preferential secretion and clearance of the more basic forms of renin may contribute to short-term control of human renin-angiotensin system activity.
