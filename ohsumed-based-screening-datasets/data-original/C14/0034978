Management and long-term outcome of aortic dissection.
 All 163 patients admitted to one institution between 1975 and 1988 with aortic dissection were reviewed.
 Type I and type II patients received grafting of the ascending aorta, with an intraoperative mortality rate of 11%.
 For type III dissection, management was medical in 53 patients, while 19 required surgery for aortic rupture or expansion, with an intraoperative mortality rate of 11%.
 The 9- or 10-year survival rates were 29%, 46%, and 29% for types I, II, and III respectively.
 Of 135 patients with primary aortic dissection, 17 (13%) required subsequent aortic surgery.
 Cause of late death was other cardiovascular disease in 38%, rupture of another aortic segment in 18%, sudden death in 24%, and other medical conditions in 21%.
 Although operative therapy for types I and II dissections and reserving operation for selected type III dissections provides acceptable long-term survival, careful follow-up is necessary due to concurrent cardiovascular disease and residual aortic disease.
