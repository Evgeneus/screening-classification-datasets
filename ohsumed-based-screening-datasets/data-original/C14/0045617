Sigmoid sinus thrombosis diagnosis by contrasted MRI scanning.
 Septic thrombosis of the transverse-sigmoid sinuses and the jugular bulb is a highly lethal condition.
 The presenting signs and symptoms of this disease entity are subtle and not in proportion to the magnitude of the problem.
 Later in the disease course, sudden fulminant findings appear.
 A high index of suspicion, combined with scanning techniques of either enhanced MRI or CT, allows prompt diagnosis and treatment.
 MRI enhanced with gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) is a valuable adjunct that confirms the diagnosis and delineates the extent of suspected pathology.
