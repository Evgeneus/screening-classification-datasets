Renal artery stenosis in patients with aortic dissection: increased prevalence 
 The authors retrospectively analyzed the prevalence of renal artery stenosis in 63 consecutive patients with aortic dissection who underwent thoracic and abdominal aortography.
 Ten patients (16%) had renal artery stenosis, five with atherosclerosis and five with fibromuscular lesions.
 Risk factors for aortic dissection were Marfan disease in nine patients, bicuspid aortic valve in one, and hypertension in 54 (including seven patients with Marfan syndrome).
 If the patients with Marfan syndrome and the patient with the bicuspid aortic valve are excluded, renal artery stenosis was present in 10 of 53 patients (19%) when the cause of dissection was presumably hypertension.
 This finding suggests that renovascular hypertension is a greater risk factor for aortic dissection than is essential hypertension.
 The success of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) in controlling renovascular hypertension has been proved.
 In this series, emergent PTRA successfully controlled the hypertension in one patient with a type B dissection, resulting in an excellent clinical outcome.
 Angiography should be routinely performed on patients with aortic dissections to evaluate for renal artery stenosis.
