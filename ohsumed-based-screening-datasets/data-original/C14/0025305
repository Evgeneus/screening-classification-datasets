Suppressive effect of SUN1165 on supraventricular tachycardia.
 The electrophysiologic properties of SUN1165 and its suppressive effect on supraventricular tachycardia were assessed in 14 patients, nine with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and five with atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT).
 This new agent prolonged the PR interval and QRS duration but did not alter the QT interval or the corrected QT interval.
 It did not alter the sinus cycle length or sinus node recovery time.
 The drug prolonged the AH interval, HV interval, and intraatrial conduction time but did not change the effective refractory periods of the right atrium or right ventricle.
 SUN1165 prevented the induction of tachycardia in six of nine patients with AVRT by a complete retrograde block of the accessory pathway and prevented AVNRT in four of five patients by a complete retrograde block of the fast atrioventricular nodal pathway as well.
 We conclude that SUN1165 is very effective in preventing AVRT or AVNRT.
 Larger studies with more patients are warranted.
