Reversal of a dense, persistent, holohemispheric neurological deficit after an endarterectomy of the carotid artery: case report.
 The role and timing of a carotid endarterectomy in the setting of an acute ischemic stroke-in-evolution remain controversial.
 Although computed tomographic (CT) scans typically show no abnormalities in the acute stage, it is generally agreed that a dense neurological deficit (hemiplegia) and/or multiple modality neurological disturbance (involving motor, sensory, gaze, and visual field impairment) represent contraindications to surgical intervention.
 We present a case of an acute right holohemispheric neurological deficit including dense hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, gaze disturbance, hemineglect, and impaired level of consciousness.
 This persisted for 4 days while serial CT scans showed no evidence of infarction.
 Angiography revealed pre-occlusive stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with sluggish antegrade flow.
 The anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis were impaired, and the right middle cerebral artery territory filled via the posterior communicating artery.
 Despite the dense neurological deficit persisting for 4 days, a carotid endarterectomy was performed.
 Gradual neurological improvement was noted within hours of the operation, and all neurological deficits resolved within the subsequent 3 days.
 This case is consistent with prolonged holohemispheric hemodynamic compromise below the threshold of neurological dysfunction, but above the threshold of tissue infarction ("idling neurons").
 Features assisting in the recognition of this unusual scenario and the indications and risks of revascularization in this setting are discussed.
