A population-based perspective of the hospital incidence and case-fatality rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The Worcester DVT Study.
 A community-wide study was conducted in 16 short-stay hospitals in metropolitan Worcester, Mass, to examine the incidence and case-fatality rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in patients hospitalized between July 1, 1985, and December 31, 1986.
 The average annual incidence of deep vein thrombosis alone was 48 per 100,000, while the incidence of pulmonary embolism with or without deep vein thrombosis was 23 per 100,000.
 The incidence rates of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism increased exponentially with age.
 The in-hospital case-fatality rate of venous thromboembolism was 12%.
 Among patients discharged from the hospital, the long-term case-fatality rates were 19%, 25%, and 30% at 1, 2, and 3 years after hospital discharge.
 Extrapolation of the data from this population-based study suggests that there are approximately 170,000 new cases of clinically recognized venous thromboembolism in patients treated in short-stay hospitals in the United States each year, and 99,000 hospitalizations for recurrent disease.
 Because of the silent nature of this disease and the low rate of autopsy in the United States, the total incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates of venous thromboembolism remain elusive.
