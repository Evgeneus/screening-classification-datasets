Median and ulnar neuropathy after streptokinase infusion.
 In a patient treated with intravenous streptokinase, inflammation developed at the infusion site followed by permanent ulnar and median neuropathy.
 Although adverse streptokinase infusion site reactions have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration, no other cases have been reported in the medical literature.
 We suggest that extravasated streptokinase may produce permanent ulnar and median neuropathy.
