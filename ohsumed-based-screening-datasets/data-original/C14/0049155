Congestive heart failure in diabetes with hypertension may be due to uncoupling of the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor-effector system in the kidney basolateral membrane.
 Hypertension is known to potentiate the risk of congestive heart failure (CHF) in diabetic individuals.
 Receptor-effector systems for atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is known to regulate intracellular calcium (Ca2+), were studied in the kidney during hypertensive-diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats.
 Animals were divided into four groups: control, diabetic (D), hypertensive (H), and diabetic plus hypertensive (D + H).
 Diabetes was induced by a streptozotocin (65 mg/kg) injection and hypertension was induced by abdominal aortic constriction; studies were done at 1 and 6 weeks.
 Plasma ANP was increased at 1 week in the D, H, and D + H groups.
 There was a significant increase in the activity of Ca2+ + magnesium (Mg2+) adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), which acts as a Ca2+ pump, in the kidney basolateral membrane from D, H, and D + H group at the 1 week study.
 Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, on the other hand, was significantly decreased in the D + H group only at 6 weeks.
 This was associated with a decrease in plasma ANP, an increase in the kidney ANP receptor number, and a decrease in guanylate cyclase activity.
 The response of the Ca2+ pump to ANP was also attenuated.
 Since ANP is known to mediate its cellular effects in part by increasing Ca2+ + Mg2+ ATPase, the observed changes in the D + H group may contribute to the development of nephropathy and CHF.
