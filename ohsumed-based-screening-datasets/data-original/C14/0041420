Functional recovery of hibernating myocardium after coronary bypass surgery: does it coincide with improvement in perfusion?
 To determine the relationship between functional recovery and improvement in perfusion after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), 49 patients were studied.
 Radionuclide angiography was performed before, 1 month after, and 6 to 12 months after CABG to evaluate regional wall motion.
 Exercise thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging was done before and 1 month after CABG to assess regional perfusion.
 Preoperative asynergy was observed in 108 segments, and 74 of them showed an improvement in wall motion 1 month after CABG (segment A).
 Sixty-six of these segments (89%) were associated with an improvement in perfusion.
 Eight segments that had not improved 1 month after CABG demonstrated a delayed recovery of wall motion 6 to 12 months after CABG (segment B).
 However, seven of eight segments (88%) already showed an improvement in perfusion 1 month after CABG.
 A total of 82 segments exhibited functional recovery after CABG and were considered hibernating segments.
 In the preoperative study segment B more frequently had areas of akinesis or dyskinesis than segment A (75% vs 34%, p less than 0.05).
 The mean percent thallium-201 uptake in segment B was lower than that in segment A (74% +/- 9% vs 83% +/- 8%, p less than 0.05).
 Functional recovery of hibernating myocardium usually coincided with an improvement in perfusion.
 However, delayed functional recovery after reperfusion was observed in some instances.
 Severe asynergy and severe thallium-201 defects were more frequently observed in these segments with delayed recovery.
 Hibernating myocardium might remain stunned during those recovery periods.
