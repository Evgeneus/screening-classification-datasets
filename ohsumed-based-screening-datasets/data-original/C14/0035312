Cardiovascular risk factors in young snuff-users and cigarette smokers.
 We studied cardiovascular risk factors in 21 young men who were habitual snuff-users, and compared them with the same risk factors in 18 non-tobacco-users and 19 cigarette smokers of the same age and body mass index.
 Both snuff-users and smokers showed increased levels of alcohol and coffee consumption and a decreased level of physical exercise compared to non-users.
 Both groups of tobacco-users showed increased serum insulin levels compared to the control group at similar blood glucose concentrations.
 In contrast to the smokers, snuff-users showed no significant elevation of diastolic blood pressure, haemoglobin concentrations, white cell count, serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels.
 Snuff users had higher plasma fibrinogen levels than non-users (P = 0.07).
 The use of snuff by young men appears to have less impact than smoking on cardiovascular risk factors, with the possible exception of elevated serum insulin and plasma fibrinogen levels.
