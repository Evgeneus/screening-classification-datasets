Optic nerve sheath decompression for nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy improves multiple visual function measurements.
 Optic nerve sheath decompression was performed in seven patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
 Visual function was evaluated by measurement of visual acuity with standardized Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts, color vision testing, quantitation of relative afferent pupillary defects with neutral-density filters, and Goldmann and Humphrey perimetry.
 Visual acuity improved markedly in all patients (at least doubling of the visual angle); the peripheral visual field expanded by at least 20 degrees (as measured by Goldmann perimetry) in six patients.
 Three patients also experienced marked improvement in color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, and foveal sensitivity.
 Our experience supports the possible beneficial effect of optic nerve sheath decompression in patients with nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy.
