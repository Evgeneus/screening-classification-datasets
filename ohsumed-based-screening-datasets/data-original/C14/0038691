Fatal theophylline poisoning with rhabdomyolysis. A potential role for dantrolene treatment.
 A fatal case of theophylline poisoning is described.
 The patient developed rhabdomyolysis, renal failure and compartment syndrome, as well as the more usual features of severe theophylline poisoning.
 Dantrolene appeared to be useful in controlling the hypermetabolic state associated with the overdose and may have a role in future treatment.
