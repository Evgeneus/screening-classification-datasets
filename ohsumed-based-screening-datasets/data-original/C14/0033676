Alpha-blocker therapy of hypertension. An unfulfilled promise.
 For various reasons, the alpha 1-receptor blocker prazosin has been used infrequently as initial therapy for hypertension.
 The introduction of additional agents of this class with properties different from prazosin provides slower onset of action, which should reduce the degree of first-dose and postural hypotension and a longer duration of action, which allows for once-a-day dosage.
 A summary of the published data on efficacy, side effects, and special properties of this class of agents indicates that they will probably be used more extensively, particularly because of their ability to improve lipid and glucose-insulin metabolism.
