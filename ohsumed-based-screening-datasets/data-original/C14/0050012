Very severe self-poisoning lithium carbonate intoxication causing a myocardial infarction.
 A case of severe lithium carbonate self-poisoning is described, presenting with a very high serum lithium level (14.6 mmol/L) on admission.
 Lengthy and repeated hemodialyses were required to lower lithemia to nontoxic ranges.
 As is usually reported, our patient had prolonged neurologic manifestations (coma, hyperreflexia, fluctuating focal signs) and developed hypotension, cardiovascular collapse, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and diarrhea.
 Other less common features were the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction without coronary artery lesions and thrombocytopenia.
 The possible pathogenic mechanisms are discussed.
 Hemodialysis and supportive intensive care treatment are commented upon.
 The final outcome was favorable, and the patient recovered completely.
