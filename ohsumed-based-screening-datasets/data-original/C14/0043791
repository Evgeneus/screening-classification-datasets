Aortoiliac dissection after percutaneous insertion of an intra-aortic balloon pump.
 Aortic or aortoiliac dissection may complicate percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump insertion in various ways.
 Thrombosis can escape clinical recognition if no major obstruction develops.
 Death due to perforation after dissection is not uncommon.
 In this case study, aortoiliac dissection led to bilateral iliac artery stenosis, an unusual complication of percutaneous femoral cannulation for insertion of a balloon pump.
