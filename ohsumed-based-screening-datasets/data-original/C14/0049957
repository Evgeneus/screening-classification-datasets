Abnormal vasomotor changes early after coronary angioplasty. A quantitative arteriographic study of their time course.
 BACKGROUND.
 To study the impact of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) on coronary vasomotion, we prospectively analyzed spontaneous changes in coronary diameter and the response to the cold pressor test and intracoronary nitroglycerin in 11 patients subjected to successful single-vessel PTCA.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 All antianginal medications were stopped 48 hours before each study.
 The minimum diameter of the PTCA segment and the diameter of a distal segment in the angioplastied vessel and of a segment in a control vessel not manipulated by the balloon catheter or guide wire were measured by computerized edge detection immediately before PTCA and 5 minutes after, 4 hours after, and 8 days after PTCA.
 At 4 hours, PTCA and distal segments were constricted by 38 +/- 9% and 16 +/- 5%, respectively, compared with the values at 5 minutes (p less than 0.01).
 Before angioplasty, the cold pressor test caused vasoconstriction of PTCA and distal segments by 23 +/- 6% (p less than 0.0001) and 15 +/- 4% (p less than 0.008), respectively, but no constrictor response was elicited at 5 minutes or 4 hours after angioplasty.
 Eight days after PTCA, the basal coronary diameters were similar to those observed 5 minutes after PTCA and the response to the cold pressor test was similar to that observed before PTCA.
 All segments dilated significantly with nitroglycerin at all times, and no vasoconstriction changes were found in the control segments.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Four hours after PTCA, transient spontaneous vasoconstriction of the PTCA and distal segments occurs, which is so intense that the cold pressor test does not cause any further constriction.
 These abnormalities resolve within 8 days of PTCA.
