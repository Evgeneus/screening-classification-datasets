A femoral vein-femoral artery loop technique for aortic dilatation in children.
 Balloon aortic dilatation is now a recognized therapy for aortic stenosis in children.
 Using retrograde approaches with either single or double balloons, successful dilatation can be readily achieved, but with little control of balloon position across the valve.
 We describe a femoral vein-femoral artery loop technique via a transseptal approach which facilitates antegrade crossing of the stenotic aortic valve and allows optimal balloon control and simultaneous pressure gradient recording during the procedure.
