Endocarditis due to ampicillin-resistant nontyphoid Salmonella: cure with a third-generation cephalosporin.
 A case of ampicillin-resistant salmonella bacteremia complicated by endocarditis in a 78-year-old man is presented.
 Previous rheumatic valvular heart disease and the lack of response to initial treatment with chloramphenicol prompted us to consider this diagnosis.
 There was a good clinical response after treatment with ceftriaxone alone and corresponding improvement on the echocardiogram.
 This case demonstrates the possible endovascular complications of salmonella bacteremia in elderly people and that endocarditis should be included among the invasive infections due to ampicillin-resistant Salmonella that could potentially be treated with the newer cephalosporins.
