A prospective randomized trial of adjuvant chemotherapy with bolus versus continuous infusion of doxorubicin in patients with high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma and an analysis of prognostic factors.
 A prospective randomized trial was conducted to compare the cardiotoxic and therapeutic effects of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 every 3 to 4 weeks) administered by bolus or 72-hour continuous infusion as adjuvant chemotherapy in 82 eligible patients after resection of high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity or superficial trunk.
 Cardiac toxicity, defined as a 10% or greater decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction as assessed by radionuclide cineangiography, was evaluated in 69 patients.
 Cardiotoxicity was seen in 61% of patients in the bolus treatment arm with the median doxorubicin dose of 420 mg/m2.
 Among patients who received continuous infusion, 42% had cardiotoxicity with a median dose of 540 mg/m2.
 The rate of cardiotoxicity as a function of the cumulative dose of doxorubicin was significantly higher in the bolus treatment arm (P = 0.0017).
 Two patients in each group had clinical congestive heart failure, with one cardiac death occurring in each.
 There was a trend toward a lower rate of metastasis (P = 0.19) and a significantly lower rate of death of disease (P = 0.036) for patients treated with the bolus dose.
 Cox model analysis identified three unfavorable characteristics for the rate of developing a distant metastasis: blood transfusion within 24 hours of operation (P less than 0.00001), tumor deep to the fascia and 5 cm or more in size (P = 0.0043), and a histologic subtype other than liposarcoma (P = 0.0002).
 The unfavorable effect of continuous infusion was not selected in the model (P = 0.16).
 Adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with soft tissue sarcoma is investigational.
 Furthermore, the impact of perioperative blood transfusion merits further study.
