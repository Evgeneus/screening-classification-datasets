Multicenter comparison of once- and twice-daily isradipine to hydrochlorothiazide for the treatment of hypertension in elderly patients.
 After 8 weeks of isradipine, a twice-a-day dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, 49% of elderly patients showed a complete response (sitting diastolic blood pressure less than or equal to 85 mm Hg) and 36% showed a partial response (sitting diastolic blood pressure decrease greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg) for an 85% total response rate.
 Hydrochlorothiazide gave a complete response in 36% of the patients and a partial response in 33%, for a 69% total response rate (p less than 0.0046).
 Because elderly subjects have reduced clearance for many drugs, we determined how those who responded to twice-a-day administration would respond to once-a-day administration.
 After 4 weeks of isradipine administered once a day, 54% of the patients showed a complete or partial response, whereas 38% of the patients who were changed to placebo showed a response.
 In contrast, 82% of patients receiving hydrochlorothiazide once a day showed a response, whereas 60% of patients who were changed to placebo showed a response.
 These data indicate that the standard formulation of isradipine was not effective when administered once a day.
