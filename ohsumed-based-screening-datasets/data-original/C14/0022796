Percutaneous extraction of fractured guidewire from distal right coronary artery.
 The incidence of retained hardware components in the coronary artery tree is likely to parallel the growing number and types of percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures being performed.
 Management has extended from the conservative option of simply leaving behind the retained components to the more aggressive approach of surgical removal.
 A percutaneous method is described herein which offers the interventional cardiologist an alternative method of managing patients with retained wire fragments contained entirely in the coronary artery.
