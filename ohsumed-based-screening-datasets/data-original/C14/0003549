Progressive coronary luminal narrowing after cardiac transplantation.
 Accelerated coronary disease is a major factor limiting long-term survival in cardiac transplant recipients.
 Coronary angiography was obtained a mean of 5.1 weeks posttransplantation and annually thereafter.
 Replicate projections recorded after nitroglycerine administration were quantitated using computer-assisted edge detection.
 Five hundred and fifteen coronary segments in 25 patients having 1-year follow-up and 353 segments in 18 patients reaching 2-year follow-up were compared with baseline angiograms.
 Significant change was defined as +/- 0.10 mm, equal to 3.8% change in diameter based on three standard deviations obtained from estimation of measurement error.
 Mean coronary diameter fell from 2.44 +/- 0.26 mm at baseline to 2.21 +/- 0.34 mm (p less than 0.001) at 1-year follow-up.
 This rate of diameter decline was 20-fold more rapid during the initial posttransplantation year than the rate of change of visually normal segments in nontransplant patients with coronary atherosclerosis elsewhere.
 There was no significant drop in mean diameter between the first and second year in those patients who had second-year studies.
 Decrease in absolute diameter for vessels greater than 2.9 mm significantly exceeded diameter reduction for smaller vessels but did not differ when considered as a ratio of vessel diameter.
 In 21 of 25 patients, mean coronary diameter reduction exceeded the three-standard deviation threshold at their last angiogram, but only two of these patients had visually detectable transplant coronary disease.
