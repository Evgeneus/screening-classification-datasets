Results and complications of angioplasty in fibromuscular disease.
 Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was used to treat 66 patients with 85 renal artery stenoses due to fibromuscular dysplasia.
 The hypertension was refractory to medical management in 46 patients, and the initial success rate was 100%.
 Clinical follow-up has been obtained in all patients, who were followed for as long as 121 months.
 The recurrence rates were 8% of lesions and 10% of patients.
 Cumulative patency rate predicted for 10 years was 87.07%.
 The mean systolic pressure decreased by 52 mm Hg and the mean diastolic pressure decreased by 35 mm Hg in response to treatment.
 Twenty-six patients (39%) were cured, 39 (59%) were classified as improved, and one (2%) did not respond to PTA.
 Fourteen of the patients also had elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels.
 Renal function was improved in 86% of the patients and stabilized in 14% of the patients.
 Analysis of the long-term results suggests that PTA should be the initial treatment for choice of patients with fibromuscular dysplasia in the renal arteries.
