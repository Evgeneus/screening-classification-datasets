Nd:YAG iliac and femoropopliteal laser angioplasty: results with large probes as "sole therapy".
 Laser assisted balloon angioplasty with a laser heated metallic capped fiberoptic catheter may be effective in the treatment of femoral and iliac artery occlusive disease.
 In order to avoid the inherent trauma of balloon angioplasty, yet at the same time "debulk" atheroma, 75 patients underwent laser angioplasty of the superficial femoral and iliac arteries as "sole therapy".
 Laser angioplasty was performed using an Nd:YAG laser coupled to a 600 micron fiber and a 3.5 mm probe (22-28 watts), 4.2 mm or 5.0 probe (32-40 watts).
 Fifty-nine patients had laser angioplasty for claudication and 16 for limb salvage.
 The initial angiographic success rate was 84% (41/49) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the superficial femoral and 69% (18/26) (lesion length 2-14 cm) for the iliac arteries.
 In follow-up extending to 21 months (mean 14.4 months) 73% (30/41) of the superficial femoral artery and 76% (14/18) of the initially recanalized iliac arteries remain patent.
 When initial failures are included, this represents an overall intermediate-term patency rate of 52% (32/49) for superficial femoral and 49% (14/26) for iliac arteries respectively.
 By avoiding the disruptive effect on the arterial wall architecture caused by balloon angioplasty, while at the same time ablating and vaporizing more atheromatous material with larger laser probes, the long-term patency rates of laser angioplasty as "sole therapy" may prove to be superior to those of laser assisted balloon angioplasty.
