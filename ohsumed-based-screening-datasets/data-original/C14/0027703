Thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications in essential thrombocythemia. A retrospective study of 103 patients.
 A retrospective study of 103 patients with essential thrombocythemia was carried out to evaluate the incidence of thrombohemorrhagic complications and establish whether there were any correlations between these events and clinical or laboratory data.
 At onset or during the course of the disease, 26 patients (25.2%) presented thrombotic and 12 (11.6%) hemorrhagic complications: among the latter, six patients had gastrointestinal bleeding during antiaggregant therapy.
 No significant correlations were observed between thrombohemorrhagic complications and platelet count, age, sex, platelet function, bleeding time, or therapeutic regimen.
 However, there was a statistically significant correlation between a positive patient history for thrombotic events and an increase in thromboses.
 In agreement with other authors, it is believed that the best approach in asymptomatic patients is strict surveillance without treatment.
 Chemotherapy and/or treatment with antiaggregant agents should be reserved for symptomatic patients or patients with a positive history for thrombotic events.
