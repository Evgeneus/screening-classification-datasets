Bopindolol: Czechoslovak experience with a new beta blocker in the treatment of hypertension.
 Bopindolol is a nonselective beta blocker with mild intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.
 One of the drug's main benefits is its prolonged effect, lasting for 24 hours, which makes it possible to administer bopindolol in a single daily dose, a fact that may improve patient adherence to therapy.
 A double-blind study was performed in two centers, comparing bopindolol with metoprolol in 86 hypertensive patients.
 Baseline diastolic blood pressure (BP) was 100 to 120 mm Hg.
 The effects of bopindolol or metoprolol on BP and heart rate were similar: return to normal values was achieved in 70% of patients with either drug.
 A 6-month study at another center found that bopindolol did not affect the levels of total cholesterol, low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides.
 Another 12-month study documented a decrease in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and apo B.
 The apo A/B ratio rose, thus improving the atherosclerotic index.
 No deterioration of glucose tolerance or immunoreactive insulin response to glucose was seen after 6 months of bopindolol administration.
 Bopindolol satisfactorily modifies not only resting but also exercise BP during isometric and isotonic load, thus reducing BP fluctuation during physical activities of the hypertensive patient.
 The drug exerts no effect on renal and liver function, electrolyte balance and hematologic parameters.
 Bopindolol is a very useful drug of first choice in mild and moderate hypertension.
 Bopindolol's main advantages include its prolonged action, good tolerance and a beneficial effect on risk factors of atherosclerosis (lipid and carbohydrate metabolism).
