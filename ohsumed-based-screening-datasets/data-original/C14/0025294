Regional myocardial function after repetitive brief episodes of ischemia: effect of altering the duration of the reperfusion period.
 How recovery of regional contractile function in myocardium is influenced by alterations in the duration of reperfusion after repetitive brief coronary artery occlusions was investigated in chronically instrumented, conscious dogs.
 All animals underwent five 5 minute left anterior descending coronary artery occlusions with a final 5-hour reperfusion period.
 Dogs were randomly assigned to one of three groups determined by the duration of reperfusion (5, 10, or 15 minutes) between successive 5-minute occlusion periods.
 A shortening of the duration of the reperfusion period between occlusions led to reduced recovery and progressive deterioration in systolic shortening after multiple occlusion-reperfusion sequences.
 With 15-minute reperfusion periods, the percentage of segment shortening (%SS) during the first through fourth reperfusion periods ranged from 17.1 +/- 2.6% to 18.2 +/- 1.8% and did not differ from the preocclusion control value (18.8 +/- 1.7%) by the end of the final reperfusion period.
 In contrast, in those dogs with 5-minute reperfusion periods, %SS was significantly reduced from the preocclusion control value (20.2 +/- 2.2%) at the completion of the final 5-hour reperfusion period (11.4 +/- 1.5%).
 Results of the present study indicate that after only a few brief periods of coronary artery occlusion, rapid and cumulative deterioration in regional contractile function can occur when the duration of intermittent reperfusion is sufficiently brief.
