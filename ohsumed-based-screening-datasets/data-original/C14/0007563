Ability of calcium-entry blockade by felodipine to disclose different pathogenetic mechanisms behind hyperventilation-induced myocardial ischemia in men.
 To verify that myocardial ischemia occurring during either the overbreathing or recovery phase of the hyperventilation test is based on different pathogenetic mechanisms, 2 consecutive series of patients, selected on the basis of their response to a run-in hyperventilation test, were studied.
 Group I comprised 15 patients who developed ST-segment depression early during overbreathing, whereas group II consisted of 12 patients showing ST-segment depression late during the recovery phase.
 A single oral dose of felodipine 10 mg or of placebo was administered on 2 consecutive days according to a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, and the hyperventilation test was repeated, on both days of the study, 3 to 5 hours after drug intake.
 In group I, ST-segment depression occurred after placebo in all patients during overbreathing, with an increase in rate pressure product (from 112 +/- 31 at baseline to 168 +/- 55 mm Hg x beats/min/100 at the onset of ST-segment depression; p less than 0.01).
 After felodipine, 13 patients continued to show ST-segment depression during overbreathing, together with an increase in rate pressure product (from 107 +/- 24 at baseline to 158 +/- 46 mm Hg x beats/min/100 at the onset of electrocardiographic changes; p less than 0.01).
 In group II, all 12 patients showed ST-segment depression during recovery after placebo, with a rate pressure product comparable to baseline conditions (112 +/- 35 at baseline vs 102 +/- 27 mm Hg x beats/min/100 at the onset of ST-segment depression; difference not significant).
 After felodipine, no patient developed ST-segment depression or chest pain.
