Lumbar regional anaesthesia and prophylactic anticoagulant therapy. Is the combination safe?
 A survey has been carried out in all Danish anaesthetic departments (n = 80) regarding the attitude towards the use of epidural/spinal lumbar analgesia in patients who were receiving prophylactic anticoagulant therapy for the prevention of thromboembolism.
 About 60% of the departments used the techniques in patients receiving low-dose heparin and no side effects had been experienced.
 Spinal and epidural anaesthesia were in general regarded as being contraindicated in patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists.
 In the world literature, the attitude towards the combination is conflicting.
 No randomised trial has been performed and complications are almost entirely confined to patients fully anticoagulated with vitamin K antagonists.
 Only one case of an epidural haematoma has been recorded when subcutaneous low-dose heparin was used as thromboprophylaxis.
