Metabolic activity in the areas of new fill-in after thallium-201 reinjection: comparison with positron emission tomography using fluorine-18-deoxyglucose.
 Reinjection of thallium-201 after recording the 3-hr delayed scan often demonstrates improvement in areas of persistent abnormalities.
 To determine the metabolic activity of these areas, the changes seen on stress/redistribution/reinjection thallium SPECT were compared with PET using fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in 18 patients with coronary artery disease.
 Of 48 segments showing no redistribution on the delayed scan, the reinjection scan identified new fill-in in 20 segments (42%), all of which demonstrated FDG uptake.
 In contrast, only 7 of the 28 segments (25%) showing no fill-in after reinjection were PET viable (p less than 0.01).
 Eleven patients had coronary bypass graft surgery after the radionuclide study.
 The majority of the segments showing redistribution (87%) and new fill-in after reinjection (65%) improved in wall motion, whereas only eight segments (25%) without new fill-in improved after surgery.
 Of those without new fill-in, two segments showing PET ischemia improved in wall motion, whereas the remaining six segments showing PET scar did not improve after surgery.
 Thus, the segments showing new fill-in after reinjection are PET viable myocardium.
 However, reinjection thallium imaging still underestimates the extent of tissue viability compared to PET imaging.
