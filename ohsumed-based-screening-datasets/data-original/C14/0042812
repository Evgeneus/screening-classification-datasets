Embolization of arteriovenous malformations with peripheral aneurysms using ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer. Report of three cases.
 The authors report three cases of arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) with aneurysms arising from the feeding artery; all were successfully treated with a new nonadhesive liquid embolic material, ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVAL).
 In two patients the AVM's were totally removed without difficulty, and in one the AVM was managed conservatively after embolization.
 No new neurological deficits appeared during or after embolization.
 After road-mapping techniques, EVAL was injected slowly until the feeding artery and aneurysm were completely obliterated.
 This embolic agent is easy to handle and is considered safe compared with other adhesive liquid embolic agents, such as isobutyl-2-cyanoacrylate or n-butyl cyanoacrylate.
 It is concluded that EVAL is an excellent agent for embolizing an AVM with a peripheral aneurysm on the feeding artery.
