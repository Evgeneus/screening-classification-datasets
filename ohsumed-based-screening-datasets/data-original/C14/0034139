Relation of arteriographically defined coronary artery disease to serum lipoprotein particles mapped with monoclonal antibodies.
 BACKGROUND.
 This study was designed to investigate the relation of a molecular analysis of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing atherogenic lipoprotein particles to coronary artery disease (CAD) in middle-aged men.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Two groups of men were studied.
 The first consisted of 97 patients with angiographically documented CAD (greater than 50% stenosis of at least one coronary artery).
 The second group consisted of 145 subjects without symptomatic CAD, who served as controls.
 In both groups, measurements were obtained for total cholesterol level, triglyceride level, cholesterol contents in apoB- and nonapoB-containing particles (LpB, LpnonB), total apoB and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI levels), lipoprotein particles recognized by monoclonal antibodies anti-apoB (LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7) and anti-apoAI (LpAI-2GII).
 Taking into account age, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes, smoking habits, and drug consumption, the analysis showed that the mean levels of cholesterol were identical in both groups but differed when cholesterol content in LpB and LpnonB subfractions were assessed, thus reflecting an increase in the low density fraction and a decrease in the high density fraction, respectively.
 This was confirmed by an increase in total apoB and a decrease in total apoAI.
 Measurements of LpBL3, LpBL5, LpBL7, and LpAI-2GII particles also discriminated between the two groups.
 After adjustment for cholesterol content in LpnonB particles, a difference in total apoB was no longer significant between groups, whereas LpBL3, LpBL5, and LpBL7 levels remained significantly higher in CAD patients.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 The measurement of separate concentrations of apoB in different particles may permit a more-accurate assessment of CAD risk than measurements of total apoB levels.
