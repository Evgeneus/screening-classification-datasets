Effect of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium-201 image quality 
 To determine the effect of different types of exercise supplementation on dipyridamole thallium image quality, 78 patients were prospectively randomized to one of three protocols: dipyridamole infusion alone, dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip, and dipyridamole with low-level treadmill exercise.
 Heart-to-lung, heart-to-liver, and heart-to-adjacent infradiaphragmatic activity ratios were generated from anterior images acquired immediately following the test.
 Additionally, heart-to-total infradiaphragmatic activity was graded semiquantitatively.
 Results showed a significantly higher ratio of heart to subdiaphragmatic activity in the treadmill group as compared with dipyridamole alone (p less than 0.001) and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise (p less than 0.001).
 No significant difference was observed between patients receiving the dipyridamole infusion, and dipyridamole supplemented with isometric handgrip exercise.
 We conclude that low-level treadmill exercise supplementation of dipyridamole infusion is an effective means of improving image quality.
 Supplementation with isometric handgrip does not improve image quality over dipyridamole alone.
