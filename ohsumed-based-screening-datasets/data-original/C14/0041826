An improved method for the quantification of left-to-right cardiac shunts.
 We have investigated a technique for quantifying QP/QS in left-to-right cardiac shunts.
 In this method, the gamma variate, which is fitted to the first-pass portion of the lung curve, is used to generate a curve, which simulates the response of a normal lung curve with systemic recirculation.
 The difference between this curve and the observed lung curve is then used to calculate QP/QS.
 This method was evaluated on a set of simulated lung time-activity curves with precisely known QP/QS values on a group of 11 patients with no clinical suspicion of cardiac shunt and on a group of 30 patients referred for cardiac shunt studies.
 The QP/QS in each of these studies was determined by three individuals using both the Maltz-Treves method and the new method.
 This method yielded QP/QS values that were more accurate on the simulated lung data and had less interobserver variation on all the studies than those obtained from the Maltz-Treves method.
