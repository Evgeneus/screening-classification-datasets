Major clinical diagnoses found among patients with Raynaud phenomenon from the general population.
 This study of 62 individuals with Raynaud phenomenon (RP) drawn from the general population of South Carolina shows a profile of associated diseases that is different from the one reported from hospital based studies.
 We found that connective tissue diseases affect a much smaller fraction of patients with RP than previously reported.
 Compared to RP negative controls, our RP positive group was found to suffer more frequently from a variety of diseases, both RP related and not RP related.
