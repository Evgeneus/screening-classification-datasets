Prediction of pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders by angiotensin II sensitivity and supine pressor test.
 An angiotensin II sensitivity test and a supine pressor test were done consecutively at 28 weeks gestation in 90 healthy, normotensive nulliparous women.
 None of the supine pressor tests was positive, applying the predefined threshold of a rise of 20 mmHg in diastolic blood pressure after rolling over; nine tests were positive using a corrected 9 mmHg cut-off level.
 Ten women had a positive angiotensin sensitivity test using a threshold of the effective pressor dose of 8 ng/kg/min; 22 women were positive using an effective pressor dose of less than or equal to 10 ng/kg/min.
 Later in pregnancy 12 women (13%) developed pregnancy-induced hypertensive disease (PIH).
 The specificity of both tests of predicting the development of PIH was about 90%.
 The sensitivity of the angiotensin sensitivity test at the 10 ng/kg/min level was 92%.
 Because of its low sensitivity of 25% the supine pressor test appears to have no value for the prediction of PIH.
 There was a significant positive association between angiotensin II refractoriness and birthweight.
