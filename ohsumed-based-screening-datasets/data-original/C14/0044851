Cardiovascular effects of volatile anesthesia in rabbits: influence of chronic heart failure and enalaprilat treatment.
 Circulatory responses to isoflurane and halothane anesthesia were studied in eight rabbits with biventricular cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin (Adriamycin, 14 mg/kg IV over 7 wk) and in eight controls (saline injections).
 In preliminary operations pulsed-Doppler flow probes were placed on the ascending aorta, left renal artery, and lower abdominal aorta.
 Each group was studied after 4, 6, and 7 wk of treatment.
 The development of congestive heart failure (CHF) was associated with decreases in mean arterial pressure and cardiac output (CO) of 14% and 16%, respectively, (P less than 0.05) and an increase in heart rate.
 In controls, each anesthetic agent produced dose-related decreases in mean arterial pressure and increases in heart rate, but not significant changes in CO.
 Renal blood flow was reduced to a similar degree by 1.3 MAC halothane (24% decrease) and 1.3 MAC isoflurane (21% decrease); hindlimb blood flow was reduced only by halothane.
 As CHF developed there was an attenuation of the heart rate response to anesthesia.
 Halothane, but not isoflurane, significantly reduced CO in more advanced stages of CHF.
 The changes in renal blood flow and hindlimb blood flow with each anesthetic in the CHF group were similar to those observed in controls and did not vary with week of treatment.
 Administration of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat (0.2 mg/kg IV) reversed the CO and renal blood flow effects of halothane except after 7 wk of treatment in the CHF group, when the combination of halothane and enalaprilat resulted in severe circulatory depression.
