The antihypertensive mechanism of delapril, a newly developed converting enzyme inhibitor, is related to the suppression of vascular angiotensin II release in the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
 Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the local control of arterial tone.
 To further gain insight into the significance of vascular RAS in hypertension, we investigated the relationship between the antihypertensive action of delapril, a newly developed converting enzyme inhibitor (CEI), and its effects on vascular angiotensin II (Ang II) release in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR).
 Male SHRs were given delapril or its active metabolite (5-hydroxydelapril diacid; 5-hydroxy-DPD) orally (10 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks.
 Isolated hind legs of these rats were perfused with angiotensinogen-free Krebs-Ringer solution, and Ang II released into the perfusate was directly determined by extraction with Sep-Pak C18 cartridges connected to the perfusion system.
 Both delapril and 5-hydroxy-DPD produced a sustained antihypertensive action.
 The spontaneous release of Ang II from isolated perfused hind legs of control SHRs was about 50 to 110 pg during the first 30 min of perfusion, and it remained stable up to 3 h.
 Another active metabolite, delapril diacid (DPD), when added to the perfusion medium (10(-9) to 5 x 10(-5) mol/L), suppressed the Ang II release in a dose-dependent manner.
 The maximal percent inhibition of Ang II released evoked by DPD (5 x 10(-6) mol/L) was approximately 51%.
 Oral pretreatment of either delapril or 5-hydroxy-DPD for 2 weeks suppressed the Ang II release by 61% and 73% for delapril and 5-hydroxy-DPD, respectively.
 These results suggest the presence of a functional RAS in vascular tissues, and that delapril exerts its antihypertensive effect through inhibition of vascular Ang II release in SHRs.
