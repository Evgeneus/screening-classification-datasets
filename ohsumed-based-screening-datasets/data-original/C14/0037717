Pathophysiology of isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients: Doppler echocardiographic insights.
 Systemic hemodynamics were evaluated with aortic pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography in 79 elderly subjects with isolated systolic hypertension participating in the Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program (SHEP) and were compared with the values in 39 normal age-matched subjects.
 Cardiac output was elevated (4.50 +/- 1.13 L/min versus 3.94 +/- 1.12 L/min, p less than 0.05) in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with values in normal elderly subjects.
 Systemic vascular resistance did not differ between both groups (2140 +/- 536 dyn.sec/cm-5 versus 2011 +/- 553 dyn.sec/cm-5, p = NS).
 The mean acceleration of blood during left ventricular ejection was similar in patients with isolated systolic hypertension in comparison with normals (12.6 +/- 5.6 m/sec2 versus 11.5 +/- 3.5 m/sec2, p = NS).
 Patients with isolated systolic hypertension had significantly decreased arterial compliance, as measured by the stroke volume-to-pulse pressure ratio (0.77 +/- 0.26 cm3/mm Hg versus 1.11 +/- 0.30 cm3/mm Hg, p less than 0.0001).
 The prevalence of aortic and mitral regurgitation as well as valvular and annular calcification did not differ between analyzed groups.
 Isolated systolic hypertension in elderly patients appears to be multifactorial, with reduced arterial compliance and increased cardiac output both playing a role.
