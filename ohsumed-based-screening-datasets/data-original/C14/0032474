Double-outlet right ventricle: morphologic demonstration using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.
 Sixteen patients with double-outlet right ventricle, aged 1 week to 29 years (median 5 months), were studied with a 1.5 tesla nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging scanner.
 Two-dimensional echocardiography was performed in all patients.
 Thirteen patients underwent angiography, including nine who underwent subsequent surgical correction.
 Three patients underwent postmortem examination.
 Small children and infants were scanned inside a 32 cm diameter proton head coil.
 Multiple 5 mm thick sections separated by 0.5 mm and gated to the patient's electrocardiogram were acquired with a spin-echo sequence and an echo time of 30 ms.
 A combination of standard and oblique imaging planes was used.
 Imaging times were less than 90 min.
 The NMR images were technically unsuitable in one patient because of excessive motion artifact.
 In the remaining patients, the diagnosis of double outlet right ventricle was confirmed and correlated with surgical and postmortem findings.
 The NMR images were particularly valuable in demonstrating the interrelations between the great arteries and the anatomy of the outlet septum and the spatial relations between the ventricular septal defect and the great arteries.
 Although the atrioventricular (AV) valves were not consistently demonstrated, NMR imaging in two patients identified abnormalities of the mitral valve that were not seen with two-dimensional echocardiography.
 In one patient who had a superoinferior arrangement of the ventricles, NMR imaging was the most useful imaging technique for demonstrating the anatomy.
 In patients with double-outlet right ventricle, NMR imaging can provide clinically relevant and accurate morphologic information that may contribute to future improvement in patient management.
