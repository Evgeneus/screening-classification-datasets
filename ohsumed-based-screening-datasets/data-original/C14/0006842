Does carotid restenosis predict an increased risk of late symptoms, stroke, or death?
 The identification of carotid restenosis as an unexpected late complication of carotid endarterectomy has prompted concerns regarding its importance as a source of new cerebral symptoms, stroke, and death.
 To investigate these concerns, we analyzed a consecutive series of 507 patients undergoing 566 carotid endarterectomies, each documented as technically satisfactory.
 Post-operative duplex Doppler examination data at 3 days, 1, 3, 6, 12 months, and annually thereafter in 484 arteries (85.5%) permitted classification of these arteries according to the most severe degree of postoperative stenosis: normal (n = 306); 1% to 19% (n = 89); 20% to 50% (n = 40); more than 50% (n = 49, including 8 occluded).
 The incidence of more than 50% restenosis was 14.5% in female and 7.7% in male patients (p = 0.003).
 Life table analyses to 10 years revealed a significantly greater life expectancy among those with restenosis (p = 0.05).
 Stroke was also less likely in patients with restenosis, although this difference did not reach statistical significance.
 When survival and stroke were both endpoints, the likelihood of patients with more than 50% restenosis remaining alive and stroke free was also greater than the less than 20% stenotic group (p = 0.03).
 Thus patients with carotid restenosis were less likely than patients with normal postoperative scans to have late symptoms, stroke, or early death.
