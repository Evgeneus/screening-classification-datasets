Anaesthetic-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmia in Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.
 A four-year-old deaf girl with a history of convulsions developed polymorphous ventricular tachycardia during induction of anaesthesia.
 The arrhythmia reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously.
 Post-anaesthetic ECG showed marked prolongation of the QTc interval (570-690 msec).
 Deafness and prolonged QTc interval in association with microcytic-hypochromic anaemia confirmed the diagnosis of the Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome.
 This case report highlights the potentially lethal complication of halothane anaesthesia in patients with long QTc interval syndrome.
