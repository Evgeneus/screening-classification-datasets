Stasis ulcers: the role of compliance in healing.
 The goal in treating a stasis ulcer is rapid and permanent reepithelialization of the ulcer bed.
 The patient can reach this goal by strict compliance with a program taught and continually reinforced by the physician.
 The program teaches about the effects of the force of gravity on the flow of blood and lymph in the lower extremities in various positions.
 The program consists of three rules for the patient to follow: (1) Never sit with legs below heart level.
 (2) Never stand still.
 Walk in place or even while sitting (if sitting is necessary).
 (3) Always wear compressive stockings or pneumatic leggings when walking.
 I present four case histories demonstrating the different rates of healing of stasis ulcers during noncompliance and during compliance with the physiologic methods of controlling edema and venous stasis in the legs.
