Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide in young normotensive subjects with a family history of hypertension and in young hypertensive patients.
 Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) behavior was evaluated in 26 untreated essential hypertensives, 21 normotensives, and 20 normotensives with hypertensive heredity under normal sodium intake (120 mEq of Na+/day).
 All subjects were men, mean age 22.1 +/- 1.9 years.
 Plasma ANP was evaluated by radioimmunoassay on samples collected in supine position upon waking and again after 1 h of orthostatism.
 Resulting data showed that ANP in hypertensives (supine = 44.5 +/- 19.4 pg/mL, orthostatism = 24.1 +/- 11.6 pg/mL) was at higher levels than in controls (supine = 38.3 +/- 19.4 pg/mL, orthostatism = 19.9 +/- 10.6 pg/mL) or in normotensives with hypertensive heredity (supine = 42.1 +/- 16.8 pg/mL, orthostatism = 23.2 +/- 10.8 pg/mL).
 Mean ANP level was higher in the latter group than in the control group (supine = +9%; orthostatism = +14.2%).
 In conclusion, plasma ANP is raised in young essential hypertensives, resulting in slightly elevated levels in normotensives with hypertensive heredity.
