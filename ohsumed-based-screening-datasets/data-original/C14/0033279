Effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor on normal and ischemic myocardium.
 We sought to determine the effects of acidic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) on ischemic and normal myocardium and to determine whether direct application of acidic FGF to the heart could promote angiogenesis.
 Eighteen dogs underwent placement of an ameroid constrictor on the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).
 Three weeks later, a left internal mammary artery (IMA) pedicle was positioned over the LAD territory, with a sponge saturated with acidic FGF (n = 12) or saline (n = 4) interposed between the pedicle and the heart.
 Polytetrafluoroethylene fiber or collagen I sponges were used to deliver the acidic FGF.
 Weekly angiography of the IMA was performed in all dogs, but significant IMA to coronary collaterals were not demonstrable in any dog.
 Eight dogs had histological evidence of subendocardial infarction in the LAD territory (five acidic FGF, three control, p = NS).
 Striking smooth muscle cell hyperplasia was present in arterioles and small arteries exclusively in areas of subendocardial infarction in all of the acidic FGF-treated dogs but in none of the control dogs (p less than 0.05).
 Noninfarcted myocardium appeared normal in all dogs.
 In two additional dogs, ameroid constrictors were not placed on the LAD, such that acidic FGF-treated sponges were placed on normally perfused myocardium of the LAD territory.
 Histological evaluation of those hearts revealed normal myocardium, without evidence of myocardial infarction or smooth muscle cell hyperplasia.
 Thus, when acidic FGF is delivered to the myocardium via an epicardial sponge in dogs whose coronary flow is compromised, acidic FGF does not cause an angiogenic response in viable myocardium but causes vascular smooth muscle cell hyperplasia in areas subjected to ischemic injury.
