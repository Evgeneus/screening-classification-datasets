Sinus arrest induced by trivial nasal stimulation during alfentanil-nitrous oxide anaesthesia.
 A case is reported of bradycardia and sinus arrest induced by insertion of a nasal temperature probe.
 Other possible causes of bradycardia and sinus arrest under anaesthesia are reviewed briefly.
 Evidence for the neurological basis of a nasocardiac reflex, similar to the oculocardiac reflex, is presented.
 A minor, trivial stimulus may elicit this reflex.
