Exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease with and without angina.
 Left ventricular dysfunction during exercise is considered a relatively sensitive marker of ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether exercise-induced myocardial dysfunction was more severe in patients with angina than in patients with ischemia without angina.
 Seventy-seven patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease and an abnormal left ventricular response to exercise were studied by means of gated blood pool imaging.
 The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing imaging.
 The arteriographic and functional parameters of 24 patients with angina during exercise testing were compared with those of 53 patients who were pain free at the time of the test.
 Both groups were similar with regard to rate of multivessel disease (50% vs 51%, p = NS) and prior myocardial infarction (46% vs 51%, p = NS), as well as age, sex, and history of angina.
 Mean global ejection fraction remained unchanged (but abnormal) in both groups of patients during exercise.
 Furthermore, evidence of new regional asynergy during exercise assessed by a five-point scoring system was found to be equally abnormal in the two groups.
 Results of this study suggest that the severity of exercise-induced global and regional left ventricular dysfunction is independent of the presence of absence of angina during exercise testing.
