Early thrombolytic treatment reduces analgesic requirement in patients with myocardial infarction.
 The duration and amount of analgesics required were investigated in 67 patients with myocardial infarction treated with intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) or placebo in a randomized double-blind trial.
 Infusion of rtPA (100 mg)/placebo was started within 5 h after the onset of symptoms, and the requirement for analgesics during the following 48 h was recorded.
 Sixty-seven per cent of the 30 rtPA-treated patients required analgesic treatment for less than 6 h, compared to 38% of the 37 patients in the placebo group (P = 0.04).
 During the study period, patients in the rtPA group used the equivalent of 5.3 mg (median value) intravenous morphine, which was significantly less than the 11.2 mg used in the placebo group (P = 0.04).
 In conclusion, the present study suggests that early thrombolysis with intravenous rtPA reduces the amount and duration of analgesic treatment required by patients with myocardial infarction.
