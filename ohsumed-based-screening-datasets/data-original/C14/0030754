Heterogeneity in oxygen diffusion around venous ulcers.
 The pathogenesis of venous ulceration is thought to involve the formation of fibrin cuffs around dermal capillaries.
 Consistent with a barrier effect of fibrin, it has been shown that the dermal diffusion of oxygen, as measured by transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2), is decreased in limbs affected by venous ulcer.
 However, it is unknown whether oxygen diffusion around the perimeter of venous ulcers is uniformly affected.
 In this study, we investigated TcPO2 values at four different quadrants around the ulcers of 14 patients, the contralateral leg of five patients with unilateral ulcers, and the leg of six normal individuals.
 These values were also compared to TcPO2 measurements at the chest.
 Our results indicate that, whereas TcPO2 values in limbs affected by venous ulcers are much lower than normal, there is a great deal of variability in oxygen diffusion around individual ulcers.
 These findings may represent a heterogeneity in the disease process affecting the leg.
