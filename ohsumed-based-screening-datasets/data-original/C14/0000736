The incidence of deep vein thrombosis after cementless and cemented knee replacement.
 The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in 244 patients who had total knee replacement has been studied.
 In 120 the prosthesis was cemented and in 124 it was cementless.
 In all cases the replacement was primary and a porous-coated prosthesis with a porous-coated central tibial stem was used.
 Deep vein thrombosis was diagnosed by venography, and pulmonary embolism by perfusion scanning.
 The incidence of deep vein thrombosis in the cementless knees (23.8%) and in the cemented (25%) was approximately the same.
 The only significant predisposing factors for deep vein thrombosis in both groups were obesity, prolonged postoperative immobilisation, previous venous disease and hyperlipidaemia.
