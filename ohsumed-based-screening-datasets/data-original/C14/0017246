Long-term outcome and prognostic indicators in the hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
 We examined 61 patients an average of 9.6 years (range 5 to 18 years) after an episode of childhood hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
 Twenty-four (39%) had one or more abnormalities.
 Seven (11%) had proteinuria and six (10%) had low creatinine clearance as solitary abnormalities.
 Eight (13%) had both proteinuria and reduced creatinine clearance; three (5%) had a combination of hypertension, proteinuria, and low creatinine clearance.
 Abnormalities sometimes appeared after an interval of apparent recovery.
 Logistic regression analysis showed that duration of anuria was the best predictor of disease at follow-up.
 No patients who had anuria lasting longer than 8 days or oliguria exceeding 15 days escaped chronic disease.
 However, 45% of those with disease had no anuria, and a third had no oliguria.
 Physicians should therefore be cautious in assuming recovery from HUS on the basis of a single evaluation and should periodically evaluate patients for an extended period.
