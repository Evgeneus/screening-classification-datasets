Suppressive effect of sulfate on the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats.
 The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of the sulfate ion on blood pressure in DOCA-salt hypertension, which involves increased sympathetic nervous activity.
 Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups, and received one of the following drinking solutions: distilled water [control], 171 mmol/L sodium chloride [NaCl group], 171 mmol/L sodium chloride plus 12 mmol/L magnesium sulfate [S(+) group], or 171 mmol/L sodium chloride plus 12 mmol/L magnesium chloride [S(-) group].
 In the S(+) group, the elevation of systolic blood pressure (SBP; mm Hg) was significantly attenuated (168 +/- 17 v 213 +/- 26, P less than .005) and intraerythrocyte calcium concentration (R-Ca; mumol/L cells) was significantly lower (11.5 +/- 3.0 v 17.4 +/- 6.5, P less than .05) than in the S(-) group.
 The cardiac norepinephrine content (H-NE; ng/100 g tissue) of the S(+) group was significantly lower than that of the S(-) group.
 SBP was correlated negatively with H-NE (r = -0.70, P less than .001) and positively with R-Ca (r = 0.45, P less than .005).
 R-Ca was negatively correlated with H-NE (r = -0.36, P less than .05).
 These results suggest that the replacement of chloride with sulfate ion suppresses the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats at least in part by its inhibitory effect on sympathetic nervous activity through the decreased intracellular calcium concentration.
