Coronary vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage as a cause of stunned myocardium. Case report.
 A patient with subarachnoid hemorrhage was found to have electrocardiographic abnormalities resembling an acute myocardial infarction as well as left ventriculographic findings of cardiac dysfunction.
 These cardiac abnormalities resolved following surgical clipping of the aneurysm and the patient recovered well from the operation.
 She died 2 months later from cancer and a postmortem examination at that time revealed no evidence of myocardial necrosis.
 In this report, the authors discuss coronary vasospasm and reversible postischemic "stunned myocardium," a condition that has not been considered previously in relation to subarachnoid hemorrhage.
