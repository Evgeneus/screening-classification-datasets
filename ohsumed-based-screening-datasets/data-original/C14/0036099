Rapid thrombus dissolution by continuous infusion of urokinase through an intracoronary perfusion wire prior to and following PTCA: results in native coronaries and patent saphenous vein grafts.
 Even with aspirin and heparin therapy, thrombus present prior to or forming after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) results in significant complications.
 We report on 33 patients who were treated with continuous infusion of Urokinase through an intracoronary perfusion wire for 24 hr because of visible intracoronary thrombus.
 Seventeen native vessels (9 pre-PTCA and 8 post-PTCA) and sixteen saphenous vein grafts (12 pre-PTCA and 4 post-PTCA) were treated.
 All vessels were patent at the time of perfusion wire placement.
 Complete thrombus resolution, successful PTCA and sustained patency was seen in 31 of 33 patients.
 One native vessel treated post PTCA (originally occluded) re-occluded.
 One saphenous vein graft treated prior to PTCA showed improvement in thrombus but distal embolization with balloon inflation occurred.
 No significant complications related to the intracoronary infusion technique were observed.
 In conclusion, rapid lysis of intra-coronary thrombus can be accomplish safely using this technique and can result in improved PTCA outcome.
