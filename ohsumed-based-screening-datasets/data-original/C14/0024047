Stress management in the treatment of mild primary hypertension.
 The use of simple relaxation-based stress management procedures in the treatment of mild primary hypertension has been the subject of extensive study.
 Stress management appears to lead to reliably greater reductions in pressure than a variety of control procedures.
 The mechanisms underlying these effects are obscure, and research has not identified which patients will benefit most from treatment.
 Preliminary data suggest that stress management may reduce the risk of coronary heart disease, but much research must be done if this is to be confirmed.
 It is suggested that such research should take into account the possibility that stress management may have beneficial effects on more than just hypertension-related aspects of the cardiovascular disease process.
