Dynamic exercise-induced elevation in plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with effort angina pectoris.
 We investigated the relationship between plasma atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) levels and hemodynamic indices during dynamic exercise testing in 15 patients with effort angina pectoris.
 Patients exercised on an angina-limited, supine, multistage bicycle ergometer, and plasma ANP levels and hemodynamic indices were measured at rest, at peak exercise, and 6 minutes after exercise.
 Plasma ANP levels increased significantly at peak exercise.
 Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) and coronary sinus blood flow (CSBF) were significantly correlated with plasma ANP levels before and at peak exercise (PAWP: r = 0.69, p less than 0.001; CSBF; r = 0.45, p less than 0.05).
 In six of eight patients whose PAWP exceeded 20 mm Hg at peak exercise, plasma ANP levels were increased at 6 minutes after exercise, whereas PAWP had decreased relative to the values obtained at peak exercise.
 Plasma ANP concentrations at 6 minutes after exercise were not correlated with PAWP at the same time.
 However, PAWP at peak exercise was correlated with the plasma ANP levels at 6 minutes after exercise (r = 0.80, p less than 0.001).
 These results suggest that in patients with effort angina pectoris left ventricular dysfunction resulting from exercise-induced myocardial ischemia may increase preload excessively and may contribute to the excess secretion of ANP after dynamic exercise.
