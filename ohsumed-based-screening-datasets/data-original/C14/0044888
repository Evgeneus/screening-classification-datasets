Acute postinfarction septal rupture: long-term results.
 From 1973 to 1989, 66 patients received early surgical repair for acute postinfarction ventricular septal rupture.
 Mean age was 64 +/- 7 years (range, 45 to 80 years).
 Ventricular septal rupture occurred soon after acute myocardial infarction (3.4 +/- 4 days), and the first medical treatment occurred 6.7 +/- 7 days after onset of acute myocardial infarction.
 Three patients had a previous myocardial infarction.
 The site of the rupture was anterior in 38 patients (57%) and posterior in 28 (43%).
 Forty-four patients (67%) were in shock at the time of admission.
 Intraaortic balloon pumping was used preoperatively in 28.
 Operation was performed at the time of maximal efficacy of medical treatment.
 The same technique was used in all cases.
 Associated procedures included coronary bypass grafting in 5 patients and valvar operation in 5.
 The patients have been carefully followed up for up to 16 years.
 Hospital mortality was 45% (30 patients) and was cardiac related or due to acute renal failure in 25 patients (83%).
 No correlation could be revealed between early death and age, sex, preoperative intraaortic balloon pumping, or year of operation.
 Location of the ventricular septal rupture (early mortality of 57% for posterior versus 37% for anterior ventricular septal rupture) and shock at the time of admission (52% versus 32%) showed a trend toward significance (0.08 less than or equal to p less than 0.10).
 Response to initial active therapy has a strong predictive value (mortality of 70% in unresponsive patients versus 14% in responders; p less than 0.001).
