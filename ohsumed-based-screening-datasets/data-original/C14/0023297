Atherosclerotic carotid disease and the eye.
 The evaluation and management of retinal ischemia from atherosclerotic carotid disease is in a state of flux reflected by the change from emphasizing surgical management in the '70s toward skepticism about the benefit of surgery in the '80s.
 In addition, reliable noninvasive diagnostic testing of the carotid artery has reduced the risk.
 The decision to consider surgical versus medical management must be made on an individual basis based on the patient's health, age, and the risk of angiography and surgery at each institution.
 In children and young adults, amaurosis fugax is a benign condition.
 In the older population amaurosis fugax is often the sentinel event of diffuse atherosclerotic disease and possible early death from myocardial infarction.
 A team including the neurologist, internist, ophthalmologist, and surgeon optimizes care of the whole disease and not just the symptom.
 It is hoped that information in the next decade will supply additional guidance in the care of this multifaceted malady.
