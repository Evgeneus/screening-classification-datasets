Sinus bradycardia related to temporomandibular joint surgery.
 The carotid artery lies in close relationship to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
 Manipulation of the mandible during TMJ surgery has been observed in several cases to be directly associated with the development of sinus bradycardia as the joint is distracted during arthrotomy and arthroplasty procedures.
 We report several cases and discuss differential diagnosis of sinus bradycardia associated with positional changes of the TMJ.
 This report emphasizes the importance to the surgeon and to the anesthesiologist of recognition of this cardiac phenomenon, mediated through the trigeminovagal reflex, to appropriately manage the patients during TMJ surgery.
