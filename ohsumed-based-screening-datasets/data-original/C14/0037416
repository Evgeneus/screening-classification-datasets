Coronary venous retroinfusion of deferoxamine reduces infarct size in pigs.
 The efficacy of coronary venous retroinfusion of the iron chelator deferoxamine was studied in 24 pentobarbital-anesthetized open chest pigs with a 60 min occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery followed by 3 h of reperfusion.
 Eight retrogradely treated pigs were given 10 mg/kg body weight of deferoxamine by way of the anterior interventricular vein and eight systemically treated pigs received the same doses of deferoxamine intravenously.
 Drug infusions lasted for 5 min, beginning 15 min before reperfusion.
 Eight control pigs received systemic intravenous saline solution.
 Myocardial area at risk and necrotic area were assessed by the monastral blue dye and the triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining method, respectively.
 There were no significant differences in hemodynamics or regional myocardial function (sonomicrometry) among the groups.
 Infarct size expressed as percent of risk area was 73.9 +/- 13.5% in the control group, 70.6 +/- 16.4% in the systemically treated group and 48.5 +/- 21.4% (p less than 0.05) in the retrogradely treated group.
 In conclusion, deferoxamine significantly reduced infarct size after coronary occlusion only when given regionally by way of the coronary vein.
 Because there was no significant hemodynamic effect caused by deferoxamine infusion, it is suggested that this drug prevents postischemic reperfusion injury by a direct cardioprotective effect.
