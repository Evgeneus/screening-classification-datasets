Report of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society's consensus conference on the Management of the Postmyocardial Infarction Patient.
 In October 1989, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society announced a program to achieve consensus on important issues in the care of patients with cardiovascular disease.
 This report on the management of the postmyocardial infarction patient represents the first in a series of these consensus conferences.
 The process for establishing consensus recommendations involved several steps.
 A primary panel of 11 experts from various fields was selected to review the available clinical evidence and to make a list of recommendations about management decisions in the postmyocardial infarction period.
 The initial report was distributed to a secondary panel of 16 reviewers* representing allied health care constituencies from across Canada.
 On the basis of the critical reviews and feedback from these reviewers, a revised report was distributed to all members (over 800) of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society for further review and feedback.
 This iterative approach resulted in a penultimate report that was presented at a plenary session of the annual scientific meeting of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society on Oct.
 18, 1990, in Halifax, NS.
 On the basis of discussion and feedback from this symposium, the consensus review was completed.
