Jets over Labrador and Quebec: noise effects on human health.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the noise from low-level flights over Labrador and Quebec is harmful to human health.
 DATA SOURCE AND SELECTION: Search of MEDLINE for articles on the effect of noise, particularly impulse noise associated with low-level flights, and a search of the references from identified articles.
 DATA SYNTHESIS: The noise levels from low-level flights could affect hearing acuity.
 However, the more important consequences appear to be stress-mediated physiologic effects, especially cardiovascular ones, and psychologic distress, particularly in children.
 Subjective perception of control over the noise has been found to mitigate some physiologic effects.
 CONCLUSION: There is sufficient evidence to show that the noise from low-level flights is harmful to human health.
