Heart disease in Asians and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans.
 Heart disease is the leading cause of death for Asian-Americans and Pacific-Islanders, Hispanic-Americans, and Native Americans.
 Generally, heart disease death rates are lower in these population groups than in Caucasians, with the notable exception of Native Americans under the age of 35.
 Of particular interest are data for southwestern US Native Americans and Mexican-Americans, which indicate low CHD prevalence rates despite high rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus, increasing hypertension, and low socioeconomic status.
 Much more research is needed to explain these and other observations.
 Intervention in those risk factors already identified is necessary, particularly in prevention of obesity and diabetes.
