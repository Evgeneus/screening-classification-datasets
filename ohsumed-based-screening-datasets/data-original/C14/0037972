Monosialoganglioside in subarachnoid hemorrhage [published erratum appears in Stroke 1991 Jul;22(7):957]
 We studied 119 patients with disturbance of consciousness following subarachnoid hemorrhage, due mostly to verified aneurysm rupture, admitted to five Italian neurosurgical departments over 18 months.
 Level of consciousness as assessed by score on the Glasgow coma Scale ranged from 8 to 14 before the beginning of treatment; level of consciousness was assessed again 7, 14, and 21 days later.
 Patients were randomly allocated to treatment with monosialoganglioside or placebo according to a double-blind experimental design.
 The two treatment groups were homogeneous at entry with regard to the main clinical parameters.
 Both groups improved, but the rate and degree of improvement were greater in the monosialoganglioside-treated group.
 The difference was significant on days 14 (p = 0.04) and 21 (p = 0.02).
 Our results seem to confirm the hypothesis that monosialoganglioside reduces brain edema and provides nonspecific neuronal membrane protection.
