Arterial switch procedure in an adult.
 The arterial switch procedure has been shown to offer both anatomic and physiologic correction in infants and children with transposition of the great arteries and ventricular septal defect.
 We believe that adults may also benefit in some circumstances, as evidenced by the case of a 22-year-old man who underwent successful operation after having initially undergone pulmonary artery banding for transposition with ventricular septal defect in 1967 when he was 5 months of age.
