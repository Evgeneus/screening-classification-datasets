Transient corneal opacification induced by cold in Raynaud's disease.
 A 48-year-old man presented with longstanding complaints of transient blurring of vision on exposure to cold temperatures.
 A review of family history was noteworthy in that two of the patient's four sons and the patient's brother had similar complaints.
 All affected individuals had Raynaud's disease.
 Results of ophthalmic evaluation showed transient corneal opacities.
 Slit-lamp video photography under cold stress demonstrated conjunctival vascular changes consistent with Raynaud's phenomenon.
 An extensive work-up for systemic disease was otherwise negative.
 To the best of the authors' knowledge, anterior segment changes have not been described previously in idiopathic Raynaud's disease.
