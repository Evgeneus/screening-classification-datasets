Disseminated Conidiobolus infection with endocarditis in a cocaine abuser.
 A crack cocaine abuser developed disseminated infection caused by a species of Conidiobolus not known to cause disease in vertebrates.
 The fungus gained entry via skin abrasions on the lower extremities, spread through the hematogenous route, and caused endocarditis.
 There was evidence of fungal infection in the lungs, heart, kidneys, skeletal muscles, and brain.
 An additional complication was extensive rhabdomyolysis, with a marked elevation of creatine kinase of up to 1.2 million U/L.
