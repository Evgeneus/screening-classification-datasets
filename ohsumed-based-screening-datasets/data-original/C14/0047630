Comparison of celiprolol and propranolol in stable angina pectoris. Celiprolol International Angina Study Group.
 The comparative antianginal effects and safety of propranolol and celiprolol, a highly beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blocker with selective partial beta 2-adrenoceptor agonist activity, were assessed in an international multicenter, placebo run-in, active control, double-blind, randomized, titration-to-effect study of 140 patients with stable, exercise-induced angina pectoris.
 At baseline, all patients received placebo for 2 weeks, then titrated doses of once-daily celiprolol (200, 400, 600 mg) or twice-daily propranolol (total daily dose 80, 160, 320 mg) over 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week maintenance period.
 Heart rate and blood pressure, at rest and with exercise, weekly anginal attack frequency, nitroglycerin consumption and symptom-limited treadmill exercise times (modified Bruce protocol) were assessed.
 Compared with their respective baselines, both celiprolol and propranolol reduced anginal attack and nitroglycerin consumption rates to a comparable degree, while improving exercise tolerance (p less than 0.05).
 Treatment with propranolol compared with celiprolol, however, was associated with a significantly lower heart rate at rest (p less than 0.01).
 The double-product at the conclusion of exercise testing was significantly reduced by both drugs.
 Celiprolol and propranolol had similar effects on blood pressure, and were well tolerated.
 More symptomatic bradycardia occurred with propranolol.
 Despite the differences in their hemodynamic actions, once-daily celiprolol is as effective as twice-daily propranolol in the treatment of patients with stable angina pectoris.
