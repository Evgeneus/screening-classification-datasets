Pediatric heart transplantation for congenital heart disease and cardiomyopathy.
 Orthotopic heart transplantation has become an accepted therapy for adult patients with end-stage heart disease.
 In newborns and infants, this procedure is still controversial because of the unknown long-term results and the lack of donor organs.
 Since March 1988, we have performed orthotopic heart transplantation in 11 infants and children with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 6), cardiomyopathy (n = 4), or congenital endocardial fibroelastosis (n = 1).
 The smallest infant was 3 days old and weighed 2,650 g.
 Four of 15 potential donors had to be refused for various medical reasons, and 4 were transferred to our hospital for organ retrieval.
 Seven hearts were procured remotely.
 We accepted weight mismatches up to 105% between donor and recipient.
 There were three perioperative deaths, two in patients 5 and 17 days old with hypoplastic left heart syndrome and 1 in a 2-year-old patient with a dilated cardiomyopathy.
 All 3 patients had drug-resistant right heart failure.
 A 2-year-old girl with a dilated cardiomyopathy died 2 months after transplantation owing to severe pulmonary embolism originating from the superior vena cava.
 The remaining 7 patients are alive and well between 1 month and 31 months after transplantation.
 Angiographic follow-up has not revealed signs of graft atherosclerosis at 2 years.
