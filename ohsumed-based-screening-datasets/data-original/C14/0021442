Dipyridamole technetium-99m-2-methoxy isobutyl isonitrile tomoscintigraphic imaging for identifying diseased coronary vessels: comparison with thallium-201 stress-rest study.
 A same-day double injection protocol employing 99mTc-methoxyisobutyl isonitrile (MIBI) and myocardial single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detecting coronary artery disease (CAD) was assessed in 30 patients.
 SPECT was performed 1 hr after a first injection (250 MBq) of 99mTc-MIBI, given after 0.56 mg/kg dipyridamole (DPD) infusion.
 Patients were then reinjected at rest (750 MBq) and were reimaged 1 hr later.
 Within 1 wk, all patients underwent a complete stress-rest SPECT thallium study.
 Of the 330 myocardial segments evaluated, 25 were judged ischemic by both techniques, while persistent defects were demonstrated in 50 and in 47 with 99mTc-MIBI and 201TI, respectively.
 Six regions were considered for diseased vessels identification.
 Sensitivity and specificity for CAD were 100% and 75%, respectively, for both 201TI and 99mTc-MIBI.
 Sensitivity for identification of diseased vessels by 201TI was 68% for LAD, 89% for RCA, and 80% for LCX as opposed to 75%, 89% and 80%, respectively, by 99mTc-MIBI.
 Specificity was 93% in both cases for LAD, 73% and 63% for RCA, and 53% and 46% for LCX.
