Clinical utility of transesophageal echocardiography.
 Routine transthoracic echocardiography fails to generate images of diagnostic quality in a significant number of patients who are obese, uncooperative, or unable to be properly positioned (eg, patients receiving ventilatory assistance), and in those with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chest wall deformities, or recent thoracic surgical procedures.
 In addition, posterior structures in the heart such as the left atrium, left atrial appendage, atrial septum, and mitral valve are seen with poorer resolution than structures closer to the anterior chest wall.
 Placement of a sonographic transducer in the esophagus immediately behind the heart circumvents these limitations.
 Newly developed probes are well tolerated by sedated conscious patients as well as by patients receiving ventilatory assistance in the intensive care unit and those under general anesthesia.
 Consequently, transesophageal echocardiography is now available for further enhancement of cardiac diagnosis in outpatients, for evaluating the hemodynamic status of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit, for intraoperative assessment of cardiac repairs, and for intraoperative cardiac monitoring in noncardiac surgical procedures.
 A series of case examples from our practice during a recent 1-year period illustrates the clinical utility of this technique in these settings.
