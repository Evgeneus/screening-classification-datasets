Patient selection for mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.
 Between 7/87 and 9/90 thirty-four patients underwent total artificial heart (Berlin Heart) (n = 2) or biventricular assist device (Berlin Heart) (n = 32) implantation as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.
 The time of mechanical support ranged from 2 to 60 days, for a mean of 19.2 days.
 Twenty-three patients received heart transplants, with 74% 30-day survival and 52% long-term survival.
 Implantation of a mechanical support system became indicated in those patients whose hemodynamic and clinical condition deteriorated despite treatment with enoximone in addition to maximal sympathomimetic medication.
 The strategy to administer enoximone routinely was the result of a prospective study on 24 pretransplant patients in whom enoximone therapy reduced the need for mechanical assistance by 62%.
 At the time of device implantation shock-related organ impairment such as cerebral, renal, hepatic, and respiratory dysfunction was present in 62% of patients.
 In addition, 7 patients had pneumonia.
 During mechanical support complete recovery of end-organ failure and resolution of pneumonia was observed in the majority of patients.
 The results indicate that end-organ dysfunction per se should not be considered a contraindication to mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.
 However, further clinical investigations are needed to identify predictive indicators of irreversible organ damage.
