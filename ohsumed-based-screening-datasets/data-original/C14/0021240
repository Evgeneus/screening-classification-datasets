Lung injury in a surfactant-deficient lung is modified by indomethacin.
 Repetitive total lung lavage in adult rabbits leads to a reproducible severe surfactant-deficient lung injury.
 Hypoxemia requiring mechanical ventilation occurs, accompanied by a substantial pulmonary hypertension, a large intra-alveolar protein leak, peripheral neutropenia, and pathological features of marked neutrophil infiltration with extensive hyaline membrane formation.
 Pretreatment with indomethacin abolishes postlavage pulmonary hypertension, preserves a slightly better lung function with higher arterial PO2, and prevents the postlavage peripheral neutropenia found in untreated animals.
 Pretreatment with a thromboxane A2 receptor blocker (L 655,240, Merck Frosst, Canada) also completely attenuated pulmonary hypertension, providing evidence that thromboxane A2 mediates pulmonary arterial hypertension after lung lavage.
 However, specific thromboxane receptor blockade had no other long-lasting beneficial effects on the ongoing injury in this model.
