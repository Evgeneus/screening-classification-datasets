Indications and limitations of aortic valve reconstruction.
 To elucidate the value of conservative operation for aortic regurgitation, all consecutive patients operated on between July 1988 and July 1990 were reviewed.
 Of 251 patients with aortic regurgitation, 107 (42.6%) had nonprosthetic operation.
 The mean age was 23 years, and 90 patients (84.1%) were rheumatic.
 Two techniques were used: repair (annular and leaflet plasties, 69 cases) and cusp extension with glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium (25 bovine, 13 autologous).
 There were two hospital deaths (1.8%), both in the repair group, and no late deaths or embolic events.
 Only 5 patients (4.7%) were anticoagulated.
 In the repair group there were 12 reoperations, four (5.9%) due to aortic and eight to mitral dysfunction.
 In the cusp extension group there were two reoperations due to mitral dysfunction.
 Echocardiographic follow-up showed better results with cusp extension.
 In conclusion, conservative operation for aortic regurgitation is possible in a high percentage of young rheumatic patients and does not require anticoagulation.
 Cusp extension is more reliable than repair in terms of early results, although its long-term durability is not yet known.
