Hemodynamic and neurohormonal effects of quinidine in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction secondary to coronary artery disease or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy.
 Quinidine causes vasodilation directly and by inhibition of adrenergic vasoconstriction, but it also exerts negative inotropic activity.
 Although this drug is often administered to patients with severe congestive heart failure, the net consequences of these opposing actions have not been evaluated in such patients.
 The hemodynamic and neurohormonal response to oral quinidine (600 mg) in 19 patients with severe chronic heart failure was therefore determined.
 Vasodilation was the predominant effect of quinidine, with reductions in mean arterial, left ventricular filling and right atrial pressures of -9% (confidence interval [CI] -5 to -13), -8% (CI -19 to 3), -15% (CI -26 to -4), respectively.
 The quinidine-induced vasodilation increased plasma norepinephrine and epinephrine concentrations by 44% (CI +17 to +72) and 47% (CI +2 to +91), respectively.
 No change in cardiac performance was noted, with the cardiac index slightly increased (+10%, CI +2 to +17) and stroke work index unchanged (0%, CI -11 to +11) after quinidine.
 Although the mean serum quinidine concentration was within the therapeutic range or lower in all patients, the serum quinidine concentration and the change in mean arterial pressure did correlate (r2 = 0.64).
 In conclusion, vasodilation is the predominant hemodynamic effect of oral quinidine in patients with congestive heart failure.
 However, potential adverse effects may be caused by consequent neurohormonal activation.
