Usefulness of weightlifting training in improving strength and maximal power output in coronary artery disease.
 The effects of 10 weeks (20 sessions) of combined weightlifting and aerobic training (n = 10) were compared with the effects of aerobic training alone (n = 8) on indexes of strength and aerobic exercise capacity in 18 men with coronary artery disease (CAD).
 Initial test performance was similar between groups.
 After aerobic training, the maximal load that could be lifted once only (1-repetition maximum) in single-arm curl, single-leg press and single-knee extension exercises increased by 13% (11.8 to 13.3 kg; p less than 0.01), 4% (97.0 to 101.0 kg; difference not significant) and 5% (28.2 to 29.7 kg; difference not significant), respectively; corresponding gains with combined weightlifting and aerobic training were 43% (12.2 to 17.4 kg; p less than 0.01), 21% (99.0 to 120.0 kg; p less than 0.01) and 24% (29.0 to 36.0 kg; p less than 0.01).
 After aerobic training, the initial 1-repetition maximum could be lifted an average of 4 times, compared with 14 times after combined training.
 Maximal progressive incremental cycle ergometer power output increased by 2% in the aerobic control group (1,088 to 1,113 kpm/min; difference not significant) and by 15% (1,030 to 1,180 kpm/min; p less than 0.05) in the experimental group.
 Cycling time at 80% of initial maximal power before attaining a Borg (0 to 10) rating of perceived exertion of 7 (very severe) increased by 11% (604 to 672 seconds; difference not significant) and by 109% (541 to 1,128 seconds; p less than 0.05) in the control and weight-trained patients, respectively.
