Penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with dissecting hematoma: control of bleeding with percutaneous embolization.
 A case is presented in which left subpleural hematoma and hemothorax resulted from a penetrating atherosclerotic aortic ulcer with an aortic pseudoaneurysm and intramedial hematoma.
 Percutaneous transfemoral embolization of the ulcer with use of coils and thrombin resulted in stabilization of the patient's hemodynamic status.
 The patient died 6 days later of pneumonia.
 In certain clinical situations, treatment of bleeding from penetrating aortic ulcers with percutaneous embolization may stabilize the patient's condition, allowing elective surgical intervention.
