Predictors of physical functioning after a cardiac event.
 An increased understanding of the factors that promote or hinder patients' return to optimal activity levels after a cardiac event is necessary to help them achieve this goal.
 Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to examine psychologic resources, depression, physical recovery, and illness severity for their relationships with subjective and objective physical functioning (exercise data).
 A correlational survey design was used to assess patients' (n = 46) illness responses 9 weeks after the cardiac event.
 Patients also participated in a symptom-limited exercise test.
 The findings suggested that the individual's return to greater activity levels after a cardiac illness was associated with less depression and illness severity, and higher levels of objective physical functioning, physical recovery, and self-esteem.
 Further, patients' objective physical functioning was associated not only with greater subjective physical functioning but also with greater levels of physical recovery and mastery.
