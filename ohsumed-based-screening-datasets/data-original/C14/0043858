Effects of early captopril administration on infarct expansion, left ventricular remodeling and exercise capacity after acute myocardial infarction.
 In a double-blind study, 99 patients (82 men, age range 40 to 75 years) with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were randomly assigned to receive captopril or placebo.
 Treatment began within 24 hours of admission.
 Serial echocardiographic measurements of endocardial segment lengths and left ventricular (LV) volumes, and ejection fractions were obtained.
 The 2 groups were matched at baseline except for an excess of previous AMI in the placebo group (13 of 50 vs 2 of 49 patients, p = 0.002).
 The increase in anterior segment length, from baseline to 2 months, was significantly less in the captopril than in the placebo group (2.8 +/- 1.6 vs 10.4 +/- 2.4mm, 95% confidence interval [CI] -13.5 to -1.7, p = 0.01).
 The increase in posterior segment length was also less in the captopril group, but the difference was not significant (3.2 +/- 1.2 vs 7.0 +/- 1.8mm, 95% CI -8.0 to 0.5, p = 0.08).
 Fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated increases in segment length greater than 2 standard deviations of the measurement error (14 of 70 [20%] vs 29 of 72 [40%] patients, p = 0.009).
 In patients with anterior AMI, the infarct-containing anterior segment length increased by 4.5 +/- 2.3 mm in the captopril versus 12.4 +/- 3.1 mm in the placebo group (95% CI -15.7 to -0.2, p = 0.046), and fewer patients in the captopril group demonstrated infarct expansion (6 of 20 [30%] vs 13 of 21 [62%] patients, p = 0.04).
