Vascular abnormalities in epidermal nevus syndrome.
 We report a patient with epidermal nevus syndrome and right hemispheric infarct and review 3 others with neurologic manifestations best explained by ischemia or hemorrhage.
 Each had a significant vascular abnormality such as occlusion or blood vessel dysplasia.
 None had hemimegalencephaly.
 We hypothesize that underlying vascular dysplasia is the cause of the neurologic lesions in these patients.
