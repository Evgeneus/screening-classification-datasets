Role of angioplasty in myocardial infarction management strategies: a review.
 The role of angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction has been extensively studied in the past few years.
 Although angioplasty in some circumstances can be the primary reperfusion intervention, logistic problems and the excellent results of intravenous thrombolytic therapy have resulted in postlytic angioplasty being the preferred use of this interventional strategy.
 Clinical trials of this strategy have not supported its routine use, however, and a much more selective application of postthrombolytic coronary artery dilation is advocated at this time.
