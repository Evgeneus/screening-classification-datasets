Ventricular dysfunction does occur during liver transplantation.
 Ventricular dysfunction, then, does indeed occur during liver transplantation, particularly at the time of reperfusion.
 Pulmonary embolism contributes to right ventricular and right atrial encroachment on left-heart filling, and paradoxical embolism may occur.
 Pericardial effusions, tricuspid regurgitation, hypothermia, and the release of substances, particularly potassium from the donor liver, may further contribute to compromises in ventricular function.
 Proper monitoring and appropriate treatment, however, lead to successful operative outcomes in most cases.
