Enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improves cardiac function in hypoxic rabbit ventricle without increasing total glycolytic flux.
 The effects of elevated glucose on cardiac function during hypoxia were investigated in isolated arterially perfused rabbit interventricular septa.
 Rest tension, developed tension, intracellular potential, 42K+ efflux, lactate production, exogenous glucose utilization, and tissue high-energy phosphate levels were measured during a 50-min period of hypoxia with 4, 5, or 50 mM glucose present (isosmotically balanced with sucrose) and during reoxygenation for 60 min with perfusate containing 5 mM glucose/45 mM sucrose.
 At physiologic (4 or 5 mM) and supraphysiologic glucose (50 mM), lactate production and high-energy phosphate levels during hypoxia were equally well maintained, yet cardiac dysfunction was markedly attenuated by 50 mM glucose.
 Despite identical rates of total glycolytic flux, exogenous glucose utilization was enhanced by 50 mM glucose so that tissue glycogen levels remained normal during hypoxia, whereas glycogen became depleted with 4 or 5 mM glucose present during hypoxia.
 Most of the beneficial effects of 50 mM glucose occurred during the first 25 min of hypoxia.
 Prior glycogen depletion had no deleterious effects during hypoxia with 50 mM glucose present, but exacerbated cardiac dysfunction during hypoxia with 5 mM glucose present.
 These findings indicate that enhanced utilization of exogenous glucose improved cardiac function during hypoxia without increasing total glycolytic flux or tissue high-energy phosphate levels, suggesting a novel cardioprotective mechanism.
