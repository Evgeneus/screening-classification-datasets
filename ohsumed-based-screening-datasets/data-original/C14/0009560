Hemopump support for the failing heart.
 Under fluoroscopy, the hemopump is passed through the aortic valve into the left ventricle through a Gortex (WF Gore, Denver, CO) chimney sewn to a surgically exposed femoral artery.
 The system aspirates the left ventricular blood and actively pumps it into the aorta.
 Five patients (four men, one woman), aged 47-71 years (mean, 62 years), were candidates for hemopump support because of refractory cardiogenic shock.
 Three were recovering from repeated coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, and two required postoperative emergency CABG for failed percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
 One patient died during insertion, and four had the hemo-pump successfully placed.
 All patients had low cardiac out-put and had intraaortic balloons in place.
 Average insertion time took 20 min, with maintenance on the hemopump for an average of 13 hr.
 One patient was maintained on the hemopump for 12 hr, but because of continued deterioration, was placed on a total artificial heart (Harvik 7-70).
 Patients 3 (hemopump inserted transthoracically) and 4 had the hemopump discontinued because of brain death, and the fifth survived.
 This patient is alive and working 1 yr later.
 The hemopump is an effective left ventricular support system that is less invasive than conventional transthoracic systems.
