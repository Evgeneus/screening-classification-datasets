Myocardial infarct size reduction by the synergistic effect of hyperbaric oxygen and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator.
 Fasting mongrel dogs underwent hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT), recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) treatment, and simultaneous HBOT and rt-PA treatment following prior experimental left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion for 2 hours.
 Thrombosis in and around a copper coil was recorded angiographically at regular intervals, and immediately prior to treatment conclusion.
 Controls (n = 10) were untreated.
 Group two animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with 90 minutes of HBOT at 2 atm absolute.
 Group three animals (n = 8) were treated additionally with 50 mg rt-PA over 90 minutes.
 Group four animals (n = 10) were treated additionally with simultaneous HBOT and rt-PA over 90 minutes.
 Myocardial injury was determined by a combination of triphenyltetrazolium chloride histochemical staining and by formazan dye extraction.
 Damage was measured as a percent of left ventricular cross-sectional area studied.
 HBOT alone restored 35.9% of oxidative enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001).
 Treatment with rt-PA alone restored 48.9% of enzyme activity (p greater than 0.001).
 The combination of HBOT and simultaneous rt-PA resulted in 96.9% restoration of oxidative enzyme activity versus the control group (p greater than 0.001).
