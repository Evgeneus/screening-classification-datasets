The safety and efficacy of terazosin in the treatment of essential hypertension in blacks.
 Terazosin, a new selective alpha 1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, has been found to be an effective antihypertensive agent.
 In a series of studies, the safety and efficacy of terazosin, alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, were evaluated in 1180 black patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension.
 Terazosin was effective in lowering blood pressure when administered alone (in dosages of 1 to 80 mg/day) and when prescribed (in dosages of 1 to 20 mg/day) in combination with other antihypertensive agents.
 In elderly black patients, terazosin, 1 to 10 mg daily, was as effective in lowering blood pressure as propranolol (40 to 120 mg twice daily).
 Changes (mean +/- SE) in sitting diastolic blood pressure from baseline were -8.1 +/- 1.4 mm Hg for terazosin and -5.0 +/- 1.5 mm Hg for propranolol.
 Terazosin (5 mg) combined with methyclothiazide (2.5 to 5 mg) produced a significantly greater (p less than 0.01) antihypertensive effect than that of terazosin alone.
 Changes (mean +/- SE) in standing diastolic blood pressure from baseline were -7.9 +/- 2.0 mm Hg for terazosin alone, -15.1 +/- 2.1 mm Hg for terazosin plus 2.5 mg of methyclothiazide, and -15.0 +/- 2.0 mm Hg for terazosin plus 5 mg of methyclothiazide.
 Terazosin had a favorable effect on serum lipid levels and appeared to compensate for the negative lipid effects associated with diuretics and beta-blockers when used in combination with these agents.
 Terazosin, alone and combined with other antihypertensive agents, was well tolerated with minimal side effects in black hypertensive patients.
