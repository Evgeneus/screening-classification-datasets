Sodium-lithium countertransport and cardiorenal abnormalities in essential hypertension.
 The rate of red blood cell sodium-lithium countertransport is elevated only in a subgroup of patients with essential hypertension.
 We have therefore compared renal and cardiac function and morphology in two groups of hypertensive patients with high (n = 23) or normal (n = 22) sodium-lithium countertransport (mean +/- SEM: 0.61 +/- 0.10 versus 0.29 +/- 0.07 mmol/l red blood cells.hr).
 The two groups were similar in age, sex distribution, body mass index, smoking habit, duration of hypertension, and actual levels of untreated blood pressure.
 Hypertensive patients with elevated sodium-lithium countertransport activity showed elevated glomerular filtration rate (118 +/- 2 versus 109 +/- 2 ml/min.1.73 m2; p less than 0.001), albumin excretion rate (23 +/- 3 versus 14 +/- 2 micrograms/min; p less than 0.001), larger kidney volume (250 +/- 15 versus 203 +/- 13 ml.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01), lower lithium clearance rate (26.7 +/- 0.3 versus 28.9 +/- 0.3 ml/min.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01), and higher total body exchangeable sodium (2,716 +/- 33 versus 2,485 +/- 41 mmol.1.73 m2; p less than 0.01).
 Left ventricular mass index (139 +/- 6 versus 119 +/- 6 g/m2; p less than 0.05), relative wall thickness (0.39 +/- 0.05 versus 0.29 +/- 0.04 cm; p less than 0.001), and left posterior wall plus intraventricular septum thickness (2.02 +/- 0.04 versus 1.76 +/- 0.03 cm; p less than 0.05) were also higher in patients with high sodium-lithium countertransport.
 Hypertensive patients with normal sodium-lithium countertransport had renal and cardiac parameters similar to those of a normotensive control group (n = 21) except for a higher glomerular filtration rate and left ventricular mass index.
