Vasculitis as a paraneoplastic syndrome. Report of 11 cases and review of the literature.
 In a study of 222 patients with vasculitis, we identified 11 who had an associated neoplasia.
 Seven had hematological neoplasia and 4 had solid malignant tumors.
 In 4 patients vasculitis gave the first evidence of the neoplasia or of its recurrence.
 Nine of our patients had cutaneous vasculitis.
 The other 2 had vasculitis involving the intestine and resulted in acute abdomens.
 These 2 patients needed prednisone treatment for the vasculitis.
 Neoplasia should be considered in patients with vasculitis without an apparent cause.
