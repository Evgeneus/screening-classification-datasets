The role of peripheral capacitance and resistance vessels in hypotension following hemodialysis.
 The arterial pressure (AP) response to hemodialysis was studied with echocardiography and strain gauge plethysmography in 17 patients with end-stage renal disease; mean AP was unchanged in seven (group A) and was reduced by more than 10 mm Hg in 10 patients (group B).
 Following dialysis, body weight decreased and heart rate increased equally in both groups.
 Ejection fraction did not change in the two groups.
 Left ventricular end-diastolic volume fell by 13 +/- 10% in group A and by 24 +/- 16% in group B.
 Cardiac index (CI) fell in group B, but remained unchanged in group A.
 Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) did not change in both groups.
 The change in mean AP before and after dialysis was significantly correlated with that in Cl (r = 0.49, p less than 0.05), but not with that in SVR.
 Calf venous pressure-volume curves were not different between the two groups before dialysis.
 Hemodialysis shifted the curve toward the volume axis for group B but not for group A.
 These results suggest that hypotension following dialysis is mainly due to the fall in cardiac output, in which increases in venous distensibility play an important role.
