Comparison of the results of electrophysiologic testing after short-term and long-term treatment with amiodarone in patients with ventricular tachycardia.
 The results of electrophysiologic testing after short-term and long-term treatment with amiodarone were compared in 71 patients with ventricular tachycardia.
 Electrophysiologic testing was performed in the baseline state after 11 +/- 3 days of treatment with 1.2 to 2.4 gm/day of amiodarone, and after 13 +/- 4 weeks of therapy with a daily amiodarone dose of 400 mg.
 After short-term therapy, 62% of the patients had an adequate response to amiodarone.
 In 27 patients who were hemodynamically unstable, ventricular tachycardia was induced and became noninducible or hemodynamically stable after combination therapy with a class I agent.
 Among 18 patients who did not have inducible ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy, eight (44%) had inducible, hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after long-term treatment with amiodarone.
 On the other hand, six of the 27 patients who had hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia after short-term therapy had an adequate response after long-term treatment with amiodarone.
 Therefore an adequate electrophysiologic response after short-term therapy does not guarantee a similar response after long-term treatment, and an inadequate response after short-term therapy does not always predict a similar response after long-term therapy.
