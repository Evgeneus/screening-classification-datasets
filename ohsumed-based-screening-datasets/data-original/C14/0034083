Role of endogenous endothelin in the development of hypertension in rats.
 To further elucidate the pathophysiologic role of endogenous endothelin (ET), we have studied the chronic effect of anti-ET gamma-globulin on the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and stroke prone SHR (SHR-SP) for three weeks.
 In neither SHR nor SHR-SP did repetitive bolus injection of anti-ET gamma-globulin suppress the rise in blood pressure.
 The present data suggest that endogenous ET is not likely to play a key role in the development of hypertension, although ET may induce a local vasoconstriction at the injured vascular wall.
