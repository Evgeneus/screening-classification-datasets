Right- and left-arm blood pressure discrepancies in vascular surgery patients.
 To identify a relationship between atherosclerotic vascular disease and differences in blood pressure between the right and left arms, blood pressure differences between arms were measured in patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD, n = 58), in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD, n = 38), and in patients with no evidence of atherosclerotic disease, who served as a control group (n = 38).
 The incidence and magnitude of right and left arm pressure difference determined by the oscillometric technique were compared between the patient groups.
 The incidence of systolic pressure difference greater than or equal to 20 mmHg between arms in patients with PVD (21%) was greater than that in either those with CAD (3%) (P less than or equal to 0.05) or control subjects (0%) (P less than 0.01).
 The incidence of systolic pressure difference greater than or equal to 45 mmHg between arms in patients with PVD (10%) was greater than that in either those with CAD (0%) (P less than 0.05) or control subjects (0%) (P less than 0.05).
 Patients with PVD also had a greater incidence of right and left arm difference than did those with CAD or controls for mean and diastolic blood pressures.
 Of all patients with a systolic difference greater than 10 mmHg, neither the right nor the left arm blood pressure was consistently higher: 21 of 35 (60%) had a higher pressure in the right arm, and 14 of 35 (40%) had a higher pressure in the left arm (P = 0.33).
 Gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and age were not associated with a difference in blood pressure between the right and left arms.
