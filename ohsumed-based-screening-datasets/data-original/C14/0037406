Predictive accuracy of electrophysiologic localization of accessory pathways.
 Operative ablation of accessory pathways depends critically on preoperative localization when technical limitations preclude complete intraoperative mapping.
 To assess the accuracy of localization, 345 patients undergoing operative ablation were studied; 316 (91.6%) had a single accessory pathway and 29 (8.4%) had multiple accessory pathways.
 The electrophysiologic study was diagnostically complete and accurate in 294 patients (93%) with a single accessory pathway and 19 (61%) with multiple accessory pathways.
 A left lateral accessory pathway was most accurately localized with excellent sensitivity (99%) and positive predictive value (98.5%).
 Diagnostic errors occurred in 33 patients because of 1) incorrect localization (n = 16), 2) failure to detect a second pathway (n = 9), and 3) diagnosis of a second pathway not verified intraoperatively (n = 8).
 Multiple pathways were more prevalent in the group with errors (33.3% vs.
 5.8%, p = 0.0001), as were unidirectional pathways (48.5% vs.
 24.3%, p = 0.003).
 It is concluded that preoperative localization of accessory pathways is sufficiently accurate to allow intraoperative mapping to be brief and focused.
