Budd-Chiari syndrome in association with Behcet's disease.
 Budd-Chiari syndrome developed in 3 patients with preexisting Behcet's disease.
 Benign intracranial hypertension was the chief presenting complaint in one patient, who later suffered extensive inferior vena caval and hepatic vein thrombosis, with manifestations of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
 She did not respond to treatment and subsequently died of hepatic coma.
 In the other 2 patients, Budd-Chiari syndrome was confirmed by liver biopsy.
 Both patients made a good recovery and remain well at the time of this report.
