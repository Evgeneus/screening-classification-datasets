Hypertension as an unusual feature in an outbreak of tetrodotoxin poisoning.
 We report an outbreak of tetrodotoxin poisoning resulting from consumption of ovaries of an unidentified species of fish.
 Thirty victims manifested the typical neurologic symptoms of tetrodotoxin poisoning.
 Although hypotension is the classically described blood pressure reaction, eight individuals developed hypertension (average blood pressure 192/110 mm Hg); one died of acute pulmonary edema.
 Semi-quantitative tetrodotoxin bioassay of two uneaten ovaries revealed tetrodotoxin concentrations of 54 Mouse Units/gm and 287 Mouse Units/gm, respectively.
 To gain insight into the unusual phenomenon of hypertension observed in our outbreak, we interviewed the victims, performed a funduscopic exam for hypertensive retinopathy and checked their blood pressure periodically in the ensuing year.
 Mild hypertension evidenced by retinopathy and elevated blood pressure was found in all seven who manifested hypertension during the acute event and survived.
 We postulate that individuals with pre-existing hypertension responded to the relatively small doses of tetrodotoxin with a dramatic rise in blood pressure.
 This resulted in the fatal outcome for one individual with severe coronary artery disease.
 Hypertension should be recognized as a possible feature of tetrodotoxin poisoning, especially in predisposed individuals.
