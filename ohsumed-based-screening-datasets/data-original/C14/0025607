Simulation of compartment syndrome by rupture of the deep femoral artery from blunt trauma.
 Life-threatening hemorrhage of the femoral vasculature from a blunt injury to the thigh without femoral fracture has not been emphasized in the medical literature.
 Two cases of massive hemorrhage from the deep femoral system resulted from blunt injury to the thigh without femoral fracture.
 In the first case, a diagnosis of compartment syndrome was based on muscle swelling from the blunt trauma.
 A fasciotomy uncovered life-threatening bleeding.
 In the second case, which had a similar history and clinical symptoms, a vascular injury was suspected and an arteriogram was done.
 Disruption of the deep femoral arterial system was detected, and fluoroscopic embolization controlled the bleeding.
 A routine fasciotomy was then done.
 Both patients appeared clinically to have a thigh compartment syndrome, presumably based on injury from the crushed muscle.
 They both had normal arterial pulsations distal to the injured thigh.
 The only feature that suggested a vascular injury was a need for transfusion for hemodynamic support in excess of apparent blood loss.
 Arteriography, with embolization if necessary, is advised for all cases of suspected thigh compartment syndrome in which there is an unexplained need for hemodynamic support by transfusion.
