Vascular entrapment of intra-aortic balloon after short-term balloon counterpulsation.
 Prolonged, continuous intra-aortic balloon (IAB) counterpulsation for several weeks can result in balloon entrapment secondary to thrombus formation in the balloon lumen.
 In this report, we describe a patient who developed IAB entrapment, early (1 wk) after initiation of counterpulsation.
 A trace amount of blood was noted in the tubing connecting the balloon catheter to the console for 3 days prior to IAB malfunction and vascular entrapment.
 We suggest that the balloon catheter be removed immediately when blood is detected in the external connecting tubing even if the IAB is functioning satisfactorily.
