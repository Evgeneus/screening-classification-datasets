The benefit to cost ratio of work-site blood pressure control programs.
 Reduction in the cost of health care claims among hypertensive employees was examined over a 4-year period after exposure to a 3-year blood pressure control program, to see whether work-site monitoring and counseling produced a subsequent benefit.
 Hypertensive employees at three experimental sites (N = 183 to 367 subjects) were compared with subjects at a control site (N = 169) who had received no postscreening follow-up or monitoring, and with matched normotensive employees.
 The cost of subsequent health care claims for hypertensive employees at the experimental sites was lower than claims for those at the control site, but there was no significant difference across the sites in claims for normotensive employees.
 After adjusting to a standard 1982 dollar, the data showed from $1.89 to $2.72 in reduced health care claims per dollar spent operating the hypertension control program.
