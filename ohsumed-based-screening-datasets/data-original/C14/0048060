Importance of the aminoglycoside dosing regimen in the penicillin-netilmicin combination for treatment of Enterococcus faecalis-induced experimental endocarditis.
 The penicillin-aminoglycoside combination is recommended for the treatment of systemic enterococcal infections.
 However, the optimal dosing regimen of the aminoglycoside remains to be elucidated.
 We evaluated the efficacy of penicillin, alone or in combination with various dosing regimens of netilmicin, for the treatment of experimental left-sided Enterococcus faecalis endocarditis in rabbits.
 Animals were injected intramuscularly for 4 days with penicillin alone or in combination with netilmicin in one of the following regimens: netilmicin at a low dose (2 mg/kg of body weight every 8 h), netilmicin at a high dose (4 mg/kg every 8 h), or netilmicin at a single daily high dose (12 mg/kg every 24 h).
 MICs and MBCs were 3.1 and 6.2 micrograms/ml and 8 and 8 micrograms/ml for penicillin and netilmicin, respectively.
 A netilmicin concentration of 4 micrograms/ml was the lowest concentration that achieved synergism with penicillin, as shown by the kill-curve method.
 Mean peak levels of netilmicin in serum were 5.6 (netilmicin at 2 mg/kg), 9.8 (netilmicin at 4 mg/kg), and 20.6 (netilmicin at 12 mg/kg) micrograms/ml.
 Mean penicillin levels in serum were constantly above the MIC.
 Penicillin plus netilmicin at a high dose given three times daily was more effective (P less than 0.05) than any other regimen in reducing bacterial titers in vegetations and was the only treatment that induced a significant bactericidal activity in rabbit serum during the trough.
 We concluded that divided doses of aminoglycoside are more effective than the same total dose given once daily in combination with penicillin.
