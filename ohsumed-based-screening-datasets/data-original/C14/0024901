Role of combination drug therapy with a class IC antiarrhythmic agent and mexiletine for ventricular tachycardia.
 The combination of mexiletine and a class IC antiarrhythmic agent (encainide, propafenone or flecainide) was evaluated by electrophysiologic testing in 14 patients with a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia whose tachycardia remained inducible during therapy with the class IC drug alone.
 During the control drug-free state, all patients had inducible ventricular tachycardia, with a mean cycle length of 260 ms (range 190 to 400).
 During monotherapy with the IC agent the tachycardia remained inducible in each patient, but there was a significant increase in the cycle length to 340 ms (240 to 500) (p less than 0.001).
 The effective refractory period of the ventricle was not altered.
 Treatment with mexiletine (oral in 13 and intravenous in 1) was begun and electrophysiologic testing was repeated.
 Ventricular tachycardia in one patient was rendered noninducible and one patient had arrhythmia aggravation.
 The tachycardia in the remaining 12 patients remained inducible but its average cycle length increased further to 392 ms (340 to 460) (p = NS).
 Nine patients had rate slowing and the average cycle length of the ventricular tachycardia in this group was significantly increased (302 to 388 ms, p less than 0.05).
 The average effective refractory period was significantly increased during combination therapy (267 ms) compared with no drug therapy (235 ms) and therapy with the class IC drug alone (247 ms) (p less than 0.05).
 After a mean follow-up interval of 22 months, seven patients continue on the combined treatment and have no ventricular tachycardia.
