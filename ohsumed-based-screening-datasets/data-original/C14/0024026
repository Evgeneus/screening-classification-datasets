Brain and liver angiotensinogen messenger RNA in genetic hypertensive and normotensive rats.
 The brain's renin-angiotensin system in integrally involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid/mineral metabolism.
 Enhanced activity of the angiotensin system in the brain has been implicated as a possible source of the hypertension and the elevated salt appetite of the spontaneously hypertensive rat, as compared with the Wistar-Kyoto rat.
 This study tested whether these inbred strains of hypertensive and normotensive rats differ in central or peripheral expression of the gene coding for angiotensinogen, the prohormone for the angiotensin peptides.
 Angiotensinogen messenger RNA was measured in the brain by in situ hybridization and in the liver by Northern blot analysis, using a synthetic oligonucleotide.
 There was a 28% greater expression of the angiotensinogen gene in the region of the anteroventral hypothalamus, preoptic area, and medial septum of the hypertensive strain.
 There were no differences between strains in liver angiotensinogen gene expression.
 These results are consistent with the possibility that enhanced elaboration of the angiotensin prohormone in the brain contributes, in part, to the hypertension or the elevated salt appetite of the spontaneously hypertensive rat.
