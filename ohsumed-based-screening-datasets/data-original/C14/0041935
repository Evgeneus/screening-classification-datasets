St. Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution. Beneficial effect of glucose and multidose reinfusions of cardioplegic solution.
 The intention of this study was to determine whether glucose is beneficial in a cardioplegic solution when the end products of metabolism produced during the ischemic period are intermittently removed.
 The experimental model used was the isolated working rat heart, with a 3-hour hypothermic 10 degrees C cardioplegic arrest period.
 Cardioplegic solutions tested were the St.
 Thomas' Hospital No.
 2 and a modified Krebs-Henseleit cardioplegic solution.
 Glucose (11 mmol/L) was beneficial when multidose cardioplegia was administered every 30 minutes.
 Including glucose in Krebs-Henseleit cardioplegic solution improved postischemic recovery of aortic output from 57.0% +/- 1.8% to 65.8% +/- 2.2%; p less than 0.025.
 The addition of glucose to St.
 Thomas' Hospital No.
 2 cardioplegic solution improved aortic output from 74.6% +/- 1.9% to 87.4% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.005.
 Furthermore, a dose-response curve showed that a glucose concentration of 20 mmol/L gave no better recovery than 0 mmol/L, and glucose in St.
 Thomas Hospital No.
 2 cardioplegic solution was beneficial only in the range of 7 to 11 mmol/L.
 In addition, we showed that multidose cardioplegia was beneficial independent of glucose.
 Multidose St.
 Thomas' Hospital No.
 2 cardioplegia, as opposed to single-dose cardioplegia, improved aortic output recovery from 57.4% +/- 5.2% to 74.6% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.025, and with St.
 Thomas' Hospital No.
 2 cardioplegic solution plus glucose (11 mmol/L) aortic output recovery improved from 65.9% +/- 2.9% to 87.4% +/- 1.9%; p less than 0.005.
 Hence, at least in this screening model, the St.
 Thomas' Hospital cardioplegic solution should contain glucose in the range of 7 mmol/L to 11 mmol/L, provided multidose cardioplegia is given.
 We cautiously suggest extrapolation to the human heart, on the basis of supporting clinical arguments that appear general enough to apply to both rat and human metabolisms.
