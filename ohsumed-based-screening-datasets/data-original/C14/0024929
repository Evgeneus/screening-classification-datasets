Prospects for the use of antagonists to the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor to prevent post-angioplasty restenosis and thrombosis.
 Despite many advances since its inception in humans in 1977, coronary angioplasty continues to be limited by the problems of abrupt arterial closure and late restenosis.
 Excessive platelet deposition at the site of angioplasty undoubtedly plays an important role in the pathophysiology of both of these problems.
 Monoclonal antibodies and snake venom-derived or synthetic peptides directed against a common protein recognition sequence on the platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor are currently in the early stages of preclinical and clinical testing and hold promise of preventing abrupt closure and restenosis by inhibiting platelet function.
 Whether any of these agents will eventually be commonly used in clinical practice will depend on their effects on the complex pathophysiology of these problems and on their safety profile when administered to patients who are likely to receive other antithrombotic medications and who are instrumented for coronary angioplasty.
