A review of hemoglobin and the pathogenesis of cerebral vasospasm.
 We believe that current experimental and clinical evidence can be most satisfactorily interpreted by assuming that oxyhemoglobin is the cause of cerebral vasospasm that follows subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 We review the pathogenetic mechanisms by which oxyhemoglobin affects cerebral arteries.
 The relative importance of each of these mechanisms in the genesis of vasospasm, the biochemical pathways of oxyhemoglobin-induced smooth muscle contraction, and the intracellular actions of oxyhemoglobin on smooth muscle and on other cells in arteries are still not definitely established.
