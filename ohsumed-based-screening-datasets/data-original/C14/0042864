Exercise training and coronary collateral circulation.
 This review examines the potential for an exercise-induced increase in coronary collateral circulation, with specific reference to the role and functional significance of collateral vessels, highlighting animal and human studies in particular, and their inherent methodological limitations.
 Exercise training may enhance myocardial oxygen supply by promoting transient periods of myocardial ischemia, a potent trigger of collateral growth.
 Some human studies have shown that moderate-to-high intensity training can result in a higher double product at the onset of angina and/or ischemic ST-segment depression, suggesting that myocardial oxygen supply has increased.
 Attempts to use thallium-201 exercise scintigraphy to assess myocardial perfusion before and after a physical training program have produced conflicting data, whereas angiographic studies in group trials have, without exception, yielded disappointing results.
 Thus, direct evidence that exercise stimulates collateralization in humans is lacking.
