Influence of left ventricular diastolic filling on symptoms and survival in patients with decreased left ventricular systolic function.
 The relation between left ventricular (LV) filling variables measured by gated blood pool radionuclide ventriculography and clinical symptoms and survival was examined in 93 patients who had decreased LV systolic function.
 The diastolic data were not significantly associated with clinical symptoms.
 Time to peak filling rate, peak filling rate and ejection fraction were associated independently with survival free of cardiac death (chi-square = 7.74, 5.91 and 3.92, respectively, by stepwise Cox regression analysis).
 A short time to peak filling rate or increased peak filling rate was associated with decreased survival, whereas the opposite indicated a good prognosis.
 One-year Kaplan-Meier survival was 73 and 98% when time to peak filling rate was below or above the median value of 167 ms, respectively, 82 and 90% when peak filling rate was above or below the median value of 1.67 end-diastolic volumes per second, respectively, and 76 and 95% when LV ejection fraction was below or above the median value of 0.35, respectively.
 Thus, filling variables (time to peak filling rate and peak filling rate) measured by radionuclide ventriculography may be valuable in predicting survival in patients with decreased LV systolic function.
