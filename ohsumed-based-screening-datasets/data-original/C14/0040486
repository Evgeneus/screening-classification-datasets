Evaluation of dipyridamole-Doppler echocardiography for detection of myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease.
 Doppler assessment of left ventricular filling and ejection during dipyridamole stress may supplement wall motion analysis for detection of myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease (CAD).
 Thirty-four patients taking no cardioactive therapy were studied using intravenous dipyridamole (0.6 mg/kg) during 2-dimensional and pulsed Doppler echocardiography.
 Twelve patients had normal coronary arteries (group 1) and the remainder, who had significant CAD, were divided into groups 2 (n = 11) and 3 (n = 11).
 Only subjects in group 2 developed myocardial ischemia manifest as reversible regional asynergy and ST-segment depression.
 Heart rate increased (16 +/- 9 beats/min, p less than 0.01) and mean blood pressure decreased (-5 +/- 8 mm Hg, p = not significant) uniformly across groups.
 Exaggerated hyperkinesia of normally contracting wall segments was the common response to dipyridamole infusion in patients with CAD.
 The respective mean percent changes in peak early diastolic velocity, peak atrial velocity, their ratio and ejection peak velocity, and mean acceleration for groups 1 (20, 42, -13, 20 and 23%), 2 (22, 32, -2, 10 and 14%) and 3 (23, 33, -6, 16 and 18%) were similar.
 Comparisons between normal patients and those with CAD and between groups 2 and 3 revealed no significant differences in the effect of dipyridamole on any variable.
 However, a decrease in both peak velocity and mean acceleration of left ventricular ejection was seen in 3 of 4 group 2 patients who developed severe ischemia.
 Dipyridamole-Doppler echocardiography is insensitive for detection of CAD and appears unable to identify myocardial ischemia unless this is severe.
 Hemodynamic changes and compensatory wall motion induced by dipyridamole may explain these findings.
