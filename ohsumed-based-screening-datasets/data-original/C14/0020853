The yield of cholesterol screening in an urban black community.
 BACKGROUND: While the distribution of cholesterol levels have been well studied in the general population, little is known about cholesterol and other cardiovascular disease risk factors in screenings held in an urban Black community.
 This study was designed to determine the yield of cholesterol screening in this community.
 METHODS: Screening took place in eight community sites.
 Serum total cholesterol was measured using a rapid capillary technique.
 Blood pressure was taken according to national guidelines and the average of two to three measurements were used.
 Standard interviews were used to determine the presence of cardiovascular risk factors by history.
 RESULTS: Of the 562 individuals screened, 44.9 percent had cholesterol levels requiring referral for follow-up care.
 Of those with total cholesterol greater than or equal to 6.21 mmol/L, 66.4 percent were previously undetected and more than half also had blood pressure levels greater than or equal to 140/90 mmHg on screening; 45 percent of all participants had blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 on screenings.
 Of those with a history of elevated total cholesterol levels, none had levels below 5.17 mmol/L at the time of screening.
 CONCLUSIONS: Multiple risk factors are highly prevalent in the urban Black community during cholesterol screening programs.
 Findings suggest the need for cholesterol programs incorporating blood pressure screening in the urban Black community.
