Effect of heparin on coronary arterial patency after thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator in acute myocardial infarction.
 Infarct artery patency rates at 90 minutes after coronary thrombolysis using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) with and without concurrent heparin anticoagulation have been shown to be comparable.
 The contribution of heparin to efficacy and safety after thrombolysis with rt-PA is unknown.
 In this pilot study, 84 patients were treated within 6 hours of onset of acute myocardial infarction (mean of 2.7 hours) with the standard dose of 100 mg of rt-PA over 3 hours.
 Forty-two patients were randomized to receive additionally immediate intravenous heparin anticoagulation (5,000 U of intravenous bolus followed by 1,000 U/hour titrated to a partial thromboplastin time of 1.5 to 2.0 times control) while 42 patients received rt-PA alone.
 Coronary angiography performed on day 3 (48 to 72 hours, mean 57) after rt-PA therapy revealed infarct artery patency rates of 71 and 43% in anticoagulated and control patients, respectively (p = 0.015).
 Recurrent ischemia or infarction, or both, occurred in 3 (7.1%) anticoagulated patients and 5 (11.9%) control patients (difference not significant).
 Mild, moderate and severe bleeding occurred in 52, 10 and 2% of the group receiving anticoagulation, respectively, and 34, 2 and 0% of patients in the control group, respectively (p = 0.006).
 These data indicate that after rt-PA therapy of acute myocardial infarction, heparin therapy is associated with substantially higher coronary patency rates 3 days after thrombolysis but is accompanied by an increased incidence of minor bleeding complications.
