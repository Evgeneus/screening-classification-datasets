Early prediction of acute myocardial infarction from clinical history, examination and electrocardiogram in the emergency room.
 The possibility of early prediction of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) was assessed in 7,157 consecutive patients coming to our emergency room during a 21-month period with chest pain or other symptoms suggestive of AMI.
 Of these patients 921 developed an AMI during the first 3 days in the hospital.
 Of the 4,690 patients admitted to hospital, 1,576 (34%) had a normal admission electrocardiogram, and 90 of these (6%) developed AMI.
 Of 1,964 patients with an abnormal electrocardiogram without signs of acute ischemia (42% of those admitted), 268 (14%) developed AMI, and 563 (51%) of 1,109 patients with acute ischemia on the electrocardiogram (24%) developed AMI.
 All patients were prospectively classified in the emergency room on the basis of history, clinical examination and electrocardiogram into 1 of 4 categories, according to the initial degree of suspicion of AMI.
 Of 279 admitted patients judged to have an obvious AMI (6% of the 4,690), 245 (88%) actually developed AMI; of 1,426 with a strong suspicion of AMI (30%), 478 (34%) developed one; of 2,519 with a vague suspicion of AMI (54%), 192 (8%) developed one; and of 466 with no suspicion of AMI (10%), 6 (1%) developed one.
 Thus, only a low percentage of the patients with a normal initial electrocardiogram or a vague initial suspicion of AMI developed a confirmed AMI.
