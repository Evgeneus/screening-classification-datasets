Gastric antral vascular ectasia ("watermelon stomach"): radiologic findings.
 Radiologic findings in a patient with gastric antral vascular ectasia are described on computed tomographic scans, upper gastrointestinal series, and specimen radiographs.
 Findings include prominent, scalloped antral folds radiating to the pylorus and thickening of the gastric antrum.
 Pathognomonic red vascular folds, likened to stripes on a watermelon, can be seen endoscopically.
