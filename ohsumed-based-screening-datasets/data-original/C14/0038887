Crossing failure in PTCA: mind the deflated balloon profile!
 An attempt to reposition an Integra PTCA balloon-on-a-wire failed although the whole stenosed segment could be crossed before inflation.
 After careful removal the device showed a grossly altered shape.
 Deflated balloon profiles, quite different from the initial shape, can determine the outcome both in dissections and in multilesion cases.
