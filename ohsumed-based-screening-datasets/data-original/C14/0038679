Ambulatory stab evulsion phlebectomy for truncal varicose veins.
 The management of primary varicose veins is evolving.
 Recovery time, cost, recurrence rate, and cosmesis are critical determinants.
 Classic "high ligation" and ankle-to-groin stripping is expensive, results in a long convalescence, and may produce unacceptable scarring and possible permanent nerve injury.
 This report describes the technique of stab evulsion phlebectomy performed in an outpatient setting.
 Under loco-regional anesthesia, and after high ligation, existing tributary and trunk varicosities are evulsed with specially designed hooks.
 The multiple stab incisions, 1.5- to 3-mm long, are closed with adhesive strips.
 Fifty-six patients, with 69 involved limbs, have been operated on during the past 9 months.
 Postoperative pain and complications were minimal.
 Convalescence was eliminated and all patients immediately resumed normal daily activities.
 Cosmesis was excellent.
 This technique is based on hemodynamically accurate principles.
 It effectively removes all varicosities, eliminates the proximal source of reflux, and disconnects potentially outflowing perforators, yet leaves in situ undamaged trunk veins, which may be used as potential vein grafts.
