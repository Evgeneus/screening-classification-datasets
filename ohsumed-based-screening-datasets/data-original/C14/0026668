Body weight is more important than family history of hypertension for left ventricular function.
 Left ventricular function was studied in young men with a positive family history of hypertension for two generations (n = 15).
 The findings were compared with three control groups: one age-, sex-, and weight-matched group with a negative family history of hypertension (n = 14); one normotensive control group unselected as regards family history of hypertension (n = 27); and one group also unselected regarding family history of hypertension but selected with blood pressure criteria to have mild blood pressure elevation (n = 59).
 The group with a positive family history of hypertension, in comparison with the normotensive control group, was heavier, had higher blood pressure, increased left ventricular wall thickness, increased left ventricular mass, and signs of changes in diastolic and systolic left ventricular function.
 There were no differences in these variables between the group with a positive family history and the other two control groups.
 Data clearly indicated that subjects with a positive family history of hypertension, as well as subjects with mild blood pressure elevation, were heavier than the normotensive control group.
 It is not possible to judge, with available data, if the changes in left ventricular morphology and function in the two groups with a different family history of hypertension and in the group with mild blood pressure elevation occurred as a physiological response to the increase in afterload or if the neurohormonal and metabolic disturbances leading to the condition of slight overweight also affected left ventricular function.
