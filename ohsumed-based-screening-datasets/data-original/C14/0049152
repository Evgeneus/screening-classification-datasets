Comparison of tomographic and planar imaging for the evaluation of thrombolytic therapy in acute myocardial infarction using pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-99m sestamibi.
 Pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with technetium-99m hexakis 2-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (Tc-99m sestamibi) was performed in patients who underwent thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction comparing planar imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
 Twenty-one patients were injected with Tc-99m sestamibi before thrombolytic treatment.
 SPECT and planar imaging were acquired after completion of the treatment.
 The scintigraphy was repeated 5 days later in 20 subjects.
 Planar and SPECT studies were evaluated using an uptake score.
 Patients were divided according to the status of the infarct-related vessel (patent in 13 patients, group 1, and occluded in seven, group 2) and to the presence of functional recovery in serial echocardiographic controls (present in 10 patients, group A, and absent in 10, group B).
 The scintigraphic defect extent in the 5-day images correlated with the enzymatic infarct size: SPECT: r = 0.75, p less than 0.0002; planar: r = 0.68, p less than 0.002.
 The decrease of the uptake defects correlated with the reduction of the left ventricular wall asynergy (admission versus 1 month echocardiogram): SPECT: r = 0.92, p less than 0.000001; planar: r = 0.82, p less than 0.00001.
 The percent decrease of the uptake defects was significantly higher in patients in group 1 and group A compared with group 2 and, respectively, group B--SPECT: group 1: 51.4 +/- 27.7 versus group 2: 13.1 +/- 8.6, p less than 0.02; group A: 64.2 +/- 15.3 versus group B: 11.9 +/- 8.1, p less than 0.0002; planar group 1: 41 +/- 30.4 versus group 2: 7.7 +/- 6.2, p less than 0.05; group A: 52.5 +/- 24.3 versus group B: 6.1 +/- 6, p less than 0.0002.
 This study confirms the reliability of pre- and post-treatment myocardial scintigraphy with Tc-99m sestamibi for evaluating the outcome of thrombolytic treatment in myocardial infarction.
 The results seems slightly more accurate using SPECT, but a simple three-view planar study also gives useful data.
