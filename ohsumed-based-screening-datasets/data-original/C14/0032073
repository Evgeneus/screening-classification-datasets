Multiple drug therapy in the treatment of essential hypertension.
 Treatment for high blood pressure is aimed to prevent the excess morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension by reducing the blood pressure to acceptable levels and by improving the cardiovascular risk status.
 Antihypertensive medications can be selected that not only reduce blood pressure but also have beneficial effects in concomitant illness and neutral or positive effects on other cardiovascular risk factors.
 Multiple drug therapy offers not only the possibility of greater therapeutic efficacy than that achieved with single agents but also the possibility of reduced incidence of side effects through complementary actions.
 The antihypertensive regimen should be simple and acceptable to the patient to promote compliance.
 Nurses, along with physicians, have an integral role in the long-term management of hypertensive patients through education, counsel, and follow-up for blood pressure control and health promotion.
