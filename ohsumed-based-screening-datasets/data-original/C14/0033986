Myocardial and aerobic requirements for an upper body exerciser: implications for cardiac rehabilitation.
 To assess the cardiorespiratory, hemodynamic, and electrocardiograph (ECG) responses to an upper body exercise device, we studied ten cardiac men (mean age +/- SD = 58.0 +/- 6.5 years) who performed three five-minute exercise bouts at metronome settings of 20, 50, and 80 clicks per minute.
 Operation of the device involved shuttling a plastic buoy on two 6-m waxed ropes between two persons.
 Aerobic requirements were generally appropriate for arm training, corresponding to mean values of 5.3, 7.0, and 10.1 ml.kg-1.min-1 at the three progressive metronome settings.
 Perceived exertion (Borg, 6 to 20 scale) at these work rates was 8.3, 10.4, and 14.6, whereas average heart rate and systolic blood pressure responses were 77, 85, and 114 beats.min-1 and 145, 158, and 175 mmHg, respectively.
 Continuous ECG monitoring during upper body exercise revealed no significant ST-segment depression or serious arrhythmias.
 The device appears to be a safe and effective complement to a cardiac exercise training program.
