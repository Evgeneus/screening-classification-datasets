Use of technetium-HMPAO to demonstrate changes in cerebral blood flow reserve following carotid endarterectomy.
 Cerebral perfusion through stenosed internal carotid arteries is usually maintained by autoregulation.
 However, flow reserve may be reduced, suggesting hemodynamically significant stenosis, and such reduction should be improved by carotid endarterectomy.
 This concept was studied in 20 subjects with unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis (major stenosis greater than or equal to 70%, minor stenosis less than or equal to 50%).
 Thirteen had experienced recent transient ischemic attacks and seven had no definite focal symptoms.
 Subjects underwent Tc-HMPAO cerebral SPECT during acetazolamide dysautoregulation before and after internal carotid endarterectomy.
 Nine (45%) had perfusion defects that improved after surgery, suggesting surgery had improved cerebral flow reserve.
 Seven had defects that did not improve after surgery.
 Four had worsened or new defects after surgery, suggesting perioperative infarcts.
 The relatively large proportion of patients with improved cerebral blood flow reserve after surgery suggests that this technique may have a significant role to play in assessing which patients might benefit from carotid endarterectomy.
