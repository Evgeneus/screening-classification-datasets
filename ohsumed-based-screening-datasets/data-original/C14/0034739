Noninvasive detection of functionally significant coronary artery stenoses with exercise and positron emission tomography.
 Positron emission tomography has been employed in vivo to assess flow using N-13 (nitrogen-13) ammonia and glucose metabolism, with the glucose analog F-18 (fluorine-18) fluorodeoxyglucose.
 Flow metabolism mismatches in which glucose metabolism is increased with respect to flow have been used to define ischemic, but viable myocardium.
 The feasibility of detecting exercise-induced ischemia using this technique was explored.
 Eleven normal volunteers and 16 patients who had undergone coronary arteriography were studied with N-13 ammonia at rest and with bicycle exercise, and with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose in the postexercise period.
 Each image was divided into 16 sectors.
 Comparison of absolute net extractions of N-13 ammonia at rest and with exercise was not sensitive in detecting functionally significant coronary artery lesions.
 Myocardial uptakes of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose and exercise N-13 ammonia were normalized to the sector with the highest N-13 ammonia uptake (corresponding to the highest flow rate).
 The differences and ratios of these normalized uptakes were successfully used to objectively define flow metabolism mismatches and to identify functionally significant coronary artery disease.
 Our data suggest that exercise flow and metabolic imaging are superior to rest and exercise flow imaging, particularly in patients with prior myocardial infarctions.
