Anaerobic threshold in patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.
 The aim of the present study was to investigate the ventilatory anaerobic threshold in patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.
 Ventilatory volumes and gas exchanges were measured during treadmill stress testing in 36 patients (11 with previous myocardial infarction) with electrocardiographic criteria of myocardial ischemia during the test and in 23 healthy, untrained control subjects of equivalent age.
 The anaerobic threshold was detected in 32 of 36 patients (89%) and in 22 of 23 control subjects (96%).
 The anaerobic threshold was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects (13.5 +/- 1.9 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001).
 In the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the anaerobic threshold was also significantly lower than in the control subjects (13.9 +/- 1.6 versus 19.7 +/- 1.7 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.001).
 Among the 21 patients without previous myocardial infarction, the 12 with a low ischemic threshold, which occurred during the first three steps of the modified Bruce protocol, had an anaerobic threshold significantly lower than the other nine patients (13.1 +/- 1.5 versus 14.9 +/- 1.0 ml/kg per minute VO2, p less than 0.01).
 However, even in the patients with a moderate to high ischemic threshold, the anaerobic threshold was significantly lower than in the control subjects (p less than 0.001).
 These data show that the anaerobic threshold can be measured in the great majority of patients with exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.
 The low anaerobic threshold level indicates a relevant functional impairment in these patients.
