Quantitative relation between increased intrapericardial pressure and Doppler flow velocities during experimental cardiac tamponade.
 To establish whether a quantitative relation exists between pericardial pressure and respiratory variation in intracardiac blood flow velocities, a spontaneously breathing closed chest canine model of pericardial tamponade was created.
 In seven dogs, pericardial pressure was sequentially increased in stages from a mean of -4 +/- 1 to 10 +/- 2 mm Hg while aortic and pulmonary Doppler flow velocities, pleural pressure changes (respiratory effort), blood pressure and cardiac output were measured.
 The variation in the Doppler-detected peak transaortic velocity (AV) during inspiration (IV) increased linearly from -5 +/- 3% at baseline (pericardial pressure -4 mm Hg) to -32 +/- 9% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg [IVAV = -2 (pericardial pressure)--13.1; r = 0.78, p less than 10(-6)].
 The inspiratory variation in the peak transpulmonary velocity increased from 13 +/- 3% at baseline to 71 +/- 19% at a pericardial pressure of 10 mm Hg.
 The inspiratory variation in the pulmonary Doppler peak velocity (IVPV) was dependent on both pericardial pressure and degree of respiratory effort [IVPV = 3.8 (pericardial pressure) + 2.6 (respiratory effort) + 10.9; r = 0.88, p less than 10(-8)].
 Thus, quantitative relations exist between increases in intrapericardial pressure and increases in inspiratory variation of peak aortic and pulmonary flow velocities.
 Additionally, pulmonary artery flow velocity is influenced more than aortic velocity by intrathoracic pressure.
