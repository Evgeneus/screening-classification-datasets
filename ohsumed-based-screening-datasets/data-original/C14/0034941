Scanning electron microscopic study of microaneurysms in the diabetic retina.
 We describe the clinical and pathologic appearance of the retinal microcirculation in a patient with a 22-year history of diabetes mellitus.
 A vascular cast of one eye was prepared and studied with scanning electron microscopy.
 The three-dimensional views obtained give insight into the pathogenesis of microaneurysms.
