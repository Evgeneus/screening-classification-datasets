Endocardial resection in the treatment of ventricular tachycardia secondary to cardiac trauma.
 Sustained ventricular tachycardia with left ventricular aneurysm formation is a rare complication following penetrating cardiac trauma.
 We present an unusual case of serious ventricular tachycardia which developed 35 years after a World War II injury and was successfully treated with aneurysmectomy, map-guided subendocardial resection, and cryoablation.
