Multicenter registry of angioplasty therapy of cardiogenic shock: initial and long-term survival.
 This retrospective multicenter study reviews the role of acute percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the treatment of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction to determine whether early reperfusion affects in-hospital and long-term survival.
 From 1982 to 1985, 69 patients were treated with emergency angioplasty to attempt reperfusion of the infarct-related artery.
 Balloon angioplasty was unsuccessful in 20 patients (group 1) and successful in 49 patients (group 2).
 Initial clinical and angiographic findings in the groups with unsuccessful and successful angioplasty were similar with respect to age (60.5 +/- 2.3 versus 57 +/- 1.8 years), infarct location (65% versus 65% anterior) and gender (65% versus 67% male).
 Hemodynamic variables in the two groups, including systolic blood pressure (68 +/- 4.3 versus 73 +/- 1.6 mm Hg), left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (24.4 +/- 2.4 versus 27 +/- 1.0 mm Hg) and initial ejection fraction (28.5 +/- 4% versus 32 +/- 2%), were also similar.
 Twenty-nine patients received thrombolytic therapy with streptokinase; the overall rate of reperfusion was 34%.
 Group 1 patients had a short-term survival rate of 20%, compared with 69% in group 2 patients (p less than 0.0005).
 Thirty-eight patients survived the hospital period and were followed up for 24 to 54 months (mean 32.5 +/- 2.4).
 Five patients (all in group 2) died during follow-up.
 The long-term incidence rate of congestive heart failure was 19%, arrhythmia 21%, need for repeat angioplasty 17% and coronary artery bypass grafting 26%.
 Twenty-four month survival was significantly better in group 2 patients (54%) versus group 1 patients (11%, p = 0.003).
