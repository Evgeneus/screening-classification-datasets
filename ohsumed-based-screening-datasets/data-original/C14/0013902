Prospective study of a prosthetic H-graft portacaval shunt.
 This study was undertaken to prospectively evaluate the 8-mm Gore-Tex interposition H-graft portacaval shunt.
 Thirty-six high-risk patients at the University of South Florida-affiliated hospitals received small-diameter shunts because of bleeding esophagogastric varices over a recent 2-year period.
 Portal vein and portal vein-inferior vena cava gradients were significantly reduced after shunting.
 These pressure changes were manifested clinically by the absence of variceal rebleeding and improvement of ascites; in addition, the incidence of encephalopathy was low.
 The 8-mm graft maintained hepatopedal flow in 67% of the patients, but reversal of flow did not result in complications commonly associated with poor portal perfusion.
 Graft thrombosis occurred in four (11%) patients.
 All grafts were successfully revised, three by operative revision and one by an interventional radiologist.
 Operative mortality was low (11%), and morbidity was unusual.
 The small-diameter H-graft portacaval shunt is a safe and effective method of treatment for bleeding esophagogastric varices.
