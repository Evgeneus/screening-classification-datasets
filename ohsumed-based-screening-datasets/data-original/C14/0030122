Cor triatriatum. Clinical presentation and operative results.
 From November 1973 to January 1988, 15 patients with cor triatriatum underwent surgical correction at the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Ospedali Riuniti, Bergamo, Italy.
 Their ages ranged from 15 days to 48 years.
 Eight patients (53%) were younger than age 1 year.
 Evidence of congestive heart failure was present in five infants, whereas three infants, three children, and two adults initially had signs of pulmonary venous obstruction, and two children had a heart murmur only.
 Five patients had cor triatriatum alone; in ten cases there also was an atrial septal defect.
 Associated anomalies in four patients included left superior vena cava, ventricular septal defect and left superior vena cava, partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection, and bilateral partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection.
 Cor triatriatum was repaired with the aid of cardiopulmonary bypass in all patients.
 Excision of the membrane was accomplished with a right atrial approach in 13 patients and a left atriotomy in one patient.
 Both atria were opened in one case.
 All associated anomalies were simultaneously corrected.
 Three patients (20%) died early after operation.
 Among the 12 survivors, no late events have occurred, and all of them are presently in New York Heart Association functional class I.
 A recent echocardiogram shows absence of residual obstruction or shunt and good development of the left cardiac chambers.
