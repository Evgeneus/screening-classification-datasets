Salvage of thrombosed forearm polytetrafluoroethylene vascular access grafts by reversal of flow direction and venous bypass grafting.
 A technique is described for salvage of looped forearm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) vascular access grafts that fail because of thrombosis due to cephalic vein outflow obstruction.
 It entails reversal of blood flow direction through the graft and construction of a new venous outflow in the medial upper arm.
 This procedure was performed in nine patients and, at the present time, has increased the graft life by an average of 6.2 months (range: 2 to 14 months) in eight.
 We conclude that this is a useful alternative to abandoning failed looped forearm PTFE grafts that have cephalic vein outflow obstruction.
