Central arteriovenous malformations of the maxillofacial skeleton: case report.
 Central arteriovenous malformation of the maxillofacial skeleton, though rare, is a well-documented entity.
 Past treatments have usually included some form of surgical intervention.
 Surgical resection as an attempt to cure has been effective but costly, ie, in relationship to patient morbidity and hospital expenditures.
 A case of vascular malformation is presented in which selective angiography and embolization as a primary treatment were used rather than ablative surgery.
 The patient tolerated the procedures well, with complete resolution of bleeding.
