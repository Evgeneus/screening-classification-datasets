Regional intravenous ketanserin and guanethidine therapy in Raynaud's phenomenon.
 The authors report the results of a study of 25 patients with Raynaud's phenomenon (primary, posttraumatic, and secondary to diffuse connective tissue diseases) treated with regional intravenous injections of guanethidine or ketanserin.
 These two drugs were chosen because of the different etiopathologic profiles of the conditions.
 All the patients showed a substantial clinical improvement with a remission of trophic lesions.
 Conditions secondary to connective tissue disorders did not demonstrate much improvement based on instrumental data alone, possibly because of the intrinsic limitations of the techniques used for evaluating peripheral blood flow.
 This specific type of pharmaceutical treatment appeared to be especially suitable for this disease owing to a combination of therapeutic efficacy and a substantial reduction in the total dosage for each patient.
