Does cigarette smoking have an independent effect on coronary heart disease incidence in the elderly?
 In order to evaluate the effects of cigarette smoking on coronary heart disease (CHD) in elderly persons in the Honolulu Heart Program, 1,394 men between ages 65 and 74 were followed during an average 12-year period for new cases of nonfatal myocardial infarction and fatal CHD.
 Incidence rates increased progressively in individuals classified at baseline as never, former, and current smokers, respectively.
 The absolute excess risk associated with cigarette smoking was nearly twice as high in elderly compared with middle-aged men.
