Effects of tissue-type plasminogen activator and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex on mortality in acute myocardial infarction.
 An overview of eight randomized controlled trials of tissue-type plasminogen activator (Alteplase or Duteplase) and 10 of anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex (Anistreplase) showed that the odds of early death were reduced by 29% by tissue-type plasminogen activator and 46% by anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator complex, with overlapping 95% confidence intervals.
 Although the beneficial effects of both agents are consistent and are strengthened when all the trials are considered together, the available data do not permit comparisons of the relative efficacy of these two agents with each other or with streptokinase.
