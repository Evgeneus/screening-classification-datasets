Surgical manipulation of primate cerebral arteries in established vasospasm.
 It is generally believed that surgery in the face of angiographic vasospasm is dangerous due to an increased incidence of postoperative cerebral ischemia.
 One theory is that arterial narrowing is exacerbated by surgical manipulation of vasospastic vessels during aneurysm dissection and clipping.
 This theory was tested in a primate model of cerebral vasospasm and the results reported.
 Six monkeys underwent baseline cerebral angiography, followed by induction of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on both sides of the circle of Willis.
 An equal amount of fresh autologous blood clot was placed around each internal carotid, anterior cerebral, and middle cerebral artery.
 Six days later, angiography was repeated and the right craniectomy was reopened for clot evacuation and surgical manipulation of the right cerebral arteries, including placement of a temporary aneurysm clip on the right middle cerebral artery.
 The left cerebral arteries were not exposed or manipulated, and served as controls.
 Twenty-four hours later angiography was repeated, then the animals were killed.
 Equal and significant vasospasm (greater than 40% reduction in vessel caliber compared to baseline, p less than 0.05) was seen in the middle cerebral arteries on both sides of the circle of Willis in all animals 6 and 7 days after SAH.
 There was no significant change in the severity of vasospasm on Day 7 compared with Day 6 in the right cerebral arteries.
 Increased risk of postoperative cerebral ischemia for surgery in the peak vasospasm period may be due to mechanisms other than increased arterial narrowing precipitated by surgical manipulation.
