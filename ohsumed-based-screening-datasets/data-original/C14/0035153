Haemodynamic considerations in the management of patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage.
 Cerebral vasospasm occurs, following subarachnoid haemorrhage, in the majority of patients and is accompanied by cerebral ischaemia in 30%.
 The objectives of this article are to review (1) the effects of subarachnoid haemorrhage and vasospasm on cerebral blood flow (CBF); (2) the effects of induced hypotension and hypocapnia on CBF in these patients; (3) current therapy for cerebral ischaemia from vasospasm.
 The medical literature was searched using Index Medicus; for the period 1983-90 this search was done on a computer with the CD-ROM version of Index Medicus, Silver Platter.
 Papers were selected on the basis of validity and applicability to clinical practice; animal studies are included when human data is lacking.
 Cerebral vasospasm may decrease cerebral blood flow, disturb autoregulation and place the patient at risk for delayed cerebral ischaemia.
 Intraoperative induced hypotension and hypocapnia can decrease CBF further, although effects of either on outcome have not been evaluated.
 Calcium antagonists are effective for both the prevention and the treatment of delayed cerebral ischaemia.
 Of the mechanical treatments, systemic-arterial hypertension has the firmest scientific foundation, although this is frequently combined with haemodilution and blood volume expansion.
 There is a need for randomized clinical trials to assess the efficacy of these latter treatments.
