Myocardial rupture. Your patient's survival may depend on you.
 Myocardial rupture is the second leading cause of in-hospital death from acute myocardial infarction.
 It is most likely to occur in the elderly, women, and patients with transmural infarction and no previous history of angina.
 A high index of suspicion is critical to the diagnosis.
 Myocardial rupture should be suspected when recurrent chest pain or hemodynamic instability develops after myocardial infarction.
 Rapid intervention and appropriate infarct-limiting therapy may reduce the mortality rate of this catastrophic complication.
