Accordion right coronary artery: an unusual complication of PTCA guidewire entrapment.
 The contour of the epicardial coronary vessels may change considerably during coronary angioplasty.
 We report the extreme and unique "accordion-like" wrinkling of the mid right coronary artery as a result of distal guidewire entrapment during coronary angioplasty.
 Recognition of this artifact and its treatment may prevent further complications of coronary angioplasty.
