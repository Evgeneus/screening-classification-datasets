Complete repair of atrioventricular septal defect.
 We report our experience with 103 consecutive children who underwent repair of complete atrioventricular septal defect between 1971 and 1990.
 Ninety-one patients were less than 18 months old (mean age, 6.2 months; mean weight, 5.8 kg) and were repaired using deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest.
 There were 15 perioperative deaths.
 Twelve patients were older (mean age, 40.2 months; mean weight, 18.9 kg) and were repaired using moderate hypothermia and cardiopulmonary bypass.
 There were two perioperative deaths.
 Repairs were performed with the single-patch technique.
 Four younger patients required repeat repair to control residual mitral regurgitation.
 Two of the older children required late reoperation to replace one or both atrioventricular valves.
 Three younger children underwent pulmonary artery banding initially; 1 died after complete repair.
 Three older children underwent initial pulmonary artery banding; 2 died at definitive repair, and the survivor required pulmonary artery reconstruction, which was repeated subsequently.
 Since 1977 our policy has been to perform primary definitive repair whenever possible.
 Two patients died late from unrelated causes.
 At the most recent follow-up the majority of patients had no or minimal symptoms.
 We continue to advocate primary definitive repair whenever possible using the single-patch technique in symptomatic patients with complete atrioventricular septal defect.
