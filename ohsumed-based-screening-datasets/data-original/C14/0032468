Evaluation of right ventricular early diastolic filling by cine nuclear magnetic resonance imaging in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 Numerous studies have established abnormalities in systolic and diastolic function of the left ventricle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 A consistent feature of this disease is reduced diastolic function of the left ventricle, but little information is available regarding right ventricular function in this disease.
 Cine nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging has been found to be effective for measuring right ventricular volumes and therefore was used to assess early diastolic filling of the right ventricle in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
 Right ventricular time-volume curves were obtained from cine NMR images in 10 patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and 8 normal subjects.
 Right ventricular volume was calculated with use of Simpson's algorithm at approximately 18 phases of the cardiac cycle and, from the curve, peak filling rate and filling fraction during the first third of diastole were determined.
 In patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, peak filling rate tended to be less (176 +/- 46 vs.
 305 +/- 50 ml/s, p less than 0.01) and filling fraction decreased (39.5 +/- 13.8 vs.
 74.5 +/- 13.3%, p less than 0.01) in comparison with values in normal subjects.
 Thus, analysis of right ventricular time-volume curves obtained by using cine NMR imaging demonstrated diastolic dysfunction of the right ventricle in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
