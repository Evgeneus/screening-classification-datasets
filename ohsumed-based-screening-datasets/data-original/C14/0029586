Pediatric cardiac rehabilitation.
 Sixteen patients participated in a Pediatric/Young Adult Cardiac Rehabilitation Program that included exercise training, education about cardiovascular diseases, dietary counseling, and counseling on stress management.
 Seven patients completed the program, and complete data were available on six.
 The subjects demonstrated significant changes in their hemodynamics and exercise tolerance after completing the program.
 Resting blood pressure decreased by 7%, from 119 +/- 12 to 111 +/- 10 mm Hg; peak oxygen consumption increased by 20%, from 31.9 +/- 4.3 mL/kg of body weight per minute to 38.4 +/- 6.0 mL/kg of body weight per minute; and exercise treadmill time increased by 21%, from 8.5 +/- 1.4 to 10.3 +/- 1.0 minutes.
 No complications occurred during exercise training or testing.
 Supervised exercise training at moderate intensity is safe and produces significant and beneficial changes in hemodynamics and exercise time in children with cardiac disease.
