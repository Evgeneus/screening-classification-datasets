Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in hypertension.
 Compared with blood pressure measurements in the office setting, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring offers a more accurate and reliable method of diagnosing and managing hypertension.
 Indications for ambulatory blood pressure monitoring include borderline hypertension, a discrepancy between home and office blood pressure measurements, persistent blood pressure elevation in the office with no end-organ damage, episodic elevations of blood pressure or suggestive symptoms, hypertension resistant to treatment, episodic angina not related to exercise, end-organ damage but normal office blood pressure readings, and evaluation of the efficacy of antihypertensive agents.
 Several cases are presented for review.
