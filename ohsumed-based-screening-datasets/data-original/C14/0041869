Results of a multicenter study of the modified hook-titanium Greenfield filter.
 Initial efforts to modify the stainless steel Greenfield filter for percutaneous insertion led to development of a titanium Greenfield filter, which could be inserted by use of a 12F carrier.
 This device functioned well as a filter but had an unacceptable 30% rate of migration, tilting, and penetration.
 Therefore a titanium Greenfield filter with modified hooks was developed and has been tested in 186 patients at 10 institutions.
 Successful placement occurred in 181 (97%); placement of the remainder was precluded by unfavorable anatomy.
 A contraindication to anticoagulation was the most frequent indication for insertion (75%).
 All but two were inserted percutaneously, predominantly via the right femoral vein (70%).
 Initial incomplete opening was seen in four patients (2%), which was corrected by guide wire manipulation and asymmetry of the legs in 10 (5.4%).
 Insertion site hematoma occurred in one patient, and apical penetration of the cava during insertion occurred in a second patient.
 Both events were without sequelae.
 Follow-up examinations were performed at 30 days at which time 35 deaths had occurred.
 Recurrent embolism was suspected in six patients (3%) and two of three deaths were confirmed by autopsy.
 Filter movement greater than 9 mm was seen in 13 patients, (11%) and increase in base diameter greater than or equal to 5 mm was seen in 17 patients (14%).
 CT scanning showed evidence of caval penetration in only one patient (0.8%).
 Insertion site venous thrombosis was seen in 4/46 (8.7%) patients screened.
 The modified hook titanium Greenfield filter is inserted percutaneously or operatively through a sheath, eliminating concern for misplacement from premature discharge.
