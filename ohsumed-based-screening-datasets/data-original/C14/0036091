Successful angioplasty of a chronically occluded saphenous vein graft using a prolonged urokinase infusion from the brachial route.
 A 68-year-old man who presented with unstable angina had had cardiac bypass surgery 12 years earlier and successful angioplasty of a native circumflex lesion 18 months previously.
 Repeat catheterization showed a widely patent angioplasty site but interval closure of a saphenous vein graft to a large marginal branch that was totally occluded proximally.
 A stress test revealed significant myocardial ischemia.
 Severe peripheral peripheral vascular disease with known bilateral iliac artery occlusions mandated a brachial approach.
 Because of his high risk for repeat cardiac surgery, it was elected to attempt saphenous graft angioplasty following a prolonged urokinase infusion.
 After an infusion of urokinase for 36 hr, antegrade flow was restored and angioplasty was carried out successfully on a discrete mid-graft legion.
 Subsequent stress testing showed resolution of the ischemia.
 There were no vascular complications.
