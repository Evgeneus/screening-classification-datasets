Fasting in vivo delays myocardial cell damage after brief periods of ischemia in the isolated working rat heart.
 To assess the effects of fasting on recovery of function and exogenous glucose metabolism after 15 minutes of total ischemia, we perfused isolated working rat hearts from fed and fasted animals.
 Hearts were perfused in a recirculating system with bicarbonate buffer containing glucose (10 mM).
 Mechanical performance, release of marker proteins for ischemic membrane damage (lactate dehydrogenase, myoglobin, citrate synthase), and the concentrations of lactate and glucose in the perfusion medium were measured serially.
 Tissue metabolites were also measured.
 Fasting raised the myocardial glycogen content by 25%.
 Cardiac performance of perfused hearts from fed and fasted animals was the same during the preischemic and the post-ischemic period.
 The time of return of function to preischemic values was significantly less in hearts from fasted rats (2.3 versus 7.8 minutes, p less than 0.025).
 The release of cytosolic and mitochondrial marker proteins was significantly lower in hearts from fasted rats than in hearts from fed rats.
 Glucose metabolic rates during control and reperfusion were unchanged for hearts from fasted rats, but decreased for hearts from fed rats during reperfusion.
 The adenine nucleotide content at the end of ischemia was higher in hearts from fasted animals than in hearts from fed animals.
 We conclude that increasing glycogen levels prior to ischemia improves recovery of function, lessens membrane damage, and prevents loss of adenine nucleotides.
