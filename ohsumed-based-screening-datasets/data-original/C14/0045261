Delayed decline in plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels after an abrupt reduction in atrial pressures: observation in patients with dual-chamber pacing.
 The effect of an abrupt reduction in atrial pressures on atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) secretion was studied in four patients with complete atrioventricular block with a dual-chamber pacemaker when the pacing mode was changed from the VVI to the DVI mode at an equal rate of 70/min.
 Simultaneous continuous hemodynamic monitoring was performed using a balloon-tipped thermodilution catheter.
 With DVI pacing, there was an immediate decrease of right atrial pressure from 4.5 +/- 0.9 to 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm Hg, and a reduction of pulmonary arterial wedge pressure from 7 +/- 0.8 to 4.5 +/- 0.9 mm Hg, together with a rise in cardiac output from 3.1 +/- 0.2 to 3.7 +/- 0.2 L/min.
 However, despite a constant hemodynamic status after dual-chamber pacing, the arterial ANP level steadily decreased from 151 +/- 26 pg/ml to a steady low level of 78 +/- 15 pg/ml after 20 minutes of dual-chamber pacing (percentage reduction- 48 +/- 8%, p less than 0.05).
 This persisted until the end of the study at 60 minutes.
 The time-dependent decay in ANP secretion after an abrupt and constant change in hemodynamic status should be considered when interpreting ANP levels.
