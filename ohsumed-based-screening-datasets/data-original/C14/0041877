Vascular rehabilitation: benefits of a structured exercise/risk modification program.
 A vascular rehabilitation program was designed to increase exercise tolerance and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with lower extremity arterial occlusive disease.
 Sixty-eight patients (32 men, 36 women); ages 55 to 85 years (mean, 68 years) with claudication 30 (44%), or recovering from lower extremity revascularization 36 (53%), or endovascular procedures 2 (3%) entered the vascular rehabilitation program.
 Each underwent a physical examination, risk factor assessment, noninvasive arterial studies, and cardiac evaluation.
 A history was taken from each patient also.
 Six patients (9%) were excluded on recognition of silent myocardial ischemia.
 Sixty-two patients (91%) were accepted for exercise training in a program designed to offer 24 (1-hour) monitored exercise sessions, 12 (1-hour) personalized education lectures, and development of a home maintenance exercise program.
 No deaths or major morbidity occurred.
 Seventeen patients (27%) did not finish the program, eight (13%) because of development of significant cardiac, extremity, or cerebrovascular disease and nine for nonmedical reasons.
 Of the 45 patients (73%) who completed the program, 38 (88%) had documented increases in walking distances of greater than 100% (122% to 450%).
 All 45 patients designed home exercise programs, and 88% of the smokers quit.
 Long-term follow-up was available on 100% of the patients.
 Thirty-eight patients (84%) have been followed for 2 years or more.
 Thirty-eight (84%) maintained or improved walking distances recorded on exit from the program.
 Thirty of the 36 patients (83%) who stopped smoking remained nonsmokers.
 Significant reductions in cholesterol were seen at 1 year, and significant reductions in triglycerides were seen at 12 weeks and 1 year.
