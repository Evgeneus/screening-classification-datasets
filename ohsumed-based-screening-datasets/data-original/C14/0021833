Liver transplantation: MR angiography with surgical validation.
 Thirty patients (mean age, 45 years) were evaluated with magnetic resonance (MR) angiography before liver transplantation to assess the accuracy of MR angiography.
 A series of breath-hold, two-dimensional images were acquired and subsequently processed to form three-dimensional projection angiograms.
 Graphic information on blood flow in the portal vein was acquired by using presaturation bolus tracking.
 Correlative duplex ultrasound (US) was performed in 28 patients, and surgical or autopsy correlation was available in all cases.
 MR angiography demonstrated patency of the portal vein in 26 (96%) of 27 patients, made possible the diagnosis of portal venous occlusion in three of three patients, depicted reversed portal flow in one patient, and provided clear delineation of the extent of varices and specific portosystemic collateral vessels.
 When duplex US was successful, there was full agreement with MR angiographic results in assessing portal vein patency and flow direction.
 All of the MR findings were corroborated at surgical exploration or autopsy.
 The authors conclude that MR angiography is very accurate in the portal system and is valuable in preoperative assessment for liver transplantation.
