Hypertensive heart disease in African-Americans.
 Hypertensive heart disease is a frequent complication in hypertensive African-Americans because of inadequate high blood pressure control.
 Moreover, African-Americans may be predisposed to develop LVH earlier in life and more readily than Caucasians, and it may be more malignant.
 The appearance of both LVH and congestive heart failure are ominous developments in individual patients, and early detection of LVH is mandatory for adequate management and reversal of this complication, if possible.
 Additional research is needed, and new, sensitive tools for detecting LVH will accelerate such studies.
 Further investigations are also needed on the reversibility of LVH, preferred antihypertensive agents for accomplishing reversal, and whether expected benefits result.
