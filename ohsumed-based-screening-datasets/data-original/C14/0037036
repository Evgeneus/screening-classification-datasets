Surveillance for recurrent stenosis after endovascular procedures. A prospective study.
 Eighty-nine endovascular procedures were performed during a 1-year period.
 Techniques included balloon angioplasty (n = 50), laser-assisted balloon angioplasty (n = 32), and atherectomy (n = 7).
 Indications were claudication (65.2%), critical ischemia (30.3%), and failing bypass (4.5%).
 Preoperative evaluation included a history and physical examination, segmental limb pressures, and color duplex ultrasonography.
 Postoperative surveillance consisted of a history and physical examination, ankle-arm indexes, and color duplex examinations at 1-week, 1-month, and then 3-month intervals.
 All levels of aortoiliac and infrainguinal disease were treated.
 Immediate technical success rate was 89.8%.
 Recurrence rates by life-table analysis reveal a 9-month patency rate of 45.4%.
 Early results of this prospective study indicate that endovascular procedures are subject to significant restenosis rates.
 Restraint is advised concerning general acceptance of endovascular procedures pending critical study.
