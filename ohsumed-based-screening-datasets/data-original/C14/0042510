Role of echocardiography in the diagnosis and evaluation of severity of mitral and tricuspid stenosis.
 The presence, severity, and hemodynamic consequences of mitral and tricuspid stenosis can be determined by echocardiographic techniques.
 In mitral stenosis two-dimensional echocardiographic imaging allows definition of leaflet anatomy and dynamics, subvalvular disease, ventricular function, and involvement of other valves.
 Spectral and color Doppler echocardiographic techniques permit accurate measurement of transvalvular gradient, determination of functional orifice area, evaluation of associated valvular regurgitation, and assessment of pulmonary artery pressures.
 These approaches are of recognized clinical value, and they provide additional diagnostic information that is unavailable from clinical assessment alone in a significant number of patients.
 Compared with available invasive diagnostic standards of reference, echocardiographic data have been found to be comparable in accuracy.
 In tricuspid stenosis echocardiographic imaging and Doppler techniques provide an assessment of valve morphology and function that should be similarly useful in clinical management decisions, although rigorous comparative studies have not been performed.
 Currently, carefully done echocardiographic studies are a definitive means of establishing the presence and significance of mitral stenosis and tricuspid stenosis, thereby obviating the need for invasive evaluation in many patients, reducing risk, and potentially decreasing the cost of diagnostic assessment.
