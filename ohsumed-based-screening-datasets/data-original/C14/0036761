Preservation of skeletal muscle in tissue transfers using rat hindlimbs.
 Replantation of major extremities after long periods of ischemia can lead to viable replants in many cases, but functional restoration is often poor owing to fibrosis of the muscle.
 In this study, maximum hypothermic time in tissue transfers containing skeletal muscle using hindlimbs of Lewis rats preserved in 4 degrees C Euro-Collins solution was investigated.
 After preserving midthigh amputated legs in this solution for 6, 9, and 12 hours, the legs were transplanted to other inbred rats using microsurgical technique, and 1 week later, gastrocnemii were obtained to analyze ATP, ADP, and AMP using high-performance liquid chromatography.
 The values were compared with those for healthy legs, nonischemic operated control legs, and legs preserved in the same manner for 6, 9, and 12 hours.
 Histologic and serologic examinations were conducted.
 ATP values of the 9-hour preservation group resumed those of the nonischemic operated control group, with the values of the 12-hour preservation group remaining at 61 percent.
 Histologically, focal necrosis, hyaline degeneration, and regeneration processes were the most characteristic manifestations in the muscles transplanted after cold ischemia of 12 hours.
 It was concluded that skeletal muscle could be preserved for 9 hours in 4 degrees C Euro-Collins solution.
