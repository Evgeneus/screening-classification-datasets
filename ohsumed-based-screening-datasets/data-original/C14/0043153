The NACI Registry: an instrument for the evaluation of new approaches to coronary intervention. The NACI Investigators.
 The New Approaches to Coronary Intervention (NACI) Registry was developed to collect in-depth data about patients whose coronary artery lesions are being treated with new interventional techniques such as atherectomy, stents, and laser devices.
 The NACI Registry database distinguishes among several possible "modes" for device use, such as preparatory, planned definitive, and bailout use.
 Common definitions are used for data collection across all devices, and device-specific forms are used to record procedural details.
 NACI's unique modular form design facilitates thorough data collection, even for the most complex treatment scenarios.
 The database structure allows for data analysis at the patient, procedure, lesion, and device levels, as required to perform in-depth analyses of the immediate and long-term success of new devices.
 Once adequate knowledge of basic device performance has been collected, the Registry structure can also allow expeditious planning and performance of randomized trials comparing a new device to conventional PTCA.
