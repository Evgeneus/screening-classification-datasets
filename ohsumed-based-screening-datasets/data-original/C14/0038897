A new technique for sheathless percutaneous intraaortic balloon catheter insertion.
 Intraaortic balloon counterpulsation is helpful for controlling myocardial ischemia and providing hemodynamic support, but its applicability is limited by lower extremity ischemic complications in a significant percentage of patients.
 We developed a new sheathless technique for percutaneous intraaortic balloon catheter insertion which reduces the effective catheter diameter.
 A pilot study using this new technique resulted in a 10% rate of limb ischemia, without compromise of balloon function.
 We conclude that this technique may be useful in reducing the incidence of limb ischemia associated with intraaortic balloon counterpulsation.
