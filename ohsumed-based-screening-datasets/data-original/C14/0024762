Histological study of white blood cells and their association with lipodermatosclerosis and venous ulceration.
 The number of white blood cells per mm2 has been determined in serial histological slides taken from punch biopsies of skin from the goiter region in patients with varicose veins.
 In eight patients the varicose veins were complicated by lipodermatosclerosis of the skin, and in a further six there was a history of ulceration.
 In uncomplicated varicose veins there was a median of 6 white blood cells per mm2, in patients with lipodermatosclerosis there were 45 white blood cells per mm2, and where there was a history of ulceration, 217 white blood cells per mm2.
 No change in white blood cell content was observed after the venous pressure was raised for 30 min by sitting the patient with the lower limb dependent.
 White blood cell infiltration of the skin is associated with lipodermatosclerotic changes caused by venous insufficiency.
