Orifice variability of the stenotic aortic valve: evaluation before and after balloon aortic valvuloplasty.
 The effects of balloon aortic valvuloplasty on orifice variability of the stenotic sclerocalcific aortic valve were evaluated by hemodynamic measurements of aortic valve function in 14 patients before balloon aortic valvuloplasty, during nitroprusside infusion before valvuloplasty, 48 h after valvuloplasty and during nitroprusside infusion 48 h after valvuloplasty.
 Aortic valve function was assessed by aortic valve area calculations with use of the Gorlin and Cannon formulas.
 Nitroprusside infusion before balloon aortic valvuloplasty caused no change in mean aortic valve gradient but a significant increase in mean aortic transvalvular flow from 186 +/- 46 to 202 +/- 61 ml/s (p less than 0.05), in Gorlin aortic valve area from 0.49 +/- 0.17 to 0.53 +/- 0.21 cm2 (p less than 0.05) and in Cannon aortic valve area from 0.45 +/- 0.18 to 0.49 +/- 0.22 cm2 (p less than 0.05).
 Nitroprusside infusion 48 h after valvuloplasty induced no change in mean aortic valve gradient but a significant increase in mean aortic transvalvular flow from 214 +/- 61 to 254 +/- 78 ml/s (p less than 0.005), in Gorlin aortic valve area from 0.71 +/- 0.25 to 0.83 +/- 0.32 cm2 (p less than 0.01) and in Cannon aortic valve area from 0.78 +/- 0.33 to 0.88 +/- 0.40 cm2 (p less than 0.05).
 Forty-eight hours after valvuloplasty, nitroprusside infusion induced a larger increase (40 +/- 40 ml/s) in mean transvalvular flow than before valvuloplasty (16 +/- 27 ml/s; p less than 0.05) and a larger increase (0.12 +/- 0.14 cm2) in Gorlin aortic valve area than before valvuloplasty (0.05 +/- 0.07 cm2; p less than 0.05).
