Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management of isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly.
 Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is a common disorder in the elderly, carrying with it a high risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.
 Environmental and age-related factors believed to contribute to ISH include obesity, declining physical activity, stress, and such dietary changes as increased salt intake and decreased intake of calcium and potassium.
 Increased rigidity of the aorta resulting in reduced compliance is an important hemodynamic feature, but factors that increase peripheral resistance also appear to play a role.
 Antihypertensive drugs have been shown to effectively and safely lower the systolic blood pressure elevations characteristic of ISH.
 To date, use of low drug doses and careful titration of dosage have avoided significant orthostatic hypotension and undue lowering of the diastolic pressure.
 Studies of relatively small groups of patients suggest that antihypertensive drugs can lower the risk of cardiovascular morbidity/mortality associated with ISH but the definitive answer awaits results of the ongoing large-scale Systolic Hypertension in the Elderly Program trial.
 In the interim, management should begin with conservative measures such as weight loss, salt restriction and, possibly, calcium supplementation.
 If this fails, drug therapy should be considered in patients with systolic blood pressures above 180 mm Hg and in those with systolic readings between 160 and 180 mm Hg who have concomitant cardiovascular risk factors.
 To date, no controlled trials of sufficient size have demonstrated that one drug class is more effective than another in treating ISH.
 Drug therapy should be tailored to the individual patient, starting with a low dose of a single drug and, if necessary, slowly increasing dosage until a systolic blood pressure under 160 mm Hg is attained.
