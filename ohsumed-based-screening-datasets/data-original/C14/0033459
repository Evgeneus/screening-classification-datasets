Post stenotic aneurysm in popliteal artery entrapment syndrome.
 In a retrospective review of 74 cases of Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome collected over a 16 year period, 10 cases of aneurysm were found (13.5%).
 This represents an incidence of 26% of the 38 cases of popliteal aneurysm of any etiology seen during the same period of time.
 In contrast to atherosclerotic aneurysms, these aneurysms were seen in a young age group (21-30 years of age) and all were associated with popliteal entrapment.
 Evidence is presented to support our opinion that these aneurysms are post-stenotic in origin.
 We feel that young adults with symptoms of leg ischaemia and evidence of an aneurysm of the popliteal artery should be investigated for popliteal entrapment and treated before complications occur.
 We have found a posterior approach to be the most satisfactory method of exploring the popliteal fossa.
