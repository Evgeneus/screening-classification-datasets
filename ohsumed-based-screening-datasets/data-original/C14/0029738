ACE inhibitors in the elderly.
 As the population with hypertension becomes older, it is important to determine the properties of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in the elderly.
 The pharmacokinetics and efficacy of captopril, enalapril, and a new once-daily ACE inhibitor, quinapril for the treatment of hypertension in young and elderly patients are reviewed, and the safety profiles of these agents in young and elderly patients are discussed.
 Although the safely profile of all three drugs is very favorable, quinapril tended to be better tolerated by patients of all ages in comparative clinical trials.
