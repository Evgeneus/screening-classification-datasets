Extended release felodipine in essential hypertension. Variations in blood pressure during whole-day continuous ambulatory recording.
 Intraarterial blood pressure (BP) monitoring during free ambulation (Oxford technique) was carried out in 12 essential mild-to-moderate hypertensive patients undergoing 4 weeks treatment with felodipine, 10 mg given once daily in an extended release formulation.
 Compared to placebo, felodipine significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure throughout 24 h.
 The greatest reduction was observed at 10 AM, 3 h after drug administration (-32 +/- 6/-24 +/- 5 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, P less than .001).
 Hourly BP values remained significantly lower up to and including the 24th hour during felodipine extended release treatment (-18 +/- 5/-11 +/- 3 mm Hg, P less than .001).
 Felodipine extended release also reduced 24 h blood pressure variability, evaluated on the standard deviation of each hourly mean (from 16.3 +/- 0.9/12.6 +/- 0.6 to 13.4 +/- 0.6/10.4 +/- 0.6 mm Hg, P less than .01).
 Furthermore, absolute BP values dropped significantly at the peaks of dynamic exercise (bicycle ergometer: from 248 +/- 13/123 +/- 11 to 204 +/- 24/102 +/- 13 mm Hg, P less than .001), isometric exercise (hand grip: from 232 +/- 18/133 +/- 16 to 180 +/- 20/101 +/- 16 mm Hg, P less than .001), and cold pressor test (from 229 +/- 20/127 +/- 14 to 178 +/- 22/99 +/- 15 mm Hg, P less than .001).
 In conclusion, felodipine extended release exerts a good antihypertensive effect which is maintained for 24 h and reduces the level of blood pressure peaks reached under different physical stresses.
