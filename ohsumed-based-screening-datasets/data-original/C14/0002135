Spinal extradural cavernous hemangioma.
 Three cases of isolated spinal extradural cavernous hemangiomas are reported, two in the thoracic and one in the lumbar region.
 One of them manifested as acute cord compression, the other two as chronic progressive myelopathy or radiculopathy.
 A total excision or subtotal excision with irradiation was performed.
 All of them had good functional recovery.
 The clinical picture, radiological diagnosis, and optimal method of treatment are discussed.
 The relevant literature is reviewed.
