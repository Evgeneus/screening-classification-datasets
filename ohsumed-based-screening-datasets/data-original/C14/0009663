Crico-tracheal disruption and common carotid artery occlusion: a case of blunt trauma.
 A case of blunt trauma to the neck is presented.
 While driving an all terrain vehicle (ATV), a 20-yr-old male was struck across the anterior neck by a cord suspended between two poles.
 Initial findings were suggestive of an isolated laryngeal injury; 48 hours later, however, a dense left hemiplegia became manifest.
 A CT scan demonstrated a large right frontoparietal cerebral infarct, and an angiogram confirmed occlusion of the right common carotid artery.
 Intractable cerebral oedema developed, and the patient died five days after the initial insult.
 Such injuries should alert the clinician to the possibility of major vascular injury, and if suspected, angiography is warranted.
