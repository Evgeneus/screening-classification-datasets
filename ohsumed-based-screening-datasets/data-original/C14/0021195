Small bowel enteroscopy: an early experience in gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin.
 Peroral small intestinal enteroscopy was performed in 35 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal bleeding of unknown origin by using a prototypic Sonde-type enteroscope.
 The median value for patient age was 69 years; duration of bleeding, 2 years (range, 2 months to 9 years); and transfusion requirements, 9 units.
 Bleeding was occult in 54% of these patients.
 Placement and passage of the enteroscope was performed by a gastrointestinal endoscopy assistant.
 Mean passage time was 4.3 hours.
 Complete passage was obtained in 14% of the patients, passage into the mid-distal ileum in 69%, and passage only into the jejunum in 17%.
 The diagnostic yield was 26%, with the majority of lesions encountered being mucosal vascular malformations.
 Small intestinal enteroscopy is a reasonable diagnostic procedure before embarking on visceral angiography and surgical exploration when standard endoscopic and radiologic methods fail to disclose a diagnosis.
