Nutritional assessment of patients with extended left ventricular assist device support.
 The nutritional status of nine patients with end-stage heart disease who were supported by a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for more than 30 days while awaiting cardiac transplantation was evaluated.
 Nutritional status was indicated by the following scale: 0-2, adequate nourishment; 3-5, moderate malnourishment; greater than 5, severe malnourishment.
 This scale was based on serial assessments of albumin, transferrin, total lymphocyte count, percentage of ideal body weight, midarm circumference, triceps skinfold, and arm muscle circumference.
 Each variable was compared with established standards before implantation and before transplantation times and assessed 1 point if less than the normal value and 0 points if within the normal range.
 At the time of LVAD implantation, 5 patients had a score of 0-2, 3 patients had a score of 3-5, and 1 patient had a score greater than 5.
 At the time of cardiac transplantation, 7 patients had a score of 0-2, 2 patients had a score of 3-5, and no patients had a score greater than 5.
 The patients who were able to meet at least 50% of their daily caloric and protein requirements by oral intake alone were noted.
 At LVAD implantation, only 2 patients (22%) met this requirement; however, 6 patients (67%) met this requirement at the time of cardiac transplantation.
 All 9 patients underwent cardiac transplantation, and 8 survived.
 Thus, it appears that extended LVAD support and maintenance of hemodynamic stability allow patients to regain the desire and ability to achieve adequate nutritional status, which may considerably reduce their perioperative transplant risks.
