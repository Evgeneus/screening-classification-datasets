The unstable ST segment early after thrombolysis for acute infarction and its usefulness as a marker of recurrent coronary occlusion.
 To investigate the incidence of early recurrent ST elevation after intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction, 12-lead electrocardiograms were continuously monitored for 571 +/- 326 minutes in 31 patients presenting within 4 hours of symptom onset.
 The study group comprised 9 women and 22 men (mean age +/- standard deviation 53 +/- 12 years), with ST elevation (anterior in 15, inferior in 16) on the initial electrocardiogram, who were given either tissue plasminogen activator (22 patients) or streptokinase (9 patients).
 Angiography was performed in 30 of 31 patients at 7 to 10 days.
 Early (less than 3 hours) resolution of ST elevation occurred in 19 patients (61%) at a median of 94 minutes (interquartile range 57 to 113) after thrombolysis, whereas 12 (39%) had no or late (greater than 6 hours) resolution.
 Eleven of the 19 with early resolution (58%) had either transient (5 patients) or sustained (6 patients) recurrences of ST elevation.
 Recurrent ST elevation was equal to or more than the initial peak elevation in 9 of 11 patients, and greater than 75% of initial peak in 2.
 A total of 25 episodes of recurrent ST elevation were observed in the 11 patients (19 transient and 6 sustained episodes), of which 8 (32%) were silent.
 The proportion of silent episodes was similar for transient (35%) and sustained (33%) recurrences.
 All patients with sustained recurrent ST elevation had at least 1 preceding transient recurrence.
 The median duration of transient recurrent ST elevation was 43 minutes (28 to 63).
