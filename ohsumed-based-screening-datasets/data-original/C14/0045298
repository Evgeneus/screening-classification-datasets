Simultaneous measurement of all thrombosis parameters from native human blood: usefulness in monitoring efficacy and complications of thrombolytic therapy.
 The sequelae of thrombus formation, both by shear forces and by collagen fiber, the subsequent coagulation, and the dislodgement of thrombi (thrombolysis) were measured from a small volume of nonanticoagulated blood sample, by a new instrument.
 Addition of streptokinase (SK) or tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) to the blood sample eliminated the need for anticoagulation for thrombolysis measurement: clot lysis preceded and allowed thrombolysis to occur.
 The test revealed activation of platelets and coagulation by SK and rt-PA.
 Apart from this general trend, platelet reactivity in response to plasminogen activator showed great individual variation.
 Whether the greatly enhanced (42%) or prolonged hemostasis (13%), observed in different blood samples with rt-PA, could be used as a predictor of reocclusion or bleeding complications remains to be established.
 Thrombolysis did not occur in 12% of the samples tested.
 These thrombolysis models may be useful for developing new agents for the dissolution of platelet-rich thrombi.
 It is suggested that this technique be used for monitoring thrombolytic therapy.
