Evaluation of the perforating veins of the lower extremity using high resolution duplex imaging.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate duplex imaging as a means of assessing perforating veins in patients with longstanding venous stasis ulceration.
 Thirty patients with nonhealing venous stasis ulcers and twenty normal volunteers serving as controls were evaluated with a standard 8-MHz imaging probe and integrated pulsed Doppler.
 The internal diameter of perforating veins was measured and perforators were grouped into one of four categories based on functional criteria: competent perforator with venous flow (C); incompetent perforator with venous flow (IC); competent perforator with arteriovenous flow (C-AVC); incompetent perforator with arteriovenous flow (IC-AVC).
 Sixteen of the patients with ulcers were subsequently studied by ascending venography and in 11 patients, intraoperative identification of perforating veins was made during the Rob procedure.
 In this subset of patients the vessel was categorized as competent or incompetent regardless of flow signal.
 There were significant differences in mean perforator diameter between ulcer patients and normal volunteers.
 Duplex imaging identified 93 perforators and venography a total of 70.
 In all 16 extremities, duplex imaging made the diagnosis of significant perforating vein incompetence, verified by venography.
 Intraoperative findings demonstrated an excellent correlation with duplex imaging.
 We believe duplex imaging to be a promising new modality for evaluation of the perforating veins of the lower extremity.
