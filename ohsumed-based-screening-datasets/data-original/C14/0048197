Low-dose isradipine once daily effectively controls 24-h blood pressure in essential hypertension.
 In one study of 10 patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, equivalent total daily doses (13 +/- 2 mg) of isradipine given twice daily and a modified-release formulation of isradipine (isradipine MR) given once daily were found to control adequately 24 h ambulatory blood pressure compared with placebo (P less than .001 for each v placebo).
 In another study of 22 patients with essential hypertension, 5 and 10 mg isradipine MR once daily has been shown to reduce the average 24 h blood pressure by 11 +/- 1/6 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001) and 13 +/- 2/9 +/- 1 mm Hg (P less than .001), respectively, compared with placebo.
 There was no loss of efficacy with isradipine MR during the 24 h observation period with either dose.
 In conclusion, low-dose isradipine MR once daily is an effective first-line treatment in essential hypertension.
