Transcription, storage and release of atrial natriuretic factor in the failing human heart.
 1.
 In this study the relationship between the synthesis of atrial natriuretic factor at the level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and the atrial storage and circulating plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor were investigated in 15 patients with heart failure.
 The patients underwent right and left heart catheterization before cardiac surgery for valve replacement or coronary artery bypass grafting.
 2.
 Plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were correlated to atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA.
 Atrial levels of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA and plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor exhibited a close correlation to both pulmonary artery pressure and left atrial pressure.
 No relationship, however, could be found between the right atrial content of atrial natriuretic factor and both the expression of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA in the atria and the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor.
 3.
 From these data it may be concluded that increased plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor in the pressure- and/or volume-overloaded heart are associated with an elevated level of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA.
 We suggest that not only plasma levels of atrial natriuretic factor but also the expression of atrial natriuretic factor in the atrial are related to left ventricular filling pressures in the failing human heart.
