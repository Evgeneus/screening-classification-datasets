Continuous vectorcardiography in cardiac surgery: natural course of vector changes and relationship to myocardial oxygen uptake.
 Continuous vectorcardiography was registered before and during the first 18 hours after cardiac surgery in 53 patients.
 QRS vector changes (QRS-VD) occurred during the operation, but no further changes were observed postoperatively.
 The ST vector (ST-VM) increased during the operation, and a further slight increase occurred postoperatively.
 Perioperative myocardial infarction occurred in three patients.
 Their ST-VM was higher than the average in patients without myocardial infarction, while QRS-VD did not differ from the average pattern.
 Twelve other patients were studied in pacemaker-induced moderate tachycardia.
 QRS-VD increased in proportion to heart-rate changes (rs median = 0.93, p less than 0.01).
 QRS-VD also correlated with myocardial oxygen uptake (rs median = 0.62, p less than 0.05).
 The ST-VM responses were not uniform.
 The data suggest that vectorcardiogram variables can provide information related to myocardial energy metabolism.
