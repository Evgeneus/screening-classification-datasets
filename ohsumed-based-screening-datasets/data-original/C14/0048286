Myocardial distribution of indium-111-antimyosin Fab in acute inferior and right ventricular infarction: comparison with technetium-99m-pyrophosphate imaging and histologic examination 
 In a postmortem study of a 69-yr-old female patient who had suffered 2 yr previously a non-Q-wave anterior infarction and who had sustained just seven days earlier a left inferior and right ventricular infarction, the distribution of 111In-antimyosin Fab was compared to the results of 99mTc-pyrophosphate imaging and histologic examination.
 Indium-111-antimyosin Fab imaging could not be performed because of cardiogenic shock.
 However, postmortem gamma scintillation counting revealed increased activities of antimyosin Fab in the inferoapical and right ventricular infarcted regions in which 99mTc-pyrophosphate positive imagings were observed; in contrast, a histologically confirmed old subendocardial anterior infarction had no definite activity.
 Thus, the myocardial distribution of 111In-antimyosin Fab corresponded well to the results of 99mTc scintigrams and histologic examinations in a human heart, suggesting that this technique could be useful in vivo for detecting several-day-old myocardial infarction of the right ventricle as well as the left ventricle.
 Tissue from the 2-yr-old infarction was not identified by this technique.
