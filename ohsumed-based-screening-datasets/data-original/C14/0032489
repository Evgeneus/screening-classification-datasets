Epicardial coronary artery tone and reactivity in patients with normal coronary arteriograms and reduced coronary flow reserve (syndrome X) 
 The vasomotor response of proximal and distal angiographically normal coronary artery segments was studied in 12 patients with syndrome X, 17 age- and gender-matched patients with chronic stable angina and 10 control subjects with atypical chest pain and a normal coronary arteriogram.
 Ergonovine (300 micrograms by intravenous injection) and isosorbide dinitrate (1 mg by intracoronary injection) were administered to all patients.
 Computerized coronary artery diameter measurement (angiographically normal segments only) was carried out before and after the administration of ergonovine and nitrate.
 Baseline intraluminal diameters (mean +/- SEM) of proximal and distal coronary segments were not significantly different in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease (proximal 2.88 +/- 0.19, 3.01 +/- 0.13 and 2.86 +/- 0.13 mm; distal 1.57 +/- 0.09, 1.70 +/- 0.10 and 1.61 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively).
 With ergonovine, proximal segments constricted by 10 +/- 2%, 7 +/- 2% and 11 +/- 3% and distal segments by 12 +/- 3%, 14 +/- 3% and 14 +/- 2% in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively (p = NS).
 With isosorbide dinitrate, proximal coronary segments dilated by 11 +/- 2%, 10 +/- 2% and 8 +/- 2% (p = NS) and distal segments by 15 +/- 2%, 11 +/- 3% and 13 +/- 2% (p = NS) in control subjects and patients with syndrome X or coronary artery disease, respectively.
 Within groups, constriction in response to ergonovine and dilation in response to nitrate were not significantly different in proximal and distal segments.
