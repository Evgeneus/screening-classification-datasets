Improved compliance measures: applications in an ambulatory hypertensive drug trial.
 To assess the value of improved monitoring of medication-taking behavior in a drug trial, we employed a modified pill vial with microcircuitry to record the precise times when the vials were opened.
 After a 3-week placebo washout period, 21 ambulatory subjects with mild hypertension (mean age, 57 years; 67% men; 76% white) randomly received isradipine or enalapril twice daily in a double-blind titration during 10 weeks.
 Both drugs achieved a 13% reduction in sitting diastolic blood pressure (p less than 0.01) with minimal symptomatic or laboratory toxicity.
 Although pill counts indicated near-perfect compliance (92% to 99% for both groups), the electronic monitor showed that fewer than half of all openings occurred at the prescribed interval of 12 +/- 2 hours.
 Modest overdispensing was documented in the 3 days before scheduled visits.
 The monitor confirmed that pill count misclassified compliance sufficiency in 22% of visits and permitted more discrete attribution for drug-associated adverse reactions and secondary resistance to treatment.
 We conclude that the electronic monitor reduces ambiguity about medication compliance and helps interpret both the biology and pharmacology of the trial.
