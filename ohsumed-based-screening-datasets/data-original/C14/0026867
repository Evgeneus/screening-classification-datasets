Reproducibility of quantitative planar thallium-201 scintigraphy: quantitative criteria for reversibility of myocardial perfusion defects.
 Fifty-two paired stress/delayed planar 201TI studies (27 exercise studies, 25 dipyridamole studies) were processed twice by seven technologists to assess inter- and intraobserver variability.
 The reproducibility was inversely related to the size of 201TI perfusion abnormalities.
 Intraobserver variability was not different between exercise and dipyridamole studies for lesions of similar size.
 Based upon intraobserver variability, objective quantitative criteria for reversibility of perfusion abnormalities were defined.
 These objective criteria were tested prospectively in a separate group of 35 201TI studies and compared with the subjective interpretation of quantitative circumferential profiles.
 Overall, exact agreement existed in 78% of images (kappa statistic k = 0.66).
 We conclude that quantification of planar 201TI scans is highly reproducible, with acceptable inter- and intraobserver variability.
 Objective criteria for lesion reversibility correlated well with analysis by experienced observers.
