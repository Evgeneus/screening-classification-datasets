Ascites after rupture of dissecting aortic aneurysm into the right atrium.
 We report successful repair of an aneurysmal aorta-right atrial fistula causing intractable ascites.
 The clamped "ascending aorta" was drained for mixed return after perfusion through the femoral vessels and opened during hypothermic arrest.
 Return cannulation through the fistula permitted definitive repair.
