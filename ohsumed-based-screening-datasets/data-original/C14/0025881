Habitual leisure-time physical activity is associated with differences in various risk factors for coronary artery disease.
 Various risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) were compared in 100 healthy, male factory workers, divided into two groups of 50 each on the basis of their leisure-time activity.
 The two groups, designated as sedentary and physically active, were similar in terms of age and body mass index, but the physically active group had a significantly slower pulse rate.
 In addition, the plasma glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose load were significantly lower in physically active individuals.
 Furthermore, fasting plasma triglyceride concentration was significantly lower and the high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration was higher in the physically active individuals.
 Thus, substantial benefits in terms of CAD risk were associated with increased leisure-time physical activity.
