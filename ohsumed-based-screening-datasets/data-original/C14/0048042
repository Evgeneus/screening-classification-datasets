Effect of nitroglycerin on coronary collateral function during exercise evaluated by quantitative analysis of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography.
 A noninfarcted, entirely collateral-dependent myocardial region provides an opportunity to assess the effect of nitroglycerin on coronary collateral function during exercise.
 Stress thallium-201 computed tomography was performed in seven patients with effort angina and no history of myocardial infarction, both before and after nitroglycerin (0.3 mg).
 All patients had single-vessel disease with total or subtotal (99% with delay) occlusion of proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and well-developed collaterals.
 The pressure-rate product, mean blood pressure, and heart rate at peak exercise did not differ before and after nitroglycerin.
 The size of the perfusion defect and the severity of ischemia during exercise estimated by quantitative analysis of thallium-201 single photon emission computed tomography were significantly less after nitroglycerin administration (extent score: 23 +/- 17 vs 7 +/- 9, p less than 0.01; severity score: 20 +/- 22 vs 3 +/- 4, p less than 0.05).
 The pressure-rate products at peak exercise did not differ before and after nitroglycerin, which suggested that the reduction in perfusion defect size was unlikely to be the result of decreased myocardial oxygen consumption.
 These results suggest that nitroglycerin improved coronary collateral function during exercise and thus prevented exercise-induced myocardial ischemia.
