Hypertension in African-Americans.
 A considerable disparity exists between African-Americans and US Caucasians in the incidence, severity, and management of hypertension.
 As a consequence, overall hypertension-related morbidity and mortality rates are at least threefold to fivefold higher in African-Americans than in Caucasians.
 Alarmingly high frequencies of stroke, end-stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, and left ventricular hypertrophy occur in African-Americans.
 To bring this crisis under control will require a renewed commitment to expanded research, improved public health measures, and more effective clinical intervention.
 Current hypertension control programs must be expanded and adequately funded.
 In addition, primary prevention of hypertension should be strongly recommended for the US population, especially African-Americans.
