Iloprost attenuates the increased permeability in skeletal muscle after ischemia and reperfusion.
 Increased vascular permeability is an early and sensitive indicator of ischemic muscle injury, occurring before significant histologic or radionuclide changes are evident.
 We investigated the effect of iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analog, on microvascular permeability in a rat striated muscle model.
 In six control and six experimental animals the cremaster muscle was dissected, placed in a closed-flow acrylic chamber, and suffused with a bicarbonate buffer solution.
 Dextran labeled with fluorescein was injected intravenously as a macromolecular tracer, and microvascular permeability was determined on the basis of clearance of the fluorescent tracer.
 Two hours of ischemia were followed by 2 hours of reperfusion.
 In the experimental group iloprost (0.5 microgram/kg/min) was given in a continuous intravenous infusion.
 Microvascular permeability increased significantly during reperfusion in both control and experimental animals (p less than 0.0001).
 Treatment with iloprost, however, significantly attenuated this response compared to the control group, 4.8 +/- 0.3 versus 7.3 +/- 0.5 microliters/gm/min, respectively (p less than 0.0001).
 Iloprost decreases the rise in vascular permeability after ischemia and reperfusion.
 Experimental clinical use of iloprost under controlled conditions in the treatment of patients with acute skeletal muscle ischemia appears justified.
