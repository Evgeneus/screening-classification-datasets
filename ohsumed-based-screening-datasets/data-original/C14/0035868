Triiodothyronine-enhanced left ventricular function after ischemic injury.
 Hypothyroidism is associated with profound left ventricular dysfunction.
 Brain-dead organ donors and patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass are chemically hypothyroid with significantly reduced circulating free triiodothyronine (T3).
 To test the hypothesis that T3 enhances left ventricular function in a hormonally deficient environment, a total of 36 healthy New Zealand White rabbit hearts were studied using a modified Langendorff preparation with Krebs-Henseleit perfusate and intra-ventricular balloon.
 In 9 normal rabbit hearts a cumulative dose-response curve with logarithmically increasing doses of T3 was obtained.
 The vehicle solution for T3 dissolution served as control (n = 9).
 Left ventricular function was assessed from peak developed pressure at baseline and after T3 administration.
 Triiodothyronine had no effect in normal hearts on peak developed pressure or end-diastolic pressure.
 In 18 rabbits, the acute effect of T3 administration after ischemia was investigated.
 Preischemic left ventricular function was measured to serve as baseline, and hearts were subjected to 37 degrees C global ischemia.
 Triiodothyronine (n = 9) or vehicle (n = 9) was infused during reperfusion, and left ventricular peak developed pressure was measured at 30 and 60 minutes of reperfusion.
 Recovery of function (expressed as percent return of left ventricular peak developed pressure) was significantly improved within 15 minutes of reperfusion (65.0% +/- 2.1% versus 80.2% +/- 4.1%) and remained significantly improved throughout the reperfusion period (p less than 0.05 by analysis of variance).
 These data suggest that although T3 possesses no inotropic properties, it significantly improves postischemic left ventricular function.
 The rapidity of the functional improvement suggests that these effects may be due to plasma membrane-mediated mechanisms.
