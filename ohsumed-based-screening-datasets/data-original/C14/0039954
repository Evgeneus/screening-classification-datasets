Quantitative thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography during maximal pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with adenosine for assessing coronary artery disease.
 The diagnostic value of maximal pharmacologic coronary vasodilation with intravenously administered adenosine in conjunction with thallium-201 single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for detection of coronary artery disease was investigated in 101 consecutive patients who had concomitant coronary arteriography.
 Tomographic images were assessed visually and from computer-quantified polar maps of the thallium-201 distribution.
 Significant coronary artery disease, defined as greater than 50% luminal diameter stenosis, was present in 70 patients.
 The sensitivity for detecting patients with coronary artery disease using quantitative analysis was 87% in the total group, 82% in patients without myocardial infarction and 96% in those with prior myocardial infarction; the specificity was 90%.
 The sensitivity for diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients without infarction with single-, double-and triple-vessel disease was 76%, 86% and 90%, respectively.
 All individual stenoses were identified in 68% of patients with double-vessel disease and in 65% of those with triple-vessel disease.
 The extent of the perfusion defects, as quantified by polar maps, was directly related to the extent of coronary artery disease.
 In conclusion, quantitative thallium-201 SPECT during adenosine infusion has high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing the presence of coronary artery disease, localizing the anatomic site of coronary stenosis and identifying the majority of affected vascular regions in patients with multivessel involvement.
