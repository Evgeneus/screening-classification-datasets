Disturbed secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with persistent atrial standstill: endocrinologic silence.
 Persistent atrial standstill is a very rare pathophysiologic condition whose diagnosis is established when both electrical and mechanical silence of the atria are confirmed.
 To test the hypothesis that secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide is disturbed in patients with persistent atrial standstill, the response of atrial natriuretic peptide secretion and other neurohormonal factors during exercise was investigated in three patients with a rate-responsive ventricular demand (VVI) pacemaker implanted for confirmed persistent atrial standstill.
 The results were compared with those observed in eight normal subjects and patients with a rate-responsive VVI (Group A) or atrial demand (AAI) (Group B) pacemaker implanted for confirmed sick sinus syndrome.
 Patients in Group A displayed significant elevation of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide secretion both before and during exercise (122.5 +/- 14.8 and 207.5 +/- 8.3 pg/ml, respectively) compared with those in Group B (55 +/- 14.1 and 116.4 +/- 51.5 pg/ml, respectively) and the normal subjects (18.9 +/- 9.8 and 30.8 +/- 19.2 pg/ml, respectively).
 This indicated development of a nonphysiologic increase in atrial volume or pressure overload, or both, in rate-responsive VVI pacing because of lack of atrioventricular synchrony.
 However, patients with persistent atrial standstill had undetectable (less than 10 pg/ml) or almost undetectable secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide as well as lower levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate in the circulation both before and during exercise.
 Changes in plasma catecholamines during exercise were similar in patients with persistent atrial standstill compared with the other groups.
 This study indicates that "endocrinologic silence" accompanies electrical and mechanical silence of the atria, which may constitute a third diagnostic clue to persistent atrial standstill.
