Prognostic indices of survival in patients supported with temporary devices (TAH, VAD).
 In an attempt to identify current indications and patient selection criteria for the use of mechanical circulatory support, we reviewed our experience in 83 patients who received a total artificial heart (TAH; n = 43), ventricular assist device (VAD) (n = 13), centrifugal pump (n = 17) or extracorporeal membrane oxigenation (ECMO) (n = 8) as a bridge to transplantation (Group I, n = 50) or for recovery from heart failure (Group II, n = 33).
 Comparing patients successfully transplanted (n = 20) or weaned (n = 9) who survived initial hospitalization, and those who died on mechanical support, there were no differences in preoperative renal, hepatic or pulmonary functions.
 Postoperative urinary output and bilirubin levels were the earliest variables affecting survival, and urinary output 24 hours after implant was discriminative in patients who survived (p less than 0.01).
 Age (above or below 40 years) and modality of terminal heart failure (acute versus chronic) were the most important factors affecting survival in the bridge to transplant group: 82% of young patients with acute decompensation were transplanted and 63% are long-term survivors while all patients over 40 years with chronic heart failure died on mechanical support (MS).
 In postcardiotomy patients, duration of cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) was significantly different comparing survivors with those who died in either bridge or recovery groups and all patients who had a CPB greater than 4 hours died on MS or after transplantation or weaning.
 In conclusion, preoperative indices indicating reversibility of multiple organ dysfunction remain to be identified.
