Cholesterol screening in a black inner-city pediatric population.
 A screening for total blood cholesterol levels was conducted by the University of Louisville Department of Family Practice in association with the National Youth Sports Program in Louisville, Kentucky.
 On May 30, 1987, 224 inner-city children between 10 and 16 years of age were tested; 109 (49%) were girls and 115 (51%) were boys.
 All participants were black.
 Of the entire population, the girls had a slightly lower mean level of cholesterol than the boys (160 mg/dL vs 165 mg/dL, respectively).
 Because of the large number of participants aged 10 to 14 years (211), this subset of children was studied more closely.
 In this age group, 47 (22%) of the children were at moderate risk for future cardiovascular disease and 48 (23%) were at high risk.
 The serum cholesterol levels were relatively constant in all children until age 12, after which a slight reduction occurred.
 This decrease is more evident in boys.
 Our study also showed a correlation between increased blood cholesterol and above normal weight/height indices (ie, Quetelet scores), with nearly 70% of all children having elevated cholesterol levels also exhibiting above normal Quetelet scores.
 We observed no correlation between high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure in this study population.
 Dietary intervention is recommended as the initial treatment for elevated cholesterol levels in children.
