Left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension.
 Major advances in left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and hypertension have occurred in recent years.
 The ability to diagnose LVH has been improved by echocardiography, and with this technique it has been shown that evidence of LVH is an important independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
 The major cause of death in patients with hypertension and LVH is coronary artery disease.
 Therefore an understanding of the interrelationships between these two disorders is fundamental, and it is now clear that the hypertrophied ventricle is vulnerable to myocardial ischemia.
 Appreciation of the mechanisms of sudden death has also increased, although the exact situation in patients with LVH remains to be clarified.
 Regression of LVH is known to occur with the use of several different antihypertensive drugs.
 Recent studies indicate that the calcium blocking agent nicardipine, in addition to beta-blocking drugs and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, brings about LVH regression without any deterioration of left ventricular function.
 However, further studies are needed to assess the long-term benefits of this regression.
