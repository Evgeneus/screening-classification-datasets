Mixed venous oxygen saturation for differentiating stable from unstable tachycardias.
 Current antitachycardia systems are incapable of adequately distinguishing stable from unstable tachycardias.
 Previously, integration of a pressure sensor or an impedance sensor, together with electrogram analysis, has been investigated as an improved method of identifying unstable arrhythmias.
 A mixed venous oxygen saturation sensor was investigated for differentiating stable from unstable paced and induced tachycardias in 10 patients.
 During rapid pacing at 600, 500, 400, 350, 300, and 250 msec cycle lengths, mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased as cycle length decreased.
 For any given cycle length, rapid ventricular pacing tended to result in greater mixed venous oxygen desaturation compared with atrial pacing.
 Mixed venous oxygen saturation decreased similarly during induced ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths greater than 230 msec.
 However, ventricular tachycardias at cycle lengths less than or equal to 230 msec and ventricular fibrillation had no effect on mixed venous oxygen saturation until after termination.
 Subsequently, a mixed venous oxygen saturation-tiered therapy algorithm (cycle length less than or equal to 230 msec = unstable; cycle length greater than 230 msec and MVO2 greater than or equal to 6% over 30 seconds = unstable) was developed and was tested retrospectively in 113 paced and induced tachyarrhythmias in these 10 patients for detecting unstable tachycardias (defined as a decrease from baseline systolic arterial pressure of greater than or equal to 50 mm Hg at 15 seconds).
 The mixed venous oxygen algorithm had 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity compared with rate-only (rate greater than or equal to 170 beats/min) detection with 93% sensitivity and 71% specificity.
