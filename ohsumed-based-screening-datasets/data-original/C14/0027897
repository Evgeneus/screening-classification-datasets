Extraperitoneal approach for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms are characterized by dense perianeurysmal fibrosis involving the adjacent organs.
 Attempts to isolate the aneurysm can lead to operative injuries of these structures, thus increasing the rates of complications and mortality.
 In the last 12 years 45 patients with inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms underwent aneurysm resection at the Department of Vascular Surgery of the University of Rome.
 The aneurysm was resected through a standard, midline transperitoneal approach in 39 patients, through a thoracophrenolaparotomy in two patients, and through a left-flank extraperitoneal approach in the last four patients.
 The extraperitoneal approach simplified aneurysm dissection and aortic clamping with no cases of postoperative morbidity or death.
 In addition, we reviewed the CT scan findings of 12 patients surgically treated for inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 The amount of fibrosis in the anterior wall of the aneurysm was greater than in the left posterolateral aspect (p = 0.008).
 We conclude that the left-flank extraperitoneal approach is the most anatomically advantageous route for repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.
