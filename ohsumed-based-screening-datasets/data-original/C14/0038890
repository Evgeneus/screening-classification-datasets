Coronary angioplasty in octogenarians: comparisons to coronary bypass surgery.
 Coronary angioplasty was performed in 74 patients 80 years of age and older (mean 83 +/- 3).
 Single vessel coronary disease was present in 34% and multivessel coronary disease in 66%.
 Angioplasty of a single vessel was performed in 51 patients (69%), while 23 (31%) had angioplasty of multiple vessels.
 Angioplasty was successful in 59 of 74 patients (80%).
 Angioplasty was unsuccessful but uncomplicated in 12 (16%) due to (unyielding) calcified lesions or (impassable) old occlusions.
 Of these 12, 8 were discharged on medical therapy and 4 underwent elective uncomplicated bypass surgery prior to discharge.
 Three (4%) patients required emergency coronary bypass surgery due to abrupt vessel closure during the angioplasty procedure, with one hospital death (1.4%).
 Follow-up (mean 24 +/- 22 months) was obtained in all patients.
 Of the 59 successful angioplasty patients, late mortality was 10% (cardiac 7% and non-cardiac 3%).
 Survival and survival without myocardial infarction were both 90%; survival without either infarction or bypass surgery was 86%.
 Actuarial 3-year survival was 91% and 3-year freedom from death, infarction or bypass surgery was 87% by life-table analysis.
 Repeat angioplasty for restenosis was performed in 7 patients (12%) without complications.
