Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian arteries: long-term results in 52 patients.
 We studied the long-term results of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery in treating stenosis (43 patients) or occlusion (nine patients).
 In all 52 patients, the blood pressure before treatment in the arm on the involved side was at least 30 mm Hg lower than that in the opposite arm.
 Thirty-nine patients (75%) had symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency (dizziness, blurred vision, ataxia).
 Angioplasty was successful in 40 (93%) of 43 patients with stenosis and in five (56%) of nine patients with occlusion.
 In the successfully treated patients, follow-up angiograms showed absence of narrowing greater than 30% stenosis, and the blood pressure in the treated arm equaled that in the opposite arm.
 The patients were followed up for 6-48 months (mean, 29 months).
 During this time, the blood pressure in the treated arm remained normal in 41 (91%) of 45 patients.
 The symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency subsided in 28 (72%) of 39 patients.
 These results suggest that percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is useful for treating subclavian artery stenosis or occlusion.
