Comparison of different antibiotic regimens for therapy of 32 cases of Q fever endocarditis.
 We studied 32 cases of Q fever endocarditis diagnosed in France between January 1985 and December 1989 to evaluate the efficacies of the different regimens of antibiotics used for treatment.
 Each patient was monitored during the treatment (range, 12 to 60 months), and clinical and biological information was computerized.
 Various treatments were prescribed, including doxycycline alone (9 cases) or in association with rifampin (4 cases), quinolones (16 cases), or sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (1 case).
 Two patients died before the beginning of the treatment.
 Nineteen patients had hemodynamic failure and subsequently underwent valve replacement.
 Nine valve tissue cultures were positive despite previous antibiotic treatment.
 In terms of their effects on mortality, the difference between doxycycline alone and doxycycline plus quinolones is statistically significant.
 We conclude that the addition of quinolones to doxycycline is beneficial.
 On the basis of clinical, serological, and valve tissue culture results, no treatment was able to cure Q fever endocarditis within 2 years, even with a combination of antibiotics.
 We advise a minimum duration of treatment of 3 years with therapy combining quinolones and doxycycline.
