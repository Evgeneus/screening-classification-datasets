Effects of nitroglycerin and diltiazem on well-developed coronary collateral circulation in conscious dogs.
 The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of nitroglycerin and diltiazem on coronary collateral circulation.
 Studies were conducted in 8 conscious dogs instrumented for the measurement of left circumflex coronary artery (LCCA) flow, subendocardial segment lengths in areas perfused by the LCCA, and left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).
 Brief, repeated LCCA occlusions sufficiently developed collateral vessels for the resting metabolic requirement in the LCCA region.
 One week following the cessation of repeated LCCA occlusions, two-minute coronary occlusions with and without drug pretreatment were performed on separate days.
 The ischemic responses to coronary occlusions were not altered by diltiazem (50 micrograms/kg, IV), but nitroglycerin (5 micrograms/kg, IV) attenuated myocardial ischemia definitely.
 The authors conclude that nitroglycerin produces greater effects than diltiazem in attenuating myocardial ischemia in the collateral dependent zone when effects of each drug on systemic and coronary circulation were minimized by pretreatment with small doses.
