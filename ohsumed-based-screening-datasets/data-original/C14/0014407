A possible role for antiphospholipid antibodies in acquired cardiac valve deformity.
 We studied the frequency of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients undergoing cardiac valve replacement, and present the results in the context of the pathology of the valve lesions.
 Forty-eight consecutive patients undergoing valve replacement were studied.
 Of the whole group, 15 (31%) had antibody levels greater than 2 SD above the mean for a control group of healthy persons and 11 (23%) had a level of greater than 3 SD.
 There was an increased frequency of elevated antibody levels in patients with valves showing fibrocalcific change and a significant association between aPL and valve thrombus.
 The possible role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of the valve lesions is discussed.
