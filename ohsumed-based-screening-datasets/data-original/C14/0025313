Sinus parasystole.
 Sinus parasystole is the expression of a protected nondominant sinus pacemaker, which is totally independent of the dominant rhythm.
 Two forms of sinus parasystole are described: (1) an active form, where both the dominant and the parasystolic pacemakers are located within the sinus node and (2) a passive form, where the basic rhythm is ectopic and the sinus pacemaker is protected as a result of complete retrograde SA block.
 Three cases of sinus parasystole are analyzed.
 In the active form of the arrhythmia the parasystolic sinus P waves are identical to those of the basic sinus rhythm.
 The diagnosis is suggested by variably coupled premature sinus P waves occurring with mathematically related intervals.
 This relationship between the parasystolic intervals can not be precise whenever complicating factors such as modulation occur.
 The recognition of active sinus parasystole is difficult, since the parasystolic P waves do not differ from basic P waves, so that the pattern resembles that of sinus arrhythmia or sinus extrasystoles.
 The passive form of sinus parasystole is more easily recognized due to the clear-cut difference between the dominant ectopic atrial waves and the "parasystolic" sinus P waves, which manifest with variable coupling intervals and reflect mathematically related intervals in between.
