Mononeuropathy in sickle cell anemia: anatomical and pathophysiological basis for its rarity.
 Peripheral neuropathy is a rare complication of sickle cell disease.
 We report a young black woman with sickle cell anemia who developed a proximal median mononeuropathy in the setting of sickle cell crisis.
 The clinical and electrodiagnostic features are consistent with an ischemic mechanism from the sickling process.
 The pathophysiological basis for the rarity of this complication may be related to the rich anastomotic microvasculature of peripheral nerve and the unique large size of the capillaries of this vascular network.
