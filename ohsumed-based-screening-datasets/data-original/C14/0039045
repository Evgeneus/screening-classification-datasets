IgA nephropathy in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension.
 Renal glomerular changes are a well recognised complication of cirrhosis and are frequently characterised by mesangial IgA deposition.
 We report a patient with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension who developed IgA nephropathy and a nephrotic syndrome with renal histological changes classically associated with cirrhosis.
 Splenectomy with resection of a splenic artery aneurysm resulted in remission of the nephrotic syndrome.
 This case illustrates the factors which contribute to the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy in liver disease.
