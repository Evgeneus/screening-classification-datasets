Severe hypertension with segmental renal infarction following surgical removal of a retroperitoneal malignant hemangiopericytoma: a case report.
 Severe hypertension developed in a fifty-five year-old woman after surgical removal of a retroperitoneal tumor, when the renal artery was injured.
 Renal arteriography after the surgery demonstrated a segmental infarction of the right kidney.
 A close relationship between activation of the renin-angiotensin system and the development of severe hypertension was observed.
 Satisfactory control of blood pressure concomitant with reduction of plasma renin activity was achieved by a combination of an angiotensin-converting anzyme inhibitor, beta-blocking agent, and calcium-entry blocker.
 The mechanism of activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renal infarction is discussed.
