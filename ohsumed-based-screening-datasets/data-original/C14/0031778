Cardiac performance indices during hypervolemic therapy for cerebral vasospasm.
 The effect of hypervolemic preload enhancement on cardiac performance was systematically analyzed in nine patients following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 The patients ranged in age from 34 to 63 years, and none had a history of cardiac disease.
 Each patient underwent placement of a flow-directed balloon-tipped catheter and the following measurements were taken during hypervolemic therapy: pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP), central venous pressure (CVP), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume index (SVI), and left ventricular stroke work index (LVSWI).
 After baseline measurements were recorded, hetastarch or plasmanate was infused intravenously at 300 cc/hr.
 Thermal output determination and pressures were measured every 15 minutes.
 The PAWP did not correlate in a statistically significant fashion with the CVP in the ranges recorded; however, a statistically significant correlation did exist between PAWP increases and increases in CI, SVI, and LVSWI (p less than 0.01).
 There was no statistical correlation between PAWP increases above 14 mm Hg and improvement in cardiac performance as evidenced by CI, SVI, and LVSWI measurements.
 It is concluded that CVP is an unreliable index of cardiac performance during hypervolemic therapy and that, in previously healthy individuals, a PAWP of 14 mm Hg is associated with maximum cardiac performance.
