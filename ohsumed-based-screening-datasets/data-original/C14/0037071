Reference systems in echocardiographic quantitative wall motion analysis with registration of respiration.
 Registration of respiration allows analysis at the end-expiratory phase and may thus favor the use of the fixed-reference system versus the floating-reference system in echocardiographic quantitative wall motion analysis.
 Analysis is performed on two-dimensional echocardiograms of 44 normal subjects, 38 patients with anterior myocardial infarction, and 17 patients with posterior myocardial infarction.
 Two different models for wall motion analysis are applied, each using the fixed-reference system and the floating-reference system, respectively.
 In patients with anterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the anterior, septal, and apical walls, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall.
 In patients with posterior myocardial infarction, the fixed-reference system indicates severe wall motion abnormalities at the posterior wall, whereas the floating-reference system indicates less severe wall motion abnormalities almost equally at every wall.
 These findings indicate that the fixed-reference system is superior to the floating-reference system in quantification of wall motion of end-expiratory two-dimensional echocardiograms.
