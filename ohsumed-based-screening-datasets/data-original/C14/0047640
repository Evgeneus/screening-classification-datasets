Plasma sodium-potassium ATPase inhibition activity in low- and normal-renin hypertension.
 Thirty-seven subjects with low- and normal-renin hypertension (plasma renin activity less than 0.45 ng/L/sec on a 100 mmol Na diet) were studied on a 10 and 100 mmol sodium diet (100 mmol K and 25 mmol Ca) to examine the effect of varied sodium intake on plasma Na,K-ATPase inhibitory activity (NKAIA) (% inhibition).
 On the 10 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (r = 0.384, P = .019).
 On the 100 mmol Na diet, plasma NKAIA correlated with daily urinary sodium excretion (r = 0.384, P = .019).
 With the increase in sodium intake, the mean change in MAP was 0.5 +/- 7.8 mm Hg (range -12.7 to 16.3) and the mean change in plasma NKAIA was -4.2 +/- 11.2% inhibition (range -37.5 to 16).
 The change in MAP was correlated to the change in plasma NKAIA (r = 0.384, P = .019).
 Plasma NKAIA is related to mean arterial pressure or urinary sodium excretion depending on the dietary sodium intake, and is related to sodium-induced changes in MAP in low and normal renin hypertensive patients.
