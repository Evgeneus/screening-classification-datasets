Long-term results of catheter ablation of idiopathic right ventricular tachycardia 
 Ten consecutive patients with recurrent episodes of symptomatic, idiopathic, sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) originating in the right ventricle underwent an attempt at catheter ablation of the ventricular tachycardia.
 There were seven women and three men, with a mean age of 39 +/- 14 years (+/- SD).
 None of the patients had any evidence of structural heart disease.
 The VT had a left bundle branch block configuration and an inferior axis in each patient, and the mean cycle length was 313 +/- 75 msec.
 Based on the methods of induction of the VT and the response of the VT to verapamil, the VT mechanism was presumed to be reentry in six patients, triggered activity in three patients, and catecholamine-sensitive automaticity in one patient.
 Sites for ablation were guided by pace mapping, and an appropriate target site was identified in the right ventricular outflow tract in each patient.
 From one to three shocks of 100-360 J (mean total, 336 +/- 195 J) were delivered from a defibrillator between the tip of the ablation catheter (cathode) and a patch electrode on the anterior chest (anode).
 An electrophysiology test 7-9 days after ablation demonstrated that VT was still inducible in only one patient, who was treated with amiodarone.
 One other patient had a recurrence of VT 3 weeks after ablation and was treated with verapamil.
 Eight of 10 patients were not treated with antiarrhythmic medications and have had no episodes of symptomatic VT during 15-68 months of follow-up (mean follow-up, 33 +/- 18 months).
 There were no acute or long-term complications.
