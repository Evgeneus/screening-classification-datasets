Clinical results of axillobifemoral bypass using externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene 
 Seventy-six axillobifemoral grafts with externally supported polytetrafluoroethylene prostheses were performed since 1983.
 The indications for operation were absolute (aortic sepsis) in 20 (26%) patients and relative (excessive operative risk or technical difficulty) in 56 (74%) patients.
 The life-table primary patency for these operations at 4 years follow-up (mean follow-up, 2 years, 4 months) was 85%.
 We conclude that the patency results achieved in this patient series are sufficiently satisfactory to warrant use of axillobifemoral grafts in an expanded number of patients with high operative risk and need for bypass of aortoiliac occlusive disease.
