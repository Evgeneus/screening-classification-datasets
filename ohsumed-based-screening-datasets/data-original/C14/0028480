Excessive sweating: an uncommon sign of basilar artery occlusion.
 Excessive sweating of the face and, to a lesser degree, of the thorax and limbs, occurred after basilar artery occlusion in a 15 year old Saudi boy.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a limited bilateral paramedian infarction of the rostral ventral pons.
 Basilar artery occlusion in children and adolescents is a rarity.
 Excessive sweating following such a stroke is rare in any age group.
 Clinico-anatomical correlations are discussed.
