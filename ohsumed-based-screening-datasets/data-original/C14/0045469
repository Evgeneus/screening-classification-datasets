Coronary hemodynamic effects of atrial natriuretic peptide in humans.
 Studies of the effects of atrial natriuretic peptide on the coronary circulation have yielded conflicting results in animals and have not been fully investigated in human subjects.
 To further characterize the direct coronary hemodynamic actions of atrial natriuretic peptide in humans and to assess the safety of its administration in patients with coronary artery disease, incremental doses of synthetic atrial natriuretic peptide and nitroglycerin were infused into the left coronary artery in 14 patients, 11 of whom had coronary artery disease.
 Both agents caused dose-related increases in total coronary sinus blood flow.
 The largest dose of atrial natriuretic peptide given to all patients (100 micrograms) increased mean coronary sinus blood flow from 127 +/- 7 to 149 +/- 9 ml/min (p less than 0.05) and decreased coronary vascular resistance from 0.93 +/- 0.07 to 0.81 +/- 0.05 mm Hg/ml per min (p less than 0.05); mean arterial blood pressure and heart rate were not affected by this dose of atrial natriuretic peptide.
 The greatest changes in coronary sinus blood flow (+25%) and coronary vascular resistance (-18%) after atrial natriuretic peptide administration occurred in the patients with coronary artery disease and no other associated cardiovascular disease.
 The maximal effects of atrial natriuretic peptide were similar to those of nitroglycerin, and no untoward effects were observed.
 Thus, atrial natriuretic peptide is a direct coronary vasodilator in humans.
 Its maximal dose effects are similar to those of nitroglycerin and were well tolerated in this small group of patients.
 The physiologic importance and therapeutic potential of atrial natriuretic peptide in patients with coronary artery disease merit further investigation.
