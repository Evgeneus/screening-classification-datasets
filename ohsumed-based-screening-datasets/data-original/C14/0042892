The effect of nicardipine on vasospasm in rabbit basilar artery after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 This study was performed to examine the effect of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, nicardipine, on vasospasm after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) in the rabbit.
 The study was carried out in two parts: 1) effect of intravenous nicardipine (n = 45) and 2) effect of intracisternal nicardipine (n = 21).
 SAH was induced by injecting 5 ml of autologous arterial blood into the cisterna magna.
 In the intravenous study, there were five groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with vehicle (saline); 3) SAH and intravenous infusion of low-dose nicardipine (0.01 mg/kg/h); 4) SAH and intravenous infusion of high-dose nicardipine (0.15 mg/kg/h); and 5) controls without SAH.
 The intravenous infusions were started immediately after SAH and continued for 48 hours until death.
 In the intracisternal study, there were three groups: 1) SAH without treatment; 2) SAH with intracisternal administration of nicardipine (0.37 mg/h); and 3) controls without SAH.
 Intracisternal infusions were begun 70 hours after SAH and continued for 2 hours until death.
 After perfusion-fixation, the basilar artery was removed and processed for morphometric analysis.
 In the intravenous study, vessels from animals subjected to SAH were significantly narrowed when compared with controls, although after high-dose nicardipine vessel caliber was slightly larger than in the other SAH groups.
 Animals given intracisternal nicardipine showed a nonsignificant reduction of caliber as compared with controls: only 12% decrease in diameter and 22% decrease in luminal area.
 In the rabbit SAH model, nicardipine had a very modest effect on vasospasm at the doses tested.
