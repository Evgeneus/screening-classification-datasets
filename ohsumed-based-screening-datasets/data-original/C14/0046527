Iliac artery stenosis or obstruction after unsuccessful balloon angioplasty: treatment with a self-expandable stent.
 Obstruction or stenosis of the iliac artery was treated by placement of a self-expandable stent in 91 patients.
 A total of 100 lesions was treated.
 All patients had had poor results of balloon angioplasty including residual stenosis, iliac occlusion, and dissection.
 The stent used in all cases was a self-expandable stainless steel endoprosthesis mounted on a 7- or 9-French catheter and covered by an invaginated tubular rolling membrane.
 The diameter of the expanded stent varied from 7 to 12 mm.
 A total of 129 stents was placed.
 Technical success was 97%.
 Thromboses occurred immediately after placement in two patients and within the first month in six; these were mainly due to residual obstruction.
 Eighty-two (93%) of 88 patients with a follow-up longer than 3 months had no recurrent symptoms.
 Restenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia inside the stent occurred in 10 patients; these required repeated intervention in only four cases.
 In the remaining six patients, no further complications occurred.
 Our results show that self-expanding endoprostheses are of value for improving the results of inadequate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
