Incidence of aneurysms in Takayasu's arteritis.
 The angiographic findings of Takayasu's arteritis in a series of 113 patients were reviewed.
 Predominant findings were stenotic or occlusive changes, but fusiform or saccular aneurysms were also found in 36 patients (31.9%) in the various sites of aorta and its major branches.
 Multiple aneurysms were found in 15 patients.
 The most common site of aneurysms was the ascending aorta (16 patients); in 7 of the patients these were complicated by aortic regurgitation.
 Aneurysms developed in the aortic arch in 3 patients, in the descending aorta in 11, in the abdominal aorta in 7, and in the major branches of the aortic arch in 9 patients.
 In 2 patients, follow-up angiograms showed enlargement of the aneurysms, and rupture of the aneurysm occurred in 1 patient.
 Aneurysms were found even in young patients.
 A fifteen-year-old female showed a huge aneurysm in the ascending aorta as the initial manifestation of this disease.
 Thickening of the walls of aneurysms was common and characteristic.
 This study revealed the moderately high incidence of aneurysms of various sites of arteries in patients with Takayasu's arteritis.
 The authors conclude that aneurysm, as well as occlusive changes, can be a primary lesion.
