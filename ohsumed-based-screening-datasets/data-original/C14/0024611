Higher recurrence rate after coronary angioplasty in unstable angina pectoris.
 PURPOSE: Recurrent stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) is a significant problem, requiring repeat dilation in about one-third of all treated patients.
 Various clinical and procedure-related predictors have been proposed.
 Between 1983 and 1987, 257 patients underwent 322 procedures, where 380 stenoses were attempted.
 Indications were: stable angina pectoris 73%, unstable angina pectoris 22%, other indication 5%.
 The primary success rate was defined as a less than 50% remaining postprocedure stenosis.
 FINDINGS: Repeat angiograms were done for 88% of the initially successful cases, either six months after PTCA or if there was a clinical recurrence.
 Restenosis was defined as a recurrence of a more than 50% diameter stenosis.
 The restenosis rate was 33% and was significantly higher (p less than 0.05) for unstable (46%) than for stable angina pectoris (29%).
 There was a nonsignificant tendency to a higher restenosis rate in the left anterior descending artery than in the other coronary vessels.
 IMPLICATIONS: The increased restenosis rate seen after PTCA for unstable angina pectoris could be caused by a higher activity in systems affecting the proliferative processes in the smooth muscle cells of the arterial wall, which is thought to form the pathophysiologic basis for restenosis after PTCA.
