The influence of CLS 2210 on the course of myocardial infarction: a pilot study in man.
 To assess the effect of CLS 2210 (a new formulation of calcium dobesilate) on the evolution of acute myocardial infarction, 100 patients presenting their first infarct were distributed, according to their sequential admissions to the hospital, into CLS 2210-treated group (50 patients) or a comparison group (50 patients not receiving CLS 2210).
 The two groups were similar in age, sex, predisposing factors, and site of infarction.
 Intravenous infusion of CLS 2210 was begun within six hours of onset of chest pain and continued for seventy-two hours.
 Thereafter, it was given, as oral capsules, in a dose of 1,000 mg every eight hours throughout the hospitalization.
 Before and during the trial, blood samples were drawn for the measurements of serum concentrations of creatine kinase (CK), and twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained serially in each patient.
 All objective data were analyzed on a coded basis without reference to the treatment.
 In the comparison group, thirty-six to forty-eight hours was required for CK to fall to 50% of the baseline value, whereas in the CLS 2210-treated group it reached 50% of the baseline in eighteen to twenty-four hours.
 For each infarction site, a statistically significant fall was reached earlier in the CLS 2210 group.
 CK, the ECG index, and the sum of the ST segments showed earlier and more rapid improvement in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group.
 The consumption of narcotic analgesic agents and nitroglycerin was substantially less in the CLS 2210 group than in the comparison group.
