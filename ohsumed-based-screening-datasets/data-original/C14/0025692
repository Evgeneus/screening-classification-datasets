A world record marathon runner with silent ischemia without coronary atherosclerosis.
 A 62-year-old world record marathon runner was found to have silent ischemia manifested by a very abnormal stress test, whereas at autopsy nine months later, there was virtually no coronary atherosclerosis nor other disease of the coronary microvasculature.
 However, there was focal fibrosis of the papillary muscles consistent with remote ischemia secondary to possible CV.
 It is postulated that endurance-related high catecholamine levels might have been responsible.
