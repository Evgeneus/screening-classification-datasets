Diagnosis of mitral valve aneurysm by transoesophageal echocardiography.
 In a patient with mitral valve aneurysm precordial echocardiography suggested a mistaken diagnosis of infective endocarditis.
 Transoesophageal echocardiographic examination established the correct diagnosis, which was subsequently confirmed at operation.
 Transoesophageal echocardiography gives better resolution of lesions associated with the mitral valve than precordial examination and may improve the diagnostic accuracy.
