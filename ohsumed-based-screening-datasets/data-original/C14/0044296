Exercise hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism during long-term beta-adrenergic blockade in severe heart failure 
 Hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism at rest and during exercise were investigated in 21 patients with heart failure.
 The patients were evaluated before and after long-term treatment (14 +/- 7 months) with the beta-adrenergic blocking agent metoprolol.
 Clinical improvement with increased functional capacity occurred during treatment.
 Maximal work load increased by 25% (104 to 130 W; p less than 0.001).
 Hemodynamic data showed an increased cardiac index (3.8 to 4.6 liters/min per m2; p less than 0.02) during exercise.
 Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased at rest (20 to 13 mm Hg; p less than 0.01) and during exercise (32 to 28 mm Hg; p = NS).
 Stroke volume index (30 to 39 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) and stroke work index (28 to 46 g.m/m2; p less than 0.006) increased during exercise and long-term metoprolol treatment.
 The arterial norepinephrine concentration decreased at rest (3.72 to 2.19 nmol/liter; p less than 0.02) but not during exercise (13.2 to 11.1 nmol/liter; p = NS).
 The arterial-coronary sinus norepinephrine difference suggested a decrease in myocardial spillover during metoprolol treatment (-0.28 to -0.13 nmol/liter; p = NS at rest and -1.13 to -0.27 nmol/liter; p less than 0.05 during exercise).
 Coronary sinus blood flow was unchanged during treatment.
 Four patients produced myocardial lactate before the study, but none produced lactate after beta-blockade (p less than 0.05).
 There was no obvious improvement in a subgroup of patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy.
 In summary, there were signs of increased myocardial work load without higher metabolic costs after treatment with metoprolol.
