Concurrent double balloon valvotomy for combined rheumatic mitral and tricuspid stenosis.
 We expanded the application of percutaneous balloon valvotomy (PBV) to 4 adults (age 14 to 30 years, average 22.2 years) with combined rheumatic mitral and tricuspid stenosis.
 Double balloon dilatation reduced the transmitral gradient from 17.36 +/- 3.54 to 5.52 +/- 0.89 (P less than 0.025) and transtricuspid gradient from 12.65 +/- 2.67 to 3.67 +/- 0.95 (P less than 0.025).
 Mitral and tricuspid valve area increased from 0.73 +/- 0.20 to 2.57 +/- 0.67 (P less than 0.005) and from 0.77 +/- 0.24 to 2.67 +/- 0.24 cm2 (P less than 0.005), respectively.
 The procedures were well tolerated, with no significant increase in valvular regurgitation or left to right shunt across the atrial septum.
 The excellent symptomatic and haemodynamic benefits are sustained at 3-24 months follow-up.
 It is concluded that combined dilatation of stenotic valves by double balloon technique can emerge as an alternative to surgery in selected patients with polyvalvar rheumatic heart disease.
