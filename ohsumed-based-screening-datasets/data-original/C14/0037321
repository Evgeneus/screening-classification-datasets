Economic considerations that influence health policy and research.
 Cardiovascular conditions account for more medical costs than any other diagnostic category in the United States.
 Increasingly, economic constraints will shape policy related to health care and research.
 Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular condition, and despite low unit health care costs, the aggregate costs are considerable.
 However, the unit and aggregate costs of the complications of hypertension are fourfold greater and, in this economic perspective, aggressive approaches are warranted to prevent complications.
 Treatment and research strategies should be identified that could have considerable potential economic impact.
 Several strategies are suggested as a prospective guide to policy development.
 Economic considerations will be important and should be incorporated in the planning of hypertension care and research.
