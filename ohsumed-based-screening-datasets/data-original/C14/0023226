Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy with cerebral involvement.
 In a patient with angiographically proven cerebral vasculitis five months after acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE) neurological symptoms promptly responded to steroid treatment.
 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed multifocal white matter lesions in the hemispheres and the brain stem suggesting a diffuse subcortical vasculitis.
