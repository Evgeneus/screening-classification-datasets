Exercise testing and training in patients with peripheral vascular disease and lower extremity amputation.
 Patients with peripheral vascular disease have a high risk of coronary artery disease.
 The risk is even greater when the peripheral vascular disease leads to lower extremity amputation.
 Exercise testing using lower extremity exercise has been the "gold standard" for screening for coronary artery disease, but many patients with peripheral vascular disease and those with amputations have difficulty doing this type of exercise.
 Arm exercise ergometry has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative for the detection of coronary artery disease in patients who cannot do leg exercise.
 This test has also been used to determine safe exercise levels and may be able to predict the ultimate level of prosthetic use in amputees.
 Exercise training with arm ergometry also improves cardiovascular efficiency and upper body strength in poorly conditioned patients.
 Studies are needed to appreciate fully the role of exercise testing and training in the recovery of these patients after amputation.
