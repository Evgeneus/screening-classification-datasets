Therapeutic adherence in the elderly: transdermal clonidine compared to oral verapamil for hypertension.
 This double-blind, double-dummy, randomized clinical trial, conducted in elderly patients with mild hypertension, compared adherence to treatment, efficacy, side effects, and quality of life during treatment with transdermal clonidine versus oral sustained-release verapamil (verapamil-SR).
 Blood pressure declined significantly--from 148/95 mm Hg at baseline to 139/84 after titration and 135/86 after maintenance--with transdermal clonidine (n = 29), and from 156/96 to 144/85 and 148/88, respectively, with verapamil-SR (n = 29).
 Adverse event rates and quality-of-life questionnaire responses were similar in the two treatment groups.
 Transdermal clonidine was worn as directed during more than 96% of patient-weeks of treatment.
 Compliance with the oral verapamil regimen was less consistent: Verapamil-SR was taken as directed during approximately 50% of patient-weeks of therapy, and individual compliance, assessed by tablet counts, varied from 50-120%.
 In all, 86% of subjects were satisfied or highly satisfied with the convenience of transdermal therapy; 87% reported that side effects were slightly or not bothersome; 65% indicated that transdermal patches were more convenient than oral therapy; and almost 60% preferred transdermal to oral therapy.
 In this study transdermal clonidine and oral verapamil were equally safe and effective.
 A substantial majority of patients preferred transdermal to oral therapy, and adherence to treatment was greater with transdermal therapy.
