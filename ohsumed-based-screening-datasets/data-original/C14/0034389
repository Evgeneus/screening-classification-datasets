The management of geriatric hypertension in health maintenance organizations.
 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of medical care received by Medicare enrollees with hypertension in health maintenance organizations (HMOs) compared to that received by a similar group of elderly hypertensives in a fee-for-service (FFS) setting.
 DESIGN: A quasi-experimental design was used to study an historical cohort of newly evaluated hypertensive patients over a 2-year period.
 SETTING: Medicare HMO and FFS practice settings.
 PARTICIPANTS: Eight Medicare HMOs and 87 FFS primary care physicians in the same communities were selected.
 A sample of 685 elderly hypertensive patients was studied, 336 in FFS settings and 349 in HMOs.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: An expert panel of physicians selected standards of care for the management of geriatric hypertension, and medical records were reviewed.
 The results showed significant differences (P less than 0.01) in recording medications (94.5% HMO versus 88% FFS) and smoking histories (75.8% HMO versus 64.7% FFS), checking orthostatic blood pressures (9.5% HMO versus 3.3% FFS), performing funduscopy (44.4% HMO versus 27% FFS), completing cardiac examinations (90.8% HMO versus 79.8% FFS), and obtaining chest x-rays (72.8% HMO versus 64.3% FFS, P less than 0.05).
 Treatment and follow-up were similar between the two groups, except that FFS hypertensives were more likely to have medications adjusted and electrolytes ordered.
 CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that elderly hypertensives in HMOs received equal or better quality of care for most criteria compared to elderly hypertensives in FFS settings.
