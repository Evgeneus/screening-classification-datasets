Reperfusion adjunctive therapy.
 The beneficial effects of coronary thrombolytic therapy may be enhanced by certain adjunctive therapies.
 Some of these are of proven value, some appear to offer no benefit in spite of theoretical advantages, and some remain to be evaluated in clinical trials.
 Acetylsalicylic acid markedly enhances the mortality reduction of thrombolytic therapy and should be used routinely.
 There is a strong theoretical rationale for the use of heparin, but evidence for its benefit exists primarily in small angiographic trials, and convincing clinical benefit has not yet been demonstrated.
 Early intravenous beta-blockers were shown in the prethrombolysis era to confer modest benefit, but extensive data on their adjuvant use with thrombolysis are available from only one trial.
 Intravenous nitrates were demonstrated to reduce mortality in the prethrombolysis era, and are soon to be evaluated in trials employing thrombolytic therapy.
 The calcium channel blockers, in spite of a variety of theoretical benefits, have proved to be of no value acutely, and in the subacute setting, only diltiazem appears to confer benefit in the subgroup of patients with non-O-wave infarction.
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are likely to be of value in survivors of acute myocardial infarction with left ventricular dysfunction, and benefits observed with acute use in experimental infarction are now being evaluated in clinical trials.
