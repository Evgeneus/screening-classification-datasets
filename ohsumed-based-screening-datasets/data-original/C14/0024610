Importance of RAA system and the treatment of patients with ACE inhibition after myocardial infarction.
 There is activation of the renin angiotensin system after both complicated and uncomplicated myocardial infarction.
 Angiotensin II increases myocardial oxygen consumption whilst reducing coronary flow and is also directly toxic to the myocardium.
 Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors produce beneficial haemodynamic and neuroendocrine changes in patients with acute left ventricular failure, and may have a role in selected patients with cardiogenic shock.
 There is evidence to suggest that they might prevent the development of late cardiac failure by limiting the extent of post infarction ventricular dilation.
 Further research is necessary to define their role in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction.
