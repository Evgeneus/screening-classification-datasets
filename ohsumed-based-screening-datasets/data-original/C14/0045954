Stimulation of atrial natriuretic peptide and vasopressin during retrograde mitral valvuloplasty.
 Acute mitral obstruction may lead to an increase in atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) due to increased atrial pressure and a large increase in arginine vasopressin (AVP) due to simultaneous arterial and ventricular baroreceptor unloading.
 We measured ANP and AVP concentration after transseptal puncture and during percutaneous retrograde mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PRMV) in 11 patients (mean age 57 +/- 12 years; nine women) with mitral stenosis and congestive heart failure.
 Atrial septal puncture per se resulted in a significant increase in ANP and AVP without a significant change in aortic pressure.
 Subsequent PRMV led to a further increase in ANP, a transient decrease in aortic pressure from 89 +/- 7 to 45 +/- 4 mm Hg, and a large (fivefold) increase in AVP.
 ANP and AVP were no longer different from baseline values 18 to 24 after the procedure.
 This study suggests that transseptal puncture and acute mitral obstruction are major stimuli to ANP release and that combined unloading of arterial and left ventricular mechanoreceptors is a very potent vasopressinergic stimulus.
