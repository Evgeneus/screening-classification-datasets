Catecholamine responses to histamine infusion in man.
 To evaluate the effects of histamine-induced hypotension on plasma catecholamine levels, eight normal men, aged 20 to 40 years, were infused with incremental doses of histamine starting at 0.2 microgram/kg/min at a 30 degree tilt position with monitoring of blood pressure (BP) and heart rate.
 Histamine dosage was increased every 5 minutes by 0.1 to 0.2 microgram/kg/min until mean BP fell greater than 15 mm Hg or a dosage of 1.6 micrograms/kg/min was reached.
 Plasma catecholamine samples were taken between the fourth and fifth minute of each histamine dosage.
 Identical measurements were made during nitroglycerin-induced hypotension in these subjects.
 Histamine produced threefold greater increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels than did nitroglycerin for comparable decreases in BP.
 Although NE levels increased twofold to fivefold from baseline with histamine infusion, epinephrine levels increased minimally at the highest doses or not at all.
 Our data demonstrate that histamine selectively releases NE from adrenergic nerve terminals without significant adrenal catecholamine release.
 We suggest that neural NE release plays an important role in the cardiac effects of histamine.
