Extracranial vertebral artery dissection following tonic clonic seizure.
 A 34 year old woman developed cerebral infarction, following a tonic-clonic seizure.
 A vertebral artery dissection was demonstrated and may have been caused by arterial trauma during the seizure.
 This cause of morbidity following convulsive seizures may have been overlooked in the past and needs to be recognised in view of the potential benefits of anticoagulation.
