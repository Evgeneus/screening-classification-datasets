Renovascular hypertension. Difficulties in diagnosis and treatment.
 Renovascular hypertension is not easily identified clinically, and most tests are not totally reliable in detecting its presence.
 The condition may be due to fibromuscular dysplasia or congenital anomalies in patients younger than age 30 or to atherosclerosis in patients older than 50.
 The goal of treatment is to lower blood pressure and improve or maintain renal function.
 Cure or improvement of hypertension is more likely in patients with fibromuscular dysplasia than in those with atherosclerosis.
 Interventional procedures include percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, surgical revascularization, and nephrectomy.
