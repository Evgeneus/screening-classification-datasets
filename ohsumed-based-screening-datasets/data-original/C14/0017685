Wegener's granulomatosis presenting as temporal arteritis.
 A granulomatous giant cell vasculitis of the temporal artery was observed in a biopsy specimen from a patient with corresponding clinical symptoms.
 Within weeks, the new onset of pulmonary infiltrates and renal failure prompted biopsy of the patient's kidney.
 A necrotizing glomerulonephritis, compatible with a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, was present.
 Vasculitis of the temporal artery may be a feature of Wegener's granulomatosis.
