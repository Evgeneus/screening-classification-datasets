Prediction of uneventful cardioversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm from direct-current electrical cardioversion of chronic atrial fibrillation and flutter.
 The present study was undertaken to reassess prospectively the immediate and long-term results of direct-current electrical cardioversion in chronic atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and to determine factors predicting clinical outcome of the arrhythmia after direct-current cardioversion.
 Two-hundred forty-six patients underwent direct-current electrical cardioversion and were followed during a mean of 260 days.
 Multivariate analysis was used to identify factors predicting short- and long-term arrhythmia outcome.
 Cardioversion was achieved in 70% of patients with atrial fibrillation and in 96% of patients with atrial flutter.
 Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that arrhythmia duration (p less than 0.001), type of arrhythmia (fibrillation vs flutter, p less than 0.02) and age (p less than 0.05) independently influenced conversion rate.
 On an actuarial basis, 42 and 36% of patients remained in sinus rhythm during 1 and 2 years, respectively.
 Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the type of arrhythmia (p = 0.0008), low precardioversion functional class (p = 0.002) and the presence of nonrheumatic mitral valve disease (p = 0.03) independently increased the length of the arrhythmia-free episode.
 Rheumatic heart disease shortened this period (p = 0.03).
 In conclusion, patients having a high probability of conversion together with a prolonged post-shock arrhythmia-free episode can be identified.
 This may improve the cost-benefit ratio of cardioversion.
