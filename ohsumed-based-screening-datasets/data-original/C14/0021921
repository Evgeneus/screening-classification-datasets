Isolated systolic hypertension in the elderly: an epidemiologic review.
 Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is usually defined as a systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure less than 90 or 95 mm Hg.
 Systolic blood pressure has been found to increase with age in most populations studied and thus the prevalence of ISH can be expected to increase with age.
 ISH is more prevalent in elderly women than in elderly men.
 Estimates of the prevalence of ISH vary according to its definition and the number of blood pressure measurements.
 There is evidence that the prevalence of ISH is decreasing.
 Results of a survey of the prevalence of ISH in 11 countries are presented; the estimates among men aged 60 to 69 years ranged from 1% in Israel to 24% in Norway.
 Only a prospective standardized survey conducted in several countries will reveal the true prevalence of ISH.
