Comparison between prostaglandin E1 and epoprostenol (prostacyclin) in infants after heart surgery.
 OBJECTIVE--To study the dose response characteristics of prostaglandin E1 and epoprostenol (prostacyclin) and directly to compare their effectiveness as pulmonary vasodilators in infants with pulmonary hypertension.
 DESIGN--A crossover design with each patient receiving both drugs in random order.
 SETTING--Infants were studied in the intensive care unit while they were sedated, paralysed, and ventilated.
 PATIENTS--Twenty infants who had undergone corrective cardiac surgery and who were in sinus rhythm, had stable haemodynamic function, and had a pulmonary artery catheter in place.
 All infants were receiving dopamine and phenoxybenzamine.
 INTERVENTIONS--Baseline haemodynamic measurements were taken and an infusion of the first drug was started at the lowest dose: after 20 minutes the measurements were repeated and the dose increased.
 This protocol was repeated for all doses of both drugs: 10, 30, and 100 ng/kg/min of prostaglandin E1 and 5, 10, and 25 ng/kg/min of epoprostenol.
 Cardiac output was measured by the pulsed Doppler ultrasound method.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Pulmonary and systemic vascular resistances were calculated from the cardiac output and compared by the Wilcoxon signed ranks test.
 RESULTS--Both prostaglandin E1 and epoprostenol were effective vasodilators: 5 ng/kg/min of epoprostenol was equivalent to 30 ng/kg/min of prostaglandin E1.
 CONCLUSIONS--Neither drug showed pulmonary specificity.
