Regression of coronary atherosclerosis: an achievable goal? Review of results from recent clinical trials.
 During the past decade, large, placebo-controlled, randomized trials have demonstrated that the incidence of coronary events can be reduced by treating hyperlipidemia.
 In studies with angiographic end points, marked lowering of total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol with comparable increases in high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol retards the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and favors regression.
 In the Cholesterol-Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS), such therapy also prevented the appearance and worsening of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary bypass grafts.
 In the recently reported Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS), in which coronary lesions were measured quantitatively, treatment induced clear regression of coronary atherosclerosis and also markedly decreased coronary events.
 The beneficial effect on coronary lesions in these studies appears to be proportional to the degree of lipid lowering.
 In addition, new evidence suggests that aspirin and calcium antagonists might prevent the development of early coronary lesions.
 The identification and aggressive treatment of patients with high serum cholesterol levels can have a major impact on the development and evolution of coronary atherosclerosis.
