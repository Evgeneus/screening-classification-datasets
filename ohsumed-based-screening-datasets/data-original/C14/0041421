U74006F, a novel 21-aminosteroid, inhibits in vivo lipid peroxidation but fails to limit infarct size in a canine model of myocardial ischemia reperfusion.
 Peroxidation of membrane lipids has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury.
 We therefore assessed the efficacy of U74006F, a potent in vitro vitamin E-like inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, in limiting infarct size in a canine model of transient coronary artery occlusion.
 Twenty dogs underwent 2 hours of occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and 6 hours of reperfusion.
 U74006F or saline solution was administered continuously from 1 hour of occlusion to the end of the experiment.
 U74006F blunted any increase in production of conjugated dienes (an index of lipid peroxidation) at both 30 minutes (1.73 +/- 0.16 mol/L x 10(-4) vs 2.62 +/- 0.22 in control dogs, p less than 0.05) and 6 hours (1.39 +/- 0.22 vs 2.06 +/- 0.18 in control dogs, p less than 0.05) after reperfusion.
 Furthermore, 6 hours after reflow vitamin E levels tended to be lower than baseline values in control dogs and higher than baseline values in dogs treated with U74006F.
 However, analysis of infarct size indicated no statistically significant difference between the two groups when expressed either as a percentage of the left ventricle (10.4 +/- 1.8% in U74006F vs 15.2 +/- 2.4% in control dogs) or as a percentage of the area at risk (33.0 +/- 5.5% in U74006F vs 37.8 +/- 4.5% in control dogs).
 Although U74006F appeared to be a potent in vivo inhibitor of lipid peroxidation, it failed to limit infarct size after 2 hours of occlusion and 6 hours of reperfusion in this canine model.
