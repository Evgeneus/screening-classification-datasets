Serum cholesterol: attitudes and behavior of family practice residents 
 BACKGROUND.
 Given the current health promotion efforts regarding coronary artery disease, more information is needed about residents' attitudes and behaviors that relate to identification and management of patients with elevated serum cholesterol levels.
 METHODS.
 Family practice residents from eight US programs (N = 128) were surveyed in 1989 to assess their attitudes and reported practice patterns.
 Resident survey data were compared, when feasible, to published data from 1986 and 1990 surveys of practicing physicians performed by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.
 RESULTS.
 The use of faculty "key contacts" resulted in a 90% response rate (N = 115).
 Both residents and practicing physicians attributed a high degree of importance to cholesterol as a risk factor.
 Residents reported more frequent routine screening of middle-aged men than the routine screening rate of practicing physicians in 1986 (P less than .01).
 Residents reported less frequent screening of younger and older adults than of middle-aged men (P less than .001).
 Residents' threshold for the use of cholesterol-lowering medication was lower than that of practicing physicians surveyed in 1986, but higher than that of physicians surveyed in 1990.
 Compared with practicing physicians, residents did not believe they were as well prepared to counsel patients about dietary change or as successful when they tried to help patients make changes; residents reported a significantly higher rate of referral to dietitians (P less than .01).
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Residents may need more education regarding screening guidelines for children and young adults.
 A health promotion skills gap may exist that explains reported discrepancies between self-report and actual behavior and indicates that residency educators may need to pay more attention to fostering dietary assessment and counseling skills in their residents.
