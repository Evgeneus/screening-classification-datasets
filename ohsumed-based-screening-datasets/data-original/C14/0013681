Acute myocarditis simulating myocardial infarction in a child.
 Pediatric chest pain usually occurs in benign conditions.
 However, this case portrays the dramatic electrocardiographic appearance of acute myocardial ischemia in a boy with biopsy-proven myocarditis who had only mild chest pain.
 This underscores the need for eliciting a detailed history when evaluating a patient with chest pain.
 If the pain cannot be clearly attributed to chest wall phenomena, or if there are historical or physical findings suggestive of an arrhythmia or angina, then further investigation with a chest radiograph and a 12-lead electrocardiogram is recommended.
 Myocarditis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of any child whose electrocardiogram is indistinguishable from an acute myocardial infarction.
 Finally, endomyocardial biopsy allows early diagnosis and institution of therapy, which may have beneficial effect on decreasing morbidity and mortality.
 Further follow-up and research is still needed to evaluate the effect of early treatment of myocarditis on long-term myocardial function and the development of chronic cardiomyopathy.
