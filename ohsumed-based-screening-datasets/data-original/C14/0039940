Angioedema: manifestations and management.
 Angioedema is characterized by localized swelling of sudden onset affecting the skin and/or mucous membranes.
 It can be classified into hereditary and acquired forms.
 Hereditary angioedema is a rare disease inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and caused by a deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor.
 Acute attacks are life threatening and cannot be managed by antihistamines, corticosteroids, or adrenergic drugs.
 Prophylactic therapy is possible with danazol or stanozolol.
 Acquired angioedema includes nonhereditary C1-esterase inhibitor deficiency; idiopathic, allergic, and drug-induced forms; angioedema associated with lupus erythematosus and hypereosinophilia; and angioedema caused by physical stimuli.
 Treatment of these forms of angioedema depends on identifying and avoiding the cause, induction of tolerance, or symptomatic treatment with systemic antihistamines.
