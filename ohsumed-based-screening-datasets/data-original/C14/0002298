Frequency of low-grade residual coronary stenosis after thrombolysis during acute myocardial infarction.
 The clinical, angiographic and demographic characteristics of 42 patients with low-grade (less than 50%) residual stenosis at the infarct lesion after thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction (MI) were assessed.
 The study group (group I) represented 21% of 198 consecutive patients receiving thrombolytic therapy over a 59-month period.
 Data on the 156 remaining patients were pooled for comparison (group II).
 Group I patients were predominantly men (86%) who were cigarette smokers (81%).
 Group II patients were predominantly men (75%, p greater than 0.10) but were significantly older (52 +/- 12 vs 56 +/- 10 years, p = 0.02).
 Prior acute MI or angina was unusual in group I.
 Sixty percent had no significant (greater than 50%) residual coronary artery disease while 25% had residual single artery disease.
 Average significant (greater than 50% diameter stenosis) residual vessel disease was 0.6 +/- 1.0 for group I and 1.9 +/- 0.9 for group II (p less than 0.001).
 In group I, average residual infarct lesion diameter stenosis was 36 +/- 7% in the right anterior oblique and 34 +/- 8% in the left anterior oblique views.
 Thirty-nine group I patients were discharged with medical therapy and 100% follow-up was obtained over a mean interval of 18 +/- 17 months.
 Fifteen patients experienced chest pain after acute MI accounting for 17 discrete events.
 Fifty-nine percent of group I had a benign course on follow-up.
 Eight events were classified as unstable angina, 4 as acute MI and 5 as atypical angina.
 Documented coronary vasospasm occurred in 3.
