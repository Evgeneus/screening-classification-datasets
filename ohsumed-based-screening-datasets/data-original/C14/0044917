Role of extended aortoplasty related to the definition of coarctation of the aorta.
 One hundred thirty-nine patients underwent operation for coarctation of the aorta.
 Age ranged from 1 day to 21 years and weight, from 1.5 to 70.4 kg.
 Numerous methods of repair were used.
 The operative mortality was low (1.3%), and 17 patients (11.3%) died late.
 Recoarctation occurred in 13 patients (9.4%).
 We attempted to correlate mortality and recoarctation with the surgical procedure.
 A review of the literature revealed no classifications of coarctation that applied to the anatomical and pathological variations we found at the time of operation.
 Therefore, we devised a surgical classification to separate the various entities in the spectrum of coarctation: type I = primary coarctation; type II = coarctation with isthmus hypoplasia; and type III = coarctation with tubular hypoplasia involving the isthmus and segment between the left carotid and left subclavian arteries.
 Each of these types has subtypes: A = with ventricular septal defect and B = with other major cardiac defects.
 We believe that rather than labeling one procedure as "the procedure of choice," providing this classification will allow the surgeon to use a method of repair that is suited to the anatomical variation.
