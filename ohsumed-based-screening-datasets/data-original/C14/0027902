Iliopectineal bursitis: an unusual cause of iliofemoral vein compression.
 The iliopectineal bursa is the largest bursa in the region of the hip joint.
 Enlargement of the bursa occurs in several conditions and may be manifested by groin pain, a pelvic or inguinal mass, or lower extremity edema due to compression of the external iliac or common femoral vein.
 A case of lower extremity edema secondary to external iliac/common femoral vein compression caused by an enlarged iliopectineal bursa is presented.
 The pathophysiology, methods of diagnosis, and forms of therapy are discussed.
