Tricuspid valve repair for tricuspid valve endocarditis: tricuspid valve "recycling".
 Tricuspid valve endocarditis traditionally has been treated with either valve excision or valve replacement.
 To avoid implantation of foreign material in an infected field, we have applied the principles of mitral valve repair to 4 patients with tricuspid valve endocarditis.
 On preoperative echocardiography, all patients had 3 to 4+ tricuspid regurgitation, evidence of progressive right ventricular enlargement, and mobile vegetations.
 In each case, up to three quarters of the anterior leaflet was excised en bloc with infected chordae and papillary muscle heads.
 Surgical procedures included standard quadrangular resection, conversion to a bicuspid valve, and pericardial patch replacement of the anterior leaflet with mobilization of basal chordae to replace resected marginal chordae.
 On postoperative echocardiography, tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular dimensions were reduced in 2 of 4 patients in spite of loss of leaflet tissue.
 All excised valve tissue demonstrated bacteria on Gram stain or culture.
 Nonetheless, all repaired valves were successfully sterilized without recurrent infections.
 Tricuspid valve repair can allow eradication of infection with potential for improving valve competency in complicated tricuspid valve endocarditis.
