Late results of two hundred seventeen femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments.
 A 10-year-experience of 217 femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments in 207 patients is reported.
 Thirty-three femoropopliteal bypasses (15%) were performed with reversed saphenous vein and 184 (85%) with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts.
 Operative indications were gangrene in 121 (56%), nonhealing ulceration in 40 (18%), ischemic rest pain in 51 (24%), and claudication in 5 (2%) cases.
 The 5-year primary graft patency rate of these bypasses was 59% (reversed saphenous vein, 74%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 55%; p less than 0.05), the secondary 5-year graft patency rate was 61% (reversed saphenous vein, 79%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 56%; p less than 0.05), and the 5-year limb salvage rate was 78% (reversed saphenous vein, 78%; polytetrafluoroethylene, 78%).
 The 30-day operative mortality rate was 10%, and the 5-year patient survival rate was 38%.
 Eleven patients (5%) required lower extremity amputation because of progressive gangrene or extensive infection despite a patent bypass to an isolated popliteal artery segment.
 We conclude that femoropopliteal bypasses to isolated popliteal artery segments (1) have acceptable 5-year graft patency and limb salvage rates; (2) should be performed with reversed saphenous vein grafts when possible; (3) may be performed with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts if necessary, with a resulting limb salvage rate equal to that of reversed saphenous vein grafts; and (4) require sequential extension to an infrapopliteal artery in up to 20% of patients.
 In addition, the presence of an isolated popliteal artery segment is associated with a high operative mortality rate and limited life expectancy because of coronary artery disease.
