Experimental contrast-associated nephropathy and its clinical implications.
 Acute renal failure after contrast media injection has been recognized for at least 35 years but the exact mechanism responsible for the renal injury remains an enigma.
 The clinical characteristics of contrast-induced nephropathy (CAN) are well-known although more recently the nonoliguric presentation has occurred at an increased frequency--in 70 to 90% of cases.
 For nonoliguric presentation of CAN, one can expect an asymptomatic increase in serum creatinine, the mean peak occurring at 4.2 days.
 If oliguric, the fractional excretion of sodium will be less than 1% and resistant to either fluid challenge or loop diuretics.
 Preexisting renal insufficiency, with or without diabetes mellitus, increases the risk of CAN 6- to 10-fold but recovery is expected, with less than 10% of all patients requiring dialytic support.
 Despite the growing body of published reports, the lack of a suitable animal model to evaluate various proposed mechanisms of renal injury has compromised our ability to devise a technique for preventing CAN.
 A popular scheme has been proposed to describe the possible sequence by which ischemia or nephrotoxins, or both, induce acute renal failure.
 In particular, a vascular mechanism (i.e., ischemia), is an appealing explanation for CAN since acute changes in renal hemodynamics after contrast media injection have been confirmed by several animal experiments.
 Unlike other vascular beds in which contrast media induce acute vasoconstriction followed by vasodilatation, the initial effect on the renal circulation is acute vasodilatation, followed by progressive vasoconstriction, increasing renal vascular resistance and a concomitant decrease in both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.
