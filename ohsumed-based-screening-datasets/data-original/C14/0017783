Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of anomalous right coronary artery.
 Coronary angioplasty of tortuous anomalous coronary arteries can be technically challenging.
 We describe a successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) of an anomalous right coronary artery after a failed previous attempt.
 The anatomic limitations of anomalous right coronary arteries and technical considerations for PTCA are discussed.
