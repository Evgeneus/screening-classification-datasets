Difference in mortality between patients treated with captopril or enalapril in the Xamoterol in Severe Heart Failure Study 
 The double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial Xamoterol in Severe Heart Failure randomized 290 patients treated with captopril and 217 treated with enalapril to xamoterol or placebo.
 At the end of the 100-day follow-up period, the cumulative probability of survival in patients with coronary artery disease or with dilated cardiomyopathy decreased in the captopril group (90.3%) when compared with the enalapril group (97.2%).
 The excess mortality in the captopril group could not be related to the indexes of the severity of heart failure, such as baseline exercise duration, functional class, cardiothoracic ratio, ejection fraction or dose of diuretic drugs.
 Furthermore, the excess in mortality was seen in all subsets of patients examined as well as across countries.
 Examination of the dosing regimen used, however, suggests that insufficient daily dosage of captopril or the inadequate schedule of administration, or both, might be responsible for different degrees of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition between the enalapril and captopril groups and hence for the difference in mortality.
 It is important in future clinical trials to determine to what extent complete circadian angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition is necessary to provide the full benefit of this therapy in heart failure.
