Vasovagal asystole during spinal anaesthesia.
 A patient in whom vasovagal asystole was induced by the performance of a spinal anaesthetic in the upright position is described.
 This illustrates the importance of routine monitoring of the electrocardiograph during regional anaesthesia.
 The risk of vasovagal syncope may be increased by the use of the sitting position and by the omission of anxiolytic premedication.
