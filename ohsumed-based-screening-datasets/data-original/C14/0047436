Changes in the central ANF-system of renovascular hypertensive rats.
 The central atrial natriuretic peptides (ANF)-system was investigated in volume-dependent, one-kidney, one-clip (1K1C) and renin-dependent two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats by radioimmunological measurement of ANF concentration in 18 selected brain areas.
 Significant changes were found in nine brain areas of 1K1C and in eight brain areas of 2K1C hypertensive rats.
 Except undirectional changes in the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis and the supraoptic nucleus, ANF concentration was changed in the opposite direction in all other brain areas, with an activation of the central ANF system in 1K1C and an inhibition in 2K1C hypertension.
 The localization of the alterations (circumventricular organs, anteroventral third ventricle region, hypothalamo hypophyseal system, brain stem) implies major differences in the central regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte and fluid homeostasis between these two models.
 The activation of the central ANF system in 1K1C hypertension may be a compensatory mechanism to prevent further increments in blood pressure and plasma volume.
 In contrast, the depression of the central ANF system in 2K1C hypertension may promote the elevation of the blood pressure.
