The effects of cyclosporin A on eicosanoid excretion in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 Alterations in renal eicosanoid levels have been postulated as a factor in cyclosporin A (CSA) nephrotoxicity.
 The effects of CSA on renal eicosanoid excretion in rheumatoid arthritis were studied over a 24-week period, during which treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was discontinued.
 The initial dosage of CSA was 4 mg/kg/day; at week 24, the mean dosage of CSA was 3.9 mg/kg/day.
 At week 24, the mean (+/- SD) serum creatinine level (1.04 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) was 32% above the baseline value; renal blood flow had decreased by 21% (P less than 0.03) and the glomerular filtration rate had decreased by 16%.
 There was a significant increase (P less than 0.03) in the 2,3-dinor thromboxane B2 level at week 2, but there was no significant change in the levels of the other eicosanoids.
 This study demonstrates that after CSA treatment, there is a selective increase in a thromboxane metabolite that parallels an increase in renal vascular resistance, even in the absence of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, and with unimpaired formation of other vasodilator eicosanoids.
