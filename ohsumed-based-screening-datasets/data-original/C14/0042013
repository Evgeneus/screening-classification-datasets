Hypertension in young patients.
 Hypertension is often unrecognized in infants and children.
 Primary care physicians need the equipment necessary to measure blood pressure in young patients and tables or graphs showing normal values for age and sex.
 Children should have a blood pressure measurement and preventive counseling at each yearly checkup.
 Significant hypertension should never be dismissed as a temporary problem but rather should be carefully investigated, treated, and followed up.
