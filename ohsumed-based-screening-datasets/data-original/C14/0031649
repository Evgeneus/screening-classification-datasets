Axillosubclavian vein thrombosis: case report.
 Deep-vein thrombosis of the upper extremity, that is, axillosubclavian vein thrombosis, is a relatively rare and potentially overlooked diagnosis in the emergency department (ED).
 It can be the cause of significant morbidity and it may be life-threatening.
 Reported here is the case of a 23-year-old man who presented to the ED with left upper extremity pain and swelling.
 Venography confirmed the diagnosis of axillosubclavian vein thrombosis.
 Hospitalization and treatment with intravenous heparin led to a satisfactory recovery.
 The clinical presentation, predisposing factors, diagnosis, treatment, and complications of this rare entity are discussed.
