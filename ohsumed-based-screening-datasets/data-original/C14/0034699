Early results of aortic valve replacement with or without concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting.
 Early results of aortic valve replacement were reviewed in 962 unselected patients, 659 without concomitant coronary bypass surgery (AVR group) and 303 with combined valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting (AVR + CABG).
 The early (less than 30-day) mortality was 4.6% in the AVR, and 5.9% in the AVR + CABG group.
 Multivariate analysis showed coronary artery stenoses and NYHA functional class to be independent predictors of early mortality in the AVR group, and the number of distal anastomoses as the strongest predictor in AVR + CABG.
 The incidence of peroperative technical complications in the cases with fatal outcome was 27% in the AVR and 6% in the AVR + CABG group.
 The incidence of myocardial injury (new Q wave or evidence of increased enzyme leakage) was 11% in AVR and 21% in AVR + CABG.
 Independent predictors of postoperative myocardial injury were aortic cross-clamp time, year of surgery, coronary artery stenoses and NYHA class in AVR and aortic cross-clamp time and year of surgery in AVR + CABG.
 The study suggests that coronary artery disease increases risk in aortic valve replacement with or without CABG.
 Replacement should be undertaken before endstage of the disease (NYHA IV), with CABG if significant coronary disease is present, and in multivessel disease the number of distal anastomoses should be restricted in order to shorten aortic cross-clamp time.
