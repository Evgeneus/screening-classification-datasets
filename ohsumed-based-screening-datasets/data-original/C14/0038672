Clinical implications of combined hypogastric and profunda femoral artery occlusion.
 From 1983 to 1990, nine patients with combined hypogastric (HA) and profunda femoral arterial (PFA) occlusive disease presented with five nonhealing hip disarticulations, three nonhealing above-the-knee amputations, perineal necrosis in six patients, buttock necrosis in four patients, visceral ischemia in two patients, and lumbosacral spinal ischemia in one patient.
 Obviously some patients had more than one regional complication.
 Five patients died from complications of HA/PFA ischemia.
 Survivors included two patients who required a hemipelvectomy, one patient who required an axillary-to-hypogastric artery bypass graft for stump salvage, and one patient who survived despite lumbosacral paralysis and complete cystectomy.
 The 56% mortality and 100% morbidity emphasize the critical significance of combined hypogastric/profunda femoral artery circulatory compromise.
 Efforts should be made to preserve or re-establish the HA and/or PFA circulation whenever possible.
 A hemipelvectomy may be required to allow the wounds to finally heal.
 Furthermore, the certainty of an above-the-knee amputation healing is not present in these patients; therefore, a hemodynamic assessment of the healing potential of an above-the-knee amputation is required.
