Gallium-SPECT in the detection of prosthetic valve endocarditis and aortic ring abscess.
 A 52-yr-old man who had a bioprosthetic aortic valve developed Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia.
 Despite antibiotic therapy he had persistent pyrexia and developed new conduction system disturbances.
 Echocardiography did not demonstrate vegetations on the valve or an abscess, but gallium scintigraphy using SPECT clearly identified a focus of intense activity in the region of the aortic valve.
 The presence of valvular vegetations and a septal abscess was confirmed at autopsy.
 Gallium scintigraphy, using SPECT, provided a useful noninvasive method for the demonstration of endocarditis and the associated valve ring abscess.
