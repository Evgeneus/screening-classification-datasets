Progression and regression of minor coronary arterial narrowings by quantitative angiography after fenofibrate therapy.
 To study the effects of fenofibrate, a lipid-lowering medication, on patients with coronary artery disease, 191 minor coronary narrowings in 42 patients with coronary artery disease were analyzed by quantitative coronary angiography using computer-assisted contour detection.
 Computed parameters were percent diameter reduction and percent plaque area.
 A prospectively formed intervention group of 21 patients treated with special diet and fenofibrate (200 to 400 mg/day) was checked every 6 weeks with regard to risk factors.
 After a mean interval of 21 months, coronary angiography was repeated, using the same x-ray system and nearly identical projections.
 The intervention group was angiographically compared at follow-up with an untreated comparison group, also comprising 21 patients.
 Both groups had high initial serum cholesterol (mean 311 mg/dl) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (mean 235 mg/dl).
 Only among the treated patients did lipid levels change significantly: cholesterol, -19%; LDL cholesterol, -20%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, +19%; and triglycerides, -30%.
 At angiographic follow-up, the changes in percent diameter reduction and percent plaque area correlated positively with the mean serum and LDL cholesterol levels of the intervention group.
 Significant differences were found in the change in percent plaque area between both groups.
 The intervention subgroup with angiographic regressions (11 patients) had significantly lower serum and LDL cholesterol levels than the intervention subgroup with angiographic progressions (10 patients).
 These results indicate the beneficial effect of fenofibrate on minor coronary narrowings.
 Because of its high reproducibility in measuring minor narrowings, quantitative coronary angiography proved to be a suitable method for angiographic follow-up.
