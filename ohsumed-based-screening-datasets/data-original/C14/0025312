Natural history of dilated cardiomyopathy in children.
 To assess the natural history and potential risk factors in childhood dilated cardiomyopathy, we investigated 25 patients (ages 9.6 +/- 4.4 years) who presented after they were 2 years old.
 All patients had symptoms of congestive heart failure and reduced contractility with a dilated left ventricle at presentation.
 Two factors at presentation were significantly different between patients who died less than 1 year after the presentation (n = 14) and those who survived for more than 1 year (n = 9); cardiothoracic ratio (65.1% +/- 6.8% vs 57.1% +/- 6.1%, p less than 0.01) and left ventricular ejection fraction (31.3% +/- 7.0% vs 40.0% +/- 6.2%, p less than 0.05).
 Irrespective of intensive medical therapy, dilated cardiomyopathy in children had a poor prognosis; the actuarial survival rate was 41% at 1 year and 20% at 3 years.
 Other forms of therapy should be considered in the early stages of dilated cardiomyopathy in this high-risk group.
