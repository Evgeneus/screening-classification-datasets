Thromboembolism. A complication of weekly chemotherapy in the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 In a retrospective survey of 85 patients who received chemotherapy as treatment for non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the authors found that clinically apparent thromboembolic disorders occurred in four of 11 patients receiving weekly chemotherapy, and in none of 74 patients who were treated on less intensive schedules, suggesting that intensive weekly chemotherapy is thrombogenic.
 The possible mechanisms of this effect are discussed.
