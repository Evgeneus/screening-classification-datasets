Endothelial cell seeding.
 Endothelial cell seeding is the transplantation of vascular endothelial cells to denuded vascular surfaces.
 Seeding theoretically reduces the probability of graft or vessel thrombosis and of neointimal fibrous hyperplasia.
 Thus far, clinical seeding trials disclosed modest improvements in patency and the development of hyperplastic anastomotic lesions in failed grafts.
 Seeding inefficiency theoretically contributes to anastomotic hyperplasia.
 The inefficiency is linked to two steps in the seeding process, namely harvesting and cell retention.
 Of these, cell retention on the seeded surface is the more critical.
 Priorities for future research should be set first on the retention of seeded endothelium in vitro and second on improved and standardized methods of cell harvesting.
