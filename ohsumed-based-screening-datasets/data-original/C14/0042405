Non-specific aorto-arteritis (Takayasu's disease) in children.
 Digital subtraction panaorto-arteriography was performed in 32 consecutive children (21 females, mean age 10.8 years) with non-specific aorto-arteritis to assess digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in imaging these children and to study the patterns of involvement in the Indian sub-continent.
 Diagnostic quality DSA images were obtained in 21 out of 27 intravenous and nine out of 11 intra-arterial studies.
 Obstructive lesions were present in all the patients and commonly involved the abdominal aorta (24 patients) and renal arteries (20 patients).
 Aneurysms were seen in five patients and predominantly involved the descending thoracic aorta.
 Pulmonary artery involvement was uncommon (five out of 20 patients) and clinically silent.
 Based on clinical and angiographic features, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed for the management of uncontrolled hypertension in eight patients (10 lesions).
 Initial success was obtained in eight procedures (80%).
 Re-stenosis occurred after 5.5 months in one patient, but was successfully re-dilated.
 The follow-up period ranged between 5 and 16 months (mean 9 months).
 Long-term efficacy of transluminal angioplasty in the management of these children is awaited.
