Overseas fatalities of United States citizen travelers: an analysis of deaths related to international travel.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: Studies of travel-related mortality and morbidity have been limited to nonfatal events.
 Causes of travel-related mortality may differ significantly from morbidity and thus have different prevention strategies.
 DESIGN: We examined the overseas fatalities of US citizen travelers for the years 1975 and 1984.
 The death certificates were abstracted; all deaths under age 60 and a 20% sample of deaths 60 and older were examined.
 SETTING AND TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: All overseas travel fatalities of US citizens were examined excluding those occurring in Canada.
 INTERVENTIONS: None.
 RESULTS: Cardiovascular events (including myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents) and injuries accounted for 49% and 25% of the overseas deaths of US citizen travelers, respectively.
 Infectious diseases other than pneumonia accounted for only 1% of the deaths.
 Eighty percent of injury deaths occurred outside of hospitals.
 Injury death rates for male travelers were greater than US age-specific death rates.
 CONCLUSIONS: Greater emphasis on the prevention of fatal events, especially those resulting from injury, must be given by physicians and other individuals and organizations who advise travelers.
 Further studies are needed to explore the issues of preventable injury deaths, emergency medical services, and overseas travel.
