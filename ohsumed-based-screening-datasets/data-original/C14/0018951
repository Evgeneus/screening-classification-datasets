Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm with hemoptysis.
 A 53-year-old man who had previously undergone resection of a left ventricular aneurysm was admitted because of hemoptysis.
 Preoperative evaluation with computed tomographic scan and cardiac catheterization demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm of the inferior ventricular wall measuring 16 cm in diameter with protrusion into the left hemithorax.
 The neck of the pseudoaneurysm was a defect in the ventricular wall extending from the base of the mitral valve annulus to the insertion of the posterior papillary muscle.
 Operative repair was performed using an albumin-coated, low-porosity Dacron patch.
