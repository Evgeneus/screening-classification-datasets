Depressed aerobic enzyme activity of skeletal muscle in severe chronic heart failure.
 A reduction in exercise capacity is a common feature of congestive heart failure.
 We hypothesized that depressed aerobic enzyme activity of skeletal muscle may contribute to this exercise intolerance.
 Biopsy samples of vastus lateralis muscle were obtained from seven patients with severe chronic heart failure and analyzed for aerobic enzyme activity.
 Compared with normal laboratory controls, the patients with heart failure had a moderate reduction (greater than 60%) in skeletal muscle citrate synthase and a marked reduction (greater than 90%) in succinate dehydrogenase and cytochrome oxidase (all p less than 0.001).
 Depression of aerobic enzyme activity of skeletal muscle is associated with severe chronic heart failure and is likely one of the contributory factors for impaired exercise capacity seen in the advanced stages of this condition.
