Pulse oximetry compared with Doppler ultrasound for assessment of collateral blood flow to the hand.
 Ischaemic injury to the hand after arterial cannulation is a rare but well documented complication and routine testing of the adequacy of collateral circulation is widely advocated.
 The widespread availability of the pulse oximeter in the operating theatre.
 its applicability in circumstances where the patient is unable to cooperate, and its dependence on pulsatile blood flow suggest that this device could potentially be usefully applied to the assessment of collateral blood flow.
 The reliability of the pulse oximeter to detect the presence or absence of collateral circulation was prospectively compared to Doppler ultrasound in 109 hands from 64 adult patients.
 Nine hands demonstrated inadequate ulnar collateral flow, one hand demonstrated inadequate radial collateral flow and a persistent median artery was found in one hand.
 In all patients the results of pulse oximeter testing (probe placed on the thumb correlated precisely with the results obtained with the Doppler device (probe located over the lateral aspect of the superficial palmar arch).
 These results demonstrate pulse oximetry to be a reliable method of assessing collateral blood flow to the hand before arterial cannulation.
