Management of perioperative hypertension using intravenous isradipine.
 The antihypertensive action of acute intravenous isradipine was investigated during fentanyl/pancuronium/nitrous oxide anesthesia for noncardiac surgery.
 An intravenous (iv) infusion of 0.5 mg isradipine (n = 10) or placebo (n = 11) was administered double-blind over 5 min if mean arterial pressure (MAP) was greater than 110 mm Hg.
 The number of patients with a favorable blood pressure reduction (delta MAP greater than or equal to 10% with MAP less than or equal to 110 mm Hg) was 80% with isradipine and 20% with placebo (P less than .05), and the mean MAP reduction from baseline was 26 +/- 12 and 2 +/- 16 mm Hg, respectively (P less than .001).
 Due to reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system, the heart rate increased by 14 +/- 12 beats/min with acute iv isradipine.
 The antihypertensive effect was sustained for 45 min.
 Isradipine was also well tolerated.
 It is concluded that intravenous isradipine is an effective antihypertensive agent for the treatment of perioperative hypertension during noncardiac surgery.
