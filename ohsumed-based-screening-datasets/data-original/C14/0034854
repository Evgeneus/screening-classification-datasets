Bypass grafting to the popliteal artery in limbs with occluded crural arteries.
 Intraoperative completion angiograms of 47 femoropopliteal bypasses in limbs with occluded crural arteries were reviewed to identify the angiographic determinants of early outcome.
 Of 28 limbs in which the foot vessels were available for analysis, only 2 (7%) had an intact pedal circulation, and 18 limbs demonstrated no crural arteries suitable for distal reconstruction.
 The overall cumulative patency rate was 51% with a 76% limb salvage rate at 12 months.
 All seven grafts performed onto a popliteal artery segment of less than 8 cm occluded in the early period.
 The status of crural and foot arteries and the number of collaterals did not correlate well with early patency.
 Limbs with no patent crural artery that were analyzed in the poor angiographic runoff group, according to our previously reported classification, demonstrated relatively higher patency rates than the other subgroups with poor runoff.
 In cases where angiography demonstrates a poor runoff for distal revascularization, popliteal bypass with occluded crural arteries might achieve acceptable patency rates.
