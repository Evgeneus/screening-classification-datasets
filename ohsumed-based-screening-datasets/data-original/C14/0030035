Correlates of postural hypotension in a community sample of elderly blacks and whites.
 Postural hypotension is thought to be prevalent among the elderly, but few community-based studies of this condition have been conducted.
 In addition, little is known about postural hypotension in blacks despite well documented racial differences in hypertension and stroke.
 Data on 659 elderly (greater than or equal to 60 years of age) participants in a survey of two rural, biracial townships were analyzed to describe the frequency and correlates of postural hypotension.
 Twelve percent of the 659 adults experienced a drop of 10 mmHg or greater in systolic blood pressure on going from sitting to standing (supine measures were not available).
 This degree of postural hypotension was twice as common for whites as for blacks (14.5% vs 7.5%, P = 0.01).
 Postural hypotension was associated with elevated sitting blood pressure and showed positive but statistically non-significant relationships with anti-hypertensive medications and leanness.
 The association between race and postural hypotension persisted after adjusting for these and other risk factors (OR = 2.2, 95% CI:1.2,4.0).
