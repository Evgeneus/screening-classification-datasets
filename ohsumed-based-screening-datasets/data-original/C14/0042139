Delayed cardiac rupture due to blunt chest trauma.
 A 7-year-old boy fell from a 2.5-m height and suffered contusion of the thorax with hematoma in the soft tissues of the lateral chest wall.
 The rib cage itself remained intact.
 After 3 days, there was only local pressure sensitivity of the left hemithorax.
 On day 8 after the trauma, the child, who up to then had seemed to be in good health, suddenly died during lessons at school.
 Autopsy revealed a full-thickness rupture of the left ventricle with resultant cardiac tamponade.
 The macroscopic and histopathologic findings are presented and discussed.
