Surgical treatment of active native valve endocarditis.
 A report is presented of 24 patients (23 male), mean age 38 years, who underwent surgery for active native valve endocarditis of the left heart in 1975-1988.
 The aortic valve was affected in all patients, and also the mitral valve in five.
 Pre-existing aortic valve disorder was present in 17 cases (13 congenitally bicuspid 4 rheumatic affection).
 There were five hospital deaths (20.8%).
 Staphylococci as causal organism and extensive infection predicted the highest mortality and morbidity.
 The mean follow-up time was 39.7 (range 2-114) months.
 Two reoperations because of prosthetic valve dehiscence revealed endocarditis of the implanted valve.
 Strong correlation was found between favourable postoperative course and rapid normalization of C-reactive protein levels, which did not fall in patients with persistent infection.
 Early surgery is recommended if the course of bacterial endocarditis is severely complicated.
