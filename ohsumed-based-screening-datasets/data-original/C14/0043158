Ventricular fibrillation complicating endomyocardial biopsy of a cardiac allograft.
 Transvenous endomyocardial biopsy remains the most useful diagnostic aid in assessing rejection in the transplanted heart.
 Although invasive, the complications associated with endomyocardial biopsy are few, and the procedure is generally regarded as safe.
 We report a case of apparent ventricular fibrillation complicating transvenous endomyocardial biopsy.
 Histologic section revealed evidence of moderate acute rejection.
 This case represents the first report of a life threatening ventricular dysrhythmia following routine endomyocardial biopsy in a cardiac transplant recipient.
