Pathophysiological role of augmented atrial natriuretic polypeptide gene expression in DOCA-salt hypertension. Effects of atrial natriuretic polypeptide monoclonal antibody.
 To elucidate the pathophysiological significance of endogenous atrial natriuretic polypeptide (ANP) in hypertension, we investigated the biosynthesis and secretion of ANP in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive rats and also examined the effect of passive immunization with monoclonal antibody raised against alpha-rat ANP on the development of hypertension in DOCA-salt rats.
 The plasma ANP level in DOCA-salt rats was significantly elevated in comparison to control rats.
 While the atrial ANP concentration in DOCA-salt rats was not significantly altered, the atrial level of ANPmRNA in DOCA-salt rats was two-fold higher than that in control rats.
 These results suggest the augmented biosynthesis of ANP in the atrium and the oversecretion of ANP from the heart in DOCA-salt rats.
 The levels of ANP and ANPmRNA in the ventricle of DOCA-salt rats exhibited significant increases, compared with those in control rats, suggesting the induction of ANP gene expression in the ventricle of DOCA-salt hypertensive rats under pre/after overload.
 Weekly intravenous administrations of monoclonal antibody with high affinity for alpha-rat ANP significantly augmented the rise in blood pressure of DOCA-salt rats.
 These results support the hypothesis that the augmented secretion of ANP is one of the defensive mechanisms to counteract high arterial pressure in this model of hypertension.
