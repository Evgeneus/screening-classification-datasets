Flash lamp pumped dye laser for rosacea-associated telangiectasia and erythema.
 The persistence of facial telangiectasis and erythema in patients with rosacea frequently presents a major cosmetic problem.
 It may also contribute to relapses of papular and pustular lesions.
 This study of 27 patients treated for their telangiectasia and erythema with a flash lamp pumped dye laser tuned at 585 nm is described.
 The laser gave good or excellent reduction of telangiectasia and erythema and overall appearance in 24 of the patients with between one and three treatments.
 In addition, papule and pustule activity was decreased in 59.2% of the patients, with those with the most severe pre-treatment activity having the most significant improvement.
 It is suggested that this is a useful additional form of treatment that may improve the telangiectasia and erythematous component of rosacea.
