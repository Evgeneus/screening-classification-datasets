Preoperative selection for curable renovascular hypertension.
 Clinical research has defined the criteria for identifying "curable" renovascular hypertension.
 The prediction is based on the measurement of plasma renin activity in peripheral veins, renal veins, and the aorta.
 Renin profiles can be examined with the method of Laragh and coworkers (the so-called incremental method), in which values for plasma renin activity are incorporated into formulas to compute indexed parameters.
 A score is attributed to each index and the prediction is based on the final score.
 Because the identification of curable renovascular hypertension is made according to numerical rules, the method is easily transformed into a computer-assisted process.
 The program is written in BASIC, and it is short enough to run on a personal computer.
