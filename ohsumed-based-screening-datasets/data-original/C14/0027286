Renal transplant arterial thrombosis: association with cyclosporine.
 Of 136 patients who received a renal transplant between January 1984 and August 1988, there were six cases (4.4%) of allograft arterial thrombosis (AAT) occurring a mean of 23 days after transplantation.
 All were maintained on cyclosporine A(CsA) in addition to prednisone and azathioprine.
 All transplants were performed by the same transplant surgeon.
 Five of the six episodes (83%) were in allografts that had multiple renal arteries (MRA), giving an incidence of AAT in that group of 36%.
 Only one of 122 (0.8%) allografts with a single renal artery experienced thrombosis.
 CsA was started a mean of 9 days after transplantation (range, 16 to 33 days).
 There was no correlation of AAT to CsA levels.
 AAT appears to be an early complication of allografts with MRA in patients maintained on CsA.
