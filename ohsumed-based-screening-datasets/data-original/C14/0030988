Detection of intracoronary fibrin degradation after coronary balloon angioplasty.
 Intracoronary thrombus formation may be involved in the pathogenesis of arterial closure after coronary angioplasty and may contribute to restenosis.
 It is hypothesized that, unlike markers of platelet activation and fibrin formation, D-dimer, a product of plasmin-mediated proteolysis of cross-linked fibrin, is not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and could be used to study intracoronary fibrin degradation during angioplasty.
 No significant difference in D-dimer levels was noted in serial plasma samples obtained from an 8Fr arterial sheath and the wire lumen of an angioplasty balloon catheter, indicating that sampling through the catheter lumen did not induce artifactual D-dimer elevations.
 Translesion (proximal and distal to the lesion) coronary blood samples were collected in 31 patients undergoing elective coronary angioplasty pretreated with aspirin, dipyridamole and heparin.
 In 20 of those in whom translesion coronary samples for plasma D-dimer levels (mean +/- standard deviation) were collected before balloon dilation, there was no evidence of ongoing intracoronary fibrinolysis (proximal D-dimer levels, 289 +/- 145 ng/ml; distal, 299 +/- 156 ng/ml; difference not significant).
 After coronary angioplasty (n = 31), there was a relatively small, but significant (p less than 0.001) increase (45 +/- 71 ng/ml) in translesional D-dimer levels (proximal, 396 +/- 223 ng/ml; distal, 441 +/- 257 ng/ml).
 The results from this study suggest (1) D-dimer levels are not subject to significant catheter-induced artifact and may be useful for assessment of intracoronary fibrin metabolism, and (2) intracoronary degradation of fibrin can be detected after (but not before) routine coronary angioplasty despite pretreatment with antithrombotic therapy, presumably in response to balloon-induced arterial injury and fibrin formation.
