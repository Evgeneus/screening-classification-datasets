Update: drug therapy for acute myocardial infarction.
 Acute myocardial infarction is potentially a highly treatable disease.
 Immediate interventions are directed to decreasing tissue hypoxia with oxygen and improving bloodflow to ischemic myocardium using nitrates and thrombolytic agents.
 Cardiac workload should be reduced by eliminating endogenous catecholamine release with analgesia and sedation, and beta blockade in patients without CHF to decrease heart rate and myocardial oxygen demand.
 Treatment of the complications of AMI include dysrhythmia prophylaxis, monitoring and specific therapy.
 Treatment of pump failure includes using vasodilators, vasopressors and positive inotropic agents.
 Early recognition and timely initiation of appropriate therapy should be every physician's goal.
