Systemic neurohumoral activation and vasoconstriction during pacing-induced acute myocardial ischemia in patients with stable angina pectoris.
 To identify the effect of myocardial ischemia on systemic neurohormones and vascular resistance, 32 untreated, normotensive patients with coronary artery disease underwent incremental atrial pacing until angina.
 Arterial and coronary venous lactate and arterial values of catecholamines and angiotensin II were determined at control, at maximal pacing rates, and at 1, 2, 5 and 30 minutes after pacing.
 Based on pacing-induced ST-segment depression (greater than or equal to 0.1 mV) or myocardial lactate production, or both, patients were selected as ischemic (n = 25) or nonischemic (n = 7).
 Baseline clinical and hemodynamic data were comparable.
 During pacing, chest pain was similar (20 ischemic vs 7 nonischemic patients).
 Also, hemodynamic measurements were comparable, except for contractility, which did not improve, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, which significantly increased in ischemic patients.
 Moreover, during ischemia arterial pressures increased significantly (13%) and systemic resistance increased from 1,470 +/- 60 (control) to 1,632 +/- 76 dynes.s.cm-5 5 minutes after pacing (p less than 0.05) in ischemic but not in nonischemic patients.
 Pacing did not affect neurohormones in nonischemic patients.
 In contrast, norepinephrine in ischemic patients increased significantly from 1.7 +/- 0.2 (control) to 2.6 +/- 0.3 (maximal pacing) and to 3.0 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter (1 minute after pacing), whereas angiotensin II levels increased from 6.2 +/- 1.4 (control) to 9.3 +/- 2.1 pmol/liter (1 minute after pacing, p less than 0.05).
 Epinephrine only increased during maximal rates (0.9 +/- 0.1 vs 0.6 +/- 0.1 nmol/liter at control, p less than 0.05).
 Thus, myocardial ischemia activates circulating catecholamines and angiotensin II, accompanied by systemic vasoconstriction.
