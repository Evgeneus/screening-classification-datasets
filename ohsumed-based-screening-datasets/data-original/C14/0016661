A case report of giant cell arteritis of the uterus and adnexa.
 Giant cell arteritis of the uterus and adnexa is a rare disorder, which is generally asymptomatic and occasionally associated with temporal arteritis.
 The true clinical significance of this dramatic microscopic finding remains obscure, but arteritis of the uterus and adnexa may be associated with later development of giant cell arteritis elsewhere in the body.
