Management of valvular heart disease: an illustrative cases approach.
 As indicated by the 22 illustrative cases included in this monograph, a stepwise approach to the assessment of valvular heart disease provides the information necessary to make good clinical decisions.
 The ECG and chest x-ray add useful information to the history and physical examination.
 Echocardiography, Doppler, and color flow Doppler techniques have an important role in defining the presence and severity of valvular stenosis and regurgitation.
 Nuclear techniques provide useful information about global biventricular systolic function, regional wall motion, and myocardial perfusion.
 Exercise testing is most valuable in confirming objectively the patient's functional status and exercise tolerance.
 Newer imaging techniques, such as cine CT and MRI, are capable of displaying and measuring cardiac chamber size and myocardial thickness; however, visualization of the cardiac valves and demonstration of flow abnormalities are difficult, limiting the current usefulness of these techniques in patients with valvular heart disease.
