Normal and diffusely abnormal myocardium in humans: functional and metabolic characterization with P-31 MR spectroscopy and cine MR imaging.
 The current study tested the concept that cine magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and phosphorus-31 MR spectroscopy might be used to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the functional and metabolic status of the myocardium in humans.
 Thirteen patients with congestive cardiomyopathy and eight healthy volunteers were imaged at 1.5 T with the one-dimensional chemical shift imaging technique for localization of P-31 MR spectroscopy and an electrocardiographically referenced gradient refocused sequence for imaging of the heart.
 Prominent peaks in the PDE and PME regions were observed in cardiomyopathic patients, but only the former peak was measured.
 The PCr/beta-ATP peak ratio was not significantly lower in cardiomyopathic patients compared with healthy subjects (1.51 +/- 0.08 vs 1.54 +/- 0.04).
 The ratios of PDE/PCr (0.80 +/- 0.07 vs 0.54 +/- 0.10) (P less than or equal to .01) and PDE/beta-ATP (1.19 +/- 0.10 vs 0.84 +/- 0.08) (P less than or equal to .05) were significantly higher in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy compared with healthy volunteers.
 Left ventricular systolic wall thickening was significantly lower and left ventricular peak and end-systolic wall stress and mass were significantly higher in cardiomyopathic patients compared with healthy volunteers.
 Thus, localized, gated P-31 MR spectroscopy combined with cine MR imaging allowed identification of both abnormal myocardial phosphate metabolism and abnormal ventricular function.
 While this study suggests that increased myocardial PDEs may be a marker for abnormal myocardium, the sensitivity and specificity of this marker need to be further evaluated.
