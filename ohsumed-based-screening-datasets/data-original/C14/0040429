Selective spinal panangiography: use of a 4-F braided catheter with a soft-tip configuration.
 A 4-F braided catheter with a soft radiopaque tip was used in selective spinal panangiographic procedures.
 Results obtained with the catheter were compared with those obtained in procedures with conventional catheters.
 The catheter was used in the intercostal, lumbar, and sacral arteries.
 Advantages of using this catheter include excellent maneuverability, reduced patient exposure to contrast medium, and reduced fluoroscopy duration.
