The "all-autogenous" tissue policy for infrainguinal reconstruction questioned.
 In 33% of patients referred for infrainguinal reconstruction for limb-threatening ischemia (mean preoperative ankle-arm index [AAI] = 0.26), no suitable autogenous reconstruction was possible.
 In 40% of cases, intraoperative pre-bypass contrast arteriography was necessary to identify a graftable tibial or pedal artery.
 The results of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and autogenous bypasses were compared after 1 to 3 years.
 After 1 year, patency was 85% and 67% for autogenous and PTFE bypasses, respectively.
 Limb salvage was 90% for autogenous bypass and 70% for PTFE bypass.
 Cumulative patency rates at 3 years were 80% for autogenous and 57% for PTFE grafts.
 Graft surveillance with duplex scanning and AAI was valuable in detecting failing grafts.
 For both types of reconstruction, secondary procedures were required to maintain patency.
 We attribute the excellent results with PTFE in part to long-term aspirin and warfarin therapy.
 In cases of combined superficial femoral and severe infra-popliteal occlusive disease, PTFE bypass is an excellent alternative when no autogenous conduit is available.
