Magnesium sulfate reverses experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats.
 We induced experimental delayed cerebral vasospasm by the intracisternal injection of greater than 0.5 ml blood in 30 rats.
 Seventy-two hours later the basilar artery was exposed via the transclival approach and photographed at high-power magnification through an operating microscope.
 We then evaluated the effect of topical (n = 30) and intravenous (n = 20) magnesium sulfate on the spastic artery by computerized image analysis.
 A greater than 50% reduction in baseline diameter of the basilar artery was observed in the rats subjected to subarachnoid hemorrhage compared with the 10 controls (p less than 0.0001).
 Intravenous magnesium sulfate dilated the spastic artery to approximately 75% of the baseline diameter in control rats (p less than 0.0001).
 Topical magnesium sulfate caused dramatic dilation of the basilar artery in both the control and the subarachnoid hemorrhage groups to near 150% of the baseline diameter in the controls (p less than 0.001).
 All rats receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate reached therapeutic plasma levels of the ion.
 Hemodynamic effects were mild and immediately reversible upon cessation of magnesium sulfate administration.
 We suggest that magnesium has a role in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced vasospasm in humans.
