End-to-end repair of aortic coarctation using absorbable polydioxanone suture.
 Based on previous laboratory work, we have used polydioxanone absorbable suture in a variety of vascular and cardiac repairs in pediatric patients.
 However, some investigators have expressed concern about the potential for aneurysm formation at the anastomotic site.
 Between March 1983 and June 1989, 15 patients (7 male, 8 female) aged 2.5 months to 9.2 years (mean, 3.7 years) had resection of coarctation of the aorta and end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone absorbable suture.
 Thirteen patients have returned for routine postoperative evaluation, the follow-up time ranging from 11 to 49 months (mean, 23 months).
 Noninvasive two-dimensional, pulsed-wave Doppler and color echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging studies demonstrated good anatomical repair and no anastomotic aneurysm formation or residual coarctation of the aorta in any patient after end-to-end anastomosis with polydioxanone.
 In summary, this intermediate follow-up study has revealed no vascular complications related to the repair of coarctation with absorbable polydioxanone suture.
