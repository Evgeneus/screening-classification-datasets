Late complications involving the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery: recognition and management.
 Pseudoaneurysms and dissecting aneurysms of the ascending aorta after cardiac surgery are uncommon but important complications.
 Pseudoaneurysms, which result from extravasation of blood into the mediastinum, most commonly occur at the site of aortotomy or aortic cannulation.
 Infection may play an important role.
 Dissecting aneurysms after cardiac surgery usually occur at the site of aortic incision or cross clamping, especially in atherosclerotic aortas.
 Both conditions may be clinically silent but more frequently are seen with significant symptoms.
 Noninvasive techniques including CT scan, MRI, and echocardiography are very useful in the diagnosis of both complications, with contrast aortography remaining the definitive method.
 Surgical repair is necessary for dissecting aneurysms and for enlarging and symptomatic pseudoaneurysms, with improving morbidity and mortality.
