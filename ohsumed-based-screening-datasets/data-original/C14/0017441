Two urokinase dose regimens in native arterial and graft occlusions: initial results of a prospective, randomized clinical trial.
 The effects of two urokinase (UK) dose regimens on lysis time, lytic success, primary clinical success, and frequency of complications of peripheral thrombolysis were compared.
 Seventy-two intraarterial UK infusions were performed by means of standard catheter-directed infusion techniques in 63 patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial or bypass graft occlusions.
 Patients were prospectively randomized to high-dose (250,000 U/h for 4 hours and then 125,000 U/h) or low-dose (50,000 U/h) regimens.
 The mean time to complete lysis was 20.8, 26.0, 16.5, and 18.2 hours for the high-dose artery, low-dose artery, high-dose graft, and low-dose graft groups, respectively (P was not significant).
 Respective mean infusion durations were 27.1, 35.4, 22.2, and 25.3 hours.
 Clinical success was achieved in 65%-85% of cases.
 The frequency of complications was equivalent between groups, except for a higher frequency of minor bleeding complications in the high-dose group.
 The two urokinase dose regimens studied were equally effective in enabling peripheral thrombolysis.
