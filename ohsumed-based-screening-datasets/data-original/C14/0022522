Intravenous enalaprilat therapy for hypertension.
 The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor enalapril is available for intravenous administration in the form of enalaprilat.
 Intravenous enalaprilat is indicated for the management of hypertension when oral therapy is not feasible.
 However, there are no reports of intravenous enalaprilat therapy exceeding one week in duration.
 We report the case of a critically ill, 39-year-old woman who received intravenous enalaprilat for the management of hypertension for a period of 21 days.
 The patient's blood pressure and heart rate were controlled adequately on a regimen of enalaprilat 1.25 mg iv piggyback q6h without any apparent adverse effects.
