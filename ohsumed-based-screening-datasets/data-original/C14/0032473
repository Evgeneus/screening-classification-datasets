Results of balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty as a palliative procedure in tetralogy of Fallot 
 Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty was attempted in 67 patients with tetralogy of Fallot at a median age of 5 months (range 0.03 to 52 months) for relief of cyanosis.
 In three patients, the valve could not be crossed and an aortopulmonary shunt was performed.
 In 35 patients, follow-up angiography was performed 3 to 30 months (average 12) after valvuloplasty.
 In 24 of these 35 patients (group A), the stenosis had been adequately palliated by valvuloplasty; the other 11 patients (group B) had required an aortopulmonary shunt 1 month (range 0 to 3 months) after valvuloplasty.
 The two groups were similar (p greater than 0.1) with respect to age at valvuloplasty, pulmonary anulus diameter, ratio of pulmonary artery to descending aorta diameter before valvuloplasty and interval to follow-up angiography.
 In contrast to patients in group B, patients in group A had a significant immediate improvement in systemic arterial oxygen saturation (p less than 0.01) and a significant increase in pulmonary anulus diameter at follow-up angiography (p less than 0.001).
 The growth of the branch pulmonary arteries was similar (p greater than 0.1) in the two groups.
 Among 42 patients who have had surgical correction, a transannular patch for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction was used in 27 (64%); there was no difference between groups A and B with respect to its use.
 Eight patients died (three after repair) and death could not be directly attributed to valvuloplasty in any.
 Balloon valvuloplasty promotes growth of the pulmonary valve anulus and pulmonary arteries and is a useful alternative to an aortopulmonary shunt in patients with small pulmonary arteries or associated complex intracardiac defects.
