Aortoiliac surgery in renal transplant patients.
 Fifteen patients who had undergone renal transplantation 3 months to 25 years earlier were operated on for treatment of complicated aortoiliac atherosclerosis; eight had aneurysms and seven had stenotic or obstructive lesions.
 Except for the first patient, operated on in 1973, in whom the kidney was protected by general hypothermia, no special measure was used to protect the kidneys.
 A transient increase in creatinemia occurred in 11 patients during the postoperative period, whereas creatinine values remained unchanged in the other four.
 All patients had regained renal function identical to the + preoperative state in less than 10 days; three of them had significant improvement as a result of correction of a lesion that was impairing renal blood flow.
 Results obtained in this series show that protection of the transplant during aortic surgery is not necessary, provided an adequate surgical technique is used.
 This technique avoids the complex methods employed in the majority of previously reported cases and appears to be a safe procedure.
