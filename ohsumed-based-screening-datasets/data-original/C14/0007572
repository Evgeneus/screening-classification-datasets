Use of auscultation to follow patients with mitral systolic clicks and murmurs.
 Mitral systolic clicks and murmurs together with associated symptoms constitute a major reason for cardiologic referral.
 Although echocardiography with Doppler study enables characterization of the mitral valve apparatus and quantification of regurgitation, its use has resulted in an overemphasis of the technical diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse and an undervaluation of diagnosis based on physical examination.
 To determine the clinical significance of an auscultatory classification of mitral systolic clicks with or without precordial systolic murmurs, 1 consultant's medical records of 291 patients with these signs were reviewed.
 Based on initial auscultatory findings, patients were divided into: (1) single or multiple apical systolic clicks with no murmur (n = 99); (2) single or multiple apical systolic clicks and a late systolic murmur (n = 129); and (3) single or multiple apical clicks and an apical pansystolic murmur or murmur beginning in the first half of systole (n = 63).
 The average duration of patient follow-up was 8 years (range 1 to 30).
 The prognosis was excellent for patients from all 3 classes.
 Two cardiac-related deaths occurred: 1 each from classes 1 and 2.
 Mitral valve surgery was performed in 3 class 2 patients (2%) and in 2 class 3 patients (3%).
 No patients developed endocarditis during follow-up.
 Palpitations, with varying anxiety overlay, constituted a major indication for cardiologic referral in all 3 classes.
 Auscultatory findings were valuable to the physician for explanation and relief of patient anxiety.
 For patient management, use of an auscultatory classification may be preferable to the technically generated term "mitral valve prolapse.".
