How much testing is needed after myocardial infarction?
 Both physicians and patients should be encouraged by the tremendous progress made in the clinical care of patients with heart disease during the last 20 years.
 However, the number of invasive and noninvasive tests is vast, so they need to be applied judiciously, using a reasonable set of clinical principles to recognize the needs of the individual patient.
 In the case of myocardial infarction, one of the most important prognostic factors is left ventricular systolic function, which is commonly measured by the ejection fraction.
 This measurement can be made with a left ventriculogram, radionuclide ventriculogram, or two-dimensional echocardiogram, the choice depending on individual circumstances.
