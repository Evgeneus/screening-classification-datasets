Effects of exercise on transmitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure in patients with mitral stenosis or a prosthetic mitral valve: a Doppler echocardiographic study.
 Doppler echocardiography was used to determine changes in transmitral gradient and pulmonary artery pressure after exercise in 12 patients with mitral stenosis and 11 patients with a prosthetic mitral valve.
 The mean transmitral gradient in the mitral stenosis group was 9 +/- 7 mm Hg at rest and increased to 17 +/- 8 mm Hg after exercise.
 In patients with a prosthetic mitral valve, exercise resulted in an increase in mean transmitral gradient from 5 +/- 2 to 8 +/- 3 mm Hg.
 Calculated pulmonary artery systolic pressure increased with exercise from 41 +/- 19 to 70 +/- 32 mm Hg in the mitral stenosis group and from 28 +/- 8 to 39 +/- 15 mm Hg in patients with a prosthetic valve.
 Exercise Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of changes in transmitral gradient and pulmonary artery systolic pressure was found to be technically simple and an important addition to the noninvasive evaluation of patients with mitral valve disease.
