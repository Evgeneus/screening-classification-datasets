Use of the perforated balloon catheter to infuse marker substances into diseased coronary artery walls after experimental postmortem angioplasty.
 A perforated balloon catheter was used in human coronary arteries after postmortem angioplasty had been performed.
 The catheter used has a standard angioplasty balloon with a pattern of laser-produced holes, 25 microns in size, which generate streams of fluid under pressure.
 Studies of the routes by which marker substances enter diseased arterial tissue when infused by the perforated balloon after experimental angioplasty are described.
 A colored marker dye entered the new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty, but did not extend greater than 2 cm either proximal or distal to the perfused segment.
 Horseradish peroxidase entered tissue not only from the lumen and adventitia as occurs with its infusion into normal tissue with the perforated balloon, but also extended from new crevices and dissection planes created by the angioplasty.
 Platelet aggregation, coagulation and cell proliferation, the likely causes of restenosis after angioplasty, originate in the sites of greatest tissue disruption and blood stasis.
 These postmortem studies suggest that active drugs are delivered to the arterial wall in a manner likely to be effective in preventing these events.
