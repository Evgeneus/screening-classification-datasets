Practical considerations in treating the elderly hypertensive patient.
 More than half of all older Americans die of cardiovascular diseases.
 Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, and its prevalence increases with age.
 Older patients are both at higher risk for end-organ complications and less likely than younger ones to survive such complications as myocardial infarction and stroke.
 Clinical studies have shown that reduction of elevated blood pressure is beneficial in many older persons.
 Optimal selection of antihypertensive therapy requires consideration of the special characteristics of the elderly, who differ from their younger counterparts in physiology, response to therapy and frequency of concomitant illnesses and medications.
 Calcium antagonists are particularly effective in these patients; other agents are useful in selected situations.
 Drugs that are likely to cause central nervous system side effects or orthostatic hypotension generally should be avoided in this patient population.
 Therapy should begin with a low dose and be titrated upward slowly, thus avoiding excessive reduction of blood pressure and the development of orthostatic hypotension.
 Treatment should be altered as necessary to minimize side effects that may impair quality of life or lead to poor compliance.
