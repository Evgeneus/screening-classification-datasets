Conventional versus thrombolytic therapy in spontaneous (effort) axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis.
 Effort axillary-subclavian vein thrombosis in young patients has produced long-term disability because of the failure of the thrombosed vein to recanalize.
 Ten consecutive patients treated in our institution were analyzed.
 All patients were diagnosed by venography.
 Four patients received thrombolytic therapy.
 Three of these had complete resolution and one had partial resolution of the symptoms and thrombus, that was confirmed by venography and duplex imaging.
 The remaining six patients were treated with conventional anticoagulant therapy.
 Three of these patients had no resolution, one had complete resolution of both symptoms and thrombus, and two had only partial resolution of symptoms but no resolution of thrombus.
 Thrombolytic therapy appears to be superior to anticoagulation in the dissolution of symptoms in effort vein thrombosis and should be considered in its management if the diagnosis is made early.
