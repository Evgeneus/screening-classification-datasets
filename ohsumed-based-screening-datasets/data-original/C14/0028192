A public health approach to cholesterol. Confronting the 'TV-auto-supermarket society'.
 Coronary heart disease has been proved to be associated with a "high-risk" diet and with elevated blood cholesterol levels.
 The National Cholesterol Education Program has embarked on a campaign based on intensive medical treatment of 60 million Americans with high blood cholesterol levels, but the degree of benefit of dietary change or pharmaceutical intervention or both to reduce blood cholesterol values remains a subject of disagreement within the scientific community.
 Evidence from comparative international studies suggests that to lower coronary heart disease mortality substantially, dietary alterations and general societal changes must be greater than those possible under the National Cholesterol Education Program's approach of physician-centered patient counseling.
 The nation's priority to prevent coronary heart disease should be a public policy approach, the goal of which is to reduce for the entire population all coronary disease risk factors.
 In the dietary area, three proposals to reduce the availability of atherogenic foods are the use of warning labels on atherogenic foods, the prohibition of advertising for such high-risk foods, and the imposition of an excise tax on the same foods.
 We must confront the "TV-auto-supermarket society" that underlies our nation's high rate of coronary heart disease.
