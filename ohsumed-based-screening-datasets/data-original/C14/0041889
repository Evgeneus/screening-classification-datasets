Innominate artery occlusive disease: surgical approach and long-term results.
 We reviewed our experience with 54 patients who underwent innominate artery revascularization during a 10-year period.
 Their age range was from 16 to 75 years (mean, 49.8 years).
 The innominate artery alone was involved in 21 patients (39%); the remaining patients had additional arch vessel obstructions.
 Before operation, neurologic symptoms occurred in 25 patients (46%), arm ischemia related to claudication and microembolization occurred in 8 patients (14%), a combination of symptoms occurred in 17 patients (32%), and no symptoms were noted in 4 patients (8%).
 The extrathoracic approach to surgery was used in 16 patients (30%).
 Eleven of the 38 patients in whom the intrathoracic approach was used had endarterectomy of the innominate artery; in three of those, the procedure was combined with left common carotid endarterectomy.
 Bypass grafts were used in the other 27 patients undergoing procedures with an intrathoracic approach; in six of those, bypass was combined with carotid endarterectomy.
 No operative deaths occurred.
 Perioperative revascularization failure occurred in four cases; all of those patients underwent a second revascularization procedure, with a secondary patency rate of 100%.
 In four patients, late occlusion was noted at 6 months and at 1, 1.5, and 10 years.
 One patient had a permanent perioperative neurologic deficit in the distribution of the left carotid artery after a combined common carotid endarterectomy/innominate endarterectomy procedure.
 No neurologic deficits were directly related to the innominate artery territory.
 Long-term actuarial survival was 83% at 10 years.
 Early and late graft failures were related to inadequate inflow in bypass grafts, progression of distal disease in arteritis, and primary closure in endarterectomy.
