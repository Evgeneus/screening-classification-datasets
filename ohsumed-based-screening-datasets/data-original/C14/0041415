A comparison of multilesion percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in elderly patients (greater than 70 years) and younger subjects.
 Results of multilesion percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) were compared in 210 elderly patients (70 to 92 years, [group I] and 210 younger patients (40 to 69 years, [group II].
 The elderly patients included more women (43% versus 24%) and patients with unstable angina (73% versus 55%).
 PTCA was successful in 87% of lesions in group I and in 94% in group II (p less than 0.001).
 Only circumflex artery dilatation was less successful in group I (78% versus 91%, p less than 0.002).
 PTCA was successful in all lesions of at least one vessel in 89% of group I patients and in 94% of group II patients (p less than 0.06).
 Successful dilatation of all lesions was achieved in 77% of group I and in 85% of group II patients (p less than 0.05).
 Complication rates were similar for both groups.
 These data demonstrate a high rate of success and safety in elderly patients undergoing multilesion PTCA despite the presence of several risk factors (advanced age, female sex, unstable angina).
 The lower PTCA success rate in these patients compared with younger subjects is almost entirely attributable to reduced success for circumflex artery lesions.
