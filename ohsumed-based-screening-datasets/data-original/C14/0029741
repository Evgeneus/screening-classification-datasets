Efficacy of ketanserin in the therapy of Raynaud's phenomenon: thermometric data.
 After a two-week washout (WO) period with placebo 1 capsule/bid, 12 patients suffering from stable Raynaud's phenomenon were treated with ketanserin (K) 40 mg/bid for fifteen days.
 Blood pressure, heart rate, and laboratory parameters were evaluated at the end of each period.
 Patients used diary cards to record the number, duration, and intensity of attacks.
 Computerized thermometry of the fingers was evaluated at basal temperature after acclimatization, 23 degrees C for thirty minutes; after cold test, 10 degrees C for five minutes; and after thermal recovery, 23 degrees C for eighteen minutes.
 Results were analyzed statistically by use of Student's t-test for paired data (p less than 0.05).
 No marked changes were observed in the symptoms of the attacks, but K proved effective in significantly reducing the number and duration of daily attacks and in promoting their spontaneous regression.
 Thermometry revealed a parallel increase in temperatures, particularly basal and recovery values.
 The data suggest increased flow and decreased vasospasm following 5-HT2 receptor blockade.
