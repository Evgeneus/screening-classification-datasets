Regimen compliance two years after myocardial infarction.
 Two-years postinfarction, the effect of a nursing intervention at 30 days postinfarction, and intentions, attitudes, and perceived beliefs of others on regimen compliance of myocardial infarction patients was investigated.
 The sample was comprised of 51 patients (E = 29, C = 22) who participated in a five-phase study over 2 years.
 No differences were found between experimental and control groups for regimen compliance to activity, stress, and medication prescriptions.
 The experimental group was significantly more compliant to the diet prescription than the control group.
 The control group was significantly more compliant than the experimental group with cessation from smoking.
 Perceived beliefs of others were predictive of compliance for all regimen prescriptions at 2 years.
 Attitude was also predictive of compliance with the diet, smoking, and stress regimens.
