Hypertensive heart disease in blacks.
 Although blacks may differ from whites in the response of hypertension to therapy, present data do not suggest that potential racial differences in cardiac structural adaptation to hypertension by themselves mandate a difference in therapeutic strategy.
 The results of large racially mixed trials of therapy that monitor LV mass regression, such as the VA Cooperative Monotherapy Trial, will be of interest in this regard.
