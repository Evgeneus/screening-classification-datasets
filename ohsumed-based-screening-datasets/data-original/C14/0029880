Postpericardiotomy and postmyocardial infarction syndrome presenting as noncardiac pulmonary edema.
 Three cases are reported that describe acute pulmonary edema as an early manifestation of a postpericardiotomy or postmyocardial infarction syndrome.
 Each of these cases occurred in the presence of good left ventricular function.
 The cases suggest this syndrome occurs in immunologically primed patients who have had prior cardiac injury resulting in readily available heart antibody.
 The first report followed an acute myocardial infarction that required a temporary pacemaker, and the two other cases occurred following coronary artery bypass surgery.
 Two of the patients had a history of distant myocardial or pericardial injury, and the third patient had an acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction two to three weeks before cardiac surgery.
 All three patients with pulmonary edema responded dramatically to corticosteroids, having been resistant to diuretic and pre-load and afterload reduction therapy, suggesting an autoimmune capillary injury process.
 Early recognition of such a syndrome is important since all three patients were successfully treated, and might otherwise have been confused with other causes of pulmonary edema.
