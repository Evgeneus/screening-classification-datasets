Prevention of coronary heart disease in black adults.
 Development of strategies to prevent CHD in blacks is impeded by the virtual absence of clinical trials demonstrating the feasibility and effectiveness of interventions in blacks.
 The wholesale generalization that interventions effective (or ineffective) in whites are similarly effective in blacks may risk the employment of worthless or even dangerous interventions in blacks.
 Using available epidemiologic data, a number of risk factors may be more important in blacks than whites by virtue of higher prevalence, increased relative risk, or both.
 These may include hypertension, lipoprotein (a), smoking, diabetes, and obesity.
 Thus, health agencies might emphasize these risk factors when developing preventive programs targeted at black populations.
 Prevention programs may best seek to prevent the onset of risk factors found highly prevalent in black communities, rather than the costly and side-effect-prone interventions to treat risk factors once established.
 Thus, there is a role for community-based as well as a high-risk approaches.
 The community-based approaches should seek to work with organizations such as churches, which traditionally play strong roles in the black community.
 Physicians treating black patients should be aware of the potentially different roles played by risk factors, and treat aggressively those individuals identified to be at high risk.
 Risk factor management should be emphasized, rather than reduced, in patients with already established CHD.
 CHD has been clearly shown to be preventable; both blacks and whites should benefit from specific interventions aimed toward this worthy goal.
