Chronic venous insufficiency in primary varicose veins evaluated by plethysmographic technique.
 Venous hemodynamics were evaluated by plethysmography in normal subjects and patients with venous disorders of the lower extremity, to clarify the pathophysiology of chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) due to primary varicose veins.
 Expelled volume during five active dorsiflexions of the feet and venous recovery time were calculated to evaluate muscle pump efficiency and valvular competence.
 Limbs with CVI due to primary varicose veins showed a higher expelled volume and a more shortened refilling time than limbs with simple varicosities.
 With application of tourniquets, the refilling time normalized in limbs with CVI, as well as in limbs with simple varicosities.
 These results indicate that a high degree of venous congestion in the distal part of the calf and valvular incompetence of the superficial vein system might cause CVI due to primary varicose veins.
