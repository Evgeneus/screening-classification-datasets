Coronary arteriography in patients with dextrocardia.
 Coronary arteriography is described in a patient with dextrocardia and situs inversus totalis.
 Six cases of coronary arteriography in dextrocardia were reviewed from the literature, and 3 other cases were reported from the authors' institutions.
 In 9 of the 10 patients, coronary arteriography was performed without difficulty using standard Judkins or Sones catheters.
 Angiographers encountering patients with dextrocardia may use standard coronary arteriographic techniques with a few subtle modifications.
