Coronary angioplasty in symptomatic patients after bypass surgery.
 With the availability of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), the management of patients who present with recurrent angina following coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) has changed.
 From January 1987 to December 1988, 149 symptomatic post CABG patients underwent coronary angiography at our institution.
 Ninety were treated with medical antianginal therapy, 14 had repeat surgery, and 45 underwent PTCA.
 Complications of repeat CABG included one death, two perioperative myocardial infarctions, and four patients with postoperative supraventricular arrhythmia.
 PTCA was performed on 42 lesions in 37 native vessels (88% success rate), and on 24 lesions in 23 vein grafts (91.7% success rate).
 Complications included acute reocclusion (one patient), peripheral artery occlusion (one patient), hematoma formation (one patient), and periprocedure myocardial infarction (one patient).
 No deaths occurred.
 At a mean follow-up of 5.9 +/- 3.8 months, 10 patients had recurrent symptoms, six of whom were found to have restenosis.
 Repeat PTCA was successfully accomplished in four patients; the other two were treated medically.
 It is concluded that PTCA is a feasible alternative to repeat CABG in selected patients and can be achieved with a high success rate and minimal complications.
