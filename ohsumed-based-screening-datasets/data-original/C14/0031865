Oral contraceptives and coronary heart disease.
 In industrialized countries, coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major public health problem for both men and women.
 Preventive strategies for reducing the excessive mortality and morbidity associated with CHD involve the identification and modification of metabolic factors believed to be involved in the disease process.
 Three major areas of concern are lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism and the hemostatic system.
 The steroid hormones contained in oral contraceptives (OCs) have been shown to interfere in all three areas.
 In many instances OCs have been shown to alter metabolic markers for CHD in directions associated with increased risk.
 Although evidence is lacking that such changes induce CHD in users of modern, low-dose OCs, it would be prudent to develop formulations with a minimal impact on metabolic risk markers.
 There is increasing evidence that many of the metabolic disturbances seen in CHD patients share a common origin, and the development of risk-free OCs is likely to require investigation into complex interrelationships.
