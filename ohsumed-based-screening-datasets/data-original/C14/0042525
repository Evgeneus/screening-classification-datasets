Echocardiographic assessment of atherosclerotic coronary lesions.
 Echocardiographic techniques to visualize normal and atherosclerotic coronary arteries include transthoracic, transesophageal, epicardial (intraoperative), and intravascular approaches.
 All are capable of visualizing portions of the coronary arteries, especially proximal, and demonstrating atherosclerotic lesions.
 However, none of these methods are able, at present, to completely examine the coronary tree, and therefore none are ready to be used as a standard clinical technique for the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease.
 Technological advances will enhance the future clinical value and applicability of these techniques.
