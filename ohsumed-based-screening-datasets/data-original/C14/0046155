Duplex Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein in tricuspid regurgitation.
 Patients with tricuspid regurgitation may present initially with vague abdominal symptoms and elevated liver enzymes.
 In the absence of diagnostic sonographic findings, patients may be subjected to an unnecessary invasive liver biopsy for an accurate diagnosis.
 We recently described the association of the pulsatile portal venous waveform on duplex Doppler sonography with tricuspid regurgitation in 15 patients.
 In this study I describe the changes in the hepatic venous waveform in these patients and compare the findings with the final diagnosis as determined by Doppler echocardiography (n = 14) or ultrafast CT (n = 1).
 All patients had clinical findings consistent with liver dysfunction and were referred for sonography to rule out diseases of the liver, biliary tree, or hepatic or portal veins.
 All patients had persistently dilated hepatic veins and inferior venae cavae.
 Twenty-four volunteers, 11 of whom had simultaneous ECG tracings, served as a control group.
 The main findings on the hepatic duplex sonogram in the disease group were a decrease in the size of the antegrade systolic wave with a systolic/diastolic flow velocity ratio of less than 0.6 (n = 4) or reversal of the systolic wave (n = 10).
 In all volunteers, systolic flow was antegrade and the ratio was more than 0.6.
 Two diagnoses were false positive and one was false negative.
 In some patients with sonographic signs of congestive heart failure, duplex Doppler sonography of the hepatic vein may be helpful in the diagnosis of one of the causes of liver dysfunction, tricuspid regurgitation.
