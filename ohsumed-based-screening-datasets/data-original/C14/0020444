Assessment and counseling of coronary risk factors by family practice residents.
 A study was undertaken to determine (1) the likelihood that patients seen for episodic health care in a family medical center have been assessed and counseled for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors, and (2) the likelihood that patients having an identified risk factor have been assessed and counseled regarding other CHD risk factors.
 One thousand five hundred twenty-eight medical records were randomly selected from all visits occurring over two periods in 1986 and 1987 to 122 residents in an eight-site family medicine residency network.
 Patients with cardiovascular disease and those younger than 20 or older than 65 years of age were excluded.
 Assessments were made of (1) smoking history, blood pressure, weight, physical activity, and dietary content during the previous 12 months; (2) family history of cardiovascular disease during the previous 12 months and in the initial patient history; (3) and blood cholesterol during the prior 5 years.
 Risk-factor counseling practices were examined for the previous 12 months.
 Blood pressure was assessed in 96% of patients, smoking in 40%, cholesterol in 26%, and family history in 52%.
 Ninety-six percent of hypertensive patients were counseled for hypertension, but only 45% of smokers and 20% of patients with hypercholesterolemia were counseled for those risk factors.
 Of patients having a given risk factor, assessment for any other risk factor occurred in fewer than 60% of cases.
 Patients having a documented positive family history were only slightly more likely than other patients to be assessed for additional risk factors.
 There is continued need for enhancing coronary risk-factor assessment and counseling by resident physicians.
