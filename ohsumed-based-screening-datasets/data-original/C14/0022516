Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm: an indication for the retroperitoneal approach.
 In three recent cases, one of which is described in this report, we have found the retroperitoneal approach to have the following significant and distinct advantages over the transabdominal repair of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms: (1) The posterolateral aspect of the aorta characteristically is not significantly involved by the inflammatory process, whereas the anterior aspect is.
 (2) The duodenum does not need to be dissected away from the aorta and, in fact, is not seen.
 (3) The left renal vein moves up off the neck of the aneurysm with forward mobilization of the kidney, facilitating proximal control.
 Now that the computerized tomography scan has become the preferred preoperative imaging technique for abdominal aortic aneurysms, the diagnosis of inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm can routinely be made before elective operation allowing the retroperitoneal approach to be selected.
