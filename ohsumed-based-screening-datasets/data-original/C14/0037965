Effect of surgery on the systemic inflammatory response to intermittent claudication 
 The hypothesis that intermittent claudication initiates a systemic inflammatory response was investigated by studying the effect of exercise on markers of neutrophil activation and vascular permeability in 25 claudicants and 10 controls.
 Urinary albumin excretion, previously demonstrated to reflect vascular permeability, increased significantly after exercise in claudicants and was associated with decreased neutrophil filterability and increased serum lysozyme activity.
 No similar exercise-induced changes were seen in controls or in claudicants after successful arterial bypass surgery.
 These results suggest that intermittent claudication is associated with potentially deleterious systemic manifestations that are surgically reversible.
