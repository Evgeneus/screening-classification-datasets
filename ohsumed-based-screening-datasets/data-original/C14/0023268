Effects of ischemia and hemoglobin on vascular function in isolated rabbit aortas.
 The vascular endothelium is important in the modulation of vascular tone via production of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors.
 The abdominal aortas of five groups of rabbits were subjected to varying lengths of ischemia (0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 hours), removed, sectioned into transverse rings, and placed in tissue baths containing Krebs' buffer at 37 degrees C and aerated with 95% O2/5% CO2.
 After equilibration the rings were tested for endothelium-dependent vasodilation with methacholine and nonendothelium-dependent vasodilation with nitroprusside.
 Endothelium-dependent relaxation as elicited by methacholine was impaired at 3 and 4 hours of ischemia but was not significantly different at 1 and 2 hours as compared to control, whereas endothelium-independent vasodilation remained normal throughout the different periods of ischemia.
 The addition of 1 x 10(-6) mol/L rabbit hemoglobin reduced the time needed to demonstrate significant impairment of endothelial function to 2 hours.
 Endothelium-independent vasodilation was not affected by hemoglobin.
 We conclude that hemoglobin exacerbates ischemia vascular dysfunction in the rabbit aorta.
