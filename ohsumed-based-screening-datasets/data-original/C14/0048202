Beneficial effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine on apolipoproteins in hypertensive patients.
 The objective of the study was to assess the effects of the calcium antagonist isradipine on plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins in patients with essential hypertension.
 After a four-week placebo wash-out period, 73 patients (41 men, 32 women) were studied in a double-blind, randomized, crossover study comparing sustained-release isradipine (isradipine SR) with the standard isradipine formulation.
 Nineteen patients received 5 mg/day and 54 patients 10 mg/day.
 Lipids were evaluated at the end of the placebo period and after 12 weeks of treatment with isradipine.
 In both treatment groups, lipid and lipoproteins were not modified.
 However, apolipoprotein A-I levels increased significantly (P less than .001) and the ratio of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A-I concentration decreased significantly (P less than .01) irrespective of gender.
 These data show that the levels of plasma apolipoprotein A-I, a strong predictor of coronary heart disease, are favorably affected by isradipine of either formulation.
 The mechanisms of this effect remain to be elucidated.
