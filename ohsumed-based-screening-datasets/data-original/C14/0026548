Noninvasive identification of myocardium at risk in patients with acute myocardial infarction and nondiagnostic electrocardiograms with technetium-99m-Sestamibi.
 BACKGROUND.
 Patients who have chest pain without electrocardiographic ST elevation are not candidates for thrombolytic therapy in most clinical trials.
 This study examined the value of technetium-99m-Sestamibi tomographic imaging to assess myocardial perfusion in patients during chest pain without ST elevation.
 METHODS AND RESULTS.
 Tc-99m-Sestamibi was injected in 14 patients who had chest pain without ST elevation, who subsequently developed enzymatic evidence of myocardial infarction within 24 hours.
 Tomographic imaging was performed 1-6 hours after injection.
 Thirteen of 14 patients showed significant perfusion defects indicative of acute myocardial infarction consistent with absent perfusion (20 +/- 15% of the left ventricle; range, 2-53%); one patient had normal images.
 Because of the absence of definitive electrocardiographic changes, only five patients received reperfusion therapy within 6 hours of the onset of chest pain.
 Regional wall motion abnormalities were present in nine of nine patients undergoing contrast ventriculography and correlated with the location of the Tc-99m-Sestamibi perfusion defect.
 At the time of subsequent coronary angiography, total arterial occlusion was present in 11 of the 14 patients.
 The infarct-related artery could be identified in 13 of the 14 patients.
 In six of these 13 patients, the left circumflex was the infarct-related artery.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 Patients who have chest pain without electrocardiographic ST elevation may have arterial occlusion and significant myocardium at risk.
 Tc-99m-Sestamibi imaging may be of benefit in identifying these patients early so that they can be considered for acute reperfusion therapy.
