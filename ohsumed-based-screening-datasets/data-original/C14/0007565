Usefulness of tomographic thallium-201 imaging for detection of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
 The role of tomographic thallium-201 exercise and redistribution imaging in the detection of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) was evaluated in 116 patients: 61 (53%) with 1- and 55 (47%) with multivessel PTCA, with a total of 185 dilated vessels.
 Complete revascularization was performed in 89 (77%) and partial revascularization in 27 (23%) of the patients.
 Restenosis was angiographically demonstrated in 69 (60%) of the patients and 85 (46%) of the vessels 6.4 +/- 3.1 months after PTCA.
 Disease progression in previously normal vessels was noted in 11 patients.
 The results were: (1) for detection of restenosis in the group of patients, single-photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) versus exercise electrocardiographic sensitivity was 93 vs 52% (p less than 0.001), specificity 77 vs 64%, and accuracy 86 vs 57% (p less than 0.001).
 The results were similar in the complete and partial revascularization groups.
 (2) SPECT was 86% sensitive, specific and accurate for restenosis detection in specific vessels with comparable results for 1-versus multivessel PTCA and complete versus partial revascularization.
 Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were: 89, 95 and 92% for the left anterior descending coronary artery; 88, 79 and 82% for the right coronary artery; and 76, 83 and 85% for the left circumflex coronary artery.
 Eighty-one percent of the diseased nondilated vessels were correctly identified.
 (3) Disease progression to greater than 50% stenosis was detected with 91% sensitivity, 84% specificity and 85% accuracy.
 SPECT thallium-201 imaging is an excellent tool for the detection of restenosis and disease progression after PTCA in the settings of 1- and multivessel angioplasty and complete and partial revascularization.
