Pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy: atypical presentations.
 Severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and markedly elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase developed in a 29-year-old-woman in whom one pregnancy resulted in intrauterine death.
 Acute fatty liver of pregnancy developed with good fetal outcome in the next pregnancy.
 This case suggests that pregnancy-induced hypertension and acute fatty liver of pregnancy are part of a clinical spectrum.
 Moreover, classic abnormalities of liver function tests need not be present in acute fatty liver of pregnancy.
