Ventricular free-wall rupture after myocardial infarction. Treatment and outcome.
 Ventricular free-wall rupture remains one of the leading causes of death after myocardial infarction (MI).
 With increased abilities for diagnosis and resuscitation techniques, surgical correction of free-wall myocardial defects resulting from ischemia and necrosis may become a simple modality of treatment, resulting in improvement of the survival rate.
 We are reporting our experience with four patients with ventricular free-wall rupture after MI, with emphasis on clinical presentation, diagnosis, and surgical management.
