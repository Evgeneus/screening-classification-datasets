Noninvasive diagnosis of vascular trauma by duplex ultrasonography.
 Duplex ultrasonography was used prospectively in the initial evaluation of 198 patients with 319 potential vascular injuries of the neck and extremities.
 Patients who were unstable or who had obvious arterial trauma were excluded.
 Injury was caused by gunshot in 104 (53%), blunt trauma in 42 (21%), stab wound in 34 (17%), and shotgun in 18 (9%).
 Duplex ultrasonography correctly characterized and localized vascular injuries in 23 patients: arterial disruptions (13), intimal flaps (4), acute pseudoaneurysms (3), arteriovenous fistulas (2), and shotgun pellet arteriopuncture (1).
 Nineteen other patients had vasospasm (13) or external compression (6) without evidence of intrinsic vessel injury, these 42 studies had true-positive results.
 Twenty patients underwent arterial repair (13 on the basis of duplex ultrasonography alone), one had primary amputation, three required fasciotomy, and 18 were observed.
 Two patients with false-negative results had minor shotgun pellet arteriopunctures that were missed by duplex ultrasonography, but neither needed repair.
 One hundred fifty-three patients had true-negative results on duplex ultrasonography: all clinically had only proximity injuries and easily palpable distal pulses.
 The result of one duplex ultrasonography study was found to be false-positive on arteriography.
 The sensitivity of duplex ultrasonography was 95%, the specificity was 99%, and the overall accuracy was 98%.
 These results closely approximate those reported with the use of exclusion arteriography in the evaluation of similar vascular trauma patients.
 Furthermore, duplex ultrasonography has no interventional risks and is more cost-effective for screening such injuries than arteriography or exploration.
 Duplex ultrasonography is a reliable method of diagnosis in patients with potential peripheral vascular injuries.
