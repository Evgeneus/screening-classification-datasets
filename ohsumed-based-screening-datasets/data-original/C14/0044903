Long-term function in University of Cape Town prostheses in the tricuspid position.
 A 55-year-old woman undergoing triple-valve replacement was found at operation to have a well preserved and functioning University of Cape Town prosthesis that had been inserted 18 years earlier for tricuspid stenosis.
 Case reporting, valve reappraisal, and factual updating on another case, the world's first documented tricuspid valve replacement for Ebstein's anomaly, are presented.
 These two remarkable in vivo successes speak well for this historic collar stud valve.
