Pathogenesis of ischemic necrosis in random-pattern skin flaps induced by long-term low-dose nicotine treatment in the rat.
 The objectives of the present experiments were to study the effects of long-term low-dose nicotine treatment on skin hemodynamics, viability, and microvascular morphology in 4 x 10 cm dorsally based acute random-pattern skin flaps in the rat.
 In addition, the reversibility of the nicotine-induced detrimental effects on skin-flap viability following cessation of nicotine treatment also was investigated.
 Low-dose nicotine (0.6 mg/kg) administered twice daily and subcutaneously for 24 weeks significantly (p less than 0.05) decreased skin-flap capillary blood flow, distal perfusion, and length and area of skin viability compared with the saline-treated control (n = 15).
 However, these same parameters in rats (n = 15) whose nicotine treatment had been withheld for 2 weeks prior to skin-flap surgery were not significantly different from the control, thus indicating that the detrimental effects of this long-term, low-dose nicotine treatment were reversible.
 The mean plasma level of nicotine in the nicotine-treated rats was 8.1 +/- 0.4 micrograms/dl and was within the range of plasma nicotine levels reported for human heavy cigarette smokers.
 Light and electron microscopic studies did not show evidence of histologic damage to the cutaneous microvasculature in acute random-pattern skin flaps and samples of normal (nonoperated) skin in nicotine-treated rats.
 It is concluded that long-term plasma levels of nicotine similar to those of heavy cigarette smokers are detrimental to the capillary blood flow and viability of random-pattern skin flaps in the rat.
 These deleterious effects can be avoided if skin flaps are raised 2 weeks after cessation of nicotine treatment.
 This low-dose nicotine treatment does not cause histologic damage to the microvasculature.
 Other pathogenic mechanisms of nicotine-induced skin flap ischemia are discussed.
