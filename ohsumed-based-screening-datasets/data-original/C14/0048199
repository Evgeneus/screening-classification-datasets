Effect of isradipine on factors affecting blood viscosity.
 The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of isradipine on red blood cell filtrability in 20 men with mild-to-moderate hypertension.
 In this prospective, double-blind study, parallel groups of hypertensive male patients were randomized to receive either isradipine (n = 11) or placebo (n = 9).
 An additional group of nine normotensive age-matched volunteers served as controls.
 Tests were performed before and after patients were treated with either isradipine or placebo.
 The hypertensive patients differed from the normotensive controls in having a higher level of fibrinogen (P less than .04), a higher hematocrit (P less than .001), a higher filtration rate (P less than .05; impaired red blood cell deformability), and a higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV; P less than .005).
 Treatment with isradipine lowered blood pressure and improved red blood cell filterability (P less than .05) compared with placebo.
