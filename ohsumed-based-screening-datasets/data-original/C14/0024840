The effect of food on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of fenoldopam in class III heart failure.
 Eighteen patients with New York Heart Association class III congestive heart failure were given single 100 mg oral doses of fenoldopam with food or fasting in a random-order single-blind crossover trial.
 Before and after each fenoldopam dose, thermodilution cardiac output, right atrial pressure, pulmonary artery pressure, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) were measured with a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter, and heart rates and blood pressures were recorded with an automated sphygmomanometer.
 Compared with fasting, bioavailability of fenoldopam was decreased significantly when administered with food: mean peak plasma fenoldopam level decreased from 26.5 (+/- 4.1 SEM) ng/ml to 10.9 (+/- 1.7 SEM) ng/ml (p = 0.0004) and mean area under the concentration-time curve was decreased from 44.7 (+/- 5.8 SEM) ng.hr/ml to 26.8 (+/- 4.1 SEM) ng.hr/ml (p = 0.0001).
 Fenoldopam administration to fasting patients resulted in decreases in mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, and PCWP and significant increases in cardiac index without change in heart rate.
 The maximum changes in mean cardiac index, systemic vascular resistance, and PCWP were greatest 1 hour after oral administration and did not persist beyond 3 hours after administration.
 In fasting patients, changes in cardiac index were correlated with plasma fenoldopam levels, whereas changes in PCWP and mean arterial pressure did not correlate significantly with the observed fenoldopam level.
