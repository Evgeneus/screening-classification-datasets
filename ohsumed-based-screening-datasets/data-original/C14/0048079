Effects of quinapril, a new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, on left ventricular failure and survival in the cardiomyopathic hamster. Hemodynamic, morphological, and biochemical correlates.
 The effect of chronic therapy with quinapril on the temporal progression of left ventricular failure and survival was assessed in the CHF 146 cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, which is an idiopathic model of congestive heart failure.
 Age-matched Golden Syrian (GS) hamsters served as normal controls.
 Quinapril was administered in the drinking water at average daily doses of 10.2, 112.4, and 222.4 mg/kg/day.
 In untreated CM hamsters, in vitro left ventricular performance progressively deteriorated with increasing age beginning at roughly 180 days.
 This decline in left ventricular performance was accompanied by a decrease in coronary flow and an increase in left ventricular volume.
 Administration of quinapril from 180 to 300 days of age prevented the decline of in vitro left ventricular contractile performance and coronary flow and also reduced the age-dependent increases in left ventricular volume.
 The cardioprotective effects of quinapril were observed at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day.
 Lung angiotensin converting enzyme activity was significantly inhibited by quinapril in GS and CM hamsters at 240 and 300 days of age at all dose levels.
 In contrast, significant inhibition of ventricular angiotensin converting enzyme activity was observed consistently at doses of 112.4 and 222.4 mg/kg/day quinapril but not at 10.2 mg/kg/day.
 In the survival protocol, CM and GS hamsters were treated with vehicle or quinapril (100 mg/kg/day) from 180 to 522 days of age.
 During the initial 210 days of treatment (from 180 to 390 days of age) 78.3% of the vehicle-treated CM hamsters died compared with 27.7% of quinapril-treated CM hamsters.
 Quinapril increased the median survival time of CM hamsters by 32.9% (112 days).
 It is concluded that chronic quinapril therapy exerts a significant cardioprotective effect and also increases survival.
