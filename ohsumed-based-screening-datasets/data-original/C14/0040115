Thallium myocardial scintigraphy in congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries.
 A case of congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries is presented with the correlation of thallium scintigraphic results with catheterization data.
 The essential features of the thallium scintigrams were marked counterclockwise rotation of the heart with perfusion abnormalities of the inferior wall and apex.
 Since patients with congenitally-corrected transposition of the great arteries may present with the symptom of chest pain, the diagnosis of transposition of the great arteries should be considered in patients with marked counterclockwise rotation of the heart and segmental perfusion abnormalities on thallium scintigraphy.
