Childhood blindness in Peru.
 A survey of childhood blindness in Peruvian children was done.
 Although most causes of blindness were due to congenital and hereditary conditions, measles accounted for almost 10% of blindness.
 With widespread measles immunization, this preventable cause of blindness in children can be eliminated or dramatically reduced.
