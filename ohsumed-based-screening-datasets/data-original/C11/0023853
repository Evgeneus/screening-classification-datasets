Recurrent corneal oedema following late migration of intraocular glass.
 This is a report of very late complications following intraocular penetration of numerous fragments of glass as a result of a test tube explosion.
 Fifteen years after the initial injury glass splinters began to migrate from the vitreous into the anterior chamber, causing acute episodes of corneal oedema.
 Four such episodes occurred over the past nine years, the corneal oedema each time disappearing within a few days following surgical extraction of the glass splinters.
 The literature on intraocular glass and its movement within the eye is reviewed.
