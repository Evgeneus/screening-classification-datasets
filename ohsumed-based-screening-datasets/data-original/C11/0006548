South American blastomycosis: ophthalmic and oculomotor nerve lesions.
 A case of South American blastomycosis began with an oropharyngeal lesion which was followed by a granulomatous uveitis.
 The patient was treated with Amphotericin B and showed a clinical regression.
 Four months later, he developed a right 3rd cranial nerve palsy, aggravating the clinical aspect with a severe generalized involvement of the central nervous system and death.
 Necropsy showed blastomycotic meningoencephalitis.
