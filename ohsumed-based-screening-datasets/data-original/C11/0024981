Analysis of the pivotal residues of the immunodominant and highly uveitogenic determinant of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein.
 Interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), a retinal-specific Ag, induces experimental autoimmune uveitis in a variety of animals.
 We have previously shown that sequence 1169-1191 of bovine IRBP is the immunodominant epitope of this protein in Lewis rats and is highly immunogenic and uveitogenic in these rats.
 The active site of peptide 1169-1191 was determined by testing its truncated forms.
 The shortest peptide to be immunologically active was found to be 1182-1190 (WEGVGVVPD).
 To determine the role of individual residues of this sequence, we have tested the immunologic activities of nine analogs of peptide 1181-1191, in which each of residues 1182-1190 was substituted with alanine (A).
 The tested activities included the capacity to induce experimental autoimmune uveitis and cellular responses in immunized rats, as well as the capability to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized against IRBP or the parent peptide 1181-1191.
 Analogs that did not stimulate these lymphocytes were also tested for their capacity to competitively inhibit the proliferative response to 1181-1191.
 Analogs A(1184), A(1186), and A(1187) resembled 1181-1191 in their activities, whereas the other analogs exhibited remarkably reduced activities, with several patterns being noticed.
 Analog A(1182) was inactive in all tests.
 Analog A(1190) was very weakly uveitogenic and non-immunogenic, but it stimulated lymphocytes sensitized against IRBP or 1181-1191 when added at exceedingly high concentrations.
 Analogs A(1183) and A(1185) resembled A(1190) in being weakly uveitogenic and A(1185) was also found to be poorly immunogenic.
 In addition, relatively high concentrations of A(1183) and A(1185) were needed to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized against IRBP or 1181-1191.
 However, a different pattern of activities was exhibited by analogs A(1188) and A(1189).
 These peptides were uveitogenic and immunogenic, but failed to stimulate lymphocytes sensitized to IRBP or 1181-1191.
 Furthermore, A(1188) and A(1189), but not A(1182), also inhibited the response to 1181-1191 of a cell line specific toward this parent peptide.
 The data are interpreted to show that residues 1188 and 1189 are involved in the interaction of the peptide with the TCR, whereas residues 1182 and 1190 and, perhaps, 1183 and 1185, are pivotal for the binding of peptide 1181-1190 to the MHC molecules on APC.
