Phacoemulsification combined with pars plana vitrectomy.
 Phacoemulsification combined with pars plana vitrectomy was performed on seven patients with both cataracts and vitreoretinal disease.
 Six of the seven had a posterior chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) placed in the capsular bag following cataract extraction.
 Visual acuities ranging from light perception to hand movement preoperatively, postoperatively ranged from hand movement to 20/25.
 There were no perioperative complications.
 During an average follow-up of more than 6 months, neovascular glaucoma developed in one patient, and a conjunctival cyst in another.
 The PC-IOLs were well tolerated.
 The small limbal incision used in phacoemulsification allows better control during the vitrectomy procedure and ensures a water-tight wound.
 In addition, with the limbal approach, the posterior lens capsule is maintained, with all the attendant advantages.
