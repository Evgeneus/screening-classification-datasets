Sarcoidosis of the eyelid skin.
 A 64-year-old white woman presented with nodular lesions on the arms and face, including both medial canthi and the left upper eyelid.
 Histopathological examination of the biopsied eyelid lesion and other facial lesions disclosed the presence of noncaseating granulomas strongly suggestive of sarcoidosis.
 No other evidence of ocular sarcoidosis was present.
 The patient had clinical, radiologic and laboratory findings consistent with a diagnosis of systemic sarcoidosis.
 Therapy with chloroquine phosphate led to regression of the cutaneous lesions.
