Capillary haemangiomas: an approach to their management.
 Twenty-five children with eyelid haemangiomas were reviewed.
 Fifteen patients with enlarging lesions thought to be at risk of causing amblyopia were treated with intralesional steroids as soon after presentation as possible.
 This appeared to reduce significantly the incidence of amblyopia.
 Surgery was reserved for older children in whom no further involution of the lesion was expected.
