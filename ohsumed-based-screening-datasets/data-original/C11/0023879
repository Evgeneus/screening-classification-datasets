Retinal detachment as a complication of retrobulbar anesthesia.
 The authors report an unusual case of retinal detachment after cataract surgery in a 48-year-old man in which it appeared that the retrobulbar needle passed through the sclera and tracked beneath the retina before perforating the retina superior to the disc.
 The cause of the detachment was not clearly defined until a depigmented line was observed after reattachment of the retina.
