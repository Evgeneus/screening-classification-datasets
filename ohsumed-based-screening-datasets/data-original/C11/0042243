Diurnal intraocular pressure after successful primary laser trabeculoplasty.
 In 20 patients who were successfully treated with laser trabeculoplasty as the primary therapy for glaucoma, we measured the intraocular pressure every two hours between 8:00 A.M.
 and 8:00 P.M.
 Success was defined as intraocular pressure of 22 mm Hg or less without medication.
 Of 20 patients, three had open-angle glaucoma and 17 had exfoliative glaucoma.
 Intraocular pressure was stable with small fluctuations during the daytime.
