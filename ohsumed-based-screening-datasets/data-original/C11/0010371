A new ophthalmic electronic videoendoscope system for intraocular surgery.
 A new ophthalmic electronic videoendoscope system has a 20-guage probe for intraocular observation, a standard size for vitreous microsurgical instruments, and both endoscopic and operating microscopic images are displayed on a split-screen monitor system to provide surgeos a simultaneous view of both images.
 Using this endoscope system at any time during surgery, surgeons can examine the intraocular structure such as the ciliary sulcus, pars plana, or vitreous base and obtain valuable but otherwise unobtainable information for completing the surgery.
