Epikeratoplasty with nonlyophilized tissue in children with aphakia.
 We studied 75 epikeratoplasty procedures using nonlyophilized tissue performed by eight ophthalmic surgeons in 70 eyes (47 patients) to correct for aphakia in children less than 8 years of age (mean age, 3.4 +/- 2.1 years).
 Of the 47 patients in the study, 24 were girls and 23 were boys; 23 patients had bilateral surgery.
 Seven of the epigrafts required removal; two were not replaced, and five underwent successful repeat epikeratoplasty.
 Overall, the success rate (that is, the percentage of epigrafts that remained optically and functionally clear throughout the course of this study) for the epikeratoplasty procedure was 89% (62 of 70 eyes) for initial surgery and 96% (67 of 70 eyes) for repeat surgery.
 The average spherical equivalent was +14.4 +/- 3.7 diopters preoperatively and +0.3 +/- 2.9 diopters one year after the operation.
 One year after the final surgical procedure, 42 of 56 eyes (75%) were within 3 diopters of emmetropia.
 In the 29 verbal patients, best-corrected visual acuity was 20/100 or better in 25 (86.2%) one year after the operation.
