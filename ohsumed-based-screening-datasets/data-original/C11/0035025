Perforating (through-and-through) injuries of the globe. Surgical results with vitrectomy.
 Fifty-one eyes of 48 patients with perforating (through-and-through) injuries of the globe were treated with vitrectomy during a 12-year period.
 Functional success was obtained in 32 eyes (63%), anatomic success was obtained in nine eyes (17%), and treatment failed in 10 eyes (20%).
 In 16 eyes (32%), 20/20 to 20/100 visual acuity was obtained; in 17 eyes (33%), 20/200 to 5/200 visual acuity was obtained; and in 18 eyes (35%), less than 5/200 visual acuity was obtained.
 The mechanism of injury was an important prognostic indicator of final visual outcome.
 Eight (62%) of 13 eyes that sustained knife or nail injuries achieved a final visual acuity of 20/50 or better, while only six (16%) with missile injuries achieved a similar level of acuity.
 Final visual outcome correlated well with the state of the macula and was not predicted by preoperative visual acuity.
 Despite improvement in surgical techniques and instrumentation, no trend toward improved visual outcomes was identified during the 12-year period.
