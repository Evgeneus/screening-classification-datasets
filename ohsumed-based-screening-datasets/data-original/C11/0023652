Cellular events associated with inflammatory angiogenesis in the mouse cornea.
 The aim of this study was to establish an angiogenesis model in the mouse and to define immunohistochemically the cellular events that precede angiogenesis.
 After chemical cauterization of the murine cornea, neovascularization was observed within 36 hours.
 The cellular infiltrate was analyzed by using antibodies on cryostat and paraffin sections and by histochemical staining for mast cells.
 It was found that neither T lymphocytes nor mast cells nor macrophages in a more mature stage of development were part of the infiltrate that preceded the ingrowth of new blood vessels.
 Instead, the infiltrating cells appearing from 3 hours on were granulocytes and inflammatory monocytes, as detected by an antibody against the calcium-binding protein MRP14.
 The authors conclude that the induction of angiogenesis during nonspecific inflammation is associated with the early influx of myelomonocytic cells, but not with the infiltration of mature macrophages, T lymphocytes, or mast cells.
 This study shows that immunohistochemical analysis of cauterized murine corneas presents a useful tool for further studies on cells and cell products involved in the angiogenic process.
