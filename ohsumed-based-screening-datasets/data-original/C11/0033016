Cardiac conduction manifestations of Reiter's syndrome.
 This study shows that conduction abnormalities may occur frequently in Reiter's syndrome of new onset or short duration.
 Since these conduction defects may be initially life threatening or may progress to life-threatening abnormalities, anyone with RS should be followed up.
 Because of the strong association between RS and HIV infection, we suggest HIV testing for all patients with RS.
 Anyone with RS should have an electrocardiogram, either to study symptoms or as a baseline if no symptoms exist.
