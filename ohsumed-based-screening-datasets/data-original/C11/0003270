Choroidal osteoma (osseous choristoma): an atypical case.
 A case of choroidal osteoma presenting in a 22-year-old girl is reported.
 The tumour, unilateral and in a juxtapapillary site, appeared markedly elevated on the retinal plane, not flat or slightly elevated as in previous reports.
 Visual acuity was not affected, and there was a complete absence of subjective symptoms.
 Echography, fluorangiography, computerised tomography, and visual field tests were performed.
 Echography is the best method for identifying and differentiating this lesion from a malignant tumour.
