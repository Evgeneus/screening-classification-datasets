Surgical management of oculomotor nerve palsy 
 We treated seven patients with unilateral oculomotor nerve palsy by transposition of the insertion of the superior oblique tendon to a point anterior and medial to the insertion of the superior rectus muscle without trochleotomy (Scott procedure).
 Additionally, large recessions of the lateral rectus muscle of involved eyes and, occasionally, recess/resect procedures of horizontal recti muscles of non-involved eyes were performed.
 All patients were followed up between one and eight years.
 Orthophoria in the primary position was achieved and maintained with one operation in four patients.
 A fifth patient had only a small residual exotropia.
 In two patients who had aberrant regeneration of the oculomotor nerve, surgery on horizontal recti muscles of the noninvolved eye improved the eyelid position of the involved eye after three operations.
