Cytomegalovirus-induced osteomyelitis in a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 A 43-year-old man with AIDS had a periodontal abscess, no fever, and normal findings on funduscopic examination.
 Three months later, the abscess area was debrided, and histologic examination of the tissue revealed osteomyelitis of the mandible.
 Within the area of osteomyelitis were numerous cells with inclusions typical of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infected cells.
 Funduscopic examination at that time revealed extensive CMV retinitis.
 Osteomyelitis should be added to the list of infections caused by CMV in patients with AIDS.
