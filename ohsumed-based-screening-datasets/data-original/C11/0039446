Implantation of Kelman-style, open-loop anterior chamber lenses during keratoplasty for aphakic and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy. A comparison with iris-sutured posterior chamber lenses.
 The clinical and specular microscopic results of 40 cases (39 patients) of penetrating keratoplasty during which a Kelman-style anterior chamber intraocular lens was implanted were reviewed retrospectively.
 Thirty-one pseudophakic eyes received an intraocular lens exchange and nine aphakic eyes received a secondary intraocular lens.
 Postoperative follow-up averaged 24.5 months (range, 3 to 51 months).
 At 1, 2, and 3 years after keratoplasty, 39.3%, 63.2%, and 63.6% of eyes, respectively, had visual acuities of 20/40 or better.
 Ninety-five percent of the grafts remained clear.
 Causes of poor postoperative visual acuity included cystoid macular edema (32.5%), new glaucoma (22.5%), and age-related macular degeneration (10.0%).
 Other causes were endothelial rejection leading to graft failure, corneal ulceration, and retinal detachment.
 Corneal endothelial cell loss by specular microscopy was 11.5% at 1 years, 21.3% at 2 years, and 25.0% at 3 years.
 These results were compared with cell loss associated with iris-sutured posterior chamber lenses in penetrating keratoplasty.
 Visual outcomes and complication rates were similar between these two methods; however, the endothelial attrition at 1 and 2 years for the sutured posterior chamber lens was greater than that of the Kelman anterior chamber lens.
