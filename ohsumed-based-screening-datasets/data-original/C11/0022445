Anisometropic amblyopia.
 One hundred twenty-four patients with anisometropia of 1 diopter or greater and amblyopia were reviewed as to the type and amount of anisometropia, whether or not they had consulted with an ophthalmologist, visual acuity before and after treatment, and type of treatment.
 The patient population was divided into five groups according to the type of anisometropia.
 Eighty-two percent of all patients reached a visual acuity of 20/40 or better.
 Eighteen percent of all patients reached a visual acuity of 20/20.
 The best visual acuity obtained was not found to be related to the degree of anisometropia or the age at which treatment was begun.
 Patients with myopic and compound myopic astigmatism/mixed astigmatism anisometropia had poorer visual outcomes.
 There was a strong positive correlation between the initial visual acuity and the best visual acuity obtained (P = 0.0001).
