Early visual rehabilitation following keratoplasty using a single continuous adjustable suture technique.
 We measured postkeratoplasty visual acuity, refraction, retinoscopy, keratometry, and corneal topography in 105 patients, in 33 of whom an adjustable continuous technique had been used, and in 72 of whom a standard technique (in which the continuous suture was not adjusted) had been used.
 In the eyes in which the sutures were adjusted (within 6 weeks following surgery), acuity improved (preadjustment mean, 20/205; postadjustment mean, 20/100), and astigmatism decreased (preadjustment mean, 8.41 diopters; postadjustment mean, 2.22 D).
 Visual acuity and astigmatism in the control group were unchanged at the same point after surgery.
