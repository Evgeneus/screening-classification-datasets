Fitting of aspheric high gas-permeable rigid contact lenses to scarred corneas.
 Scarring of the cornea often results in an irregular corneal surface, which causes scattering in light perception.
 Therefore, the impaired visual acuity cannot be adequately corrected by spectacles in most cases.
 In this study, high oxygen-transmissible aspheric rigid lenses were fitted, with computer assistance, in 26 scarred eyes of 23 consecutive patients.
 In 15 of 26 eyes (57.7%), a successful fitting with good vision, no complications, and a sufficiently long wearing time was accomplished.
 The main lens-related complications included fluorescein-staining epithelial defects in five of 26 eyes (19.2%) and epithelial edema in two of 26 eyes (7.7%).
 Computer-aided fitting was of limited value because keratometer readings were not measurable in 50% of the cases.
 The results of this study indicate that the application of high oxygen-transmissible aspheric rigid contact lenses may obviate corneal surgery.
