Technical procedures and software for magnification-corrected morphometry of optic disk photography.
 In order to obtain a new diagnostic tool for the early diagnosis of glaucoma, we developed a method based on computerized analysis of the optic disk, cup and neuroretinal rim areas.
 A fundus camera, a personal computer and a graphic tablet are employed.
 Suitable software was developed for calculating the areas (disk, cup and rim) providing an index, the rim/disk ratio.
 The method revealed high repeatability and reproducibility.
 The simplicity and speed of the procedure make this test suitable for routine clinical use in the early diagnosis of glaucoma.
