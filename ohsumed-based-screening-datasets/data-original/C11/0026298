An eyelash nidus for dacryoliths of the lacrimal excretory and secretory systems.
 We treated two patients with dacryolithiasis secondary to an eyelash.
 The first patient underwent dacryocystorhinostomy for a stone within the lacrimal sac.
 In the second patient the dacryolith was removed from a lacrimal gland ductule.
 Eyelashes found in the tear film or conjunctival fornices during routine examination should be removed to prevent the possible occurrence of dacryolithiasis.
