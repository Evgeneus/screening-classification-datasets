Effect of contact lens biomicroscopy on the clarity of fluorescein angiography.
 To study the effect of contact lens fundus biomicroscopy on the clarity of subsequent fluorescein angiography, the authors compared the fluorescein angiogram from 20 eyes recently examined using a fundus contact lens with fellow control eyes.
 Saline solution was used to couple the lens to the cornea.
 In 15 (75%) of the 20 pairs of eyes studied, there was no difference in the fluorescein angiogram clarity between examined and control eyes.
 In five (25%) patients, there was a slight asymmetry in clarity between the examined and control eyes, but this did not affect the ability to interpret the angiogram.
 The results were verified by comparing the overall quality of the transit phase of the angiograms.
 The application of a fundus contact lens to the cornea using saline solution as a coupling agent does not adversely affect the clarity of subsequent fluorescein angiography.
