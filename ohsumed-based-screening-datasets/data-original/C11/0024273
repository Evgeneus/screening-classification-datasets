Surface-wrinkling maculopathy as a potential complication of trabeculectomy: a case report.
 We report a case of "crinkled cellophane maculopathy" which developed during the first few days following an uneventful trabeculectomy in a high myopic patient with primary open-angle glaucoma.
 We suggest pathogenic mechanisms that may have induced such premacular lesions, emphasizing the patient's high myopia combined with a postoperative inflammatory reaction.
