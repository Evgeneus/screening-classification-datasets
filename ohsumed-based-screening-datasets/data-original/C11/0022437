Modified Schocket implant for refractory glaucoma. Experience of 55 cases.
 Fifty-five eyes of 51 patients with different forms of refractory glaucoma (15 aphakic, 12 neovascular, 9 postpenetrating keratoplasty, 8 congenital, 5 secondary to uveitis, 4 associated with aniridia, 1 pseudophakic, and 1 traumatic) underwent antiglaucomatous surgery using a modified 90 degrees Schocket implant.
 In 25 eyes (45.4%), this was the first surgical procedure.
 Follow-up ranged from 3 to 27 months (mean, 10.3 +/- 5.4 months).
 The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) was 39.5 +/- 8.6 mmHg (range, 22 to 66 mmHg).
 The mean postoperative IOP was 17.8 +/- 7.6 mmHg (range, 4 to 50 mmHg).
 Intraocular pressure remained less than 21 mmHg in 50 eyes (90.9%) during the follow-up period.
 In 13 of these eyes (26.0%), IOP remained under control without any medication.
 Complications were observed in 13 eyes (23.6%) and were successfully treated in 11 of them.
 Complications included iris-tube block (5.4%), vitreous-tube block (3.6%), early postoperative flat anterior chamber (1.8%), choroidal effusion (3.6%), tube exteriorization from anterior chamber (3.6%), tube displacement from silicone band (1.8%), retinal detachment (1.8%), tube-cornea touch (1.8%), vitreous hemorrhage (1.8%), infectious endophthalmitis (1.8%), and phthisis bulbi (1.8%).
 Modified 90 degrees Schocket implants are an effective technique in the management of refractory glaucoma.
