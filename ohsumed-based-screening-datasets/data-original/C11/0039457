Triple agent immunosuppression in serpiginous choroiditis.
 Serpiginous choroidopathy is a progressive choroidal inflammatory disorder that typically has a variable saltatory course.
 Response to steroids is uncertain.
 By using azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone in combination, the authors have observed rapid remission of active disease in five patients.
 Remissions have been maintained for periods up to 18 months.
 Because of the synergistic effects of this combination, doses could rapidly be reduced to maintenance levels without reactivation.
 Disease in two patients recurred immediately after discontinuation of low-dose therapy but was arrested when therapy resumed.
 Triple agent immunosuppressive therapy is well tolerated and appears to be effective.
