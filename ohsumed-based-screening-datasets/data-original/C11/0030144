A technique for retinal pigment epithelium transplantation for age-related macular degeneration secondary to extensive subfoveal scarring.
 We describe the surgical excision of submacular scar in end-stage age-related macular degeneration and transplantation of autologous and homologous retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells.
 The technique involves the preparation of a large retinal flap encompassing the macula and the arcades, removal of the submacular scar, and replacement of the RPE cells, using either an autologous pedicle graft or homologous RPE cells and Bruch's membrane.
 Fourteen months following the procedure, visual acuity in a patient with a pedicle graft had improved from counts fingers to 20/400 and the patient fixated over the transplanted RPE cells.
 After 10 months, a homologous graft in a second patient had become encapsulated with a fine subretinal membrane without neovascular tissue; visual acuity had not improved.
 No intraoperative or postoperative complications resulting from the surgery occurred in either patient.
