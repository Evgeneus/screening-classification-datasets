Retinal vasculitis as a complication of rheumatoid arthritis.
 Two middle-aged women developed retinal vasculitis in the moderately active phase of classical rheumatoid arthritis.
 Fluorescein angiography disclosed diffuse leakage from the retinal capillaries and cystoid macular edema, which subsided in response to oral steroid.
 They did not show any clinical signs of vasculitis in other parts of the body.
 Retinal vasculitis should be included in the list of complications observed in rheumatoid arthritis.
