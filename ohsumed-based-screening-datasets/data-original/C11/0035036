Effect of massive dose vitamin A on morbidity and mortality in Indian children 
 The effect of vitamin A supplementation on preschool child morbidity and mortality was assessed in a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study around Hyderabad, India.
 Every six months 200,000 IU vitamin A was given to 7691 children (treatment group) whereas 8084 children received a placebo (control group).
 Morbidity and mortality data were collected every three months.
 Risk of respiratory infection was higher in children with mild xerophthalmia than in children with normal eyes.
 Vitamin A supplementation had no effect on morbidity status.
 Mortality rates were similar in the two groups; it was highest in children who did not receive either vitamin A or placebo.
 The findings suggest that vitamin A supplementation alone may not reduce child mortality.
