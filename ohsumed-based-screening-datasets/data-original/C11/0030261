Unilateral frosted branch angiitis.
 We examined two patients with monocular frosted branch angiitis.
 The patients were young and healthy; they rapidly developed severe visual loss with thick, white sheathing of the retinal veins and responded promptly to systemic corticosteroids.
 The fluorescein angiograms showed late leakage from the retinal veins, without evidence of stasis or occlusion.
 Frosted branch angiitis can be either a unilateral or a bilateral condition.
 We believe the potential for visual loss and the prompt response to systemic corticosteroids make early, accurate diagnosis and institution of therapy desirable.
