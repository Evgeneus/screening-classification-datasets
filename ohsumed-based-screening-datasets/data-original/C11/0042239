Ocular infections associated with Comamonas acidovorans.
 Comamonas acidovorans (Pseudomonas acidovorans) is a ubiquitous gram-negative rod.
 Although generally considered nonpathogenic, we found C.
 acidovorans to be associated with six cases of ocular infections.
 The organism was the only isolate in three cases, whereas an association of other organisms was present in three cases.
 The multiple resistance patterns of these strains to antibiotic susceptibility testing emphasizes the need for culturing ocular infections.
 We recommend the identification and susceptibility testing of all ocular gram-negative rod isolates.
