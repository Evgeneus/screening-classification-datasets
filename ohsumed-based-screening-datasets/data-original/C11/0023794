Late-onset elevation in intraocular pressure after neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.
 We retrospectively studied the long-term change in intraocular pressure after neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.
 Uncomplicated extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation was performed in 446 consecutive normal eyes (401 patients), 237 (53%) of which subsequently underwent uncomplicated neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy.
 Late-onset elevation in intraocular pressure was seen in three eyes (1.4%) after cataract surgery alone (mean follow-up, 2.7 +/- 1.7 years) and in 14 eyes (5.9%) after cataract and laser surgeries (mean follow-up, 3.0 +/- 1.1 years).
 This difference was statistically significant (P less than .03).
 These results suggest that, in addition to immediate changes in intraocular pressure, neodymium-YAG laser posterior capsulotomy may be associated with an increase in intraocular pressure long after the laser surgery, even in normal eyes without obvious postoperative complications.
