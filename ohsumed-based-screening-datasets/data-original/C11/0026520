Hexagonal keratotomy for intraocular lens miscalculation.
 As the result of miscalculation of the intraocular lens before cataract surgery, hyperopia and anisometropia developed in a 67-year-old woman.
 Hexagonal keratotomy performed 7 years later under topical anesthesia with a 5-mm marker resulted in a myopic shift of 4.37 dioptres and an uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25.
