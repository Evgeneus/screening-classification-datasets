Influence of lens opacities on visual field indices.
 This report presents the results of a study designed to verify the influence of lens opacities on the visual field indices.
 Four age-matched groups of subjects were considered: healthy volunteers, glaucomatous patients without lens opacities, cataractous patients without glaucoma and glaucomatous patients with lens opacities.
 The quantification of lens opacities was performed with the Lens Opacity Meter 701 instrument.
 The visual field indices were obtained automatically from the G1 program of the Octopus system.
 The statistical analysis of the results (coefficient of correlation) has shown that only the visual field indices that correspond to uniform and diffuse loss of light sensitivity were influenced by the presence of cataract.
 On the contrary, the visual field indices that indicate local irregularities of the threshold were not significantly influenced by the presence of lens opacities.
