Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of uveal tumors.
 We detected seven tumors with magnetic resonance imaging, which demonstrate some of the uses and limitations of this diagnostic technique.
 In one patient, the correct diagnosis of extraocular extension was demonstrated with magnetic resonance imaging when both clinical and ultrasonographic data were not diagnostic.
 In another case, an extremely small area of extraocular extension was detected with ultrasound evaluation but was not noted on magnetic resonance imaging.
 Magnetic resonance imaging is highly reliable in the detection of intraocular tumors.
 In pigmented uveal melanomas it is both sensitive and highly specific.
 In amelanotic processes magnetic resonance imaging can identify a mass but cannot always adequately characterize it.
 Further experience will be necessary to determine the proper role of magnetic resonance imaging in the evaluation of uveal tumors.
