Blunt ocular trauma secondary to "war games".
 "War games" are gaining popularity in the western United States.
 These recreational contests involve members of one team attempting to shoot their opponents with high-velocity dye or paint pellets fired from air guns.
 Unfortunately, serious eye injuries occur when participants do not use protective eye wear.
 We report a case of severe blunt ocular trauma resulting in a hyphema, choroidal rupture, and retinal and vitreal hemorrhage secondary to a paint pellet striking an unprotected eye.
 This injury resulted in a significant visual defect in this patient.
