A clinicopathological study of seven globes enucleated after primary radiation therapy for malignant melanoma of the choroid or ciliary body.
 Seven patients with malignant melanoma of the choroid or ciliary body were initially managed with radiation therapy, either teletherapy with proton or cobalt 60 external beam, or brachytherapy with the insertion of an episcleral plaque containing iodine 125, 60Co or gold 198.
 All seven globes subsequently were enucleated because of progressive growth of the tumours, total retinal detachment, persistent vitreous hemorrhage, or neovascular or angle-closure glaucoma.
 Six of the patients had severe visual loss at the time of enucleation.
 The effects of radiation therapy on the neoplasms and the mechanisms for the visual loss are discussed.
