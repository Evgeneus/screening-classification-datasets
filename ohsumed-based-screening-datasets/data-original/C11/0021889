Retinal vasculitis--a primer.
 Retinal vasculitis is a diagnosis that is generally suggested by an ophthalmologist.
 Frequently patients with the disorder are referred to nonophthalmologists for further diagnostic evaluation or treatment.
 The criteria for defining vasculitis differ greatly between ophthalmologists and other physicians.
 To facilitate collaboration between ophthalmologists and their colleagues, we have sought to clarify the term "retinal vasculitis" by discussing its subcategories, the potential role of antiphospholipid antibodies, and the etiology of retinal vasculitis.
 We offer guidelines for evaluating the disorder and treating patients.
