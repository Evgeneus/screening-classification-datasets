Varicella disciform stromal keratitis.
 We treated five patients, aged 26, 4, 6, 13, and 7 years, who developed disciform stromal keratitis one, four, four, eight, and ten weeks, respectively, after the onset of the acute vesicular exanthema.
 Serologic testing confirmed recent varicella and excluded other infectious causes in two cases.
 After initial improvement with a topical corticosteroid, three patients developed recurrent corneal inflammation resembling zoster keratitis.
 These cases and previous reports indicate that varicella-zoster virus is a cause of disciform stromal keratitis that may occur and recur several weeks or months after the primary skin rash has resolved.
