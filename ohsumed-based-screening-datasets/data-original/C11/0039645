Analysis of local antibody production in the vitreous humor of patients with severe uveitis.
 We analyzed the local antibody production in vitreous humor samples collected during vitrectomy in patients with severe vision-threatening uveitis.
 In 24 patients, paired serum and undiluted vitreous humor samples were collected and tested for antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii, herpes simplex virus, varicella-zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Toxocara canis.
 Total IgG and the Goldmann-Witmer coefficient were determined.
 The initial diagnosis of ocular toxoplasmosis could be confirmed in six of the seven patients.
 The seventh patient showed a local antibody production against herpes simplex virus.
 One of the three patients with chronic panuveitis at initial diagnosis showed a local antibody production against T.
 gondii.
 These last two findings resulted in a change in medical treatment.
 Analysis of local antibody production in vitreous humor samples is a valuable diagnostic tool.
