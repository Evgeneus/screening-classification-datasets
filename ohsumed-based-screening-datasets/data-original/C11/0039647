An updated classification of retinal detachment with proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
 The Retinal Society classification on proliferative vitreoretinopathy of 1983 has been updated to accommodate major progress in understanding of this disease.
 There are three grades describing increasing severity of the disease.
 Posterior and anterior location of the proliferations have been emphasized.
 A more detailed description of posterior and anterior contractions has been made possible by adding contraction types such as focal, diffuse, subretinal, circumferential contraction, and anterior displacement.
 The extent of the abnormality has been detailed by using clock hours instead of quadrants.
