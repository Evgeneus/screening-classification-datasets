Scleral buckling for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment associated with severe myopia.
 From Jan.
 1, 1980, to Dec.
 31, 1989, we performed scleral buckling surgery on 48 eyes of 46 patients for rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated with severe myopia (greater than 5.00 diopters).
 Forty eyes of 38 patients were observed for at least six months, and the mean follow-up period was 46 months.
 Intraoperative complications occurred in four of 48 eyes (8%) and included retinal incarceration (two eyes), choroidal hemorrhage (one eye), and choroidal detachment (one eye).
 Three of the 40 eyes (7.5%) followed up for more than six months developed a recurrent retinal detachment and underwent a revision of the scleral buckle.
 At the last follow-up examination, the retinas of all 40 eyes were totally reattached.
 Final visual acuity of 20/40 or better was attained in 26 of 40 eyes (65%).
 Because of the low rate of intraoperative complications and the high rate of success, scleral buckling is recommended for most patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments associated with severe myopia.
