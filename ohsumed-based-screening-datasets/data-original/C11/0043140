Ocular pharmacokinetics of subconjunctivally administered cyclosporine in the rabbit.
 The authors assessed the ocular toxicity and pharmacokinetics of subconjunctivally and intravenously administered cyclosporine in New Zealand white rabbits.
 Fifteen rabbits received a subconjunctival injection of 5 (five animals), 10 (five animals) or 25 (five animals) mg of cyclosporine in 0.1 mL (intravenous solution of Sandimmune [50 mg/mL]); 5 mg was found to be the maximum tolerable dose.
 This dose was given as a bolus to 36 other rabbits either subconjunctivally (18 animals) or intravenously (18 animals).
 In both groups the cyclosporine concentrations in the ocular compartments, blood and urine were measured by means of high-pressure liquid chromatography at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 hours, three animals being assessed at each interval.
 Subconjunctival administration resulted in peak cyclosporine concentrations of 718 ng/mL in the aqueous humour and 1078 ng/mL in the vitreous humour, compared with no detectable levels in the aqueous humour and a peak concentration of 292 ng/mL in the vitreous following intravenous administration.
 The peak blood cyclosporine levels were 10 times lower after subconjunctival injection than after intravenous injection.
 The results indicate that subconjunctival administration is superior to intravenous administration in enhancing the ocular absorption of cyclosporine while minimizing systemic exposure in the rabbit.
