Effects of pulsed Nd:YAG laser on the surface of rabbit retina.
 Six albino rabbits were subjected to pulsed Nd:YAG laser irradiation to the retinal surface to determine whether such treatment would lead to proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
 Choroidal, retinal, and preretinal hemorrhages, noted at the time of treatment, resolved after 7 to 10 days.
 Histological examination showed no signs of anterior segment damage or proliferative vitreoretinopathy.
 These preliminary findings suggest that more extensive experimentation is warranted to determine if pulsed Nd:YAG laser may in fact safely be used to separate vitreoretinal adhesions in the treatment of retinal detachment.
