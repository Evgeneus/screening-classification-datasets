Lyme disease: neurologic and ophthalmic manifestations.
 Lyme disease is tick-borne infection which produces early and late manifestations in many organ systems.
 Prominent symptoms and signs occur in skin, heart, joints and nervous system.
 Many ocular and neuro-ophthalmic abnormalities recently have been attributed to Lyme disease, but some cases have not been well established as direct sequelae.
 This review of the contemporary state of knowledge about Lyme disease was undertaken so that more rigorous criteria can be applied in future diagnosis.
