Vitreous photography with a +90-diopter double aspheric preset lens vs the El Bayadi-Kajiura preset lens.
 Two fundus lenses, a 90-diopter preset lens and a 58.6-diopter El Bayadi-Kajiura lens, were compared.
 The lenses were evaluated with regard to their optics, magnification, field of view, and photographic usefulness in photographing the posterior vitreous.
 The 90-diopter lens provided a wider field of view but lower magnification.
 Both lenses permitted high-quality vitreous photographs through the slit lamp, but the 90-diopter lens allowed photographs to be taken through small pupils and some lens opacities.
