Changes in keratometry following trabeculectomy.
 The results of keratometry following trabeculectomy are presented.
 In contrast to the effects of wound gape after cataract extraction, trabeculectomy produces a reduction in the vertical corneal radius.
 An initial corresponding increase in horizontal radius is found immediately postoperatively, but this is not apparent by two and seven weeks after surgery.
 A possible explanation for these findings is proposed.
