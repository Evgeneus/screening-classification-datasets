Management of late-onset angle-closure glaucoma associated with retinopathy of prematurity.
 Late-onset angle-closure glaucoma secondary to retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) occurred in ten eyes of ten patients.
 The age at presentation ranged from 12 to 45 years (mean, 32 years).
 Eight eyes had nonneovascular mechanisms for the angle closure while two had neovascular angle closure.
 Treatment of eyes with this form of secondary angle closure included medical management alone, peripheral iridectomy, trabeculectomy, lensectomy, alloplastic tube shunt implantation, and cilioablative procedures.
 Three eyes required more than one of these treatments.
 The choice of therapy was based on the initial intraocular pressure and vision, degree of lens opacity and intumescence, presence of anterior segment neovascularization, and the gonioscopic appearance of the anterior chamber angle.
 The clinical features of this condition are described and a proposed mechanism and therapeutic approach are presented.
