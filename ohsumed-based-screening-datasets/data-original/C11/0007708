The macular photostress test in diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration.
 We propose the macular photostress test for the evaluation of macular function in the office setting.
 Eighty eyes were tested and divided into four diagnostic categories: background diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, age-related macular degeneration, and normal.
 The recovery times for the eyes with age-related macular degeneration were longer than for eyes with macular edema (P = .03).
 Age-matched patients with age-related macular degeneration had longer recovery times than did those without age-related macular degeneration (P = .0001).
 A possible explanation is that the prolonged recovery time in the eyes with age-related macular degeneration reflects that the anatomic lesion is located in the retinal pigment epithelium-photoreceptor complex.
 In comparison, the eyes with macular edema, whose lesion is in the inner retina and not the retinal pigment epithelium, show a less-prolonged recovery time than the eyes with age-related macular degeneration.
