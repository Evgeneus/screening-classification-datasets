Angle closure glaucoma precipitated by aerosolized atropine.
 Angle closure glaucoma is an infrequent form of glaucoma occurring when the filtration mechanism for the aqueous humor is obstructed by apposition of the peripheral iris to the trabecular meshwork.
 Anatomic features associated with acute-angle closure include congenitally small anterior segments, increased lens thickness, and shallow anterior chamber depth.
 We present two patients who developed signs and symptoms of angle closure glaucoma after receiving aerosolized atropine for treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 We recommend that before instituting therapy with an inhaled anticholinergic agent, the patient should be questioned concerning prior history of angle closure glaucoma symptoms and signs and the anterior chamber depth should be examined using iris illumination.
 Patients having shallow anterior chambers, or possible prior angle closure glaucoma attacks, should be examined by an ophthalmologist before inhalant anticholinergic therapy.
