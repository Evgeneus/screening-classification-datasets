Exercise training reduces intraocular pressure among subjects suspected of having glaucoma.
 The effect of exercise conditioning on elevated intraocular pressure has not been previously described among sedentary individuals.
 We prospectively observed intraocular pressure for nine sedentary subjects suspected of having glaucoma before and after 3 months of aerobic exercise training.
 Mean (+/- SEM) aerobic capacity, as assessed by maximal oxygen uptake, increased 6.3 +/- 1.6 mL.kg-1.min-1 (30%) (P less than .02).
 Mean intraocular pressure decreased 4.6 +/- 0.4 mmHg (20%) (P less than .001) at the end of the conditioning period.
 With cessation of exercise and subsequent detraining, intraocular pressure returned to elevated preconditioning levels by 3 weeks.
 Regular aerobic exercise is associated with a reduction in elevated intraocular pressure and may represent an effective nonpharmacologic intervention for patients suspected of having glaucoma.
