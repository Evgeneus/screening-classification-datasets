Krypton laser-induced lens opacity as a complication of retinal photocoagulation.
 Lens opacification is a well-documented complication of argon laser photocoagulation, particularly in eyes with preexisting cataracts.
 In eyes with media opacity, the krypton laser is frequently used for its superior penetrating qualities.
 To date, lens opacification from krypton application has not been documented.
 We report such a case in a cataractous eye with a vitreous hemorrhage undergoing panretinal photocoagulation.
 Factors previously implicated in the etiology of laser-induced lens damage were not present.
 The opacities were similar to those produced by the argon laser.
 We present a mechanism for understanding laser-induced lens damage and speculate on the difference between the interaction of argon versus krypton laser energy with lens constituents.
