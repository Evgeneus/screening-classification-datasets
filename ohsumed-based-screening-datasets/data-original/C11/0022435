Climatic droplet keratopathy with corneal amyloidosis.
 Climatic droplet keratopathy (CDK) is a degenerative disease of the cornea, highly prevalent in Saudi Arabia.
 It is characterized by aggregates of small, golden-yellow globules that accumulate in the subepithelial layers, Bowman's layer, and the superficial stroma of the cornea.
 The authors report on 22 patients (40 eyes) with CDK and lattice lines in the cornea.
 The condition occurred late in life (mean age, 67 years).
 It was bilateral in 82% of patients, with no family history of lattice dystrophy or systemic amyloidosis.
 These lines were found in all layers of the stroma.
 Results of histopathologic and electron microscopic examination of the lattice lines confirmed the presence of amyloid.
 Results of immunohistochemical examination showed evidence of deposition of AP protein.
 The cause of these deposits in the cornea is not known, but the authors speculate that environmental factors causing CDK also may play a role in the deposition of protein AP in the cornea.
 The contribution of trachoma to the degenerative changes in the cornea and secondary amyloidosis could not be ruled out, as all patients had inactive trachoma.
 Climatic droplet keratopathy with corneal amyloidosis, therefore, represents a form of "lattice degeneration" of the cornea.
