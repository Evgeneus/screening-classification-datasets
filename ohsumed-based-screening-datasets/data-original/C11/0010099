Orbital complications secondary to endoscopic sinus surgery.
 Eight cases of significant orbital complications associated with endoscopic sinus surgery are described.
 The anatomic problems generally fall into four categories: nasolacrimal sac or duct injury, extraocular muscle injury, intraorbital hemorrhage/emphysema, or optic nerve injury.
 The successful management of each complication depends on a thorough knowledge of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the orbital injury.
 Return to normal function of the traumatized orbital structures after medical and/or surgical intervention is anticipated.
 However, direct optic nerve injury with immediate visual field and/or acuity deficit is usually irreversible.
