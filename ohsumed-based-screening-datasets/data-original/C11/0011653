Absence of retroviral sequences in Graves' disease.
 An earlier report of HIV-1 gene sequences in thyroid cell genomic DNA from patients with Graves' disease prompted use of the polymerase chain reaction technique to identify such sequences in Graves' disease thyroid tissue and in white blood-cells from these patients.
 We were unable to confirm the existence of HIV-1-related DNA sequences in Graves' specimens.
