Initial 5-fluorouracil trabeculectomy in uncomplicated glaucoma.
 The effectiveness of trabeculectomy with adjunctive low-dose 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) as the initial surgical procedure in uncomplicated glaucoma was evaluated retrospectively in a consecutive series of 52 patients (mean follow-up, 18.6 +/- 11.7 mos) and 74 control subjects.
 The cumulative 2-year success (intraocular pressure [IOP] less than 21 mmHg) was 100% in the 5-FU group and 78.9% in the control group (P = 0.01, Wilcoxon test).
 The 5-FU group had a mean postoperative IOP of 12.5 +/- 4.6 mmHg versus 17.4 +/- 5.7 mmHg in the control group at 2-year follow-up (P = 0.015, t test).
 Antiglaucoma medications were required in 5.8% of patients in the 5-FU group and in 41.9% of controls within 2 years (P less than 0.0001, Fisher's exact test).
 These results suggest that low-dose 5-FU at the time of initial trabeculectomy leads to a higher success rate, lower IOP, and less need for antiglaucoma medications postoperatively.
