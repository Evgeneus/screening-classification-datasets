Regression analysis of visual field progression in low tension glaucoma.
 Eighty four patients (168 eyes) with low tension glaucoma were retrospectively reviewed (mean follow-up was 28 months).
 The mean age was 66 years, and 69% were females.
 Regression analysis of their automated Humphrey fields (a mean of eight fields per eye) showed progression in 50% of patients and in 37% of eyes.
 There was no statistically significant difference between patients with progression and non-progression with respect to age (p less than 0.05) or intraocular pressure (p less than 0.5).
 Visual field defects were located most frequently in the superior hemifield in both groups of patients.
 A considerable proportion of patients had advanced field loss at the time of diagnosis.
