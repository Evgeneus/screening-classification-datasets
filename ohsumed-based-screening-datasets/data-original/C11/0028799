Role of a regional register for familial adenomatous polyposis: experience in the northern region.
 Within 36 months of its formation the Northern Region Polyposis Registry had increased the number of identified gene carriers of familial adenomatous polyposis from 56 to 65 in a population of 3.1 million and had achieved a 15-fold increase in the number of at-risk relatives being regularly screened.
 Review of the surgical records at the outset of the registry revealed that the mean age at diagnosis of those patients detected by screening was 24.7 years, whereas it was 36.6 years for those detected by symptoms.
 Ten of the 31 in the latter group had colorectal carcinomas whilst only one of those detected by screening had a cancer and a significantly higher proportion had sphincter-saving surgery.
 A regional registry can provide an effective screening and counselling service to surgeons treating patients with familial adenomatous polyposis.
 At-risk relatives are best assessed by combining results of the different screening procedures now available but the prime requirement of a successful registry is dedicated domiciliary counselling.
