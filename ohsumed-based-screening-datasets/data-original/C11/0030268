Pseudophakic pupillary-block glaucoma in children.
 We studied 16 children, ranging in age between 3 and 8 years, who had posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and developed inflammatory pupillary-block glaucoma.
 Prophylactic peripheral iridectomy had not been performed in any of the eyes.
 The patients were treated medically, and YAG laser iridotomy was performed successfully one week after initial control of intraocular pressure.
 Of 16 eyes in which intraocular pressure remained uncontrolled, trabeculectomy was necessary in three eyes and irreversible glaucomatous visual loss occurred in two eyes.
 Our data demonstrate the need for stringent and more frequent postoperative follow-up of children after intraocular lens implantation, especially during the first four postoperative weeks.
 Careful long-term follow-up for treatment after cataract is mandatory to prevent development of amblyopia.
