Disc swelling in an adult diabetic patient [clinical conference]
 A patient with insulin dependent adult onset diabetes presented with bilateral disc edema and minimal visual dysfunction.
 Initial work-up excluded an intracranial lesion, and a lumbar puncture revealed a normal opening pressure.
 The patient developed proliferative retinopathy, for which she received photocoagulation therapy.
 She subsequently developed an exacerbation and change of her disc swelling, associated with raised intracranial pressure.
 The differential diagnosis of diabetic papillopathy and papilledema is discussed.
