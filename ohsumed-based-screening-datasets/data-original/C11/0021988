Idiopathic bilateral spontaneous hyphemas.
 Spontaneous hyphemas are rare and usually associated with iris microhemangiomas or other vascular anomalies of the iris.
 In addition, various systemic problems can result in spontaneous hyphema.
 This is a case report of a bilateral spontaneous hyphema (recurrent in one eye), in which no predisposing condition could be identified after exhaustive hematologic evaluation and iris fluorescein angiography.
