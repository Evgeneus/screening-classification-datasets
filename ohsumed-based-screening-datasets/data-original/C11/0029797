Chronic anterior uveitis in leprosy: an insidious cause of blindness.
 Chronic low grade anterior uveitis is the commonest cause of blindness in leprosy.
 It is usually asymptomatic until the late stages, and often patients seek help only after irreversible visual impairment has occurred.
 We present herewith several cases of this entity to emphasise the insidious nature of the disease, the extent of ocular damage it can cause, and the importance of early detection and treatment.
