Acute dacryocystic retention cured by inferior turbinate infracturing.
 A 30-year-old man with recurrent acute dacryocystic retention had successful infracturing of the inferior turbinate bone in association with probing of the lacrimal outflow system.
 Enlargement of the inferior nasal meatus by fracturing the turbinate is easy to do and would be indicated before recommending a dacryocystorhinostomy in cases of acute dacryocystic retention in which the causative cast is difficult to eliminate even by large probes that can be passed down the nasolacrimal duct.
