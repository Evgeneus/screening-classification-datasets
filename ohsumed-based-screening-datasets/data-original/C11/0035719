New device for CT-targeted percutaneous punctures.
 A device for computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous punctures that is not affixed to the patient and can be used even when the gantry is tilted was developed and tested.
 In initial patient examinations, the device was accurate within 1.0 mm of the predetermined target point.
 Experience so far has involved retrobulbar anesthesia and puncture of intervertebral disk space.
