The use of releasable sutures in Molteno glaucoma implant procedures to reduce postoperative hypotony.
 We used releasable sutures to minimize immediate postoperative hypotony and flat anterior chamber in 19 cases of refractory glaucoma requiring insertion of a single-plate Molteno implant in a one-stage procedure.
 A slip knot using 7-0 nylon suture was fashioned around the Molteno tube under a lamellar scleral flap.
 In 18 of the 19 eyes, anterior chamber depth was normal immediately after surgery.
