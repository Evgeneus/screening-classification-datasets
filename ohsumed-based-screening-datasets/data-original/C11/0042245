Intrathecal antibody production against viruses of the herpesvirus family in acute retinal necrosis syndrome.
 Viruses of the herpesvirus family cause acute retinal necrosis syndrome, a devastating necrotic retinitis in immunocompetent individuals.
 Direct proof of the viral origin of this disease may be obtained by demonstration of the virus, viral antigens, or viral DNA in biopsy specimens of retinas.
 In search of alternative diagnostic methods, we analyzed cerebrospinal fluid and serum with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for virus-specific antibody activity.
 Intrathecally produced viral antibodies were found in three consecutive patients with acute retinal necrosis syndrome: herpes simplex type 2 in a 30-year-old woman with a history of suspected neonatal herpes encephalitis, herpes simplex type 1 in a 35-year-old man, and varicella-zoster virus activity in a 62-year-old woman.
 None of the patients had clinical signs indicating an acute disorder in the central nervous system.
 This serologic approach seems to be of value for the diagnosis of an associated intracerebral viral infection in cases of acute retinal necrosis syndrome.
