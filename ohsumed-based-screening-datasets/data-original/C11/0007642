Ocular atopy and mycotic keratitis.
 In a retrospective analysis, we studied the association between ocular atopy and keratomycosis.
 Forty-one (26.3%) of 156 patients with fungal corneal ulcers were found to have preexisting allergic conjunctivitis.
 All patients had been using a combination of antibiotics and corticosteroids before developing the corneal ulcer.
 Fungus isolation on Sabouraud's agar medium was obtained in 74.8% (31/42) ulcers.
 The most common fungi isolated were Fusarium (32.3%) and Aspergillus (29%).
 One percent silver sulfadiazine was used as an antifungal agent in these patients.
 Overall efficacy of this drug was found to be 77.8%, with Fusarium being the most sensitive (87.5%).
