Long-term visual function in acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy.
 Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epithellopathy is a chorioretinal inflammatory disease occurring in young, healthy adults.
 The long-term visual prognosis and recurrence rate is uncertain.
 We reexamined 28 patients (53 affected eyes) with acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (mean follow-up, 8 years) to obtain details on the long-term functional visual outcome.
 The final visual acuities were 20/25 or better in 48 eyes (90.6%), 20/30 to 20/100 in four eyes (7.5%), and 20/200 in one eye (1.9%).
 Although the final visual acuity was good, 33 eyes (62.3%) were symptomatic with blurred vision, metamorphopsia, or scotomas.
 Thirty-six eyes (67.9%) had significant central visual field defects on follow-up examination.
 There were no recurrences after the initial month of symptoms.
 The chorioretinal scars did not enlarge with time.
 Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy has a good longterm prognosis for visual acuity, although most patients have residual symptoms and paracentral scotomas.
