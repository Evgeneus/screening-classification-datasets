B-scan ultrasonography of eyes containing intravitreal gas.
 Contact B-scan ultrasonography was performed on postoperative eyes containing intravitreal gas.
 Correlation of the ultrasonograms with the ophthalmoscopic findings disclosed that intraocular gas had a characteristic appearance on B-scan ultrasonography.
 Gas-fluid and gas-tissue interfaces were so highly reflective that no structures within or behind a bubble could be visualized.
 Shadowing, reverberation, and reflection artifacts were prominent, and dominated ultrasonographic findings.
 If the ultrasonographic characteristics of gas are understood, it is possible to use B-scan ultrasonography to determine if intraocular gas is present, whether there are one or several bubbles, and what percentage of the vitreous cavity is filled by gas.
 Specular reflection from a gas-fluid interface may be used to examine portions of the eye that might not otherwise be easily seen with ultrasonography.
