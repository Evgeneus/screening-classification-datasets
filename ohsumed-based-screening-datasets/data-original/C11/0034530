No excess prior cancer in patients with uveal melanoma.
 To determine whether there were more prior cancers in uveal melanoma patients than in a geographically matched control group, the authors compared the history of prior cancer in 407 uveal melanoma patients who lived in the western United States with that of 870 control subjects.
 Control subjects were selected by random digit dial and frequency-matched for age at diagnosis of patient, race, and sex.
 Fifty-one (12.5%) patients and 86 (9.9%) control subjects reported skin cancers whereas 25 (6.1%) patients and 47 (5.4%) control subjects reported other cancers.
 No statistically significant elevated estimates of relative risk (RR) were found for uveal melanoma with history of skin cancer in either men (RR = 1.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.87-2.3) or women (RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.58-2.0), or with history of other prior cancer in either sex (men, RR = 1.0, 95% CI = 0.42-2.2; women, RR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.55-2.1).
 Data from this study do not support an association between prior cancer and increased risk of uveal melanoma.
