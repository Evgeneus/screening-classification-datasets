Punctate inner choroidopathy and its differential diagnosis.
 The diagnosis of chorioretinal diseases largely depends on their clinical presentation rather than etiologic or systemic investigations.
 We report on a patient whose examination revealed a peculiar fundus pattern, almost completely different from disorders such as multifocal choroiditis, presumed ocular histoplasmosis, myopic degeneration, acute multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy, vitiliginous chorioretinitis, and punctate outer retinal toxoplasmosis.
 It resembled punctate inner choroidopathy, described by Watzke in 1984.
