Endophthalmitis caused by non-albicans species of Candida.
 While endophthalmitis due to Candida albicans is commonly seen in clinical practice, non-albicans species of Candida (NAC) are rarely reported to cause this condition.
 The English-language literature from 1965 through 1989 was reviewed for cases of endophthalmitis due to NAC.
 Clinical details of six well-documented cases and one unpublished case are presented here.
 Large studies of nosocomial fungemia are also summarized to emphasize the growing contribution of NAC to the total number of infections in humans, especially immunocompromised patients.
 The infrequency of ocular involvement in NAC infection is supported by studies in experimental animals that demonstrate a lower incidence of NAC endophthalmitis than of C.
 albicans endophthalmitis in the presence of disseminated infection.
 Since endophthalmitis in the absence of exogenous infection suggests disseminated candidal infection and since most NAC strains are relatively resistant to amphotericin B, it is important to recognize and appropriately treat endophthalmitis due to NAC.
