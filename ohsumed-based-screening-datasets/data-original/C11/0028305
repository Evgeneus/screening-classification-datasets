Leber's idiopathic stellate neuroretinitis.
 Leber's idiopathic stellate neuroretinitis, originally known as Leber's stellate maculopathy, is an uncommon syndrome characterized by unilateral optic disc swelling followed by the development of a macular star due to leakage of capillaries within the optic disc.
 It is seen in patients 50 years of age or younger and usually resolves spontaneously without visual sequelae.
 This entity should be recognized and distinguished from more serious diseases causing septic neuroretinitis or papillitis.
 We present a case which was initially thought to be septic retinitis.
