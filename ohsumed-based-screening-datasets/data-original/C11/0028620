Standardized data collection and coding in eye disease epidemiology: the Uveal Melanoma Data System.
 The Uveal Melanoma Data System of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary is a computerized data-base designed for data management and analysis with a broad range of clinical research applications.
 The system was created in 1980 and has evolved to include standardized data collection forms for all aspects of uveal melanoma patient care such as initial examination, treatment, and follow-up, as well as precoded forms for computer entry, which facilitate quality control measures and data analysis.
 Excerpts from current versions of these forms are presented.
 The Uveal Melanoma Data System has been used for a variety of clinical epidemiologic investigations.
 Examples of its application, including descriptive studies, prognostic factor studies, and treatment evaluations, are discussed.
 The model has potential broad application for clinical ophthalmic research in other specialty areas.
