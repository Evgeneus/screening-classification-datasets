North Carolina's dominant progressive foveal dystrophy: how progressive is it?
 We studied 34 family members at risk of having dominant progressive foveal dystrophy of Lefler, Wadsworth, and Sidbury (also called North Carolina macular dystrophy) and found 17 to be affected.
 Fifteen of these affected subjects were observed over at least a 10-year period for evidence of progressive macular degeneration.
 Only one subject showed objective evidence of progressive deterioration in only one eye.
 Our findings further substantiate that this dystrophy generally has a stable course, contrary to its original description.
