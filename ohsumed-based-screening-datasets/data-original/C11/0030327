Pathogenesis of retinal dystrophy in the Royal College of Surgeons rat.
 The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rat is an animal with genetically transmitted progressive retinal dystrophy.
 We compared histopathologically the RCS rat retina with normal age-matched control retinas (Long-Evans rats) using light and scanning electron microscopy.
 Retinal degeneration begins with alteration of the rod outer segments.
 There is a progressive involvement of the entire retina, with all layers affected by 45 days.
 The three-dimensional view obtained with scanning electron microscopy provides another perspective on the pathogenetic changes of the RCS retina.
