Sympathetic ophthalmia associated with anterior chamber intraocular lens implantation.
 We describe a rare case of sympathetic ophthalmia associated with intracapsular cataract extraction and anterior-chamber intraocular lens implantation.
 This occurred three months after an immediate postoperative complication of pupillary block, flat anterior chamber, and wound dehiscence with one of the lens haptics dissecting into the subconjunctival space.
 Both eyes developed granulomatous panuveitis, which partially responded to medical treatment.
 Removal of the anterior-chamber intraocular lens and pars plana vitrectomy resulted in control of the uveitis with significant visual improvement.
 A pathologic examination of material from the anterior chamber and vitreous showed lymphocytes, histiocytes, and pigment cells contributing to the diagnosis of sympathetic ophthalmia.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an intraocular lens implicated as a cause of sympathetic ophthalmia.
