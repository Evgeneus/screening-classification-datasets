Echographic characteristics of ocular toxocariasis.
 Ocular toxocariasis most commonly presents as one of three distinct clinical syndromes: endophthalmitis, localized posterior granuloma, or peripheral granuloma.
 Using standardized echography, the authors studied 11 toxocariasis patients presenting with one of these syndromes.
 Common echographic findings were noted in ten of these patients, and included: (1) a solid, high-reflective peripheral mass, (2) a vitreous band or membranes extending between the posterior pole and the mass, and (3) a traction retinal detachment or fold from the posterior pole to the mass.
 These findings were present in patients presenting with leukocoria or endophthalmitis, as well as in patients in whom the peripheral nematode lesion could be visualized clinically.
 In combination with the history, clinical examination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), standardized echography may be useful in establishing the diagnosis of ocular toxocariasis in cases of leukocoria in which nematode endophthalmitis is suspected.
