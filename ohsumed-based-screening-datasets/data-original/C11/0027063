Transscleral leiomyoma.
 A bluish-pink epibulbar lesion, which slowly enlarged over a period of 5 years, developed in a 31-year-old woman.
 The lesion initially resembled a staphyloma, based on the very thinned overlying sclera, but subsequent evaluation suggested that it was a solid mass.
 At the time of surgical removal, the mass appeared to have originated in the supraciliary region and to have eroded outward through the sclera.
 Histopathologically, the mass proved to be a leiomyoma.
 The authors propose theoretic possibilities to explain the location of this rare type of ocular smooth muscle tumor.
