Partial lamellar sclerouvectomy for ciliary body and choroidal tumors.
 The authors reviewed the postoperative course, visual results, histopathologic findings, and mortality data on 95 consecutive patients with tumors of the ciliary body and/or choroid who were managed by a partial lamellar sclerouvectomy.
 This surgical procedure is designed to remove the uveal tumor and leave intact the outer sclera and sensory retina.
 In this group of 95 patients, vitreous hemorrhage occurred in 79 (83%) cases, intraretinal or subretinal hemorrhage in 33 (35%), retinal detachment in 26 (28%), and cataract in 32 (34%).
 Most of the vitreous and retinal hemorrhages resolved spontaneously, sometimes leaving subretinal or preretinal fibrosis.
 A number of the postoperative retinal detachments resolved spontaneously, but retinal detachment surgery was necessary in 16 patients (17%), mostly in the earlier years of the survey.
 Most of the cataracts were mild and did not require surgery.
 The eventual postoperative visual acuity was equal to or better than the preoperative visual acuity in 23 cases (24%) over a mean follow-up period of 5 years.
 Enucleation was eventually necessary in 15 cases (16%), usually because of residual or recurrent tumor.
 Histopathologic diagnosis was uveal melanoma in 81 cases (85%) and other tumors in 14 cases (15%).
 There were no orbital recurrences, but distant metastases developed in five patients (5%), all of whom had undergone enucleation for recurrence of the intraocular melanoma.
 Although the surgical technique is difficult, partial lamellar sclerouvectomy appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option in selected cases of posterior uveal tumors.
