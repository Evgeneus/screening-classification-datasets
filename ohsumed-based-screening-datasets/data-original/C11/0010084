The use of Molteno implant and anterior chamber tube shunt to encircling band for the treatment of glaucoma in keratoplasty patients.
 This retrospective study reviews the results of 35 keratoplasty patients with complex corneal and glaucoma disease, who received Molteno-type (n = 25) or anterior chamber tube shunt to encircling band (ACTSEB)-type (n = 10) implant for the treatment of difficult glaucomas.
 The implant was placed before the keratoplasty in 14 eyes, during the keratoplasty procedure in 6 eyes, and subsequent to the corneal surgery in 15 eyes.
 Mean follow-up for the keratoplasty was 25.46 months (range, 6-58 months) and 24.74 months (range, 7-42 months) for the seton procedure.
 Graft rejection occurred in 12 (34%) of 35 eyes and was progressive in 9 eyes.
 Nonimmunologic failure was seen in 9 (26%) of 35 eyes.
 Grafts were repeated in ten eyes with eight of these (80%) remaining clear at a mean of 14.4 months.
 Considering the results of the repeat grafts, 25 (71%) of 35 eyes achieved clear transplants.
 Overall, 46% of patients had final visual acuities of 20/100 or better and 69% had final visual acuities of 20/400 or better.
 The mean preoperative intraocular pressure (IOP) of 34.54 mmHg (range, 14-68 mmHg; standard deviation [SD], 11.51) was lowered to a mean of 14.65 mmHg (range, 6-30 mmHg; SD, 4.49).
 In the final analysis, 30 (86%) of 35 eyes were judged successful from a glaucoma standpoint.
 We conclude that the Molteno- and ACTSEB-type implants are viable treatment alternatives in this difficult glaucoma group.
