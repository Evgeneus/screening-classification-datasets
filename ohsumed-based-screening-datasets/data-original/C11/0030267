The effect of topical antiglaucoma drugs on the results of high-pass resolution perimetry.
 We conducted a randomly assigned, double-masked, crossover study of the effects of betaxolol, epinephrine, pilocarpine, and timolol on the high-pass resolution perimetry results in normal subjects.
 The influence of topical administration of these intraocular pressure-reducing drugs was negligible, which confirmed the reliability of high-pass resolution perimetry results.
 The method seems appropriate for the diagnosis of glaucoma and the follow-up of patients with glaucoma.
