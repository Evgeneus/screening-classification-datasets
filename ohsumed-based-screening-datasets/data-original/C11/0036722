Magnetic resonance imaging of intraocular tamponades.
 The efficacy of proton magnetic resonance imaging in differentiating vitreous from C3F8 gas and silicone oil tamponades, and in detecting fresh hemorrhages and condensed vitreous was tested in rabbits in vivo.
 The results suggest that this imaging method could provide a useful alternative to ultrasonography, especially in eyes with opaque media.
