Kinetic ultrasound evaluation of the posterior vitreoretinal interface.
 The evaluation of the posterior vitreoretinal interface is important in the study of the natural course and preoperative evaluation of numerous disorders of the retina.
 The exact status of the posterior vitreous cannot always be reliably determined by ophthalmoscopic examination.
 The diagnostic value of kinetic contact ultrasonography was investigated to evaluate the status of the posterior vitreous in 70 eyes with clear ocular media.
 Contact B-scan ultrasound provided an extremely accurate method for evaluating the posterior vitreoretinal interface in 69 of the 70 eyes in this study, when compared with all conventional clinical means of examination including slit-lamp biomicroscopy with the Goldmann contact lens and fundus photography with the El Bayadi-Kajiura lens.
 Contact B-scan ultrasonography is an important diagnostic adjunct in determining the status of the vitreoretinal interface.
