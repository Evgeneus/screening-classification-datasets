Scleritis and Wegener's granulomatosis in children.
 We treated two children with scleritis (one unilateral, one bilateral), in whom Wegener's granulomatosis was diagnosed on the basis of pathologic changes in respiratory tract mucosa.
 Both patients were girls, 13 and 14 years of age, respectively.
 One patient had otitis media and a nodular scleritis.
 Laboratory test results demonstrated an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and microscopic hematuria.
 A biopsy of the sinus confirmed the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.
 The second patient had fever, arthralgias, a nonproductive cough, and bilateral scleritis.
 Laboratory test results demonstrated an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate, positive test results for rheumatoid factor, and bilateral pulmonary nodules on chest x-ray.
 Open-lung biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis.
 Both patients responded well to treatment with a combination of prednisone and cyclophosphamide.
