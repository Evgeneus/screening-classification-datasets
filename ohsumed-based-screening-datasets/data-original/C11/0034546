An improved palpebral spring for the management of paralytic lagophthalmos.
 Facial nerve paralysis with orbicularis muscle palsy can result in serious corneal complications, such as exposure, ulceration, and perforation.
 Eyelid springs have been used for patients with orbicularis muscle palsy to provide corneal protection while maintaining vision by restoring some kinetic eyelid function.
 The authors report on 24 patients with facial nerve paralysis who underwent implantation of an eyelid spring over a period of 8 years.
 The most common cause of orbicularis muscle paralysis was acoustic neuroma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma.
 Eighty-three percent of the cases successfully regained and maintained their eyelid function during the follow-up period, averaging 3.0 years.
 We have modified the spring to allow permanent attachment to the orbital rim by wiring.
 This modification of the surgical technique has minimized the most common postoperative complication: loosening of the spring from its periosteal attachment with subsequent loss of function and extrusion.
 In addition, transcutaneous adjustments of the spring now can be made without an incision using clasp-adjusting dental pliers.
 In selected patients, the placement of an eyelid spring prevents the corneal complications associated with paralytic lagophthalmos while maintaining visual function.
