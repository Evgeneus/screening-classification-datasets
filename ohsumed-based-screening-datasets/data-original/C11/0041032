Rhinocerebral mucormycosis: use of liposomal amphotericin B.
 Rhinocerebral mucormycosis is a rare but often fatal condition characterized by an aggressive necrotizing infection spreading from the nose to the paranasal sinuses, orbit and hence to the central nervous system.
 A case is reported in which a diabetic male with advanced mucormycosis was successfully treated by a combination of surgery, supportive therapy and liposomal amphotericin B.
 Liposomal delivery allows the drug to be both less toxic and more effective, and this is the first reported case of its use in rhinocerebral mucormycosis.
