Further evaluation of collagen shields as a delivery system for 5-fluorouracil: histopathological observations.
 Collagen shields are a potential delivery system for antifibroblast drugs such as 5-fluorouracil after filtration surgery.
 To determine whether collagen shields produce histologic evidence of inflammation when implanted subconjunctivally, shields were implanted into four rabbit eyes and six guinea pig eyes and retained for 7 or 14 days.
 Two rabbit eyes and two guinea pig eyes served as controls.
 Seven days after implantation in the rabbit eyes foreign-body giant cells were present at the surface of the shield, and early deposition of connective tissue was evident around the shield.
 The inflammatory response at 14 days was similar but more intense.
 In the guinea pig eyes the collagen shields induced substantially less inflammation, and there was marked shield degradation at 14 days.
 The results suggest that the inflammatory response in rabbits may be species specific and that collagen shields may be of value as a drug-delivery system for antifibroblast drugs in other species.
