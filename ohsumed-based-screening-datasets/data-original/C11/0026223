Disposable contact lenses.
 Disposable soft contact lenses are an alternative to conventional extended-wear lenses and provide an acceptable margin of safety and convenience for the wearer.
 The lenses are worn for one to two weeks and then discarded.
 Buildup of tear film deposits is minimized, and the need for cleaning and disinfecting solutions is eliminated.
 The long-term safety of disposable contact lenses is unknown.
