MK-507 versus sezolamide. Comparative efficacy of two topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.
 Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors MK-507 and sezolamide hydrochloride (previously known as MK-417) were compared in a double-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled study in 82 patients with bilateral primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.
 MK-507 was given every 8 or 12 hours, sezolamide every 8 hours, or placebo every 8 or 12 hours for 4 days.
 Both drugs lowered intraocular pressure (IOP) substantially.
 MK-507 was somewhat more active than sezolamide, with a peak mean IOP reduction of 26.2% for MK-507 versus 22.5% for sezolamide, although the difference between the treatments was not statistically significant.
 These drugs may have potential in the treatment of glaucoma.
