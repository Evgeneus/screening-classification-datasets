Acute multifocal inner retinitis.
 Two patients developed acute changes in vision two to four weeks after a febrile illness.
 On ophthalmic examination, each patient had bilateral vitreitis without anterior segment inflammation and multiple, bilateral, round, yellow-white inner retinal lesions that were located in the posterior pole and midperiphery.
 Laboratory tests did not contribute to a diagnosis.
 Symptomatic visual loss was caused by neuroretinitis and serous retinal detachment in one patient and by an occluded branch retinal artery in the other.
 The multifocal retinal lesions resolved gradually without treatment over several months with minimal or no residual retinal changes.
 Acute multifocal inner retinal lesions may be associated with a preceding nonspecific viral illness and may cause a sudden change in vision if associated with neuroretinitis, serous retinal detachment, or retinal vessel occlusion.
 We have termed this constellation of ophthalmic findings acute multifocal inner retinitis.
