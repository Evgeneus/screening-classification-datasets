Errors in IOL power calculations for axial high myopia.
 We studied 115 eyes with axial lengths of 27 mm or more after implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens in order to determine discrepancies between the predicted refractions and the actual postoperative refractions.
 We then reviewed the three major variables used to predict refractions in these eyes--corneal curvature, anterior chamber depth, and axial length measurements--in an attempt to determine whether any of these variables were correlated with the discrepancies.
 We found that the main reason for postoperative refractive error was inaccurate measurements of preoperative axial length.
