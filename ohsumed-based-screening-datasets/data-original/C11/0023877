Combined computed tomography and dacryocystography for complex lacrimal problems.
 Two imaging modalities, computed tomography (CT) and dacryocystography (DCG), were combined to demonstrate the relationships between the lacrimal system and the surrounding soft-tissue structures.
 In selected cases, such as those involving severe facial trauma, midfacial tumours, significant sinus disease, or previous lacrimal, nasal or sinus surgery, this imaging technique may be useful in better evaluating the anatomy of the lacrimal system and planning a surgical approach.
