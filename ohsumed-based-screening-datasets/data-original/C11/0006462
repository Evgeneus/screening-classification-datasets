Traumatic enucleation for posterior uveal melanoma.
 Two features of eyes enucleated for posterior uveal melanoma that may serve as indicators for traumatic enucleation and relate to dissemination of tumor cells at the time of enucleation are myelin artifact of the optic nerve head and acute hemorrhage within the tumor.
 Myelin artifact occurs when crushed optic nerve tissue is squeezed into the eye at the time of enucleation.
 Intralesional hemorrhage may occur during surgery and may be correlated with fluctuations in intraocular pressure.
 We reviewed 519 cases of posterior uveal melanoma treated by enucleation between 1950 and 1970.
 Without knowledge of the follow-up data, we examined histologic sections for myelin artifact, intralesional hemorrhage, subretinal hemorrhage, Callender cell type, size of tumor, necrosis, and scleral or orbital invasion.
 Neither myelin artifact nor intralesional hemorrhage were independent prognostic risk factors.
 These findings do not support or refute the hypothesis that excessive trauma during enucleation results in a worse prognosis.
