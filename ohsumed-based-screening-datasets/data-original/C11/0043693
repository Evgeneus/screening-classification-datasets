Molteno implantation for glaucoma in young patients.
 Seventy patients younger than 21 years of age underwent Molteno implantation for nonneovascular glaucoma.
 Fifty-three (76%) patients had failed angle and/or conventional filtering surgery.
 Final intraocular pressure less than 22 mmHg (but over 5 mmHg) was achieved in 40 (62%) of the 65 patients with at least 6-month follow-up (range, 6 to 59 months; mean +/- standard deviation, 22.7 +/- 14.1 months); however, only 22 (34%) were controlled after the initial Molteno implantation procedure, and 54 (83%) patients underwent further glaucoma and/or nonglaucoma surgical procedures.
 The visual acuities remained within one line of their preoperative levels or improved in 25 (68%) of the 37 patients on whom Snellen acuities were available.
 The most frequent complications included: tube-cornea touch (20%, transient in 3%), corneal edema (17%), retinal detachment (16%), tube block (10%), cataract (9%), chronic hypotony or phthisis (9%), pupillary or cyclitic membrane (9%), hyphema (7%), flat anterior chamber (6%), and large postoperative choroidal effusion (6%).
 Despite the high rates of subsequent surgical interventions and complications, Molteno implantation has been a useful approach for achieving intraocular pressure reduction in young patients with glucoma.
