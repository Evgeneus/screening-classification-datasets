Characterization of a new, potent, immunopathogenic epitope in S-antigen that elicits T cells expressing V beta 8 and V alpha 2-like genes.
 Experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) is a predominantly T cell-mediated autoimmune disease induced in susceptible animals by active immunization with human or bovine retinal S-Ag or by passive transfer of activated S-Ag or peptide-specific CD4+ T cells.
 During the course of studies aimed at the identification of T cell and B cell recognition sites in bovine and human S-Ag, a new potent uveitogenic region, located near the carboxy terminus of the molecule, was identified and characterized.
 Analysis of several synthetic peptides from this region showed that a 14 amino acid residue peptide, BSAg339-352, was highly uveitogenic when injected with adjuvants into Lewis rats.
 A uveitogenic T cell line, R737, was raised by in vitro selection of lymphocytes from animals immunized with peptide BSAg333-352.
 Northern blot analysis of mRNA from the R737 T cell line was positive for the rat homologs of murine V beta 8 and V alpha 2 T cell receptor gene probes.
 Whereas peptide BSAg339-352 defined the pathogenic site, nonpathogenic, proliferative sites were found in close physical association.
 This region is immediately adjacent to previously characterized pathogenic and proliferative sites contained in residues BSAg352-364.
 These results, as well as our previous observations, show S-Ag to be a complex molecule with several highly conserved amino acid sequences that can elicit pathogenic T cells with restricted T cell receptor V gene usage capable of active and passive elicitation of experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis.
