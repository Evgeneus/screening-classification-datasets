Surgical removal of massive subretinal hemorrhage associated with age-related macular degeneration.
 The authors report on 11 patients with age-related macular degeneration associated with massive subretinal hemorrhage, who were treated with surgical removal of the hemorrhage and associated fibrosis.
 Preoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/400 to hand motions.
 Postoperative visual acuity ranged from 20/200 to light perception with a minimum of 3 months of follow-up.
 Complications included partial or total retinal detachment in four patients (36%) and cataract in four patients (36%).
 Four of 11 patients showed some improvement in vision (36%).
 All four of these patients had surgery within 1 week of the onset of severe visual loss.
 Although surgical removal of large subretinal hemorrhages is technically feasible, visual recovery is limited, even in uncomplicated cases, by macular degenerative changes.
