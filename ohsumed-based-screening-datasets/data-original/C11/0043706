Vitrectomy for premacular fibroplasia. Prognostic factors, long-term follow-up, and time course of visual improvement.
 Two hundred seventy eyes with premacular fibroplasia consecutively treated by pars plana vitrectomy and membrane peeling were reviewed.
 This study is among the largest series with long-term follow-up reported to date.
 Visual improvement of two or more lines was achieved in 43% of eyes at 6 to 12 months, in 54% at 1 to 2 years, in 60% at 2 to 3 years, and in 58% at 3 to 5 years.
 Overall, complications occurred in 34 eyes (13%).
 Cataract progression after vitrectomy was noted in 106 (57%) of phakic eyes at 3 to 5 years, and 43 of these eyes underwent subsequent cataract extraction.
 Mean time to best visual acuity after vitrectomy was slightly less than 1 year for all eyes unless they had cataract worsening with subsequent cataract extraction (1.9 years).
 Significant factors affecting visual outcome were: preoperative lens status, visual acuity before vitrectomy, duration of preoperative symptoms of distortion and/or blurred vision, and the occurrence of intraoperative complications.
