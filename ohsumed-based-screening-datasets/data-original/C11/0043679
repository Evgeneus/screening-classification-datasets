Extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber lens implantation in controlled open-angle glaucoma.
 A consecutive series of 103 eyes, 37 with controlled simple glaucoma (SG) and 66 with capsular glaucoma (CG), underwent extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and posterior chamber lens (PC-IOL) implantation.
 Two to 6 weeks after surgery, 48% of the SG eyes and 62% of the CG eyes had visual acuities better than 0.4, as compared with 8% and 3%, respectively, preoperatively.
 The corresponding figures after 12 to 43 months in the SG eyes were 62%, and after 14 to 38 months in the CG eyes, 55%.
 A slight increase of mean intraocular pressure (IOP), from 19.0 +/- 4.8 mm Hg to 25.3 +/- 13.3 mm Hg in the SG eyes, and from 19.0 +/- 3.9 mm Hg to 24.5 +/- 9.6 mm Hg in the CG eyes occurred 1 to 2 weeks after surgery; at 2 to 6 weeks the mean IOPs had returned to preoperative levels: 18.1 +/- 6.4 mm Hg in the SG eyes and 18.4 +/- 5.9 mm Hg in the CG eyes.
 After a mean of 26.5 months (range, 12 to 43 months), IOP had decreased to 17.3 +/- 2.9 mm Hg in the SG eyes; and after 24.2 months (range, 14 to 38 months) to 17.6 +/- 5.7 mm Hg in the CG eyes.
 The need for glaucoma medication was diminished at 2 to 6 weeks after surgery: IOP was controlled (less than 21 mm Hg) without glaucoma medication in 43% of the SG, and in 50% of the CG eyes (preoperatively, all of the SG and 89% of the CG eyes required medication).
