Increased preferential optic disc asymmetry in ocular hypertensive patients compared with control subjects.
 The authors determined asymmetrical differences in optic disc cupping and pallor between the right and left eyes of 57 control subjects and 75 patients with ocular hypertension.
 Photogrammetry was used to measure the optic disc cup, and computerized image analysis was used to measure the optic disc pallor for the total disc and its quadrants.
 Generally, for control and ocular hypertensive eyes, the median values of cupping and pallor were significantly larger in the left eye than in the right, except for depth in the inferior quadrant (right eye minus left eye = 9.3%, P = 0.000) and pallor in the nasal quadrant (right eye minus left eye = 21.3%, P = 0.01), which were preferentially larger in the right eye than in the left in ocular hypertensive eyes.
 Ocular hypertensive eyes also showed a greater difference between the right and left eyes compared with control eyes for inferior depth (P = 0.06) and nasal pallor (P = 0.02).
 Detection of optic disc differences as a sign of ocular hypertension between the right eye and the left should evaluate the inferior and nasal quadrants of the disc.
