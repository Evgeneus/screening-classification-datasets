Resolution of microsporidial epithelial keratopathy in a patient with AIDS.
 A patient with a positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) titer and cryptococcal meningitis suffered bilateral epithelial keratopathy caused by Encephalitozoon, which did not respond to sulfas, erythromycin, bacitracin, tobramycin, neomycin, polymyxin B, or fluconazole.
 Eventual administration of itraconazole for the meningitis apparently produced resolution of the long-lasting (2-month) ocular infection.
 This new oral triazole antifungal may be valuable against the increasingly prevalent microsporidial infections in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
 Debulking of the infection by corneal scraping may have contributed to the authors' success.
