Inactive subretinal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration.
 Inactive subretinal new vessels (SRNVs), showing minimal leakage by fluorescein angiography and little progression, were observed in 15 eyes of 12 patients with age-related macular degeneration.
 In 8 (57%) of 14 eyes followed for longer than 6 months, the new vessels involuted and produced circumscribed areas of retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris atrophy; 6 (43%) showed a further decrease in the fluorescein leakage during the follow-up period (average, 30.1 months).
 None of the new vessels organized into an exudative fibrovascular scar.
 Visual acuity was improved or unchanged during the entire follow-up period in 12 (86%) eyes and deteriorated in 2 (14%).
 Nine patients (75%) were 80 years of age or older; three (25%) were between 65 and 70 years of age.
 These observations suggested that SRNV showing minimal fluorescein leakage, particularly when it occurs in patients older than 80 years, do not require photocoagulation because they are usually self-limited.
