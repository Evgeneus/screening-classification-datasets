The c-fms gene complements the mitogenic defect in mast cells derived from mutant W mice but not mi (microphthalmia) mice.
 Mutations at three loci in the mouse--W, Steel Sl), and microphthalmia (mi)--can lead to a deficiency in melanocytes and mast cells.
 As well, W and Sl mutants can be anemic and sterile, whereas mi mice are osteopetrotic due to a monocyte/macrophage defect.
 Recent data have shown that the c-kit receptor tyrosine kinase is the gene product of the W locus, whereas Sl encodes the ligand for this growth factor receptor.
 We show here that ectopic expression of c-fms, a gene that encodes a macrophage growth factor receptor that is closely related to the c-kit receptor, complements mutations at the W locus in an in vitro mast cell/fibroblast coculture system but is unable to reverse the inability of mi/mi mast cells to survive under these conditions.
 Furthermore, mast cells expressing the c-fms receptor survive on a monolayer of fibroblasts homozygous for the Sl mutation.
 These results suggest that ligand binding to the c-kit or c-fms receptor activates identical or overlapping signal transduction pathways.
 Furthermore, they suggest that mi encodes a protein necessary for transducing signals mediated by way of either the c-kit or c-fms receptor.
