Fuchs's heterochromic cyclitis in congenital ocular toxoplasmosis.
 We report a follow-up after 25 years of a patient with a congenital bilateral ocular toxoplasmosis who developed Fuchs's heterochromic cyclitis in her left eye.
 Whether Toxoplasma gondii can cause the development of Fuchs's heterochromic cyclitis, as our case suggests, or whether the iridocyclitis is a secondary ocular response to other agents, is not yet clear.
