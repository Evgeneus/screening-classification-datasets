Identification and treatment of retinopathy of prematurity: an update and review.
 The risk of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is higher in infants with a birth weight less than 1501 g (3 lb 5 oz).
 Identification programs coupled with refined treatment procedures can reduce visual impairment in infants with ROP.
 Physicians providing in-hospital care to these infants should ensure that ophthalmologic referral has been established before hospital discharge.
 Physicians examining these infants for their 6-week checkups are also vital safeguards in the ROP screening and referral process.
