Simplified limbal incision for extraocular rectus muscle surgery.
 We describe a limbal incision for extraocular muscle surgery which involves only one incision to the conjunctival-Tenon's layer instead of the three separate incisions required in the standard limbal approach.
 Based on the 316 extraocular muscle operations in which we have used this one-snip procedure, we conclude that it is simpler and faster than the standard limbal incision, and that it provides good surgical exposure and probably less tissue damage.
