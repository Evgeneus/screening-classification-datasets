Correlations of acoustic tissue typing of malignant melanoma and histopathologic features as a predictor of death.
 Forty-six eyes with uveal melanoma were scanned with a computerized diagnostic ultrasound system before enucleation, and light microscope sections were obtained.
 Tumors were characterized by ultrasonically measured dimensions and power spectrum analysis, which provided information not available in conventional A- or B-scan ultrasonography.
 Histopathologic features, including cell clustering pattern, cell type, pigmentation, vascularity, and necrosis, were quantified.
 Statistically significant correlations were found between parameters derived from the power spectrum and histologic characteristics.
 Patients were followed up for up to ten years with 14 deaths occurring because of metastases.
 Using a Cox relative risk model with histopathologic data, a risk model comprising pigmentation and cell type (P less than .0001) was obtained.
 Using ultrasonic characteristics, a model comprising tumor volume and scatterer concentration (P = .0062) was obtained.
 The results suggest that ultrasonic tissue characterization and three-dimensional biometry may provide improved in vivo prognostic indicators for uveal melanoma.
