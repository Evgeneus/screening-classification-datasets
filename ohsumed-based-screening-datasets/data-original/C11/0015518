Nasolacrimal obstruction after inferior meatus nasal antrostomy.
 Transient epiphora following rhinoplasty or intranasal procedures is a common occurrence.
 Permanent nasolacrimal duct obstruction, however, is rare.
 This article documents four cases of nasolacrimal duct obstruction following intranasal antrostomy.
 Three patients were cured by dacryocystorhinostomy and a fourth refused surgery.
 The anatomy of the nasolacrimal duct in the inferior meatus has considerable variation.
 Although the duct typically opens in the inferior meatus immediately under the insertion of the inferior turbinate, the orifice can be a single hole, a slit, multiple holes, or a trough, and can be located anywhere from 30 to 40 mm dorsal to the anterior nares.
 We review the embryology and anatomy of the nasolacrimal orifice in the nose and make recommendations for safe surgery in the inferior meatus.
