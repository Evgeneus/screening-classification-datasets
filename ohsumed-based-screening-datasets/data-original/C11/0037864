Current concepts in ocular allergy.
 Ocular allergy is commonly encountered by the allergist, general physician, and ophthalmologist.
 Diagnosis can usually be made by history, especially a history of itching and an allergic background.
 The diagnosis can be confirmed by skin testing, in vitro testing, and conjunctival scrapings to look for eosinophils.
 Once the diagnosis is made, a decision can be reached as to whether treatment is necessary.
 Often, supportive treatment, or removal of the allergen is preferred.
 When pharmacologic treatment is necessary, it is advisable to choose a benign form of therapy such as topical vasoconstrictor-antihistamine eyedrops or cromolyn sodium.
 Topical steroids are rarely necessary and should be used with great caution since they can induce serious sight threatening complications.
 If topical steroids are required, the patient should be monitored by an ophthalmologist.
