Chronic reversal of hemifield loss after intraocular pressure lowering in advanced glaucoma.
 Lowering intraocular pressure in two cases of severe glaucoma was associated with a chronic reversal of hemifield loss, as documented by automated threshold perimetry.
 In the first case, a small central 10 degrees island of vision expanded to 40 degrees in both hemifields eight months after intraocular pressure lowering by filtration surgery.
 The mean deviation of the central 30 degrees field improved by more than 14dB or 1.4 log units.
 To our knowledge, this case represents the greatest degree of reversal of chronic visual field loss reported in the literature.
 In the second case, a small central 10 degrees island of vision slowly expanded to 40 degrees in the inferior hemifield over a three-year period.
