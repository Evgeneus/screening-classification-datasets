Comparison of the effects of two viscoelastic agents, Healon and Viscoat, on postoperative intraocular pressure after penetrating keratoplasty 
 Sixty-two patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty were randomized to receive Healon (1% sodium hyaluronate) or Viscoat (3% sodium hyaluronate and 4% chondroitin sulfate) as a means of maintaining the anterior chamber during surgery.
 Neither viscoelastic agent was irrigated from the eye at the end of the procedure.
 Intraocular pressures (IOPs) were measured at 4, 10, 24, and 72 hours postoperatively.
 For the Healon group, IOPs were 16.52, 23.50, 28.31, 23.27, and 16.03 mm Hg at baseline and at the four follow-up periods, respectively.
 For the Viscoat group, they were 19.10, 28.33, 23.48, 18.62, and 16.17 mm Hg at those points, respectively.
 IOPs were significantly elevated over baseline in the Healon group at 4, 10, and 24 hours, and in the Viscoat group at 4 and 10 hours.
 There were no statistically significant differences between the Healon and Viscoat groups at 4, 10, and 72 hours.
 At 24 hours, the Healon group had a mean pressure rise over baseline of 6.5 mm Hg, while the Viscoat group had returned to baseline levels (P = .02).
 We conclude that both Healon and Viscoat raise postoperative IOPs, but that Healon appears to elevate IOPs for a longer period after surgery than Viscoat.
