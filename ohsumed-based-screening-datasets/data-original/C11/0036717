Pseudophakic malignant glaucoma in a child.
 We report a pseudophakic malignant glaucoma attack in the early postoperative period in the normal eye of an 8-year-old child who had undergone extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber (modified Sinskey type) intraocular lens implantation for congenital zonular cataract.
 Intensive antiglaucoma medical therapy did not resolve the glaucoma, but vitreous aspiration and anterior chamber reformation proved successful.
