Aminocaproic acid prophylaxis in traumatic hyphema.
 Oral aminocaproic acid has been shown to be effective in clot stabilization and in the reduction of secondary bleeding rates in cases of traumatic hyphema.
 In a retrospective study of 105 patients treated during a 1-year period, we found the incidence of rebleeding in patients with traumatic hyphema who received aminocaproic acid prophylaxis was 2%; the incidence in those who did not was 25%.
