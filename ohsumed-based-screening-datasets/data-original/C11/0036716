A prospective evaluation of anterior retinal cryoablation in neovascular glaucoma.
 We report a prospective evaluation of the effect of anterior retinal cryopexy on 62 eyes with neovascular glaucoma.
 Pain was relieved and anterior chamber inflammatory reaction regressed dramatically in 95%.
 Iris neovascularization was reduced or regressed in 93.5%.
 Control of intraocular pressure was clinically significant in 82.3% 1 year after the procedure, especially in patients with pretreatment pressures less than 40 mm Hg on maximal medical therapy.
 Anterior retinal cryopexy is recommended in eyes with media opacities and as a preliminary procedure for filtering surgery in eyes with neovascular glaucoma.
