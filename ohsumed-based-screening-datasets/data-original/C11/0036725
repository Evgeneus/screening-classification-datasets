Response of argon laser trabeculoplasty with varying anterior chamber anatomy.
 We studied one randomly selected eye of 50 consecutive primary open-angle glaucoma patients treated with argon laser trabeculoplasty to assess response differences as functions of anterior chamber anatomy and refraction.
 We found no significant differences related to these variables, and thus conclude that argon laser trabeculoplasty may be performed successfully in patients with crowded angles as long as the trabecular meshwork can be visualized.
