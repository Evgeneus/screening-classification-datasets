Vitrectomy, argon laser, and gas tamponade for serous retinal detachment associated with an optic disc pit: a case report.
 We report the case of a 9-year-old boy with a right optic disc pit and associated serous retinal detachment of the macula.
 This was treated by vitrectomy, endolaser, and gas tamponade as a primary procedure, which resulted in complete resolution.
 We review the literature and conclude that further reports of the management of this uncommon condition are required so that firmer guidelines on treatment can be established.
