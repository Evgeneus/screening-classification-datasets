Isolating the effects of primary open-angle glaucoma on the contrast sensitivity function.
 We evaluated spatial contrast sensitivity functions in age-matched and lens density-matched healthy eyes, eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma, and eyes with ocular hypertension.
 We also controlled for refraction, visual acuity, pupil size, and previous ocular history.
 We found an overall reduction in contrast sensitivity for the glaucomatous eyes with a significant difference at 12 cycles per degree (P less than .012).
 Eyes with ocular hypertension were not significantly different from normal eyes.
 Significant differences were noted at several spatial frequencies with less careful controls for age and lens effects.
 We concluded that spatial contrast sensitivity may be a useful adjunctive diagnostic test for glaucoma, but interpreting the results without other clinical data may lead to errors in diagnosis.
