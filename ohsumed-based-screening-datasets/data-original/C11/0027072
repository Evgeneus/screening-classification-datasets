5-Fluorouracil after trabeculectomy and the iridocorneal endothelial syndrome.
 Nine patients (nine eyes) with iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome underwent trabeculectomy and received postoperative subconjunctival injections of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to enhance bleb formation (total 5-FU dose, 30-105 mg; mean, 53.8 mg).
 Eight eyes had undergone prior unsuccessful trabeculectomy.
 Four eyes had intraocular pressure (IOP) less than or equal to 21 mmHg on zero to two glaucoma medications after 6 to 54 months of follow-up (mean, 25.3 months).
 Five eyes required repeat surgery within 2 to 13 months and were considered failures.
 All five eyes that failed received a Molteno drainage implant.
 Progressive endothelial proliferation may explain late onset bleb failure and the relative ineffectiveness of 5-FU in this condition.
