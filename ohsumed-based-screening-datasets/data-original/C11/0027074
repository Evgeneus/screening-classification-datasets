Graft survival in four common groups of patients undergoing penetrating keratoplasty.
 Graft survival rates and causes of graft failure were evaluated for 1046 consecutive keratoplasties in four groups: keratoconus, Fuchs' dystrophy, pseudophakic bullous keratopathy with retained intraocular lenses (IOLs), and pseudophakic/aphakic bullous keratopathy with secondary lens implants.
 Patient follow-up averaged 23 months (range, 1-84 months).
 There was a significant difference in graft survival among the four groups, P less than 0.0001.
 The keratoconus and Fuchs' groups had the highest survival rates and pseudophakic bullous keratopathy with retained IOLs the lowest rate.
 Problems with the external surface of the graft caused the largest number of graft failures.
 Grafts for pseudophakic bullous keratopathy with retained posterior chamber lenses had a significantly higher failure rate from rejection and endothelial decompensation, 5.1%, compared with less than 1.0% in keratoconus, Fuchs' dystrophy, or bullous keratopathy with secondary implants (P less than 0.0005).
