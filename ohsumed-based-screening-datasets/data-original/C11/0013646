Glaucoma triple procedures: efficacy of intraocular pressure control and visual outcome.
 Sixty-three glaucoma triple surgeries [combined trabeculectomy, extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE), and posterior-chamber intraocular lens (PC-IOL) implantation] were reviewed.
 Intraocular pressure (IOP) was controlled satisfactorily in all cases; 25% required additional glaucoma therapy but fewer glaucoma medications.
 Eighty-six percent achieved 6/12 or better visual acuity.
 Postoperative IOP and visual acuity results were similar to those achieved by trabeculectomy or ECCE/PC-IOL, respectively.
 Cumulative years of preoperative glaucoma therapy had an adverse effect on postoperative IOP control.
