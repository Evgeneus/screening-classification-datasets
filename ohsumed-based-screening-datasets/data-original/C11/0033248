Four-snip procedure for involutional lower lid entropion: modification of Quickert and Jones procedures.
 Involutional lower lid entropion results from a faulty lower lid retractor complex, lid laxity and overriding of preseptal orbicularis fibres on the tarsal and pretarsal fibres.
 The author describes the anatomy of the lower lid and presents a four-snip procedure for correcting this condition in which the Quickert and Jones techniques are combined.
