Corneal choristoma with microphthalmos.
 We report two rare cases of corneal choristoma with microphthalmos.
 In both cases, the whole thickness of the cornea, as well as the anterior chamber and iris, was replaced by cutaneous and subcutaneous tissue.
 In case 1, diagnosed as dermoid choristoma, the cutaneous tissue contained skin appendages and subcutaneous fibrofatty tissue extended into the vitreous cavity.
 The fibrous mass in the cavity contained fragments of retina.
 In case 2, diagnosed as a dermislike choristoma, the cutaneous tissue lacked skin appendages.
 These choristomatous cutaneous tissues hindered normal growth of ocular structures, resulting in microphthalmos.
 Use of computed tomography was helpful in evaluating the extent of ocular tissue involvement and accompanying intraocular malformations.
