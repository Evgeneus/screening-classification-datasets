Intraepithelial sebaceous epithelioma of lids, conjunctiva, and cornea treated with minimal orbital exenteration.
 "Minimal" orbital exenteration, obtained by excision of a lid tumor (that had recurred after local incision), removal of the conjunctival sac, enucleation, and tenonectomy were used to treat intraepithelial sebaceous epithelioma with pagetoid spread to conjunctiva and cornea in an 80-year-old man.
