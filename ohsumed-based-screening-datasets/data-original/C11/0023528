Miotics and retinal detachment: upgrading the community standard.
 The majority of ophthalmologists who responded to a questionnaire regarding the relationship between miotics and retinal detachment felt that such a relationship does exist, and that myopia and aphakia/pseudophakia predispose to the formation of new retinal breaks or to retinal detachment from pre-existing breaks with miotics.
 Horseshoe breaks and dialyses are pre-existing lesions that should be treated prophylactically prior to miotic therapy.
 Patients with no predisposing pathology or whose eyes have lattice degeneration or operculated breaks should be warned of possible retinal detachment prior to starting miotics.
 Not performing a peripheral retina examination prior to prescribing a miotic is acceptable, but not optimal, medical practice.
 Examining the peripheral retina or obtaining a retina consultation prior to prescribing a miotic may be beneficial to the patient and could be invaluable in the defense of litigation.
