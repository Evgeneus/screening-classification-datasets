Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation: outcome of treatment for uncontrolled glaucoma.
 We reviewed the records of 35 patients (35 eyes) treated with Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation for uncontrolled glaucoma and followed for 6 to 36 months or until treatment was declared a failure (loss of light perception, or intraocular pressure (IOP) greater than 21 mm Hg).
 The mean pretreatment intraocular pressure was 37.9 mm Hg (range, 20 to 61 mm Hg).
 The total energy in the initial treatment session ranged from 50.4 to 372.4 J (191.7 +/- 66.3 J).
 After the treatment, the mean IOP was 21.2 mm Hg (range, 0 to 53 mm Hg).
 The Kaplan Meier survival analysis demonstrated that failures occurred throughout the follow-up period and that the majority of patients required further intervention or lost all vision if followed long enough.
 Visual outcome was not correlated with energy used.
 Eleven eyes (31%) lost two or more lines of acuity or lost all light perception.
 These findings suggest that Nd:YAG cyclophotocoagulation may control IOP but cannot always save vision.
