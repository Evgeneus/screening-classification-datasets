Results of treatment of persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous.
 The records of 48 patients with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (PHPV) were reviewed.
 Approximately 17% had vision of 20/100 or better after surgery, contact lens fitting, and amblyopia therapy.
 Only eyes with a purely anterior presentation had successful visual outcomes.
 Lensectomy alone prevented glaucoma, but a membranectomy as well was required to ensure a successful visual result.
 Eyes with a posterior PHPV had poor visual results because of posterior pole abnormalities.
 I recommend that an attempt be made to visually salvage eyes with an anterior presentation.
 Eyes with a posterior or a combination anterior-posterior PHPV can be successfully treated for glaucoma, but the visual results will be poor.
