Visual and refractive results of multifocal intraocular lenses.
 One hundred forty-nine selected patients with bilateral multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) were evaluated and compared retrospectively with 131 patients with bilateral monofocal IOLs.
 Seventy-eight percent of multifocal cases and 74.8% of monofocal cases had uncorrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better.
 Fifty-four percent of multifocal cases had near uncorrected visions of J1 to J3.
 Eighteen percent had best-corrected near vision of J4 or worse.
 Sixty-three percent of multifocal cases versus 4% of monofocal cases needed no spectacle correction.
 Multifocal cases reported significantly more visual side effects (flare, glare, and halos).
 The 10% of cases with poor satisfaction (rating vision as fair-to-poor) had significantly (P = 0.03) more postoperative astigmatism (1.1 prism diopters [D] versus 0.74 D) compared with satisfied (good-to-excellent) cases.
 Patients who were dissatisfied reported more need for corrective lenses but not more side effects.
 A greater decrease in contrast sensitivity at low contrast levels was detected among multifocal cases.
 Both groups had similar contrast sensitivity at 96% and 50% contrast, but at 11% contrast, multifocal cases averaged a loss of 3.45 Snellen lines (to 20/48.2) compared with 2.65 lines (to 20/36) for monofocal cases.
