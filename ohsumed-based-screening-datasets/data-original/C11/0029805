Extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber lens implantation in Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis.
 Twenty-two patients with Fuch's heterochromic cyclitis had a posterior chamber intraocular lens implanted after extracapsular cataract extraction.
 After a mean follow-up period of 2.5 years (range, 6 to 70 months) half the patients had a visual acuity of 1.0 or more.
 The results compare favourably with those in the general population.
