Medical canthal resection: an effective long-term cure for medial ectropion.
 The results of 37 medial canthal resection procedures performed for the correction of severe paralytic or involutional medial ectropion are presented with an average follow-up of 5.4 years.
 Epiphora was improved in 33 out of the 37 cases and all but one patient had an anatomically improved lid-globe apposition, medial canthal angle, and posterofixation of the medial canthus.
 These results confirmed the long-term value of the operation.
