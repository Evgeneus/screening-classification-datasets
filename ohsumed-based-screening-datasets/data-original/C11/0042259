Infectious crystalline keratopathy caused by Candida albicans.
 Two patients developed corneal opacities resembling infectious crystalline keratopathy.
 Predisposing factors included a recent corneal transplant with suture replacement in one patient and postradiation keratoconjunctivitis with disposable therapeutic contact-lens wear in the other patient.
 Both patients were using a topically applied corticosteroid and an aminoglycoside antimicrobial.
 Smears of corneal scrapings showed numerous yeasts without inflammatory cells.
 Culturing yielded Candida albicans and Staphylococcus haemolyticus in the first case and C.
 albicans and S.
 epidermidis in the second case.
 Combined antifungal and antimicrobial therapy, with initial withdrawal of corticosteroid use, was effective.
 The microbial cause of pauci-inflammatory keratitis includes not only viridans streptococci and other bacteria but fungi as well.
