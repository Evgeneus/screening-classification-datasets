Pigmented pupillary pseudomembranes as a complication of argon laser iridotomy.
 Two cases are reported in which pupillary pigment occlusion occurred after argon laser iridotomy, reducing visual acuity and preventing fundus visualization.
 Laser-induced inflammation and subsequent long-term miotic therapy are probably responsible for this complication.
 Periodic pupillary dilatation is recommended in eyes that require miotics to control their intraocular pressure after laser iridotomy.
