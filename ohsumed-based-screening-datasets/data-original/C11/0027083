Supraciliary hemangiopericytoma.
 A 10-year-old black girl complaining of pain and decreased vision in the left eye was found to have a smoothly elevated ciliochoroidal mass involving the superonasal quadrant of the left eye.
 The mass appeared circumscribed and uniformly dense by computed tomography.
 The tumor was hyperintense to vitreous and cerebral white matter on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging but was hypointense to vitreous and hyperintense to white matter on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging.
 Results of gross examination of the enucleated eye showed a sharply circumscribed, tan, intraocular mass arising equatorially.
 Results of histopathologic examination showed a well-vascularized spindle cell proliferation with a sinusoidal pattern characteristic of hemangiopericytoma.
 This is the third reported case of intraocular hemangiopericytoma and the first in a pediatric patient.
