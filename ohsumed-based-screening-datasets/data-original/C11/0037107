Bilateral retinal artery occlusion due to mitral valve prolapse.
 We report a case of bilateral retinal artery occlusion due to mitral valve prolapse.
 Most patients with retinal ischaemia in whom it is found have not been previously known to have it.
 Since it is a common condition it would seem essential that it be included in the differential diagnosis of amaurosis fugax and retinal artery occlusion if future ischaemic events are to be prevented.
 All patients with retinal ischaemia should have a full cardiovascular examination supplemented by echocardiography.
