Juvenile xanthogranuloma of the corneoscleral limbus.
 Juvenile xanthogranuloma presenting as an isolated corneoscleral lesion is rare.
 We report such a case in a 5-year-old boy who required lamellar sclerokeratectomy to the level of Descemet's membrane.
 Ten months after treatment by total excision and lamellar corneoscleral grafting with donor tissue there was no evidence of recurrence.
 We discuss the clinical and histologic features of this disorder, the differential diagnosis and treatment options.
