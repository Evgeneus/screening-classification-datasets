Retinal detachments in patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis.
 Retinal detachments are a recognized complication of cytomegalovirus retinitis.
 In a series of 145 patients with cytomegalovirus retinitis, 38 (26%) developed retinal detachments.
 The cumulative probability of a retinal detachment 1 year after the diagnosis of cytomegalovirus retinitis was 50%.
 Detachments were associated with increased size of the cytomegalovirus lesion and with lesions extending anteriorly up to the ora serrata.
 Treatment with an anticytomegalovirus drug appeared to delay the time to detachment.
 Median survival time after the diagnosis of retinal detachment was 9 months.
 In our study, vitrectomy with silicone oil as the initial surgical procedure was the most effective approach.
 Successful anatomic reattachment of the retina was achieved in 70% of patients undergoing this procedure.
 Despite the success of surgery, the visual outcome was disappointing, with only 20% of eyes achieving a final visual acuity of 5/200 or better.
