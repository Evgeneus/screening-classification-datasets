The effect of dexamethasone on the inhibition of pseudophakic bacterial endophthalmitis.
 We investigated the effect of dexamethasone on gentamicin prophylaxis of pseudophakic bacterial endophthalmitis in a rabbit model.
 In 20 eyes treated with gentamicin and either dexamethasone or dexamethasone vehicle, there were no cases of either clinical or culture-positive endophthalmitis.
