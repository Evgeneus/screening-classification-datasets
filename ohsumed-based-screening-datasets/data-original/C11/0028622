Tears of the retinal pigment epithelium: occurrence in association with choroidal effusion.
 Two patients developed large tears of the retinal pigment epithelium associated with choroidal effusion.
 One tear occurred after combined cataract/filtration surgery complicated by postoperative choroidal detachment; the second developed in a patient with idiopathic uveal effusion syndrome.
 Weakness of the junctions of the pigment epithelial cells secondary to the accumulation of fluid in the subretinal or suprachoroidal space may result in tearing of the retinal pigment epithelium as it is stretched.
