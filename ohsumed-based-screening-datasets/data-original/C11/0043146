Incontinentia pigmenti (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome): a case report and review of the ocular pathological features.
 Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome) is an X-linked dominant condition usually fatal in males.
 Shortly after birth affected girls present with a rash followed by pigmentary changes.
 Abnormalities of the central nervous system and dentition are often present, and ophthalmic problems develop in approximately one-third of patients.
 The authors present the pathological findings in the skin and eye in a young woman who required enucleation as a result of long-standing retinal detachment and closed-angle glaucoma.
 A review of published ocular pathology reports indicates that retinal detachment and a fibrovascular retrolental membrane are the commonest intraocular abnormalities in IP.
 Changes in the retinal pigment epithelium are also prominent, although whether these are primary or secondary remains to be established.
