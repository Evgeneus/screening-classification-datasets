Correlation of the blind spot size to the area of the optic disk and parapapillary atrophy.
 We evaluated the relationship between the optic disk and the blind spot area.
 Using kinetic Goldmann perimetry in 23 patients with open-angle glaucoma and 19 normal subjects, the blind spot size was correlated significantly with the total area of the optic disk, peripapillary scleral ring, and parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy.
 Zone beta of the parapapillary atrophy with a visible sclera was attributed to an absolute scotoma, and zone alpha with irregular pigmentation was attributed to a relative scotoma.
 The blind spot was significantly larger in the glaucomatous eyes than in the normal eyes, which corresponded with a larger zone beta in the glaucomatous eyes.
 The intrapapillary and parapapillary region of the optic nerve head correlated to the size of the blind spot, which included the parapapillary chorioretinal atrophy and a significant size difference between normal and glaucomatous eyes.
