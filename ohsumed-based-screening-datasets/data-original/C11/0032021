Intraocular gas injection in the treatment of cornea-lens touch and choroidal effusion following fistulizing surgery.
 Five eyes with large choroidal detachments and flat anterior chambers following fistulizing surgery were treated with injection of perfluoropropane into the anterior chamber.
 In all cases the choroidal detachments resolved within 4 days, without the need for drainage.
 Three phakic eyes developed anterior capsular opacification in the area of contact between the gas bubble and the anterior capsule.
 Injection of perfluoropropane is recommended as a simple and effective approach to the management of choroidal detachments with flat anterior chamber in pseudophakic eyes and in cataractous phakic eyes.
