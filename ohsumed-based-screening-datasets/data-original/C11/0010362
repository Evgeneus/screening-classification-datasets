Pars plana vitrectomy for acute retinal detachment in penetrating ocular injuries.
 We studied 41 eyes with acute retinal detachment after penetrating ocular trauma in a retrospective cohort analysis.
 Pars plana vitrectomy was performed in 28 eyes, while the remaining 13 eyes had only primary repair and closure of the wound.
 The two groups differed in the type of trauma (more gunshot wounds in the vitrectomy group and more blunt injuries in the nonvitrectomized group).
 Visual success (visual acuity of 5/200 or better) was observed in 10 (37%) of the eyes treated by vitrectomy compared with one (8%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group.
 Anatomic success was achieved in 21 (75%) of the eyes in the vitrectomy group but in only one (8%) of those in the nonvitrectomy group.
 Enucleation or phthisis was observed in seven (54%) of the eyes in the nonvitrectomy group compared with only five (18%) in the vitrectomy group.
 Significant prognostic factors for anatomic outcome in the vitrectomy group were the location of the laceration and the presence of the lens.
