Fluorescein angiography in ciliary body melanomas.
 We retrospectively studied the value of iris fluorescein angiography in predicitng benignity or malignancy in 10 cases of ciliary body melanoma with iris extension.
 No correlation between fluorescein-angiographic appearance and histopathologic features was observed.
 Fluorescein angiography adds little to the management of ciliary body melanomas with iris extension.
