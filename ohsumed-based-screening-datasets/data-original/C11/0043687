Total pupillary capture with a foldable silicone intraocular lens.
 We report a case of total pupillary capture on the 1st postoperative day in a patient who had undergone phacoemulsification and placement of a silicone foldable posterior chamber intraocular lens.
 Anterior displacement of the lens optic resulted in 2.25 diopters of induced myopia.
 Dilation of the pupil corrected the lens capture and reversed the induced myopia, yielding a refraction of plano.
 Higher rates of pupillary capture have been associated with sulcus fixation and nonangulated flexible (polypropylene) haptics.
 Contraction of the capsular bag on the flexible polypropylene haptics of this silicone lens is thought to force the optic anteriorly, increasing the probability of lens capture by the iris.
