Synovial T lymphocyte-specific immune response to Chlamydia trachomatis in Reiter's disease.
 We studied the lymphocyte proliferative response to Chlamydia trachomatis in Reiter's syndrome (RS) compared with that in other rheumatic diseases.
 RS patients showed significantly increased C trachomatis-specific synovial fluid (SF) T cell proliferation.
 Proliferating cells were found in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets.
 The SF lymphocyte proliferative response to C trachomatis in RS was inhibited by anti-class I and class II major histocompatibility complex monoclonal antibodies, while the response to tuberculin purified protein derivative was inhibited only by anti-class II monoclonal antibodies.
 T cell receptor gamma/delta-bearing T cells were not consistently increased in RS SF compared with peripheral blood, nor did such cells consistently expand upon in vitro culture with C trachomatis.
 Finally, there was no correlation between the cellular immune response and levels of antibody to C trachomatis antigens.
 Our results indicate that a specific T cell response to C trachomatis within the joint plays a role in the pathogenesis of RS.
