Brazilian purpuric fever--Mato Grosso, Brazil.
 Brazilian purpuric fever (BPF) is a life-threatening pediatric infection that is preceded by conjunctivitis and caused by a specific strain of Haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius (BPF clone).
 BPF was recognized during 1984 in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, when 10 children in a town of 20,000 persons died of an acute febrile illness associated with purpura and vascular collapse.
 Until December 1989, no cases of BPF had been reported outside of Sao Paulo and the neighboring state of Parana.
 This report summarizes the recognition and investigation of BPF in the state of Mato Grosso.
