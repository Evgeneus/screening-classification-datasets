The effects of Nd:YAG laser iridotomy on the corneal endothelium.
 We studied 18 eyes of 18 patients undergoing Nd:YAG laser peripheral iridotomy for occludable anterior chamber angles.
 A Q-switched laser was used for all treatments.
 Preoperative and postoperative pachymetry and corneal endothelial cell counts were obtained centrally, in the nontreated superonasal quadrant, and in the treated superotemporal quadrant.
 No significant differences were found between preoperative and postoperative corneal thickness at any site.
 A small decrease in endothelial cell count (95 cells/mm2) at the treated site was statistically significant (P = .04).
