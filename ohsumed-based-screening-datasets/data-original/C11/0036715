The effect of glaucoma filtering surgery on corneal endothelial cell density.
 Corneal endothelial cell counts were obtained preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively in 46 eyes undergoing glaucoma filtering surgery.
 Average central endothelial cell loss in eyes without postoperative iridocorneal touch was 1.6%.
 In eyes with iridocorneal touch (Spaeth's grades 1 and 2), the average cell counts decreased by 7.1% and 9.3%, respectively.
 The average loss for combined grades 1 and 2 (8.1%) approached statistical significance (P +/- .06).
 The average loss in two patients with corneolenticular touch (Spaeth's grade 3) was greater than 50%.
 These findings suggest that early postoperative iridocorneal touch is unlikely to lead to corneal compromise in most eyes, but that corneolenticular touch can result in severe endothelial cell loss.
