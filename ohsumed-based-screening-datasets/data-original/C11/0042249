Cytomegalovirus retinopathy as the initial manifestation of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Of 100 consecutive patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection and cytomegalovirus retinopathy, 15 did not have a previous diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome before the ocular infection.
 All had other HIV-related disorders that would place them in Group IV of the Centers for Disease Control hierarchical classification system for HIV infections.
 In nine patients, cytomegalovirus retinopathy was the only disorder that fulfilled the Centers for Disease Control criteria for diagnosis of AIDS.
 In the other six, examination disclosed additional preexistent or concurrent nonocular disorders that were also diagnostic of AIDS.
 No demographic, medical, or ophthalmic characteristics distinguished the nine patients for whom cytomegalovirus retinopathy was initially the only manifestation of AIDS.
 On the basis of published figures for the prevalence of cytomegalovirus retinopathy in patients with AIDS, and the incidence with which HIV-infected persons develop AIDS, it is estimated that approximately 1.8% of patients with AIDS have cytomegalovirus retinopathy as the first manifestation and that less than 1% of HIV-infected persons will develop cytomegalovirus retinopathy as the initial manifestation of AIDS during the first seven years after infection with HIV.
