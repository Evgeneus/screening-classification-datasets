Effects of atracurium and pancuronium on the oculocardiac reflex in children.
 The authors compare the effect of two muscle relaxants, atracurium and pancuronium, on the bradycardia resulting from the oculocardiac reflex during eye surgery for strabismus in children.
 Two groups, each composed of 15 children, received either pancuronium or atracurium during strabismus operations.
 Heart rate and rhythm were observed at several points during the operations, and the changes that occurred in the two groups were compared.
 We found that the incidence and severity of the bradycardia, the incidence of dysrhythmias, and the need for atropine administration were significantly greater in the atracurium group than in the pancuronium group.
