Glaucoma after pediatric lensectomy/vitrectomy.
 Glaucoma after pediatric cataract surgery, once well recognized, now occurs only rarely after modern lensectomy/vitrectomy.
 The authors performed directed glaucoma evaluations of 34 eyes of 26 children.
 Based on intraocular pressures of 26 mmHg or greater, glaucoma was diagnosed in 8 (24%) eyes of 7 (27%) children.
 Glaucoma was found more commonly among children followed more than 60 months and was diagnosed up to 105 months after surgery.
 Typically, the glaucoma was open angle and asymptomatic.
 Four children had had previously normal pressures recorded.
 With longer follow-up, it is likely that more children will be diagnosed with glaucoma after lensectomy/vitrectomy procedures.
 The authors believe such patients should be followed as glaucoma suspects for the rest of their lives.
