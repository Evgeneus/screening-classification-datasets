Ultrastructural pathology of the 'barrier sites' in experimental autoimmune uveitis and experimental autoimmune pinealitis.
 Lewis rats were immunised with retinal S-antigen to induce experimental autoimmune uveitis and experimental autoimmune pinealitis.
 The blood-retinal and blood-pineal 'barrier sites' were examined by transmission electron microscopy.
 Inflammatory cell movement through Bruch's membrane involved separation of its constituent layers, cell migration through pores in the membrane, and between retinal pigment epithelial cells without causing significant displacement of the retinal pigment epithelial cell layer.
 The endothelial cells of retinal and pineal vessels with perivascular infiltrates showed morphological features resembling endothelium of 'high endothelial venules'.
