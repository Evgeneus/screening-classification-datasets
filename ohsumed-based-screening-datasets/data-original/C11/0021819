Graves ophthalmopathy: role of MR imaging in radiation therapy.
 Twenty-three patients with Graves ophthalmopathy who underwent radiation therapy were monitored by means of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
 T2 relaxation times of extraocular muscles and orbital fat, areas of extraocular muscles, and degree of exophthalmos were measured by means of MR imaging at the beginning, at the end, and 3 months after completion of radiation therapy.
 As a result, patients with primarily elevated T2 times of extraocular muscles showed a better therapy response regarding muscle thickening than patients with primarily normal T2 times.
 Elevated T2 times, which probably represent acute inflammatory changes, were markedly decreased at the end of therapy.
 Therefore, quantitative MR imaging favors the choice of anti-inflammatory therapy regimens in patients with elevated T2 times of extraocular muscles.
 However, the clinical response (activity scores) to the low-dose treatment protocol that was used did not correlate well with primarily elevated T2 times.
 Furthermore, T2 times increased again after cessation of therapy.
 Whether a higher radiation dose or a different fractionation scheme leads to better results must be clarified by means of further study.
