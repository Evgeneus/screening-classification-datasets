Scleral fixation suture for dislocated posterior chamber intraocular lens.
 The posterior dislocation of an intraocular lens is a serious complication of extracapsular cataract extraction with implantation of a posterior chamber intraocular lens.
 We describe a method of repositioning and suturing such a lens, using pars plana techniques.
 The method we recommend has several advantages over previously described methods, including the use of radially oriented scleral fixation sutures.
