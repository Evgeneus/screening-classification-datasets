Scleral implants: an historical perspective.
 Scleral implants are made of absorbable or nonabsorbable materials.
 One category of absorbable materials consists of donor tissue, either autogenous (fascia lata, plantaris gracilis tendon) or from cadavers (dura mater, sclera, fascia lata).
 A second category includes gelatin, reconstituted collagen, absorbable gut, fibrin, blood plasma, air, and sodium hyaluronate; of these, specially prepared gelatin seems to be the most useful.
 Nonabsorbable implant materials have proven more practical than absorbable implants.
 Solid silicone rubber is currently the most popular scleral implant material.
 It is soft, easy to handle, and well tolerated.
 Expandable implants, either temporary or permanent, are used in the form of a silicone balloon filled with liquid.
 Silicone sponge, also widely used, has the advantage of great softness.
 However, hydrogels seem to be the ideal scleral implants.
 The only one commercially available is Refojo's MAI implant.
 It is very soft and is not damaged by sutures, has a smooth surface, is molded in several sizes and shapes, and has small pores that microorganisms cannot penetrate.
 When saturated with a water-soluble antibiotic before implantation, this implant releases the antibiotic postoperatively for a longer time than any other implant material.
 Finally, surgical adhesives are useful when the sclera is too thin or weak to tolerate sutures.
 The best adhesive available seems to be isobutyl cyanoacrylate.
