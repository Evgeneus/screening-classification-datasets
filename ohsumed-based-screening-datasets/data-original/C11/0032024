Iontophoresis for eyelid anesthesia.
 Local anesthesia is appropriate for eyelid surgery, but patients fear the pain of injections.
 We evaluated iontophoresis of lidocaine for eyelid skin anesthesia to pinprick pain sensation in normal subjects, and prior to regional infiltration of the anesthetic agent in patients undergoing eyelid surgery.
 After iontophoresis of lidocaine hydrochloride 4% solution to one randomly chosen eyelid, pinprick skin sensation was tested in a double-masked manner.
 Subjective pain scores of 10 subjects were significantly less (P less than .008) on the iontophoresis treated eyelids (0.25) than on the untreated eyelids (2.55).
 Nine patients undergoing bilateral upper eyelid surgery had iontophoresis applied to one randomly chosen eyelid prior to the usual anesthetic injections.
 In this double-masked evaluation, patients reported significantly less pain (P less than .02) on the treated eyelids (1.4) than on the untreated eyelids (4.7).
 We conclude that iontophoresis is effective for achieving short-term, superficial anesthesia of eyelid skin.
