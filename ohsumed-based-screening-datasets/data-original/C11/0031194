Use of cyclosporin in the management of steroid dependent non-necrotising scleritis.
 Many patients with non-necrotising scleritis can be treated adequately with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or steroids.
 But, as many of them are young, treatment may present problems if they require high doses of steroids to control the scleral inflammation and then relapse when the dosage is reduced.
 Five such patients were treated with a combination of steroids and low-dose cyclosporin therapy, and in all cases the scleritis remained under control on a much lower dose of steroids than when steroids were used alone.
 Cyclosporin is therefore a useful drug in the management of younger patients dependent on high-dose steroids to control their scleral inflammation.
