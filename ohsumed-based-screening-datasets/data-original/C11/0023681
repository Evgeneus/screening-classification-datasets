The Takagi Automatic Tangent Screen ATS-85 analyzer for the detection of glaucomatous patients.
 The effectiveness of a new visual field analyzer, the Takagi Automatic Tangent Screen ATS-85, in detecting glaucomatous patients was studied.
 The study population consisted of three groups of subjects: normal healthy volunteers, glaucomatous patients with defective visual fields, and glaucomatous patients with early visual-field defects.
 Our results indicated that the screening program of the ATS-85 could be a useful instrument particularly for epidemiologic investigations.
