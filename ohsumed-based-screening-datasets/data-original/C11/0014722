Topical vancomycin for the treatment of Staphylococcus epidermidis and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus conjunctivitis.
 Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis are organisms that frequently cause conjunctivitis or blepharoconjunctivitis.
 We describe a patient with methicillin-resistant S.
 aureus and S.
 epidermidis conjunctivitis who was treated successfully using an extemporaneously prepared topical ophthalmic solution of vancomycin hydrochloride 31 mg/mL.
 Studies describing the preparation, stability, and comfort of this solution, as well as reports pertaining to efficacy, are reviewed.
 Controlled clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of vancomycin ophthalmic solution have not yet been performed.
