En bloc removal of inflammatory fibrocellular membranes from the iris surface in endophthalmitis.
 Dense inflammatory fibrocellular membranes may develop over the iris in an eye with endophalmitis, completely obliterating any view of the posterior segment and hindering vitrectomy.
 To remove this debris, the edge of the membrane is first lifted from the surface of the iris with a small microvitreoretinal blade inserted through a limbal wound.
 The membrane is then engaged with an iris hook that is rotated until the debris is tightly wound on the shaft of the instrument.
 The iris hook is then removed from the anterior segment, delivering the inflammatory debris en bloc.
 This technique limits possible surgical trauma to the anterior segment and provides an excellent specimen for culture.
