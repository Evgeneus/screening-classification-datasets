Central retinal artery obstruction in herpes zoster ophthalmicus and cerebral vasculopathy.
 We present a case of acute central retinal artery obstruction in association with Herpes zoster ophthalmicus and delayed cerebral vasculopathy.
 Retinal vascular obstruction is rare in zoster, and its occurrence during postherpetic cerebral vasculopathy has not been reported previously to our knowledge.
 The syndrome of delayed cerebral vasculopathy is discussed as is its possible relationship to central retinal artery obstruction.
