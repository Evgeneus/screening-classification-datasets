Vitreoretinal traction and perimacular retinal folds in the eyes of deliberately traumatized children.
 The pathophysiology of perimacular folds in eyes of deliberately traumatized children is disputed.
 The authors reviewed the clinical and forensic records and systemic and ocular findings at autopsy of three children with perimacular retinal folds who died after being violently shaken.
 Two of the children suffered direct head trauma in addition to being shaken; one patient was violently shaken without any physical or forensic evidence of direct head trauma.
 No direct ocular trauma was detected.
 In each case, the vitreous had partially separated from the retina but remained attached to the internal limiting membrane at the apices of the folds and the vitreous base, implicating traction in the pathogenesis of these folds.
 Although some intraocular findings in deliberately traumatized children may be explained by direct head injury, the possibility of both direct head trauma and shaking must be considered.
 Perimacular folds may develop without direct ocular or head trauma and may constitute evidence supporting violent shaking.
