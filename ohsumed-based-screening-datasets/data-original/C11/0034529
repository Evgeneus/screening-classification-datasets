Cilioretinal artery occlusion in young adults with central retinal vein occlusion.
 Ten patients, all younger than 50 years of age, had a temporal cilioretinal artery occlusion associated with a nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion.
 On fluorescein angiography, the cilioretinal artery eventually filled in all but one eye.
 The cilioretinal artery showed pulsations on fluorescein angiography in five eyes.
 The central retinal vein occlusion eventually resolved and the fundus assumed a normal appearance in all nine of the followed cases.
 Eight of nine eyes that underwent follow-up examination had final visual acuity of 20/30 or better.
 The occlusion of the central retinal vein produces an elevation of intraluminal capillary pressure because the central retinal artery continues to pump blood into the retina.
 Because the perfusion pressure of the cilioretinal artery is lower than the central retinal artery, it becomes relatively occluded.
 The prognosis for these patients is generally good unless the entire parafoveal capillary net is affected by the cilioretinal artery that is occluded.
