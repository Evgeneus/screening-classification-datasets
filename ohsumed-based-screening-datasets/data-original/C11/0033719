Surgical management of corneal perforation with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex).
 We report a series of six patients with spontaneous corneal perforations successfully treated with a temporary graft of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) until a definitive penetrating keratoplasty could be performed.
 Two other patients had a paralimbic perforation treated with an artificial lamellar Gore-Tex graft.
 No infection or extrusion developed, and the artificial graft kept the anterior chamber tight in all cases.
 Gore-Tex appears to be a safe and effective material for use in treating acute central and peripheral corneal perforation.
