Intraocular tolerance to silicone oils of different specific gravities. An experimental study.
 Different methylphenylsilicone (MPS) and fluorosilicone (FS) oils having a higher specific gravity than water were investigated as vitreous replacements.
 Their intraocular tolerance in vitrectomized aphakic rabbit eyes was evaluated for periods of up to 4 months and compared to that of regular polydimethylsilicone oil (PDMS).
 Weakly fluorinated FS and weakly phenylated MPS showed a presumably toxic effect on the retina.
 As compared to highly fluorinated FS, highly phenylated MPS showed better intraocular tolerance; however, inflammatory reaction was slightly more extensive than in eyes filled with PDMS.
