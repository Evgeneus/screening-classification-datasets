Lower eyelid retraction: a minimal incision surgical approach to retractor lysis.
 Lower eyelid retraction associated with prior blepharoplasty, trauma, or other conditions is a challenging problem for the ophthalmic surgeon.
 We describe a procedure involving tightening the lower eyelid and supraplacing the lateral canthus in combination with in-glove lysis of the lower eyelid retractors and scar tissue.
 This is accomplished through a small lateral incision.
 To date, we have treated over 200 eyelids using this technique with excellent results.
 We recommend this technique for the treatment of mild to moderate degrees of lower eyelid retraction.
