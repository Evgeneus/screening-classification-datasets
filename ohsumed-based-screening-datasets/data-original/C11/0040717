Preserved action of a rectus muscle after transection by an encircling solid silicone band.
 We present a case of anterior migration of a solid silicone band through a lateral rectus muscle.
 In this patient the action of the lateral rectus was preserved, and this is demonstrated photographically.
 The possible reasons for this rare complication and the possible mechanism by which lateral rectus activity remained intact are explained.
