Acyclovir in herpetic anterior uveitis.
 The optimal management of herpes simplex stromal keratitis and uveitis is controversial.
 Thirty-two patients with presumptive herpetic anterior uveitis without active corneal inflammation received 3% acyclovir ophthalmic ointment five times daily and acyclovir 200mg orally five times a day.
 Eight of 18 patients (44.4%) who had received corticosteroids deteriorated over the first five days of therapy; one of 14 patients (7.1%) without previous corticosteroid use worsened during this time (P less than .05).
 The mean healing time was similar in these two groups.
 These results suggest that antiviral therapy may be first-line treatment in patients with herpetic keratouveitis who have not received corticosteroids.
