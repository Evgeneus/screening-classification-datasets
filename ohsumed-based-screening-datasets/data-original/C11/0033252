Unusually severe traumatic uveitis associated with occult ankylosing spondylitis.
 We describe two young men in whom severe anterior uveitis developed following relatively minor corneal trauma.
 Investigation revealed ankylosing spondylitis in both cases; neither had previously experienced uveitis.
 We are unaware of any previous reports implicating minor ocular trauma in precipitating a first episode of uveitis associated with ankylosing spondylitis.
 The possibility of occult ankylosing spondylitis should be considered in cases of disproportionately large anterior chamber reactions to minor ocular trauma.
