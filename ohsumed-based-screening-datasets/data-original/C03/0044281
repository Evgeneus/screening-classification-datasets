Subcutaneous cysticercosis.
 A case of subcutaneous cysticercosis is presented, and 35 other cases from the literature are reviewed.
 Patients usually have multiple subcutaneous nodules that are firm, mobile, and sometimes painful, occurring mainly on the trunk and extremities.
 Diagnosis is made by biopsy; however, radiologic and immunologic studies can be helpful in the diagnosis and work-up.
 Treatment options include surgery, praziquantel, and albendazole.
