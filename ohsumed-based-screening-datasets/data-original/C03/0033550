Global distribution of a variant of the circumsporozoite gene of Plasmodium vivax.
 The global distribution of a newly described variant of the Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite (CS) gene was determined by genetic analysis of wild isolates.
 Whole blood specimens were collected on filter paper from patients infected with P.
 vivax in South America.
 West Africa, and the Indian subcontinent.
 P.
 vivax DNA was released from the filter paper samples, and the CS gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and analyzed for genetic variation.
 Amplified DNA was probed with oligonucleotide probes that hybridize with the predominant CS repeat region (PV210) and the variant CS repeat region (PV247) of P.
 vivax.
 The PV247 variant was found in all three geographically diverse areas.
 In addition, five of six consecutive patients studied had simultaneous infection with both the predominant and variant forms of P.
 vivax.
 These findings suggest that a single-epitope vaccine based on the predominant CS domain is unlikely to be protective on even a regional basis.
