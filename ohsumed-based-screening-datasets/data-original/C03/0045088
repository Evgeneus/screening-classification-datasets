A soluble factor produced by inoculation of human monocytes with Leishmania donovani promastigotes suppresses IFN-gamma-dependent monocyte activation.
 Whereas human cultured monocytes preactivated with IFN-gamma increase their antileishmanial capacity, monocytes inoculated with Leishmania donovani before IFN-gamma treatment fail to respond with an increase of antileishmanial capacity.
 Cell surface expression of class II MHC products also fails to be increased by IFN-gamma in the infected monocytes, although the accumulation of HLA-DR alpha-chain mRNA is increased to the same extent in infected and noninfected activated monocytes.
 This inhibition of monocyte activation is caused in a dose-dependent manner by a soluble substance elaborated into the cell supernatant after inoculation of monocytes with L.
 donovani and is referred to as activation suppressing factor (ASF).
 ASF activity can be abrogated by dialysis and by treatment with a proteinase, indicating that ASF is a small peptide.
