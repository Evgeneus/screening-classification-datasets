Serological investigation of ocular toxoplasmosis.
 The limitations of serological assessment in toxoplasma infection of the eye are well recognised, but the predictive value of clinical examination is not defined.
 We undertook a prospective investigation into the role of clinical examination and of serological findings in cases of suspected toxoplasma infection of the eye by means of the dye test and multiple IgM assays.
 Seventy-four cases of retinal disease and 202 control patients were studied.
 Patients with retinal disease had a significantly higher incidence of toxoplasma seropositivity than the control group.
 This was because some patients with retinal disease had acquired the infection congenitally.
 Half the patients investigated for toxoplasmosis were seronegative.
 Possible explanations for these findings included misdiagnosis, clinical uncertainty, or, the use of serology testing in the confirmation of other diseases.
 An excess of IgM reactivity among the retinal disease group may indicate low level immunoglobulin-M production associated with an acute exacerbation of ocular toxoplasmosis.
 There is a need to consider invasive procedures in cases of ocular infection and for novel techniques to aid the diagnosis of toxoplasma retinochoroiditis.
