Cranial vault and gigantic intracranial hydatid cyst in a young woman.
 The case of a young woman (20 years) with a gigantic intracranial hydatid cyst (110 x 90 x 65 mm) is presented.
 The first manifestation was a grand mal seizure followed by symptoms of raised intracranial pressure.
 The origin of the cyst was in the diploe of the right cheek, frontal, temporal, and parietal bones.
 An osteoplastic craniotomy was performed, and more than 100 fertile daughter cysts were removed, together with the wall of the cyst.
 A modification in the standard operative procedure is proposed for gigantic cysts that emerge from the diploe of the cranial vault and extend intracranially.
 Therapy with dexamethasone and phenobarbital was instituted preoperatively and continued postoperatively.
 The 3-month follow-up showed no relapse.
