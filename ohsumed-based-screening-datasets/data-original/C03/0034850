Comparison of antimalarial efficacy of alpha, beta, and alpha/beta arteether against Plasmodium cynomolgi B infection in monkeys.
 The blood schizontocidal activity of alpha and beta arteether has been compared with that of alpha/beta arteether (a 30:70 mixture of alpha and beta isomers), which is a fast-acting blood schizontocide undergoing phase I clinical trials at the Central Drug Research Institute.
 Both beta and alpha/beta arteether have comparable activity and are curative at a dose of 5 mg/kg for 3 days against blood-induced Plasmodium cynomolgi B infection in the rhesus monkey; alpha arteether alone is slightly less active, with a 50% cure rate at the above dose.
