Hypnozoites of Plasmodium simiovale.
 Hypnozoites of Plasmodium simiovale were detected in liver biopsies from a rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) inoculated eight days previously with sporozoites from heavily infected anopheline mosquitoes.
 The tissue forms, 6 mu in diameter, were found within the cytoplasm of hepatic parenchymal cells by immunofluorescence and restained with Giemsa.
 This is the first report of latent, pre-erythrocytic stages from an ovale-type relapsing malaria.
