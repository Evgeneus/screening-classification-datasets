Potential role of IgG avidity for diagnosing toxoplasmosis.
 Sera from 20 cases of toxoplasmic lymphadenopathy were examined by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay toxoplasma IgG avidity (ELISA) at two laboratories.
 The results obtained were largely in agreement and showed that sera from patients with acute infection had low avidity IgG (30% or less), whereas sera from patients with chronic infection had high avidity IgG (40% or more).
 It is suggested that this type of assay could have a useful complementary role in antenatal testing for toxoplasmosis.
