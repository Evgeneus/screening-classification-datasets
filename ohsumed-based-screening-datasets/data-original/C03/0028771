Epilepsy: disappearing lesions appearing in the United Kingdom 
 OBJECTIVE--Investigation of spontaneously resolving lesions associated with epilepsy.
 DESIGN--Observational study during one year.
 SETTING--One neurology department.
 PATIENTS--4 cases in patients (one of Indian parents, one African, one white English, and one Afro-Caribbean) resident in the United Kingdom, who presented with transient epilepsy.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Findings on computed tomography and on screening for infections.
 RESULTS--In all four cases a small mass lesion in one cerebral hemisphere was observed on computed tomography, which resolved after 9, 4, 3 and 1.5 months respectively without surgery.
 CONCLUSIONS--The number of cases seen in one year suggests that the lesions may be more common in the United Kingdom than previously recognised and that research into their cause is warranted.
