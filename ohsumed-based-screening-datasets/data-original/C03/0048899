Soluble IL-2 receptor as an agent of serum-mediated suppression in human visceral leishmaniasis.
 In visceral leishmaniasis (VL), patient's lymphocytes are not activated by leishmania Ag stimulation, and their sera exhibit a potent nonspecific suppressive effect on the responses of normal lymphocytes.
 Sera were obtained from 33 VL patients, eight patients with subclinical VL, and from 27 normal volunteers.
 Only sera from VL patients markedly reduced Con A-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses, as well as IL-2 or IFN-gamma production by normal lymphocytes.
 Addition of exogenous human rIL-2 to cultures containing VL patient sera partially reversed the normal lymphocyte proliferative capacity and restored IFN-gamma production.
 This phenomenon was consistent with the presence of greatly elevated levels of soluble IL-2R (sIL-2R) in VL patients' sera (4299 +/- 2351 U/ml), well above those of normal sera (180 +/- 94 U/ml), or of sera from patients with subclinical leishmania infection without immunosuppression (1002 +/- 281 U/ml).
 Furthermore, the removal of sIL-2R reduced VL serum suppressive activity as evaluated by effects on IL-2 and on IFN-gamma production.
 These data suggest the participation of high levels of sIL-2R in the serum-mediated suppression in VL.
