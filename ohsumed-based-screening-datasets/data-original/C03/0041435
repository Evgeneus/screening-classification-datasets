Chagas' cardioneuropathy: effect of ganglioside treatment in chronic dysautonomic patients--a randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study.
 To date, there is no effective pharmacologic treatment for Chagas' cardioneuropathy, one of the most common causes of congestive heart failure and sudden death in the world.
 Fifty-eight adults with positive serology for Chagas' disease and abnormal autonomic nervous system tests participated in this placebo-controlled clinical trial with Cronassial (mixed gangliosides), 40 mg daily intramuscular injection for 4 or 8 weeks.
 We measured postural response (heart rate, systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure changes in response to standing); heart rate changes induced by cough and hyperventilation reflex tests; dizziness on standing; number of stress-induced arrhythmias; and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive T-lymphocyte percentage in blood samples.
 Cronassial is safe and significantly improves systolic blood pressure (p = 0.050) and double product responses to postural stress (p = 0.028), hyperventilation heart rate response (p = 0.007), frequency of dizziness episodes (p less than 0.001), number of arrhythmias (p = 0.033), and percentage of PAS-positive T-lymphocyte counts (p less than 0.001) compared with placebo.
