Effect of clindamycin on pneumonia from reactivation of Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice.
 Clindamycin was used to treat the reactivation of a chronic Toxoplasma gondii infection in mice.
 Clindamycin reduced mortality by 44% when used prophylactically (P less than 0.001) but appeared to be less effective when used to treat clinically apparent reactivation.
 Further studies should be conducted to establish the efficacy of clindamycin for the treatment of toxoplasmosis in humans.
