In vitro activity of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes from mice immunized with a synthetic malaria peptide.
 In previous work, a T-helper epitope was mapped within the circumsporozoite protein of the murine malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii.
 A 21-mer synthetic peptide corresponding to this epitope (amino acid positions 59-79; referred to as Py1) induced a specific T-cell proliferation in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice and provided help for the production of antibodies to peptides from the repetitive region, (Gln-Gly-Pro-Gly-Ala-Pro)n, of the P.
 yoelii circumsporozoite protein when mice were immunized with the Py1 peptide conjugated to the repetitive peptide.
 Experiments were then designed to study the in vitro antiparasite efficacy of T cells elicited in vivo by peptide immunization.
 T-cell activity was evaluated on cultured hepatic stages of P.
 yoelii.
 Peptide immunizations led to the preferential activation of CD8+ T cells in BALB/c mice and of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice.
 Parasite elimination was mediated directly by these cells and did not seem to be dependent on lymphokine secretion.
 These data suggest that peptide-primed CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells could be cytolytic for the hepatic phase of malaria parasites.
 The fact that the same peptide could activate different lymphocyte populations, depending on the strain of mouse, highlights the importance of a better understanding of the fine mechanisms behind the immune responses to synthetic peptides being tested for malaria vaccine development.
