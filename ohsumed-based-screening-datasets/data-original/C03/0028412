Ophthalmomyiasis caused by the reindeer warble fly larva.
 Two boys with ophthalmomyiasis caused by the first instar larva of the reindeer warble fly Hypoderma tarandi are reported.
 Both were 9 years old and came from the coast of northern Norway.
 One had ophthalmomyiasis interna posterior and one eye had been removed because of progressive pain and blindness.
 Histological examination showed the remains of a fly larva.
 The second boy had ophthalmomyiasis externa with a tumour in the upper eyelid, and histological examination showed a warble with a well preserved larva.
 Identification of the parasite in the histological material was based on the finding of cuticular spines and parts of the cephalopharyngeal skeleton identical with those of the first instar larva of H tarandi.
