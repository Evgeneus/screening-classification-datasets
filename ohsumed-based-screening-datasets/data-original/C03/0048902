Immune response to Schistosoma mansoni infections in inbred rats. VII. Resistance is contingent on OX-8(+)-regulated high affinity IL-2 receptor-bearing W3/25+ lymphocytes but not on IL-4-dependent cells.
 These studies assess the roles of subpopulations of T lymphocytes in resistance to Schistosoma mansoni.
 CDF rats were depleted of the T cell subpopulation bearing the high affinity IL-2R by in vivo treatment with ART18+ mAb or of soluble IL-4 by treatment with 11B11 mAb.
 The development of parasites, the expression of resistance after sensitization, and the intensity of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), Ag-mediated blast transformation (AMBT), IgG2a, passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, and IgE-mediated antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity responses against S.
 mansoni or control Ag were ascertained.
 Isolated T cell subpopulations were assessed in vivo and in vitro for effects upon the protective Ir.
 Depletion with ART18 mAb suppressed the development of W3/25+ helper-inducer cells and resulted in the initial survival of more worms, decreased resistance to challenge after initial sensitization, decreased IgG2a and IgE antibody, AMBT, and DTH reactivity against schistosome Ag.
 Depletion with ART18 did not prevent the development of OX8+ (T suppressor) cells.
 Depletion with 11B11 mAb led to insignificant changes in initial parasite survival and resistance to challenge; had no effect on IgG2a antibody, AMBT, or DTH; but profoundly suppressed the IgE responses against the parasite.
 Protective immunity to S.
 mansoni in rats is dependent upon IL-2R-bearing T lymphocytes and regulated by OX8+ cells but not absolutely contingent upon IL-4 or the IgE response.
