Molecular basis of sequestration in severe and uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria: differential adhesion of infected erythrocytes to CD36 and ICAM-1.
 The CD36 and ICAM-1 glycoproteins on vascular endothelial cells have been implicated as cytoadherence receptors for Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IRBC).
 Adhesion of IRBC from Thai patients with uncomplicated and severe falciparum malaria to purified CD36 or ICAM-1 and to C32 melanoma cells was compared.
 All malaria isolates bound to solid phase-adsorbed CD36 and to fluid-phase 125I-labeled CD36.
 IRBC adhesion to purified ICAM-1 varied widely, and no correlation with clinical severity of disease was observed.
 The cytoadherent phenotype of IRBC was modulated by selective panning on plates coated with purified CD36 or ICAM-1.
 IRBC selected by panning on CD36+, ICAM-1+ melanoma cells bound to cells that express surface CD36 but not to CD36-deficient cells, indicating that CD36 exerts a strong selective pressure on the IRBC cytoadherent phenotype.
 IRBC adhesion to CD36 and ICAM-1 suggests that P.
 falciparum parasites may use these receptors in vivo to promote parasite survival and immune evasion.
