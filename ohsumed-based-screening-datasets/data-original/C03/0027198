Protection against malaria by vaccination with sporozoite surface protein 2 plus CS protein.
 The circumsporozoite (CS) protein has been the target for development of malaria sporozoite vaccines for a decade.
 However, immunization with subunit vaccines based on the CS protein has never given the complete protection found after immunization with irradiated sporozoites.
 BALB/c mice immunized with irradiated Plasmodium yoelii sporozoites produced antibodies and cytotoxic T cells against a 140-kilodalton protein, sporozoite surface protein 2 (SSP2).
 Mice immunized with P815 cells that had been transfected with either SSP2 or CS genes were partially protected, and those immunized with a mixture of SSP2 and CS transfectants were completely protected against malaria.
 These studies emphasize the importance of vaccine delivery systems in achieving protection and define a multi-antigen sporozoite vaccine.
