Malaria in travelers in Rhode Island: a review of 26 cases.
 PURPOSE: We reviewed our experience with malaria in two community hospitals in Rhode Island from 1986 to 1990.
 RESULTS: Twenty-six patients with malaria were identified.
 Fifteen patients were immigrants who had acquired malaria while visiting their country of origin, particularly West Africa.
 Fever was present in 67% of cases and gastrointestinal complaints were prominent in 26%.
 Individuals with a past history of malaria could accurately distinguish current malarial infections from other febrile illnesses.
 Two patients developed cerebral malaria.
 Plasmodium falciparum was identified in 77% of the cases.
 CONCLUSIONS: Malaria is an important diagnosis that United States physicians must consider in the medical evaluation of returning travelers.
 A significant increase in the number of cases of P.
 falciparum acquired in East Africa has been reported in recent years.
 P.
 falciparum infection must be rapidly diagnosed and treated since delays may result in complications of malaria that may lead to death.
 Mefloquine is currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control for prevention of malaria in travelers visiting countries endemic for chloroquine-resistant malaria.
 This change may alter the epidemiology of malaria in the United States in the future.
