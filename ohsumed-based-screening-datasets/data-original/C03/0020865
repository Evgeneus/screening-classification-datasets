Mass flea outbreak at a child care facility: case report.
 Cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis Bouchet, were collected at a Mississippi child care facility after reports of large numbers of adult fleas occurring on children and personnel.
 One building yielded 161 (99 percent) of the fleas collected.
 Urticarial lesions due to flea bites occurred on the legs of six children.
 Flea presence was due to cats occupying the crawl space.
 Fleas were eradicated by eliminating entry of cats and using residual insecticides throughout the facility.
