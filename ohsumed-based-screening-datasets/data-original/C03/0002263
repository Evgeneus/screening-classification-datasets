Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis 
 Pleuropulmonary manifestations of hepatic amebiasis occurred in 30 patients; 18 (60%) presented with at least 1 pulmonary complaint and 10 (33%) had multiple pulmonary symptoms.
 In 14 patients (47%), abnormalities were found on examination of the chest.
 In 16 chest roentgenograms (53%), there was at least 1 abnormality: right-sided pleural effusion (9 patients) and elevated right hemidiaphragm (8 patients) were the most common.
 All patients were treated with metronidazole (Flagyl) and had resolution of the amebic liver abscess and pulmonary disease.
 Pleuropulmonary disease is a common complication of amebic liver abscess.
 The clinical presentation and chest roentgenograms are virtually diagnostic and obviate the need for invasive procedures to confirm the diagnosis.
 Pleuropulmonary disease resolves with amebicidal treatment of the hepatic abscess.
