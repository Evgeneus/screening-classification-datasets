A role for IgE in intestinal immunity. Expression of rapid expulsion of Trichinella spiralis in rats transfused with IgE and thoracic duct lymphocytes.
 In these experiments we characterize the protective antibodies in immune serum that interact synergistically with immune thoracic duct lymphocytes (TDL) to induce rapid expulsion (RE) of Trichinella spiralis in adult rats.
 Antibodies with both reaginic and nonreaginic activity mediated RE upon passive transfer to adult rats that had been adoptively transfused with immune TDL 7 days earlier.
 In serum collected 28 days after a primary infection, the most important antibody was homocytotropic IgE.
 Native IgE produced by active infection was isolated from 28-day immune serum by salt precipitation and/or by sequential affinity chromatography.
 The murine mAb A2 and B5 (anti-rat IgE) were conjugated separately to Sepharose 4B affinity columns for affinity separations.
 IgE was shown to be pure by gel electrophoresis and Western blots and its m.w.
 was estimated at approximately 190,000.
 As little as 183 micrograms of purified IgE could induce RE after passive transfer to adult rats.
 The IgE was shown to be functional by PCA activity, Ag-binding on Western blots, and skin sensitization; the latter could be blocked by pretreatment with 1R162, a rat myeloma IgE.
 Monoclonal IgG of any isotype transferred in amounts up to 35 mg/rat could not transfer RE to rats previously transfused with TDL cells.
 Immune serum collected 3 mo after the primary infection contained insufficient IgE to transfer RE, but complex non-IgE fractions were protective.
 The data thus demonstrate that IgE is a functional Ig in the rat capable of mediating the rejection of challenge nematode infections of the gut in the absence of other specific Ig.
 Secondly, other Ig may also play a role, in particular, several weeks after the primary infection when specific IgE levels in serum have declined.
