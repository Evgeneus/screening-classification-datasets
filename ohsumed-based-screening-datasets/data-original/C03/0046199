Tumor necrosis factor-alpha synergizes with IFN-gamma in mediating killing of Leishmania major through the induction of nitric oxide.
 CBA mice develop cutaneous lesions when infected with Leishmania major.
 The disease development was significantly reduced by injecting into the lesion a combination of rIFN-gamma and rTNF-alpha.
 The doses of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha used were suboptimal in that either cytokine alone did not have any effect.
 The therapeutic effect of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha in vivo is reflected in their ability to activate macrophages to kill the intracellular parasites in vitro.
 The macrophage leishmanicidal activity induced by TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma can be completely inhibited by a specific inhibitor (L-NG monomethyl arginine) of nitric oxide synthesis.
 There was a direct correlation between the intracellular killing of the parasites and the production of nitric oxide by the macrophages.
 In contrast, there was no correlation between leishmanicidal activity and superoxide production by macrophages.
