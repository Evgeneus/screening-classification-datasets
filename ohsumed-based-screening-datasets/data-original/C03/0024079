Automated microparticle enzyme immunoassays for IgG and IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii.
 Fully automated microparticle enzyme immunoassays (MEIA) for the IMx immunoassay analyser were developed to detect IgG and IgM antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii.
 The IgG MEIA results are expressed in International Units (IU) of IgG antibody interpolated from a six point calibration curve covering the range from 0 to 300 IU/ml.
 Reproducible results were obtained from a calibration curve stored in the instrument for at least one month.
 The qualitative IgM MEIA expresses results as an index using a single calibrator included in each run.
 The Toxo IgG MEIA and Toxo IgM MEIA were in 98% and 97% agreement, respectively, with the reference assays used.
 Twenty four sera can be completely processed in about 35 minutes.
