Hookworm folliculitis.
 A case of persistent folliculitis in a 21-year-old man was demonstrated to be due to Ancylostoma caninum larvae.
 Treatment with oral thiabendazole was curative.
 Cutaneous larva migrans may be due to A caninum, but this presentation appears to be unique.
 The literature concerning etiology and pathogenesis of larva migrans is discussed with reference to this case.
