Remarkable in vitro and in vivo activities of the hydroxynaphthoquinone 566C80 against tachyzoites and tissue cysts of Toxoplasma gondii.
 Compound 566C80, 2-[trans-4-(4-chlorophenyl)cyclohexyl]-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, was studied for its in vitro and in vivo activities against Toxoplasma gondii.
 Replication within human foreskin fibroblasts of tachyzoites of seven different strains, five of them isolated from AIDS patients, was inhibited by concentrations as low as 4.8 x 10(-9) M.
 In vivo, a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight per day, administered by gavage for 10 days, protected 100% of mice against death due to infection with five different strains of T.
 gondii, including the highly virulent RH strain.
 A dose of 50 mg/kg/day protected at least 80% of mice infected with the same inoculum, and a dose as low as 9.3 mg/kg/day protected 40 to 60% of mice.
 Treatment with 50 mg/kg/day for 30 days completely eradicated parasites from mice infected with four of five strains of T.
 gondii.
 566C80 was active in vitro against the cyst stage of T.
 gondii at concentrations of 50 to 100 micrograms/ml.
 In vivo activity against this form of T.
 gondii was examined in mice infected for 6 weeks with strain ME49 and then treated orally with 100 mg of 566C80 per kg per day for 8 weeks.
 Treated mice sacrificed at 2-week intervals revealed a steady decline in the numbers of cysts in their brains compared with untreated controls.
 In addition, mortality as well as clinical signs of brain infection was absent from treated mice, whereas control mice had a high mortality rate and showed clinical signs of central nervous system infection.
 These results reveal remarkable in vitro and in vivo activities of 566C80 against T.
 gondii.
