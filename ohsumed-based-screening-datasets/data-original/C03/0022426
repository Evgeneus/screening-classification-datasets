Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments in patients with AIDS and necrotizing retinal infections.
 Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments can occur in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and necrotizing retinal infections.
 Of 68 patients with AIDS and necrotizing retinal infections seen between 1983 and 1987, rhegmatogenous retinal detachments developed in 16 patients (27 eyes).
 In this group, cytomegalovirus retinopathy was present in 75% (12 of 16) of patients, 18.8% (3 of 16) had probable herpes simplex virus retinopathy, and 6.2% (1 of 16) had toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis.
 Retinal detachment was bilateral in 68.8% (11 of 16) of patients.
 The retina was reattached successfully in 91% (10 of 11) of operated eyes.
 Proliferative vitreoretinopathy was present preoperatively in 95% of these eyes.
 Seven of 11 operated eyes had initial improvement in visual acuity.
 However, 5 of 11 continued to lose vision despite successful reattachment.
 Techniques included pneumatic reattachment, scleral buckle, vitrectomy, and silicone oil injection.
 Complicated retinal detachments in AIDS patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachments and necrotizing retinal infections are common and can be repaired, but the prognosis is guarded in many patients.
