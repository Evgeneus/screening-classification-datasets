Transfusion-transmitted babesiosis: a case report from a new endemic area.
 The seventh documented case of babesiosis transmitted by transfusion is reported.
 Both the donor and the recipient are residents of Connecticut, where the presence of endemic babesiosis has only recently been established.
 As the range of Babesia microti, and its vector the Ixodes dammini tick, continues to expand, clinicians and blood bank directors should be aware that cases of transfusion-transmitted babesiosis may occur in newly endemic areas.
