Efficacy of quinine for falciparum malaria according to previous chloroquine exposure.
 Chloroquine has been reported to antagonise the anti-parasitic action of quinine against Plasmodium falciparum in vitro.
 We looked for evidence of any such antagonism in vivo.
 In 123 Malawian children with cerebral malaria treated with parenteral quinine, the likelihood of survival and the rate of recovery were much the same in patients who had taken chloroquine and those who had not.
 In these circumstances we found no evidence of chloroquine/quinine antagonism.
