Lipophosphoglycan masks recognition of the Leishmania donovani promastigote surface by human kala-azar serum.
 Markedly elevated titers of anti-leishmanial antibodies are a hallmark of kala-azar.
 We investigated the role played by the lipophosphoglycan (LPG) in determining the reactivity of kala-azar serum with the surface of Leishmania donovani promastigotes.
 In assays performed with liver parasites there was negligible agglutination or fluorescent staining of LPG-bearing promastigotes by kala-azar serum, but strong reactivity in both assays with the use of an L.
 donovani mutant strain (R2D2) that lacks surface expression of LPG.
 Immunoprecipitation of lysates of 125I surface-labeled promastigotes indicated that kala-azar serum has reactivity with several surface proteins common to both the wild-type and R2D2 strains, and no reactivity with surface proteins unique to R2D2.
 Although direct ELISA showed that kala-azar serum recognizes purified promastigote LPG, inhibition ELISA suggested that such recognition is based solely upon reactivity with the normally unexposed core-anchor region of the molecule.
 We conclude that the poor reactivity of kala-azar serum with the surface of L.
 donovani promastigotes is caused by its lack of recognition of the exposed phosphodisaccharide repeat units of LPG, which in turn effectively mask the surface molecules that are recognized by kala-azar serum antibodies.
