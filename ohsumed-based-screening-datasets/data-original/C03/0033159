A case of opisthorchiasis diagnosed by cholangiography and bile examination.
 A case of symptomatic opisthorchiasis in a 66-year-old Laotian immigrant is presented.
 The diagnosis was made by transhepatic cholangiography and by finding the trematode eggs in bile fluid.
 The characteristic cholangiographic changes of opisthorchiasis are described, including the intraluminal filling defects, the diffuse irregular dilation of the intrahepatic bile ducts, and the abrupt endings of the terminal branches.
 The importance of microscopic examination of the bile is stressed especially when stool examination is negative.
