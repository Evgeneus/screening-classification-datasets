Strongyloides stercoralis hyperinfection and central nervous system involvement in a patient with relapsing polychondritis.
 Infections caused by Strongyloides stercoralis are not uncommon in the United States.
 Because of the many different manifestations of hyperinfection with this nematode, a high index of suspicion is essential, especially in immunocompromised patients, for whom such infections are frequently fatal.
 Patients originating from endemic areas and those who have traveled to such areas, even in the distant past, should have the possibility of strongyloidiasis evaluated before initiation of immunosuppressive therapy.
 Once considered, the diagnosis is not difficult and can be accomplished using readily available techniques and methods.
 Although thiabendazole has a high incidence of side effects and may not always eradicate infection, it remains the drug of choice for disseminated strongyloidiasis.
