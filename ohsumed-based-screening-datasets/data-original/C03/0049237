Molecular mimicry by Trypanosoma cruzi: the F1-160 epitope that mimics mammalian nerve can be mapped to a 12-amino acid peptide.
 Antigenic mimicry by Trypanosoma cruzi antigens that share epitopes with mammalian tissues may drive autoreactive B- or T-cell clones to expand and cause autoimmune pathogenesis.
 We have been studying one of these antigens, F1-160, a 160-kDa protein on the surface of T.
 cruzi that antigenically mimics a 48-kDa protein found in mammalian axonal and myenteric plexus cells.
 The F1-160 antigen has been characterized by cloning and expression of T.
 cruzi DNA encoding F1-160 in Escherichia coli.
 Recombinant peptides from various regions of the F1-160 gene were expressed and used to compete with affinity-purified polyclonal anti-F1-160 antibodies binding to nerve.
 Recombinant 48-amino acid peptide (48X) derived from expression of base pairs 611-761 of the DNA sequence completely inhibited anti-F1-160 binding to nerve.
 Recombinant peptides expressed from DNA lacking this region did not inhibit anti-F1-160 binding to nerve.
 Three peptides were synthesized to encompass the 48X peptide, a 12-amino acid peptide and two 18-amino acid peptides.
 The 12-amino acid peptide TPQRKTTEDRPQ (12X), corresponding to bases 615-651, completely inhibited the binding of anti-F1-160 antibodies to nerve at a concentration of 80 ng/ml (30 microM).
 The two 18-residue peptides did not inhibit, even at 10 micrograms/ml.
 Thus, the epitope of F1-160 crossreactive with nervous tissue can be mapped to a 12-amino acid peptide.
 Some humans with T.
 cruzi infection make antibodies to F1-160 and to the 48X and 12X peptides.
 Control sera from uninfected persons did not react with these antigens.
 Anti-48X antibodies, immunoselected from human serum with 48X peptide, bind to human nerve axons.
 This demonstrates that some individuals infected with T.
 cruzi make antibodies to the F1-160 epitope crossreactive with nervous tissues.
