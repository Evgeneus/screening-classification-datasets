Purified Fc epsilon R+ bone marrow and splenic non-B, non-T cells are highly enriched in the capacity to produce IL-4 in response to immobilized IgE, IgG2a, or ionomycin.
 Non-B, non-T cells from spleen and bone marrow cells produce IL-4 in response to cross-linkage of high affinity receptors for Fc epsilon R or Fc gamma RII, and to treatment with calcium ionophores.
 Cells bearing high affinity Fc epsilon R constituted 1 to 2% of non-B, non-T cells of spleen and of total bone marrow cells from naive donors.
 In mice whose immune systems had been polyclonally activated by injection with anti-IgD antibodies or had been infected with Nippostrongylus brasiliensis larvae, the frequency of Fc epsilon R+ cells in splenic non-B, non-T cells was also 1 to 2% but in bone marrow from anti-IgD-injected mice donors the frequency was approximately 5%.
 Cell sorting experiments revealed that all of the capacity to produce IL-4 in response to immobilized IgE or IgG2a or to ionomycin was found in the Fc epsilon R+ fraction.
 Among the Fc epsilon R+ spleen cells from naive donors, the frequency of IL-4-producing cells was 1/20 to 1/40 whereas in mice that had been injected with anti-IgD or infected with N.
 brasiliensis, the frequency of IL-4 producing cells in the Fc epsilon R+ population was approximately 1/5.
