Bacterial infections in patients with visceral leishmaniasis.
 Bacterial infections are often seen in patients with visceral leishmaniasis.
 To determine the incidence of such infection and the more common infectious agents, 30 consecutive patients with visceral leishmaniasis were followed throughout hospitalization.
 There were 24 episodes of bacterial infection in 18 patients (60%).
 The incidence of bacterial infections in these patients was 22.2/1000 days of admission.
 The proportion of patients becoming infected by time was significantly greater in the visceral leishmaniasis group than in controls (P less than .01).
 The skin, respiratory tract, and middle ear were the most common sites of infection, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus were the most common agents.
 Low-grade-virulence bacteria (e.g., Serratia and Providencia species) were also isolated from some cases.
 Bacterial infections (mainly nosocomial) in patients with visceral leishmaniasis tend to be severe and can cause death.
 When bacterial infection is suspected in these patients, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started immediately, including coverage for P.
 aeruginosa and S.
 aureus, after appropriate diagnostic procedures are taken.
