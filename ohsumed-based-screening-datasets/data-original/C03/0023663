Analysis of isotype-specific antifilarial antibody levels in a Haitian pediatric population.
 Previous studies of antifilarial antibodies in a pediatric population residing in an area with endemic Wuchereria bancrofti filariasis have demonstrated age related shifts in antifilarial immunity.
 To further characterize humoral responses in Haitian children, serum samples from 129 patients (3 months-15 years of age) were analyzed by ELISA for isotype-specific antifilarial antibody responses.
 Age-stratified analysis of geometric mean antibody titers showed significant increases in antibody titers of all isotypes with age in the amicrofilaremic population.
 Antifilarial IgG1, 2, and 3 levels were higher in amicrofilaremic children than in microfilaremic children, significantly so for IgG2 and IgG3.
 In contrast, IgG4 antibody levels were higher in microfilaremic subjects than in amicrofilaremic subjects.
 A multivariate, unconditional, logistic regression model was developed from these data to predict infection status.
 The model correctly classified 91.6% of the amicrofilaremic subjects, but only 55.6% of the microfilaremic subjects.
