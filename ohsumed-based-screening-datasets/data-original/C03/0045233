Radiologic findings of clonorchiasis.
 Clonorchiasis is a trematodiasis caused by chronic infestation of liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis.
 The adult flukes reside in the medium-sized and small intrahepatic bile ducts and, occasionally, in the extrahepatic bile ducts, gallbladder, and pancreatic duct.
 The result is mechanical obstruction, inflammatory reaction, adenomatous hyperplasia, and periductal fibrosis.
 Signs and symptoms are usually mild and nonspecific, but heavy infestation results in obstructive jaundice.
 The disease has a close relationship with recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma.
 In this article, the radiologic findings, including cholangiography, sonography, and CT of clonorchiasis are reviewed in light of the pathophysiology of the disease.
 The relationship to recurrent pyogenic cholangitis and to cholangiocarcinoma is discussed.
