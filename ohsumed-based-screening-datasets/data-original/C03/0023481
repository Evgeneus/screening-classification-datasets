Malaria.
 Human malaria is caused by four species of the genus plasmodium.
 The sexual stage of the parasite occurs in the mosquito and asexual reproduction occurs in man.
 Symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and myalgia result from the invasion and rupture of erythrocytes.
 Merozoites are released from erythrocytes and invade other cells, thus propagating the infection.
 The most vulnerable hosts are nonimmune travelers, young children living in the tropics, and pregnant women.
 P.
 falciparum causes the most severe infections because it infects RBCs of all ages and has the propensity to develop resistance to antimalarials.
 Rapid diagnosis can be made with a malarial smear, and treatment should be initiated promptly.
 In some regions (Mexico, Central America except Panama, and North Africa) chloroquine phosphate is effective therapy.
 In subsaharan Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia, chloroquine resistance has become widespread, and other antimalarials are necessary.
 The primary care physician should have a high index of suspicion for malaria in the traveler returning from the tropics.
 Malaria should also be suspected in the febrile transfusion recipient and newborns of mothers with malaria.
