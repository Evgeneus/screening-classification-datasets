Onchocerciasis in a California dog.
 A 15-year-old dog that had lived all of its life on ranches and at the Wildlife Waystation on the western edge of the San Gabriel mountains near Los Angeles, California, developed an extensive granulomatous lesion involving the right eye and associated tissues requiring removal of both the eye and the lesion.
 Microscopic examinations of the tissues revealed the presence of living and dead gravid female worms and male worms belonging to the genus Onchocerca.
 Unsheathed microfilariae presumed to be Onchocerca species were found in the skin as well.
 Because Onchocerca species are not natural parasites of dogs, it is presumed that this infection was acquired accidentally from bovine, equine, or other animal host sharing the environment.
 This appears to be the first published record of patent onchocerciasis in a dog.
