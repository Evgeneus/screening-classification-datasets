Experimental onchocerciasis in chimpanzees. Cell-mediated immune responses, and production and effects of IL-1 and IL-2 with Onchocerca volvulus infection.
 Nine of eighteen chimpanzees inoculated with infective third-stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus developed patent infection with microfilariae in skin biopsies.
 In all infected chimpanzees the in vitro cellular reactivity to O.
 volvulus adult worm-derived Ag (OvAg) increased significantly after exposure to third-stage larvae.
 However, during prepatency the in vitro cellular responses to OvAg decreased gradually in subsequently mf positive (patent) animals, and returned with patency to values not different to those before infection.
 In non-patent chimpanzees cellular responses remained significantly higher than before infection.
 Stimulation of PBMC in vitro with bacterial Ag and mitogen did not show any differences between the experimental groups through 20 months p.i.
 The addition of exogenous IL-2 did not restore the impaired responses of PBMC to OvAg in patent animals.
 Exogenous IL-2 elicited an additive increase of the cellular response to OvAg in nonpatent, and a mitogenic effect to OvAg in patent animals.
 Selective depletion of adherent, suppressor/cytotoxic (CD8+), NK cells (CD16+) and the use of autologous serum had no effect on antigenic and mitogenic cellular responsiveness.
 OvAg-induced IL-2 production decreased after patency, whereas, IL-1 production was significantly greater in both patent and nonpatent than in control chimpanzees.
 In summary, these data demonstrate that experimental O.
 volvulus infection in chimpanzees stimulated a substantial cell-mediated immune response.
 In patent chimpanzees an OvAg-specific cellular hyporesponsiveness occurred before onset of patency, possibly due to decreased IL-2 production and responsiveness.
