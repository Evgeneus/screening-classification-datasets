Cerebral sparganosis: case report and review.
 Sparganosis is a rare infection caused by a tapeworm larva from the genus Spirometra.
 A 21-year-old Indian man presented with an 18-month history of episodic confusion followed by a grand mal seizure.
 Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain confirmed the presence of a lesion of the left occipital lobe.
 Subsequent stereotactic biopsy revealed a plerocercoid larva or sparganum.
 Surgical resection resulted in cure.
 This case prompted a review of the literature on central nervous system sparganosis.
 Altogether, 17 other cases of primary cerebral sparganosis have been reported previously.
 Seizures, headache, and focal neurologic signs are common at presentation.
 Neuroradiologic imaging is sensitive but not specific for the identification of lesions.
 Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of cerebrospinal fluid or serum may be diagnostically helpful.
 However, the diagnosis is generally made after surgical resection, which is usually curative.
