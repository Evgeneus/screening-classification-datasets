Coexistence of GP195 alleles of Plasmodium falciparum in a small endemic area.
 Dimorphic variations in the genotype of the precursor to Plasmodium falciparum major merozoite surface antigens or gp195, among wild isolates in a small malaria parasite population were examined using Southern blot hybridization techniques.
 Hybridization, with DNA fragment probes and oligonucleotide probes derived from variable blocks of known gp195 alleles against 18 wild isolates from Mae Sod district in Thailand, revealed the existence of seven gp195 alleles, two of which were newly identified in this study.
 In four out of 17 patients, two different alleles coexisted in the circulation.
 It was furthermore noted that the seven alleles did not occur at the same frequency, but rather several alleles predominated in the population of P.
 falciparum in this small malaria field.
