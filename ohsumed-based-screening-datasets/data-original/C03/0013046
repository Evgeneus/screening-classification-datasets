Eosinophilic ascites due to hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis.
 We report the case of a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis, new onset ascites, and hyperinfection with Strongyloides stercoralis who had significant eosinophilia of the peritoneal fluid.
 The eosinophilia resolved with treatment of the S.
 stercoralis infection, and did not recur during two subsequent episodes of ascites and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
 Eosinophilic ascites is rare in parasitic infection, but it has been described in a variety of disorders which are discussed.
