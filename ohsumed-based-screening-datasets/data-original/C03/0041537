Standard and reduced doses of mefloquine for treatment of Plasmodium falciparum in Tanzania: whole blood concentrations in relation to adverse reactions, in vivo response, and in vitro susceptibility.
 Fifty-three asymptomatic Tanzanian school children with 400-31,000 asexual Plasmodium falciparum parasites/microliter of blood were given standard, one-half, one-quarter, or one-eighth of the recommended mefloquine treatment dose of 25 mg base/kg body weight.
 Mefloquine and main metabolite concentrations were determined in 100 microliters of capillary blood using a high performance liquid chromatographic method.
 In the standard, one-half, and one-quarter dose groups, all children cleared the parasites within three days after treatment.
 Reappearance was noted in one of the children in the one-quarter dose group during 49-56 days of followup.
 Among the children given one-eighth of a dose, two had an RII response and four had an RI response with early recrudescence.
 All 24-hour in vitro micro-tests (n = 30) showed full susceptibility for mefloquine.
 Adverse gastrointestinal reactions were reported by eight children on the first day after treatment, four of whom had been given a standard dose.
 These children had higher mefloquine concentrations one day after treatment than the other children in this group (P less than 0.05).
 In the standard dose group (n = 13), the area under the curve of capillary whole blood concentrations of mefloquine versus time was 52.4-112.1 mumol/liter x days.
 The highest concentration on day 1 was 2.75-7.20 mumol/liter and the median terminal half-life was 17.4 days.
 The highest concentrations of the main metabolite were observed 1-2 weeks after treatment and the median half-life was 18.9 days.
 The concentrations in the other groups were approximately proportional to those in the standard dose group both for mefloquine and the metabolite.
