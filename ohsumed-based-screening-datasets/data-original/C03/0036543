Results of a preventive program for congenital toxoplasmosis.
 All pregnant women followed during the period 1982-87 were screened for toxoplasmosis, and 35 patients had documented seroconversion or doubtful toxoplasmosis titers.
 One patient opted for pregnancy termination.
 The remaining were followed with a protocol that included serial ultrasound examinations and prophylactic antibiotic treatment of the mother and neonate.
 No fetal abnormalities related to congenital toxoplasmosis were found.
 All the infants had negative toxoplasmosis test titers at birth; at follow-up only one was found to have developed a subclinical infection, at 2 months of age.
 Our data suggest that antiparasitic treatment during pregnancy for those at risk for Toxoplasma infection may reduce the transmission rate.
