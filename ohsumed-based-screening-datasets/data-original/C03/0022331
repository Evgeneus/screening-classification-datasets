Therapy for acute infectious diarrhea in children.
 This article reviews current recommendations of therapy with antidiarrheal compounds and antimicrobial agents for acute infectious diarrhea in children.
 In most infants and children with acute infectious diarrhea, treatment with antidiarrheal compounds is not indicated.
 Many of these compounds interfere with identification of enteropathogens in stool specimens, and the antimotility class has an overdose potential.
 Antimicrobial therapy is given to reduce symptoms and to prevent the spread of infection by decreasing fecal shedding of organisms.
 Although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, Cryptosporidium, and Microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of Escherichia coli diarrhea and Salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis.
 For several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with Campylobacter jejuni or Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic E.
 coli infection).
 Compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects.
 Many bacterial, viral, and parasitic organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen.
 In children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy.
