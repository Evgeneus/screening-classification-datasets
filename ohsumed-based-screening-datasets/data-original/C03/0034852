Polyclonal B-lymphocyte stimulation in human malaria and its association with ongoing parasitemia.
 To study the polyclonal B-lymphocyte stimulation or activation (PBA) phenomenon in human malaria, the numbers of immunoglobulin (G, A, and M)-secreting cells in the peripheral blood, serum levels of immunoglobulins, and the presence of antibodies directed against the DNA-autoantigen were evaluated in Plasmodium falciparum- and P.
 vivax-infected individuals.
 Individuals chronically exposed to the risk of infection or non-immune subjects who contracted malaria during first visits to endemic areas were studied.
 Numbers of immunoglobulin-secreting cells (IgSC) were increased dependent upon ongoing parasitemia.
 Levels of IgG and the anti-DNA activity were also augmented in malarious individuals from the endemic area.
 Study of the kinetics of PBA done in treated patients showed that PBA decreased during treatment and disappeared 5-15 days after the start of chemotherapy.
