Office dermatologic testing: the scabies preparation.
 Patients with scabies may present with urticarial, eczematous or excoriated papules, eczematous patches or, occasionally, nodules.
 It is often difficult to differentiate scabies from eczema, folliculitis, drug eruption or lichen planus.
 The classically described burrows are often not seen.
 The scabies preparation, as described in this article, will aid in making the proper diagnosis.
