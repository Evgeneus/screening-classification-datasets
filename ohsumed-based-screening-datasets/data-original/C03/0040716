Eyelid leishmaniasis in a patient with neurogenic ptosis.
 A patient with chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis of the upper eyelid.
 Infection of this site is rare because eyelid movements usually prevent the sandfly vector from biting the skin there.
 It is postulated that the relative immobility of the upper eyelid in this patient was a major predisposing factor for the infection.
