Phagocytosis of Leishmania enhances macrophage activation by IFN-gamma and lipopolysaccharide.
 This investigation describes the ability of Leishmania promastigotes to enhance activation of bone marrow-derived murine macrophages in vitro if added together with rIFN-gamma in the presence or absence of LPS.
 Activation was defined as the capacity for arginine-derived NO2- production and the killing of intracellular Leishmania.
 Enhanced NO2- production was observed for either CBA or C3H/HeJ macrophages undergoing phagocytosis at the time of activation.
 Other phagocytic stimuli including inert polystyrene latex beads were as effective as Leishmania.
 No correlation could be demonstrated between the enhanced NO2- release and secretion of products of the respiratory burst or PGE2.
 However, TNF-alpha secretion was elevated in cultures undergoing phagocytosis and a relationship between hexosemonophosphate shunt activity and NO2- levels was evident.
 These studies confirm and extend previous reports that phagocytosis plays an important role in the regulation of macrophage physiology.
