Diagnosis of human African trypanosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis based on the detection of anti-parasite-enzyme antibodies.
 A sensitive diagnostic assay for parasitic infections based on the detection of anti-enzyme antibodies is presented.
 All serum antibodies produced in response to parasite antigens are immobilized via their Fc domain on matrix-bound protein G.
 Incubation of the immobilized antibodies with saturating amounts of parasite extract results in the binding of all recognized antigens, including those directed against a specific and readily measurable enzyme.
 The amount of bound enzyme is proportional to the anti-enzyme antibody concentration in the serum.
 The application of this principle is demonstrated for the diagnosis of both human African trypanosomiasis and visceral leishmaniasis by the detection of antibodies against parasite acid phosphatases.
