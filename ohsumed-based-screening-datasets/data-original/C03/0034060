Disseminated strongyloidiasis in AIDS: uncommon but important.
 Disseminated Strongyloides stercoralis infection is a rare and severe but treatable complication of AIDS.
 We present a case where this infection was successfully treated and review the available literature.
 Cases may present many years after they have left an area endemic for Strongyloides infection, emphasizing the need for a full travel history.
 Symptoms are typically gastrointestinal and pulmonary, with infiltrates often seen on chest radiography.
 Diagnosis requires stool examination and biopsy of affected sites.
 Treatment with repeated courses of thiabendazole (25 mg/kg twice daily for 5 days) was successful in our case, but maintenance regimens have not yet been defined.
 The relative rarity of this complication of AIDS suggests that, where both infections are present, disseminated strongyloidiasis only arises either when HIV-induced immunodeficiency is profound or, possibly, when it is accompanied by impaired granulopoiesis.
