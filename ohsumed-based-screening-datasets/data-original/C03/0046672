Reduction in the number of UCHL-1+ cells and IL-2 production in the peripheral blood of patients with visceral leishmaniasis.
 PBMC from patients with visceral leishmaniasis (VL), before and after successful antimony therapy, were analyzed for their phenotypes and for their ability to produce IL-2 and IFN-gamma and to proliferate against PHA and leishmanial Ag.
 In agreement with results of earlier studies, PBMC from active VL patients showed a markedly reduced proliferative response and IL-2 and IFN-gamma production, compared with those of healthy controls.
 The levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were within the normal range, but there was a significant decrease in UCHL-1+ cells (helper-inducer), compared with healthy individuals.
 The inhibited cellular responses, and lymphokine secretion and decreased level of UCHL-1+ cells in the PBMC of the VL patients returned to the normal range after successful chemotherapy.
 PBMC from active VL patients were fractionated into adherent cells and nonadherent cells, and the non-adherent were further fractionated into UCHL-1+ and UCHL-1- subpopulations.
 Results from cell depletion and reconstitution experiments suggest that the IL-2 production by nonadherent cells stimulated with PHA was inhibited by adherent cells, but the IL-2 production by nonadherent cells in response to specific Ag was not.
 In contrast, UCHL-1- cells seem to mediate the inhibition of Ag-driven IL-2 production by nonadherent cells but not mitogen-stimulated IL-2 secretion by nonadherent cells.
 Ag-specific IL-2 production principally involves UCHL-1+ cells.
