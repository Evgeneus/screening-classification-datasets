Rosette formation by Plasmodium coatneyi-infected red blood cells.
 Animal models are needed for the study of cytoadherence in falciparum malaria.
 Red blood cell (RBC) rosette formation is one type of cytoadherence and appears to be associated with knob formation, endothelial cell adhesion and sequestration of Plasmodium-infected RBCs.
 Since Plasmodium coatneyi-infected RBCs develop knobs and sequester, we hypothesized that they also form rosettes.
 RBCs from P.
 coatneyi-infected rhesus monkeys (Macaca-mulatta) were collected, allowed to mature overnight in vitro and found to form rosettes as hypothesized.
 This observation adds to the known falciparum-like characteristics of P.
 coatneyi, and suggests that the Macaca mulatta-P.
 coatneyi model may be appropriate for pathophysiologic studies of cytoadherence.
