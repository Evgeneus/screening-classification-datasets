Renal pathology in Saimiri monkeys during a vaccine trial using the recombinant circumsporozoite protein of Plasmodium vivax.
 Renal specimens of squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus boliviensis) were studied by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry to examine the pathologic changes during vaccine trials with four recombinant circumsporozoite (CS) proteins (rPvCS-1, rPvCS-2, rPvCS-3, NS1(81) V20) of Plasmodium vivax.
 The monkeys were vaccinated and later challenged with P.
 vivax sporozoites.
 Among the 33 posttrial biopsies, 17 had mild to moderate mesangial proliferation and nine had interstitial nephritis.
 Immunohistochemistry by the peroxidase-antiperoxidase (PAP) method revealed IgG deposits in only three of 24 specimens and failed to demonstrate C3 deposits and P.
 vivax antigens in their glomeruli.
 There was no relationship between the severity of nephropathy and intensity of parasitemia.
 The intensity of parasitemia was the same in the vaccinated and control groups.
 Vaccinated monkeys from the groups (rPvCS-1, rPvCs-2, rPvCS-3) had no differences in renal pathology from the unvaccinated controls, but one group vaccinated with NS1(81) V20 did not develop renal changes.
