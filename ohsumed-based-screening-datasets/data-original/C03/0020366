Mucin and nonmucin secretagogue activity of Entamoeba histolytica and cholera toxin in rat colon.
 Depletion of colonic mucus occurs before invasion of the colonic mucosa by Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites.
 It is hypothesized that E.
 histolytica releases a mucus secretagogue; this was studied in a rat colonic loop model.
 In colonic loops exposed to live amebae, mucus secretion was quantitated by release of acid-precipitable [3H]glucosamine-labeled luminal glycoprotein and by specific immunoassay.
 Mucus secretion increased in dose-dependent fashion in response to greater than or equal to 1 X 10(5) trophozoites; cholera toxin (20 micrograms per loop), a known mucus secretagogue, elicited a similar response.
 Thin-section histological analysis of amebae and cholera toxin-exposed loops showed increased mucus release and streaming from mucosal goblet cells with cellular cavitation compared with control loops.
 Sepharose-4B chromatography of amebae and cholera toxin-stimulated glycoproteins demonstrated secretion of mucins and an 80%-90% increase in low-molecular-weight proteins.
 E.
 histolytica trophozoites and cholera toxin enhanced the secretion of preformed and newly synthesized mucin glycoproteins and stimulated colonic glycoprotein synthesis.
 The level of mucus secretion elicited by axenic E.
 histolytica strains correlated with their virulence in vivo and in vitro.
 The amebic secretagogue was released into the culture medium and was heat stable.
 Mucus secretagogue activity of E.
 histolytica may contribute to depletion or alteration of the protective mucus blanket, facilitating pathogenesis of invasive amebiasis.
