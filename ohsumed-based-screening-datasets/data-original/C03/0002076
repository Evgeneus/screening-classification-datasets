Disseminated strongyloidiasis in AIDS and non-AIDS immunocompromised hosts: diagnosis by sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage.
 In conclusion, disseminated strongyloidiasis is a fatal disease that commonly affects the lungs.
 The disease should be suspected in an immunocompromised host who came from an area endemic for S stercoralis even years before the onset of symptoms or in patients with unexplained gram-negative bacteremia or meningitis.
 Treatment should be started promptly and should be maintained for a long time.
