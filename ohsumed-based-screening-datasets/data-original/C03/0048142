Treatment with quinidine gluconate of persons with severe Plasmodium falciparum infection: discontinuation of parenteral quinine from CDC Drug Service.
 CDC has recently reviewed data on the reported incidence in the United States of Plasmodium falciparum malaria and has evaluated available information on the effective management of severe life-threatening infections.
 As a result of this review, CDC has concluded that the therapeutic drug of choice in the United States for persons with complicated P.
 falciparum infection is parenteral quinidine gluconate, and that stocking of parenteral quinine dihydrochloride for emergency distribution is no longer required to provide optimal management of P.
 falciparum infections.
