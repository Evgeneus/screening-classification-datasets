Endogenous interferon-gamma, macrophage activation, and murine host defense against acute infection with Trypanosoma cruzi.
 Parenteral interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) activates murine macrophages to inhibit Trypanosoma cruzi multiplication and diminishes parasitemia and mortality in acute infection.
 To investigate the role of endogenous IFN-gamma in acute infection, monoclonal antibody to IFN-gamma was injected intraperitoneally into mice.
 The 6250 neutralizing units given 24 and 96 h after infection reproducibly increased mortality (P less than .05).
 Histology sections showed markedly more nests of T.
 cruzi in treated mice.
 BALB/c, Swiss Webster, C57Bl/6, and C3H/HEN mice were susceptible to the effects of anti-IFN-gamma.
 Peritoneal macrophages from mice 4 days after infection and a single dose of 6250 units of anti-IFN-gamma had significantly reduced ability to inhibit T.
 cruzi multiplication.
 Multiple doses of anti-IFN-gamma delayed but did not prevent macrophage activation.
 These results indicate the critical role of endogenous IFN-gamma for macrophage activation and host defense against acute T.
