An immunogenic Onchocerca volvulus antigen: a specific and early marker of infection.
 Onchocerciasis (river blindness) is a serious health problem and a severe obstacle to social and economic development, especially in Africa.
 A complementary DNA fragment coding for an Onchocerca volvulus antigen (OV-16) was cloned and expressed in the plasmid vector pCG808fx.
 Immune responses to this O.
 volvulus-specific recombinant antigen were detectable in patients with documented onchocerciasis; the antibody response was also detectable at 3 months and at more than 1 year before infection could otherwise be detected in humans and in chimpanzees experimentally infected with O.
 volvulus third-stage larvae.
