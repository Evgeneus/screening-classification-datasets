Disseminated strongyloidiasis with central nervous system involvement diagnosed antemortem in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Burkitts lymphoma.
 A 45-year-old man presented with central nervous system involvement as the initial manifestation of disseminated infection with Strongyloides stercoralis.
 Several concurrent clinical factors contributed to this event, all related to the patient's immunosuppression, including high-grade lymphoma, corticosteroid therapy, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 This is only the third case of CNS involvement in disseminated strongyloidiasis diagnosed antemortem.
