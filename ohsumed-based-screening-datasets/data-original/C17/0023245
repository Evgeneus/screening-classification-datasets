The effectiveness of the hair-restorer "Dabao" in males with alopecia androgenetica. A clinical experiment.
 In a randomized, double-blind trial the effectiveness of 6 months' use of a Chinese herb extract (Dabao) as a hair-restorer was studied on 396 males with alopecia androgenetica.
 The effect was evaluated by nonvellus hair counts, participants' opinions and a panel's judgement of a photo-report.
 Twenty-three participants withdrew prematurely from the study.
 In both the Dabao and placebo groups an increase in the amount of hair was observed; 133 and 109 hairs on a 5 cm2 marked area, a difference of 24 hairs (p = 0.03, one-sided).
 Participants as well as the panel reached a similar conclusion.
 Regarding cosmetic effect, 42% of the participants in the Dabao group and 37% in the placebo group reported positive results.
 The average panel score for the cosmetic result on a scale of -10 to +10 was 0.46 in the Dabao and 0.21 in the placebo group, a difference of 0.24 (p = 0.04, one-sided).
 It appears from our study that, although the cosmetic effect over 6 months is modest, Dabao does have a certain effect on the growth of nonvellus hair.
