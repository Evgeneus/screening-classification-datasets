Determination of released CD4 and CD8 antigens in the suction-blister fluid and horny-tissue extract in patients with psoriasis.
 The amounts of soluble CD4 and CD8 antigens were measured in suction-blister fluid and extracts of horny tissue in patients with psoriasis.
 The levels of soluble CD4 and CD8 in the suction-blister fluid of lesional skin in psoriasis was significantly higher than from normal skin and the uninvolved skin in psoriasis.
 Levels of soluble CD4 and CD8 in the extracts of horny tissue in psoriasis were significantly higher than those from non-psoriatic skin.
