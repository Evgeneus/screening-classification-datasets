Necrolytic migratory erythema: dyskeratotic dermatitis, a clue to early diagnosis.
 A 57-year-old woman with a 6-year history of a dermatitis that evolved into typical necrolytic migratory erythema is reported.
 Four biopsy specimens were obtained in 5 years.
 The early lesions revealed superficial perivascular inflammation in the dermis, minor epidermal spongiosis, and scattered dyskeratotic cells in the upper epidermis.
 The differential diagnosis of this pattern of dyskeratotic dermatitis, particularly in a chronic eruption, should include consideration of hyperglucagonemia and the possibility of an associated pancreatic islet cell tumor.
