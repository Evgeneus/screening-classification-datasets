Cyclosporin A suppresses ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelium in healing psoriatic plaques.
 To analyze the mode of action of Cyclosporin A (CsA) in psoriasis, we examined the phenotypic profile of resident and passenger skin cells in seven psoriatic patients before and after 2 weeks of CsA treatment using a large panel of monoclonal antibodies in a three-step immunoperoxidase technique.
 For comparison, skin biopsies from psoriatic patients receiving psoralen + UVA (PUVA) therapy were examined.
 Although both treatment protocols were equally effective in inducing resolution of psoriatic lesions, the phenotypic changes induced by CsA differed greatly from those seen after PUVA.
 In CsA-treated patients there was a dramatic reduction in the ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells, but density, pattern, and phenotype of infiltrating inflammatory cells remained essentially unchanged.
 In contrast, PUVA therapy had no visible effect on ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells, but resulted in a significant reduction of the hemopoietic resident and infiltrating mononuclear cells within the epidermis.
 These results favor, but do not prove, the assumption that the CsA regimen chosen in this study exerts its anti-psoriatic effect primarily at the level of the keratinocyte, i.e., by inhibiting events leading to keratinocyte proliferation as well as by interfering with the secretion of mediators responsible for ICAM-1 expression by papillary endothelial cells.
