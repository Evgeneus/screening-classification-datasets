Membranous lipodystrophy: MR imaging appearance of the brain.
 Five patients with membranous lipodystrophy (lipomembranous polycystic osteodysplasia with progressive dementia) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain.
 T2-weighted MR images showed atrophied cerebral white matter with dilated ventricles; increased signal intensity of the white matter; and decreased signal intensity of the thalamus, putamen, caudate nucleus, and cerebral cortex.
 Although each single finding is not specific, the combination of the above MR findings when coupled with skeletal lesions strongly suggests this rare disease.
