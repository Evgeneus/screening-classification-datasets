Toxicity profiles of disease modifying antirheumatic drugs in rheumatoid arthritis.
 The toxicity profiles of 7 disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD) (hydroxychloroquine, intramuscular (im) gold, D-penicillamine, oral gold, methotrexate (MTX), azathioprine and cyclophosphamide) were evaluated in 2,479 patients with rheumatoid arthritis consecutively enrolled at 5 centers in the Arthritis, Rheumatism and Aging Medical Information System (ARAMIS) program.
 Incidence rates for side effects are reported as events/1000 patient-years.
 Our descriptive study revealed an individual profile of prevalent toxicities for each drug.
 Oral gold was characterized by substantial lower gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity (diarrhea 391 events/1000 patient-years, loose bowel movement 148, lower abdominal pain 76), MTX by hepatotoxicity (47) while D-penicillamine had the only clinically significant incidence of altered taste (40).
 MTX users reported the most mucosal ulcers (87), followed by oral gold (76), im gold (55) and D-penicillamine (38).
 Rash was frequently seen with gold compounds and D-penicillamine, while upper GI toxicity was common with immunosuppressive agents.
 Cyclophosphamide had 48% discontinuations within 6 months.
 MTX had the lowest discontinuation rate in the first 6 months, but then showed little difference from im gold.
 A preliminary similarity index was developed to compare the toxicity profiles of various DMARD.
 Close similarities were found between toxicity profiles of im gold and D-penicillamine, and between azathioprine and MTX.
 Oral gold had a unique toxicity pattern.
 Knowledge of these different toxicity patterns can enable more appropriate selection of agents for particular patients.
