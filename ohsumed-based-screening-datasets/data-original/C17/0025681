Possible Behcet's disease revealed by pulmonary aneurysms.
 Behcet's disease (BD) is a multisystem disease which may affect many organ systems in addition to the originally described triple symptom complex.
 Pulmonary aneurysm is one of the rare complications of the disease.
 We report a case of bilateral pulmonary aneurysm in which usual criteria for the clinical diagnosis of BD were absent and we believe that pulmonary aneurysm could be the first appearance of the disease.
