Androgen replacement therapy in male patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 A hypogonadic condition characterized by low serum testosterone levels has been identified in male patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
 Seven men with active RA were treated daily for 6 months with oral testosterone undecanoate plus a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug in an attempt to evaluate the immunologic response, the overall clinical response, and the sex hormone response to such replacement therapy.
 At the end of the 6 months, there was a significant increase in serum testosterone levels (P less than 0.05), an increase in the number of CD8+ T cells, and a decrease in the CD4+:CD8+ T cell ratio.
 The IgM rheumatoid factor concentration decreased significantly (P less than 0.05).
 There was a concurrent significant reduction in the number of affected joints (P less than 0.05) and in the daily intake of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (P less than 0.01).
 The well-known immunosuppressive action of androgens probably contributed to our findings in these RA patients.
