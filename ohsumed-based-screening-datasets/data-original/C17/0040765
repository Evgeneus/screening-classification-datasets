Epidemiology of chronic venous ulcers.
 A metropolitan population of 238,000 in Perth, Western Australia, was screened for chronic ulceration of the leg.
 Patients with a chronic leg ulcer and a venous abnormality comprised 57 per cent of all patients with a chronic leg ulcer, giving a prevalence of 0.62 per 1000 population.
 There was an increasing prevalence with age; 90 per cent of patients were 60 years and older.
 This group comprised 16.7 per cent of the population, and had a prevalence of 3.3 per 1000.
 Although chronic venous ulcers were more common in women there was no difference in age related prevalence.
 In 36 per cent of patients with a venous abnormality, there was at least one other aetiological factor contributing to chronic ulceration of the leg; 96 per cent had either a history of deep venous thrombosis or a condition known to predispose to deep venous thrombosis.
