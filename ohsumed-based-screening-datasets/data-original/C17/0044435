Air esophagogram and intestinal pseudoocclusion in a patient with scleroderma.
 Air in the esophagus is unusual because it is collapsible.
 Its finding on a chest roentgenogram, particularly when not associated with a fluid level indicative of stricture, should strongly suggest systemic sclerosis (scleroderma).
 We describe a patient with scleroderma with intestinal pseudoocclusion and an air esophagogram.
 Study of chest roentgenograms of 83 patients with scleroderma, including those of 7 with pseudoocclusion, revealed no other instance of air esophagogram.
 This radiological sign, although rare, should suggest scleroderma and may be particularly useful in patients with "systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma.".
