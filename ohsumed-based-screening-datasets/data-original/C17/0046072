Severe rheumatoid arthritis: current options in drug therapy.
 Therapeutic advances have been made in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), but patients (and sometimes physicians) may become frustrated at the apparent lack of breakthrough treatments.
 The latest advances in the treatment of severe RA are discussed, along with what investigators are using experimentally both in combination with other drugs and alone to treat RA now and, possibly, in the future.
 These agents include methotrexate, cyclosporine, gamma-interferon, and omega-3 fatty acids.
