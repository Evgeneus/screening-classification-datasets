Panniculitis in an immunocompromised patient.
 We present a patient in whom histoplasmosis panniculitis developed during steroid therapy for pancytopenia secondary to myelodysplasia.
 Although the cutaneous manifestations of disseminated histoplasmosis are rare, we review them because of the increasing numbers of organ-transplant patients, as well as other patients with immunodeficiency, including acquired immune deficiency syndrome, in whom the risk of this unusual presentation of histoplasmosis must be considered.
