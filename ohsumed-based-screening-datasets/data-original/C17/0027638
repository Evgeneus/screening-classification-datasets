Juvenile spring eruption of the ears: a probable variant of polymorphic light eruption.
 We report 18 cases in which a pruritic, erythematous, papular and vesicular eruption developed on the ears following sun exposure.
 Four of these patients had, on other occasions, suffered from typical polymorphic light eruption.
 The clinical features, histological changes, and results of phototesting suggest that juvenile spring eruption of the ears is a localized form of polymorphic light eruption.
