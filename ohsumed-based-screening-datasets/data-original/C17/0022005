Treatment of psoriasis with piritrexim, a lipid-soluble folate antagonist 
 Methotrexate is an effective and convenient treatment for severe psoriasis whose use is limited by the development of hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis in a small number of patients.
 The mechanism of hepatotoxicity is unknown, but it is believed to be the result of intracellular polyglutamation and prolonged retention of methotrexate within the cell.
 Piritrexim isethionate is a lipid-soluble antifolate that has a mechanism of action similar to that of methotrexate.
 Since it is not polyglutamated, piritrexim could be effective in the treatment of psoriasis without the associated long-term hepatotoxicity.
 A 12-week phase I/II clinical trial of severe chronic plaque psoriasis assessed the safety and efficacy of oral piritrexim therapy.
 Based on experience gained from oncologic trials, each patient received a twice-daily dosage for 5 consecutive days every 2 weeks.
 Dosages ranged from 25 to 100 mg twice a day.
 Improvement in both lesion scores and percentage of body involvement was significant at a dose of 50 mg or more twice daily.
 Fifteen of 19 patients who completed 12 weeks of therapy demonstrated greater than 50% improvement in lesion scores.
 Improvement was limited by recrudescence of lesions over the 9-day rest period.
 Adverse experiences were minimal and dose related.
 Piritrexim is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis.
