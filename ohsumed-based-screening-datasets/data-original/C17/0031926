Bone-marrow transplantation for congenital erythropoietic porphyria.
 Congenital erythropoietic porphyria, a disorder of haem synthesis, is caused by uroporphyrinogen III synthase deficiency in bone-marrow normoblasts.
 Uroporphyrins and coproporphyrins accumulate and cause oxidative damage to cells exposed to sunlight.
 Uroporphyrin overproduction was greatly reduced and skin changes reversed in a girl who received a bone-marrow graft from an HLA-identical sibling at 10 years of age.
 The patient died 11 months after transplantation because of severe progressive pneumonitis and encephalopathy associated with cytomegalovirus infection, but the encouraging response up to 8 months after engraftment indicates a possible benefit of bone-marrow transplantation in the treatment of this rare but usually fatal inherited disease.
