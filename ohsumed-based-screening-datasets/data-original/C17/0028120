Posterior occipitocervical fusion. A preliminary report of a new technique.
 A new technique for occipitocervical fusion is described.
 The fixation of the upper cervical spine with plates and screws avoids the possible disadvantages of the commonly used wiring technique.
 By the establishment of a rigid fixation between the occiput and upper cervical spine with a combination of plates and screws, especially with transarticular atlantoaxial screw fixation, reliable, multidirectional, and immediate stability is achieved.
 The clinical picture and analysis of 14 patients with a variety of pathologies of the upper cervical spine is presented.
 The satisfactory outcome and solid bony fusion in all 14 patients and the absence of severe complications encourages the continued use of this technique of occipitocervical fusion.
