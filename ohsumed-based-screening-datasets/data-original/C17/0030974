Nongenital warts: classification and treatment options.
 Common, plantar and flat warts are the primary classes of nongenital warts.
 Although spontaneous remission does occur, all warts should be treated to avoid spreading.
 Common warts often develop in the periungual region of the fingers.
 This type of wart generally can be removed with cryotherapy, topical application of salicylic acid or occlusive taping.
 Plantar warts are found over pressure points of the heel or metatarsal heads.
 They are also treated with cryotherapy or salicylic acid.
 Flat warts are commonly seen on the dorsum of the hands or on the face.
 These warts are best treated with topical retinoids.
 Immunotherapies are being developed.
