Human papillomavirus segregation patterns in genital and nongenital warts in prepubertal children and adults.
 This study compared the segregation patterns of human papillomavirus (HPV) in genital and nongenital warts in prepubertal children and adults.
 HPV 2 was detected in most nongenital warts in children and adults, whereas neither HPV 6 or 11 was detected at nongenital sites in either group with the use of in situ or Southern blot hybridization analyses.
 Of nine genital tract lesions in children.
 HPV 2 was detected in two and HPV 6 or 11 in six.
 More than 90% of cases of regional tract condylomata in adults contained HPV 6 or 11.
 HPV 2 was not detected in any of 99 genital tract lesions in adults.
 It is concluded that HPV 6/11 cannot proliferate at nongenital cutaneous sites and HPV 2 can proliferate in the genital tract of children but not adults.
 Thus, the detection of HPV 6 or 11 in a genital wart in a child implies, assuming cutaneous transmission, infection from a genital site, whereas the detection of HPV 2 presumes nongenital transmission.
