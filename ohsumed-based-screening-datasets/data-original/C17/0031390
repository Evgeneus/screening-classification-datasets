Allergic contact dermatitis from eosin.
 Before 1960, eosin sensitivity was not rare and lipstick cheilitis was very common.
 We report 4 patients seen in 1988 and 1989 who were sensitized to eosin from topical bacteriostatic preparations.
 All 4 patients had positive patch tests to eosin.
 The allergen is probably an impurity rather than eosin itself.
