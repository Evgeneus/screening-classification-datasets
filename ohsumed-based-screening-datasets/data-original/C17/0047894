Expression of the interleukin 6 gene in rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts.
 A number of fibroblastoid synovial cell lines have been established from rheumatoid joints.
 These cell lines were shown to express the interleukin 6 (IL-6) gene constitutively, and exposure of these cells to 5 ng/ml of recombinant human interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) increased IL-6 gene expression.
 Other recombinant human lymphokines, namely interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor had no enhancing effect on IL-6 gene expression.
 Dexamethasone added to the cultures at 10(-7) M concentration suppressed the constitutive expression of the IL-6 gene.
 At a concentration of 10(-5) M, dexamethasone partially suppressed the IL-1 enhanced expression of IL-6.
 The IL-6 gene probe also hybridized to RNA from unfractionated synovial fluid cells, peripheral blood T cells and non-T cells but not Epstein-Barr virus transformed peripheral blood B cells of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 Our results suggest that in rheumatoid arthritis, synovial fibroblasts actively participate in joint inflammation by lymphokine production.
 The coexpression of both IL-1 and IL-6 by one synovial fibroblast line suggests a mechanism for the perpetuation of synovitis.
