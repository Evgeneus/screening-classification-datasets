Skin ultrasound in dermatologic surgical planning.
 High-resolution ultrasonography was performed on 55 patients with palpable skin lesions, all submitted to surgical excision and to histologic diagnosis.
 In all the cases, the ultrasound picture was confirmed by the surgical appearance of the lesions.
 The sonographic structure was characteristic in the case of cysts and angiomas, lymphangiomas in particular.
 Ultrasonography is considered a simple and reliable technique for the pre-operative evaluation of skin nodules, as it gives a clear picture of their size, depth, and outline.
 However, sonography cannot substitute for the clinical dermatologic approach and the need for an histologic diagnosis.
