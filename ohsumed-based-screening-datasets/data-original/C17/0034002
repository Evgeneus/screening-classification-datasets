Expression of large quantities of rheumatoid factor major cross-reactive idiotype in the serum of adults with seropositive rheumatoid arthritis.
 We quantified rheumatoid factor cross-reactive idiotype (RF-CRI) in whole serum from RF+ rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, using an inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay which is not affected by the presence of IgG.
 Serum from 16 RF+ RA patients contained 2-252 micrograms/ml RF-CRI (geometric mean */divided by SD 20.8 */divided by 5.2), while serum from 11 normal adults contained 1-16 micrograms/ml RF-CRI (geometric mean */divided by SD 3.9 */divided by 2.3).
 Serum from 8 of the RF+ RA patients contained RF-CRI at concentrations more than 2 standard deviations above the geometric mean in the normal subjects (greater than 21 micrograms/ml).
 Our results indicate that some RF+ RA patients express high concentrations of RF-RCRI and immunoglobulin molecules that express the RF-CRI may not be RF.
