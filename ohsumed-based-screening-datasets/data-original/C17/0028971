Oral melanoma and other pigmented lesions of the oral cavity.
 This article presents a review of oral malignant melanoma and other oral cavity pigmented lesions.
 The dismal prognosis for patients with oral malignant melanoma is partly due to patients' delayed recognition of signs of early disease and delayed diagnosis by physicians.
 Pigmented macules and plaques in the oral cavity, representing the radial growth phase of tumors, often go unrecognized for months or years before tumor invasion.
 Therefore, if early detection of thin oral melanomas is to be achieved, all pigmented oral cavity lesions should be viewed with suspicion.
 Biopsies of such lesions are indicated when the clinical diagnosis is uncertain.
 Prompt aggressive surgical treatment is essential in reducing the morbidity and mortality from oral melanomas.
 The differential diagnosis of oral melanomas includes nevi, oral melanotic macules, amalgam tattoos, Kaposi's sarcoma, oral melanoacanthoma, and physiologic pigmentation.
