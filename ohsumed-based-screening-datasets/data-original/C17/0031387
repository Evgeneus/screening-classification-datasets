The nickel content of certain commercially available metallic patch test materials and its relevance in nickel-sensitive subjects.
 The nickel contamination of the metallic patch test substances from 3 commercial sources was estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
 Contamination was generally greatest in the cobalt patch test substances.
 To determine whether the levels of contamination encountered were sufficient to produce a false positive patch test, 20 nickel-sensitive patients were patch tested to various concentrations of free elemental nickel in aqueous solution.
 The level of nickel contamination was less than that required to produce a false positive patch test in our patients, but was at a level which could produce false positive reactions in subjects highly sensitive to nickel.
