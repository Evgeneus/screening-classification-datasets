Adverse cutaneous reactions due to macrolides.
 Macrolides, which are widely prescribed and seldom produce hypersensitivity reactions, are considered to be safe drugs.
 We present five patients with generalized skin reactions due to erythromycin and/or spiramycin, proved by oral challenge tests.
 One patient showed reactions to both erythromycin and spiramycin.
 All skin prick and patch tests and histamine release tests with both macrolides were negative.
