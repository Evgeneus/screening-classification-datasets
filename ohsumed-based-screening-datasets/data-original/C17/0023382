Open preliminary clinical trial of clobetasol propionate ointment in adhesive paste for treatment of chronic oral vesiculoerosive diseases.
 Clobetasol propionate (Temovate), a novel high-potency topical corticosteroid, was used in open trial from 1987 to 1988 on 24 patients with persistent oral vesiculoerosive disease of at least 1 month's duration.
 Fourteen women and 10 men, ranging in age from 27 to 76 years (mean 48 years), participated.
 Nine patients had erosive lichen planus, one had benign mucous membrane pemphigoid, three had pemphigus vulgaris, seven had persistent major recurrent aphthous stomatitis, and four had chronic oral erythema multiforme.
 Fifteen patients had complete remission of signs and symptoms, seven had excellent response of signs and complete remission of symptoms, and two failed to respond.
 All other topical therapy was suspended before and during the study.
 All patients responded to two or three applications daily of medication.
 Side effects were minor and reversible, and included localized candidiasis (three patients), stomatopyrosis (two), and hypogeusia (one).
 Clobetasol propionate ointment in adhesive paste (Orabase) thus seems to be an effective topical steroid alternative to other less potent topical and systemic drugs for recalcitrant oral vesiculoerosive disease.
