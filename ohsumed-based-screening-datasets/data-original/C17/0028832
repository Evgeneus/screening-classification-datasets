Mastoid surgery in childhood.
 The presenting features and operative findings in 105 patients aged 16 years or less undergoing mastoid surgery are reviewed.
 In 94% surgery was for chronic otomastoiditis, usually acquired, and associated with cholesteatoma in 64%.
 Post-operative otorrhoea persisted beyond 6 months in 44% and contralateral disease required some form of surgical procedure in 20%.
 Post-operative hearing thresholds were improved or unchanged in the majority of patients, most of whom underwent cortical or modified radical mastoidectomy.
 An improvement in the therapeutic results of mastoid surgery in childhood is clearly necessary, but requires a greater understanding of the aetiology of chronic middle ear disease.
