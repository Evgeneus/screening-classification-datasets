Comparison of mometasone furoate 0.1% cream and hydrocortisone 1.0% cream in the treatment of childhood atopic dermatitis.
 We conducted a 6-week randomized, blinded study that compared mometasone furoate 0.1% cream, applied once daily, and hydrocortisone 1.0% cream, applied twice daily, in 48 children with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.
 Mometasone furoate, a moderate-potency steroid, produced significantly greater improvement than the low-potency hydrocortisone used twice daily.
 The difference in therapeutic response was particularly evident in patients with involvement of more than 25% of their body surface area.
 Morning plasma cortisol levels were assayed before treatment, after 1 week of therapy, and at the end of the clinical trial.
 Plasma cortisol levels were transiently suppressed in one child who was treated with hydrocortisone and in none of the children treated with mometasone.
