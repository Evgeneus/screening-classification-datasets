Marfan syndrome is closely linked to a marker on chromosome 15q1.5----q2.1.
 Marfan syndrome is a systemic disorder of the connective tissue inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.
 The disorder imparts significant morbidity and mortality.
 The etiology of the disorder remains elusive.
 A recent study localized the gene for Marfan syndrome on chromosome 15.
 We present data showing that marker D15S48 is genetically linked to Marfan syndrome.
 Pairwise linkage analysis gave a maximum lod (logarithm of odds) score of Z = 11.78 at theta = 0.02.
 Furthermore our data suggest that the Marfan syndrome locus is possibly flanked on either side by D15S48 and D15S49.
