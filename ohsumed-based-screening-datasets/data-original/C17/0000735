The Oxford knee replacement. A review from an independent centre.
 We present a study of 67 Oxford bicompartmental total knee replacements performed at a district general hospital.
 In this general orthopaedic unit, 57 of the knees (85%) had significant relief of pain with a mean flexion range of 95 degrees and a mean flexion deformity of only 9 degrees.
 There was a noticeable difference between osteoarthritic and rheumatoid knees.
 Poor results could be directly related to an avoidable postoperative complication.
 The results of this independent assessment may be compared favourably with the previously published series from the specialist centre at which the prosthesis was designed.
