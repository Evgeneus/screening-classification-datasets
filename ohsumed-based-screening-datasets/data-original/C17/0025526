An immunohistological study of desmosomes in Darier's disease and Hailey-Hailey disease.
 The immunocytochemical distribution of desmosomal components was determined in involved skin from eight patients with Darier's disease, five patients with Hailey-Hailey disease and two patients with transient acantholytic dermatosis as well as skin from four normal controls.
 Sections were stained using monoclonal antibodies to the desmosomal proteins dp1 and dp2 (desmoplakins) and the desmosomal glycoproteins dg1 (desmoglein), and dg2 and dg3 (desmocollins).
 There was normal expression of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins at the periphery of the keratinocytes in the perilesional skin in Darier's disease, in Hailey-Hailey disease and in transient acantholytic dermatosis.
 In the lesional skin there was reduced expression of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins in the basaloid 'buds' at the base of the lesions, but there was bright diffuse staining of the acantholytic cells.
 Focal intracellular staining was detected within many of the acantholytic keratinocytes in Hailey-Hailey disease and within some of these cells in Darier's disease.
 Suction blisters were used to induce fresh acantholysis in lesional skin in Darier's disease and clinically uninvolved skin in Hailey-Hailey disease.
 The results indicated that acantholysis precedes the development of intracellular staining.
 Although there are immunopathological abnormalities in the distribution of desmosomal proteins and glycoproteins in both Darier's disease and Hailey-Hailey disease, the changes are probably secondary to internalization of desmosomal components with breakdown and redistribution of antigens rather than a primary deficiency in the synthesis of these proteins.
 Focal internalization was more widespread in Hailey-Hailey disease than in Darier's disease and the differences in the distribution of desmosomal components in these diseases confirm that they are distinct entities.
