MRI findings in neuro-Behcet's disease.
 We report MRI findings in 6 patients with Behcet's disease and CNS involvement.
 There were 3 different stages of imaging appearance: (1) During the acute illness, there were scattered areas of high signal intensity on T2-weighted images with predilection to the central structures of the cerebrum, the cerebral peduncles, and basis pontis.
 (2) During the recovery phase, most of these findings improved, but some white matter high signal areas persisted in the upper brainstem and peripheral subcortical white matter.
 Occasionally, findings were suggestive of microhematoma.
 (3) During the chronic phase, atrophy of posterior fossa structures became evident with decreased signal intensity suggestive of hemosiderin deposits.
