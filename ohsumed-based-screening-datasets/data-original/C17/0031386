Phototoxicity due to Cachrys libanotis.
 After classification and identification of the plant, the alcoholic extract of Cachrys libanotis L.
 was analysed in order to identify the phototoxic agents.
 The substances responsible for photodermatitis were found to be 4 furocoumarins, of which 3 have been clearly identified, namely 5-methoxy-, 8-methoxy- and 5,8-dimethoxypsoralen.
 The structure of a 4th compound was not completely defined.
