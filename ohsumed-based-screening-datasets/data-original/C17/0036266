Therapeutic effects of cetirizine in delayed pressure urticaria: clinicopathologic findings.
 Cetirizine, a peripheral H1 antagonist, was administered to patients with delayed pressure urticaria in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.
 Efficacy in reducing pressure-induced wheals and flares was evaluated.
 Histologic changes were also assessed with the skin window technique in weight-induced wheals.
 Results showed a statistically significant reduction in weight-induced wheal area (p less than 0.01) after cetirizine therapy; this improvement was accompanied by a concomitant reduction in eosinophil recruitment as demonstrated by the skin window technique (p = 0.0029).
 Subsequently, 14 patients with delayed pressure urticaria underwent biopsy before and after 3 weeks of cetirizine therapy to evaluate the drug's histologic effects.
 A blinded observer performed the histologic studies.
 Weight-induced lesions showed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, primarily polymorphonuclear (neutrophils and eosinophils), whereas the unchallenged skin sites were normal.
 Cell counts from pressure-induced lesions showed a significant reduction in eosinophils after cetirizine treatment.
