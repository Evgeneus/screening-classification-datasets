A controlled trial of clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05% in the treatment of experimentally induced Rhus dermatitis.
 We studied the effectiveness of clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05% in experimentally induced Rhus dermatitis.
 Clobetasol rapidly decreased the vesiculation at each treated site, although the effect was most prominent at the site to which clobetasol was applied the earliest, that is, at 12 hours after exposure to Rhus extract.
 On the basis of this experimental model, clobetasol propionate ointment 0.05% may be effective therapy for naturally occurring Rhus dermatitis.
