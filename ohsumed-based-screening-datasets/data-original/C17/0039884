Allergic contact dermatitis from para-tertiary-butylphenol-formaldehyde resin (PTBP-FR) in athletic tape and leather adhesive.
 4 girls with severe allergic contact dermatitis from a brand of athletic tape and a cobbler with allergic contact dermatitis from leather adhesive are presented.
 Alkylphenol resin with unknown chemical structure had been compounded in both products.
 One of the girls developed foot dermatitis later from the adhesive used on the inside of new sneakers.
 By patch testing and chemical analysis of alkylphenol resin and the products, the 5 patients were given a specific diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis from PTBP-FR.
