Symptomatic xanthogranuloma of choroid plexus with unilateral hydrocephalus. Case report.
 Xanthogranulomas involving the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles are generally asymptomatic lesions.
 The case is reported of a 50-year-old man in whom a xanthogranuloma of the choroid plexus had occluded the left trigone, causing unilateral hydrocephalus of the left temporal horn and neurological symptoms.
 A review of the literature shows that xanthogranulomas of the glomus of the lateral ventricles differ from the xanthomatous cystic lesions of the third ventricle, which are probably akin to colloid cysts.
