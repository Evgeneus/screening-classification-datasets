Endorectal sonography in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease.
 Endorectal sonography initially was developed for evaluation of the prostate and now has been adapted for evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease.
 We used endorectal sonography to evaluate a spectrum of diseases, including primary and recurrent rectal carcinoma, metastases, villous adenoma, leiomyosarcoma, endometriosis, sacrococcygeal teratoma, chordoma, retroperitoneal cystic hamartoma, pelvic lipomatosis, diverticulitis, and perirectal abscess.
 The technique has been useful in localization of perirectal abscesses and in sonographically guided biopsy of perirectal masses.
 Knowledge of normal sonographic anatomy of the rectum is essential in the evaluation of rectal and perirectal disease.
 In this essay, we describe the technique of endorectal sonography and illustrate the sonographic findings in a variety of diseases.
