Neuropeptides enhance irritant and allergic contact dermatitis.
 It is supposed that neuropeptides participate in the regulation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions.
 However, their function in this kind of immune response is not known presently.
 Therefore, in vivo studies were initiated to test the effect on allergic (ACD) and irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) of the neuropeptides substance P (SP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and somatostatin (SOM), which are released from afferent neurons in the skin.
 Each neuropeptide was applied topically at the site of contact with the allergen (oxazolone) or irritant (croton oil) during the challenge and sensitization phase of contact dermatitis.
 The intensity of the inflammation was measured as an increase of ear-swelling response, which represents the degree of plasma extravasation in the early phase of inflammation.
 Neuropeptides alone led only to a distinct vasodilation.
 All three neuropeptides were equally able to increase allergic and irritant inflammation.
 Even minor irritant stimuli were enhanced.
 Beyond that, CGRP was able to boost sensitization, whereas SOM and SP did not show any effects on the sensitization process.
 The results presented demonstrate that neuropeptides increase plasma extravasation independent of the pathogenesis of inflammation and may act as priming substances for other mediators of increased vascular permeability.
 In addition, CGRP enhances the sensitization process.
