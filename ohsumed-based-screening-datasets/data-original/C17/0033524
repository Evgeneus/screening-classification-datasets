Local suppression of contact hypersensitivity in mice by a new bifunctional psoralen, 4,4',5'-trimethylazapsoralen, and UVA radiation.
 Although psoralens plus UVA radiation (320-400 nm) have been widely used for the treatment of dermatologic diseases, the toxic effects of these agents have led investigators to develop new photochemotherapeutic compounds.
 One such compound is 4,4',5'-trimethylazapsoralen (TMAP), a new bifunctional molecule.
 The purpose of this study was to examine the immunologic side effects of repeated treatment of C3H mice with TMAP plus UVA radiation.
 During this treatment, the number of ATPase+, la+, and Thy-1+ dendritic epidermal cells greatly decreased in the treated site, despite the lack of phototoxicity.
 The reduction in the number of detectable cutaneous immune cells was accompanied by a decrease in the induction of contact hypersensitivity to dinitrofluorobenzene applied to the treated skin, an impairment in the antigen-presenting activity of draining lymph node cells, and the presence of suppressor lymphoid cells in the spleen of unresponsive mice.
 Treatment with UVA radiation alone also reduced the number of ATPase+, Ia+, and Thy-1+ cells in the skin, but did not cause any detectable alterations in immune function.
 This implies that morphologic alterations in these cells do not necessarily indicate loss of function.
 Thus, although TMAP in combination with UVA radiation is not overtly phototoxic, it is highly immunosuppressive in mice.
