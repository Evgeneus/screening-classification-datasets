The effect of topical nitroglycerin on transcutaneous oxygen.
 The use of topical nitroglycerin has been reported to aid the healing of chronic skin ulcers.
 In this study, the effect of 2% nitroglycerin ointment on transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) was investigated in skin adjacent to the area of ointment application.
 Topical nitroglycerin caused a two-fivefold decrease in TcPO2 in skin next to or up to 9 cm away from the site of application of the ointment.
