Systemic contact dermatitis from pseudoephedrine.
 A patient with rhinitis developed systemic contact dermatitis when starting oral treatment with Rhinalair, containing pseudoephedrine hydrochloride.
 A few months later, another oral treatment Rinutan, containing norephedrine hydrochloride, provoked a more severe generalized eczema.
 Patch test reactions were strongly positive to ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, slightly positive to phenylephrine and negative to epinephrine.
 Norephedrine was not tested.
