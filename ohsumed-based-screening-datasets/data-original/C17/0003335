Urinary tissue factor activity in colorectal disease.
 Procoagulant activity (PCA) in normal urine has been recognized for over 50 years.
 Although tissue factor (TF) is produced by certain tumours, and is increased in both tumour-associated macrophages and blood monocytes, the possibility that it might also be increased in urine has not been studied in patients with cancer.
 We have measured urinary PCA in hospital controls without inflammatory or neoplastic disease (n = 79), in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 8), inflammatory bowel disease (n = 19), colorectal cancer (n = 70) and in patients undergoing colonoscopy (n = 50).
 Urinary PCA was higher (P less than 0.001) in patients with colorectal cancer and inflammatory bowel disease than controls or patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 Fourteen (88 per cent) out of 16 colonoscopy patients subsequently found to have carcinoma or inflammatory bowel disease had levels above the control upper quartile, compared with 8 (24 per cent) out of 34 with normal colonoscopy (P less than 0.001).
 TF inhibitors confirmed the nature of the PCA and Western blotting studies indicated a urinary TF molecular weight of approximately 38,000.
 These studies provide further evidence of abnormal haemostasis in malignancy and suggest that determination of urinary TF may provide a useful screening test in patients undergoing colonoscopy.
