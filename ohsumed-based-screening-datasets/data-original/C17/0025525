Tissue kallikrein and kininogen in human sweat glands and psoriatic skin.
 The cellular localization of immunoreactive tissue kallikrein and kininogen was studied in normal and psoriatic human skin.
 Immunoreactivity to both enzyme and substrate was observed in secretory granules of the dark cells in the secretory fundus (acinus) of the sweat glands.
 Double immunostaining revealed a segmental distribution of the two antigens.
 Each acinar section contained either tissue kallikrein or kininogen.
 However, there appeared to be a junctional zone in which both were present, but in separate dark cells.
 Immunoreactivity for both antigens was also observed in close apposition to the luminal microvilli of the duct cells.
 No specific immunostaining was seen in sebaceous glands, hair follicles, keratinocytes and other cells of the secretory unit such as myoepithelial or clear cells.
 In psoriatic skin there were in addition many neutrophils immunoreactive for tissue kallikrein in the epidermis and psoriatic scales.
 Mitogenic action of kinins may account to some extent for the characteristic accelerated turnover of epidermal cells in psoriasis and locally applied kinin antagonists may prove of value in the treatment of this disease.
