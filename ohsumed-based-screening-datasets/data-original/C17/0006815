Characterization of the dermal infiltrate in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients with psoriasis.
 We investigated the dermal inflammatory cell infiltrates of psoriatic lesions from nine human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients and nine age-, sex-, and site-matched control specimens.
 The study was retrospective and observer blinded.
 T lymphocytes were quantitated using UCHL-1, a pan-T-cell monoclonal antibody, and plasma cell number was estimated in hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections.
 Differences in both variables reached statistical significance.
 There were fewer T cells and the number of plasma cells was significantly higher in specimens from the human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals in comparison with control specimens.
 As plasma cells are readily identified on hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections, their presence in skin biopsy specimens from psoriatic leisons should arouse suspicion of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 The depletion of helper/inducer T lymphocytes by the human immunodeficiency virus may promote the presence of plasma cells in cutaneous inflammatory infiltrates.
