Does fish oil protect renal function in cyclosporin-treated psoriasis patients?
 In order to study the influence of fish oil on CyA-induced renal dysfunction, 13 patients with psoriasis (CyA group) received cyclosporin A (CyA) alone, and seven patients (CyA/EPA + DHA group) received a combination of cyclosporin A and fish oil (6g eicosapentaenoic acid, C20:5 omega-3, and docosahexaenoic acid, C22:6 omega-3, daily) for 3 months.
 The glomerular filtration rate fell by 18.0 +/- 9.6% in the CyA group compared with 8.7 +/- 6.8% in the CyA/EPA + DHA group (mean +/- SD, P less than 0.05).
 The effective renal plasma flow fell by 10.6 +/- 8.9% in the CyA group and did not change in the CyA/EPA + DHA group (P less than 0.05).
 The calculated total renal vascular resistance increased by 19.8 +/- 14.5% in the CyA group and did not change in the CyA/EPA + DHA group (P less than 0.01).
 The results of this pilot study suggest that fish oil can reduce CyA-associated renal dysfunction in psoriasis patients.
