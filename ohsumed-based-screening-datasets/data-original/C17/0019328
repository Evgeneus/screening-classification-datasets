Isotretinoin for refractory lupus erythematosus.
 We describe six patients with cutaneous manifestations of lupus erythematosus who were treated with isotretinoin, 1 mg/kg/day.
 In each case the cutaneous lesions had proved resistant to systemic corticosteroids and antimalarial therapy.
 Treatment with isotretinoin resulted in rapid clinical improvement in all cases.
 Recurrences were similarly rapid when the drug was discontinued.
 Side effects were minimal and easily controlled by adjustments in dose or by the use of lubricants.
