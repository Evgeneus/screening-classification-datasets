Targeting gene expression to the epidermis of transgenic mice: potential applications to genetic skin disorders.
 The ability to specifically target gene expression to the epidermis of transgenic mice offers the exciting possibility of creating animal models of certain skin disorders that are inherited in man.
 It may be possible to produce mouse models of dominantly inherited keratinization disorders by targeting the expression of mutant genes encoding the major differentiation products of the epidermis, such as the differentiation specific keratins, filaggrin and cell envelope proteins.
 Mouse models for other skin disorders associated with abnormal regulation of growth, such as psoriasis, may be generated by targeting the overexpression of cytokines and growth factors, which are thought to play important roles in the pathogenesis of this disease.
 The development of currently unavailable animal models for certain inherited human skin diseases would not only contribute to our understanding of the pathogenesis of these diseases at the molecular level, but also provide interesting models for therapeutic intervention.
