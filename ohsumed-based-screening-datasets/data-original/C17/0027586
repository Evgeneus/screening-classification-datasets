Diversity of rheumatoid synovial tissue T cells by T cell receptor analysis. Oligoclonal expansion in interleukin-2-responsive cells.
 The synovitis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by infiltrates of CD4+ T lymphocytes.
 To determine the clonal diversity of these cells, we cloned T cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2), alone or with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), directly from actively inflamed synovial tissue obtained at synovectomy.
 A total of 205 clones from 4 specimens was analyzed for T cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangements using Hind III and Eco RI digests with beta chain and gamma chain complementary DNA probes.
 A comparison of the TCR rearrangements enabled us to determine if the T cell clones arose from the same or different precursor cells.
 Most of the T cell clones (92%) had distinct TCR gene rearrangement patterns, indicating a unique clonal origin.
 However, a few clones (1 quadruplicate and 6 pairs) with identical TCR rearrangements were identified, and these clonal multiples were most commonly found in clones selected with IL-2 alone.
 Mass cultures were propagated with IL-2, alone or with PHA, and at each passage, cells were removed for TCR analysis.
 The later passages of the lines selected with IL-2 had oligoclonal TCR rearrangements, whereas no oligoclonal rearrangements were found in the PHA + IL-2-selected cell lines.
 The TCR rearrangements in the later passages of the IL-2 mass cultures were often identical to the TCR rearrangements that were found in the IL-2-derived clonal multiples.
 These findings indicate that while the majority of CD4+ T cells within the actively inflamed rheumatoid joint have diverse clonal origins, small numbers of clonal multiples and oligoclonal populations are present, and these cells may be enriched in an IL-2-responsive T cell subset.
