Marfan syndrome: no evidence for heterogeneity in different populations, and more precise mapping of the gene.
 Marfan syndrome is a dominantly inherited connective tissue disorder with manifestations in the cardiovascular, ocular, and skeletal systems.
 The diagnosis is hampered by both high variability in the phenotypic expression and late manifestation of symptoms.
 The cause of Marfan syndrome remains unknown, but our group has recently reported the genetic linkage of Marfan syndrome to a polymorphic marker on chromosome 15.
 To analyze the possible heterogeneity behind Marfan syndrome, we have performed linkage analyses for four chromosome 15 markers in 17 families from five different populations: Scottish, English, Swiss, American, and Finnish.
 By combining the linkage data of all the studied families into a LINKMAP analysis we obtained a maximal LOD score of 11.2, which maps the Marfan syndrome locus between D15S25 and D15S45 on the long arm of chromosome 15.
 The data reveal no evidence for genetic heterogeneity behind Marfan syndrome and provide us with a more precise location of both the Marfan syndrome locus and flanking markers.
 This information will provide the basis for the DNA diagnostics of Marfan syndrome in the future.
