Collagen metabolism in cutis laxa fibroblasts: increased collagenase gene expression associated with unaltered expression of type I and type III collagen.
 Collagen metabolism was studied in cutis laxa by analyzing collagen and collagenase gene expression in three dermal fibroblast strains from patients with congenital cutis laxa and comparing them with fibroblasts obtained from age-matched healthy subjects.
 Normal collagen synthetic activity was observed in the cutis laxa fibroblasts.
 An increased level of collagenase mRNA and unaltered levels of alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III) collagen mRNA were found in all cutis laxa cell strains by dot blot hybridization.
 Reduced levels of elastin mRNA were also detected in these strains.
 However, no qualitative differences in these mRNA transcripts were detected between the control and cutis laxa fibroblasts by Northern blot analysis.
 Collagenase activity in fibroblast culture supernatants was then measured using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled type I collagen.
 Increased collagenolytic activity in cutis laxa fibroblast culture supernatants was also found.
 These data suggest that increased collagenase expression of fibroblasts is related to the structural abnormality of dermal connective tissue in cutis laxa.
