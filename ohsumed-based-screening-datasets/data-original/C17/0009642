Vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap for reconstruction of defects around the groin and pelvis.
 We present our experience using the vastus lateralis myocutaneous flap for the repair of defects around the groin and pelvis.
 It is a relatively new technique, with many advantages over other flaps used in this area, though it has limitations.
 The history, anatomy and surgical technique of raising the flap are described and clinical cases are discussed.
 The importance of patient selection is highlighted.
