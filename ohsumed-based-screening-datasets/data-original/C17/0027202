Treatment of bacterial skin and soft tissue infections.
 Bacterial skin infections occur commonly and range in severity from mild to life threatening.
 The severity of skin infections, and their management and prognosis, can depend on the mechanism of infection, the skin structures involved and the infecting organism or organisms.
 Primary skin infections result from invasion of microorganisms through tiny breaks in the epidermis or from the spread of microorganisms through the bloodstream.
 Secondary infections arise from pre-existing trauma, burns or surgical wounds; infections involving the soft tissues underlying the skin are also discussed.
 These also frequently occur in areas of trauma, operation or ischemia.
 The cause, bacteriologic factors and management of skin infections were studied, with special attention to pyodermas, infections of the foot in diabetic patients and necrotizing soft tissue infections.
 Choice of appropriate antibiotic agents depends in large part on the infecting organism and patterns of antibiotic susceptibility.
 In necrotizing soft tissue infections, survival or limb salvage may depend on prompt surgical intervention.
 In these instances and in some of advanced primary skin infections in which bacteremia is involved, parenteral antibiotics are required.
 The available options are discussed and a report on the data with the combination agent ticarcillin disodium and clavulanate potassium is presented.
