Expanding contractures of the tunica albuginea due to Peyronie's disease with temporalis fascia free grafts.
 We describe a procedure to expand contractures of the tunica albuginea by multiple full thickness relaxing incisions followed by inlay of tailored temporalis fascia free grafts.
 This technique is performed without resection of the tunica albuginea, although in the case of calcified plaques the calcifications themselves are removed, preserving the overlying tunica.
 Between September 1988 and February 1990, 12 patients have undergone this procedure, all of whom have greater than 3 months of followup and have experienced spontaneous erections within the first week postoperatively.
 Of the patients 11 resumed intercourse within 8 weeks of surgery and 1 required 12 weeks.
 No patient had sensory loss postoperatively and there has been no donor site morbidity.
 Correction of curvature was accomplished in all patients and there have been no recurrences within a maximal followup of 22 months.
 Within the limitations of such a small study we believe that there is evidence supporting this approach in potent patients with severe acquired penile curvature.
