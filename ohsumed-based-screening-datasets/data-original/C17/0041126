Purulent corporeal cavernositis secondary to papaverine-induced priapism.
 Intracavernous autoinjection of vasoactive substances is used to treat erectile dysfunction.
 Infection of the corpora cavernosa can be a serious life-threatening complication with this treatment modality.
 Cavernositis is an unusual complication, especially in otherwise healthy men.
 In diabetic patients with altered blood supply to the penis and a change of cavernous tissue ischemia can lead to a fulminant infection.
 We report on a 63-year-old diabetic patient who presented with purulent cavernositis a few weeks after beginning intracavernous injection of papaverine.
 Treatment included bilateral corporotomy, debridement, and placement of intracorporeal irrigation and suction drains.
 The patient survived this serious infection leaving both corpora cavernosa with severe fibrosis.
