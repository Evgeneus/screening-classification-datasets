Relationships of total IgE level, skin prick test response, and smoking habits.
 Epidemiologic observations on 331 men showed that increased serum IgE concentration was associated with a wheal response to skin prick testing, but also to an erythema response in the absence of any wheal, and to heavy smoking.
 The association between IgE and the various skin prick test responses remained after taking into account smoking and asthma.
