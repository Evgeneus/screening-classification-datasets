Detection of human papillomaviruses in paraffin-embedded condylomata acuminata--comparison of immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction.
 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used for detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA in paraffin-embedded tissue sections of condylomata acuminata.
 Incorporation of biotinylated nucleotides during the amplification process allows a highly sensitive, fast, and non-isotopic detection of viral DNA in a subsequent Southern dot blot.
 In 100% (13 of 13) of histologically confirmed condylomata, HPV-6 or -11 could be detected by polymerase chain reaction.
 By in situ hybridization 77% (10 of 13) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 69% (nine of 13) positive results were obtained.
 Because HPV genital infection is linked to penile and cervical dysplasia, polymerase chain reaction provides a powerful and highly sensitive tool for epidemiologic studies on sexual transmission of HPV.
