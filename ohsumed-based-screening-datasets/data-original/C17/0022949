Treatment of hirsutism by an association of oral cyproterone acetate and transdermal 17 beta-estradiol.
 Twenty-four hirsute women were treated with an inversal sequential scheme of cyproterone acetate, 50 mg/d by oral route from the 1st to the 15th day of the menstrual cycle, along with 100 micrograms/24 h of 17 beta-estradiol transdermally administered from days 1 to 21, for nine cycles at weekly intervals.
 The acne and seborrhea as well as hirsutism showed a significant improvement in all subjects studied.
 The plasma testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate decrease from 1.5 +/- 1.3 ng/mL and 6.9 +/- 1.3 micrograms/mL to 0.5 +/- 0.03 ng/mL and 2.7 +/- 1.7 micrograms/mL, respectively.
 Similar values were observed in subjects with idiopathic hirsutism during the treatment.
 The metabolic parameters, as well as the plasma levels of sex hormone-binding globulin, appeared unaffected by the therapy.
 Furthermore, the luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone secretion was strongly inhibited from the first cycle of treatment.
 In conclusion, considering the good clinical results and the avoidance of any hepatic effect, this association should be taken into account in the treatment of hirsutism, especially in case of oral estrogen intolerance.
