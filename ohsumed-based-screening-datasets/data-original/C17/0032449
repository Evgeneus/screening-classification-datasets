Papillon-Lefevre syndrome with acroosteolysis.
 The Papillon-Lefevre syndrome is characterized by palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and juvenile periodontitis that results in the precocious loss of both the deciduous and permanent teeth.
 We report a patient with Papillon-Lefevre syndrome associated with acroosteolysis, an association that has not been previously described.
