Rheumatoid factors and complex formation. The role of light-chain framework sequences and glycosylation.
 New information regarding rheumatoid factors (RFs) indicates that the RFs synthesized in synovium and lymphoid tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are different from monoclonal and nonspecific RFs associated with other inflammatory states.
 The characteristics of RF associated with RA are as follows.
 They are of all Ig isotypes (not just IgM), indicating T-cell participation in antibody maturation.
 They have higher avidity for human IgG than for rabbit IgG.
 They use the human germline heavy-chain variable region (VH) gene VHIII more frequently than other VH genes, and light chains from multiple families.
 (In contrast, monoclonal RFs use predominantly VH1 and very commonly the V kappa IIIb germline gene HUMkv325).
 RA IgG is somatically mutated.
 (In contrast, monoclonal RFs use unmutated germline Ig genes).
 This suggests they are matured by stimulation either with specific antigens or other activation signals such as cytokines.
 They are abnormally glycosylated.
 In general, during periods of disease activity in adult and juvenile RA, a galactose is missing from the Fc of the IgG molecule, leaving an empty "pocket" between the C gamma 2 domains of heavy chains.
 The IgG RFs self-associate.
 This may result at least in part when galactose on the F(ab')2 portion of one IgG molecule fills the empty pocket in the Fc of another Ig molecule.
 Self-association forms immune complexes capable of fixing complement and probably of causing joint damage and vasculitis.
