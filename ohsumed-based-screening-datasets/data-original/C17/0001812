Early solid feeding and recurrent childhood eczema: a 10-year longitudinal study.
 The relationship between early solid feeding practices and risks of recurrent or chronic eczema in childhood was examined in a birth cohort of New Zealand children studied to the age of 10.
 By the age of 10 years, 7.5% of children had chronic or recurrent eczema.
 There were clear and consistent associations between the diversity of the child's diet during the first 4 months and risks of eczema.
 Even when due allowance was made for a range of confounding factors--including parental atopic illness, atopic illness in siblings, the child's early milk diet, and family social background--children exposed to four or more different types of solid food before 4 months had risks of recurrent or chronic eczema that were 2.9 times those of children who were not exposed to early solid feeding.
 It is concluded that early exposure to a diet diverse in potential food antigens may act to predispose susceptible children to recurrent or chronic childhood eczema.
