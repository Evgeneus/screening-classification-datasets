Pathogenetic significance of reactive oxygen species in diffuse fibrosing alveolitis.
 Excessive release of reactive oxygen metabolites (ROM) from lung inflammatory cells has been claimed to be of major pathogenetic significance in diffuse fibrosing alveolitis.
 In the present study, the content of oxidized methionine residues [Met(O)] as a percentage of total methionine (Met) in BAL-derived proteins was used to assess the biologic effect of ROM.
 In addition, procollagen-III-peptide was measured in BAL fluid as a marker of fibroblast activation.
 We investigated bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples from seven control patients without evidence of interstitial lung disease and from 42 patients with fibrosing alveolitis caused by idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), n = 20, or by collagen vascular disease (CVD), n = 22.
 Met(O) was elevated in the patients with IPF or CVD compared with that in the control subjects (8.86 +/- 1.26 and 8.13 +/- 1.44% versus 3.36 +/- 0.49%, p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05, respectively; mean +/- SEM).
 A positive correlation was found between percentage of neutrophils in BAL and Met(O) in both groups separately and combined (IPF, r = 0.84; p less than 0.001; CVD, r = 0.44; p less than 0.05; IPF and CVD, r = 0.60; p less than 0.001), whereas an inverse relationship existed between Met(O) and the percentage of alveolar macrophages in BAL (IPF, r = -0.59; p less than 0.01; CVD, r = -0.24; NS; IPF and CVD, r = -0.41; p less than 0.05).
