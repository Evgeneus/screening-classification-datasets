Experience with the functional cleft lip repair.
 The first 12 functional cleft lip repairs performed on unselected consecutive patients immediately following the completion of training by the author are presented.
 Previous reports on this cleft lip repair have shown excellent results but have always been based on patients operated on by the originator of the procedure.
 This report gives credence to the ease with which a cleft lip repair that gives reproducible good results can be taught and learned even by plastic surgeons with limited experience.
 It reviews the technical steps of the procedure, which emphasizes wide undermining and release of the orbicularis oris muscle on the lateral side of the cleft to allow redraping and lengthening of the lip skin, step-by-step layered closure of the mucosa, muscle, and skin, and further vertical lengthening of the lip with a Z-plasty skin closure.
 Three elements that are difficult to achieve or restore with cleft lip revision are evaluated: (1) achievement of a good skin scar, (2) maintenance of the alar-facial groove, and (3) achievement of adequate lip height without sacrificing horizontal lip length.
 Ten of the 12 patients had a satisfactory scar, 9 patients had a good alar-facial groove, and all patients had a normal-appearing horizontal lip length.
 Nine patients required secondary surgery; however, in six patients, this included correction of the nasal deformity that was not corrected at the time of cleft lip repair.
