Localized pemphigoid shares the same target antigen as bullous pemphigoid.
 A case of localized pemphigoid is described in which the lesions were only on the lower legs.
 Immunoblotting of the patients' serum reacted with a 240-kDa polypeptide identical to one of the bullous pemphigoid antigens.
 IgG1 was detected in the lesional skin and IgG1 and IgG4 in the patient's serum.
 These observations suggest that the immunopathological mechanisms in the blister formation in localized pemphigoid are similar to those found in more widespread bullous pemphigoid.
