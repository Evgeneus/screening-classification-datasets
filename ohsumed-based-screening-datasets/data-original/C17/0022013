Sclerosing panniculitis. A clinicopathologic assessment.
 Six patients with well-circumscribed, indurated, inflammatory plaques of the lower extremity are described.
 Incisional biopsy specimens in each patient revealed fat necrosis, sclerosis, and a lobular panniculitis.
 These patients are similar to those described under the designations hypodermitis sclerodermaformis or lipodermatosclerosis.
 The name sclerosing panniculitis is proposed to unify these conditions.
 The pathogenesis is unknown, although a role for venous stasis or previous thrombophlebitis has been proposed.
 Systemic or local anti-inflammatory therapies have not been clinically effective.
