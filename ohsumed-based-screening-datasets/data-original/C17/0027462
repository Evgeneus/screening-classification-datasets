Topical tretinoin for treatment of photodamaged skin. A multicenter study.
 The clinical and histologic effects of a new emollient cream formulation of topical tretinoin at concentrations of 0.05% and 0.01% were examined in 251 subjects with mild to moderate photodamaged facial skin in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, multicenter study.
 Seventy-nine percent of the subjects who received 0.05% tretinoin for 24 weeks showed overall improvement in photodamaged skin compared with improvement in 48% of the vehicle-treated control subjects.
 Significant reductions were found in fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, roughness, and laxity after 0.05% tretinoin therapy when compared with controls.
 In addition, histologic changes of increased epidermal thickness, decreased melanin content, and stratum corneum compaction provide independent evidence supporting clinical improvement.
 Side effects of erythema, peeling, and stinging were usually mild and well tolerated.
