Sebaceous carcinoma: an unusual cause of a rapidly enlarging rhinophyma.
 We describe a patient who developed sebaceous carcinoma within a long-standing rhinophyma with rapid enlargement of the lesion.
 We believe the development of this tumour was a random occurrence but the possibility of tumour development should be considered in any rhinophyma showing a rapid increase in size.
