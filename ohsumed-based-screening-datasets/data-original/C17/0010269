Evidence of heterogeneous mechanisms in lipoprotein lipid alterations in hyperandrogenic women.
 Fifty-one hyperandrogenic women had their lipoprotein lipid profiles determined.
 Free and albumin-bound testosterone was associated with triglycerides and with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels, percent ideal body weight, and waist/hip ratio.
 To gain insight into mechanisms of these lipid alterations, the women were subgrouped according to apparent source of androgen excess.
 Whereas all groups had low levels of high-density lipoprotein-2 cholesterol and high triglyceride concentrations, only in those with high luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratios was free and albumin-bound testosterone associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol independent of fasting insulin levels.
 Relationships between percent ideal body weight and waist/hip ratios, free and albumin-bound testosterone, sex hormone binding globulin, fasting insulin and 2-hour insulin levels and blood pressure are not significant in all subgroups, suggesting differing endocrinological influences and differing mechanisms for lipoprotein lipid alterations.
