Evidence for impaired T cell DNA methylation in systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis.
 Procainamide and hydralazine inhibit T cell DNA methylation and induce autoreactivity in cloned CD4+ T cells.
 These drugs also induce an autoimmune syndrome, suggesting a possible relationship between DNA hypomethylation, T cell autoreactivity, and certain autoimmune diseases.
 To test this relationship, DNA methylation was studied in T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, and was found to be impaired.
 These results support a relationship between DNA hypomethylation and some forms of autoimmune disease.
