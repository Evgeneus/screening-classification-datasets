Focal facial dermal dysplasia: two familial cases.
 Focal facial dermal dysplasia (or congenital ectodermal dysplasia of the face) is an inherited condition characterized by congenital scarlike lesions on the temples and a wide spectrum of associated facial abnormalities.
 We report the case of a woman and her son with this disorder.
 An autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expressivity may explain the different clinical expressions of focal facial dermal dysplasia.
