A tyrosinase gene missense mutation in temperature-sensitive type I oculocutaneous albinism. A human homologue to the Siamese cat and the Himalayan mouse.
 Type I oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is an autosomal recessive disorder in which deficient synthesis of melanin pigment results from abnormal activity of melanocyte tyrosinase.
 A novel type I OCA phenotype in which hypopigmentation is related to local body temperature is associated with a missense substitution in tyrosinase, codon 422 CGG (Arg)----CAG (Gln).
 This substitution results in a tyrosinase polypeptide that is temperature-sensitive.
 This form of type I OCA thus is homologous to the temperature-related forms of albinism seen in the Siamese cat and the Himalayan mouse.
