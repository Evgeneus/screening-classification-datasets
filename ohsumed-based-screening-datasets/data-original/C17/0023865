Defects of the retinal pigment epithelium in scleroderma.
 We completed ocular examination, including retinal fluoroangiography, in 19 unselected patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) and compared the findings with those made in 50 consecutive patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, 18 with primary Sjogren's syndrome, 20 with mixed connective tissue disease, and 20 healthy women.
 Five of 19 scleroderma patients had atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (26.3%) while none of the controls and only four of the 88 (4.5%) patients with other connective tissue diseases (P less than 0.01) had this anomaly.
 Atrophy of the pigmented epithelium of the retina may occur in scleroderma as a result of damage of the choroidal plexus.
