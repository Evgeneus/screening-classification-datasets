Fibroblast-keratinocyte interactions in psoriasis: failure of psoriatic fibroblasts to stimulate keratinocyte proliferation in vitro.
 We have tested in two ways the hypothesis that dermal fibroblasts direct the hyperproliferation of the overlying epidermis in psoriasis.
 First, culture medium from psoriatic and from normal skin fibroblasts was added to monolayer cultures of foreskin keratinocytes.
 Second, psoriatic and normal fibroblasts embedded in hydrated collagen lattices were co-cultured with monolayers of foreskin keratinocytes.
 There was no evidence in either study that psoriatic fibroblast products could stimulate the proliferation of the keratinocytes, or that normal fibroblast products inhibited their proliferation.
 A positive control for the fibroblasts was provided by leucocyte supernatants, which stimulated keratinocyte proliferation by up to 65%.
 Our data do not support a primary role for dermal fibroblasts in psoriasis.
