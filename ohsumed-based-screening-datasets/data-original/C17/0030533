Clinical correlations and prognosis based on hyaluronic acid serum levels in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis.
 The serum levels of hyaluronic acid (sHA) were measured using an affinoimmunoenzymatic assay in patients with distal (n = 16) and proximal (n = 15) progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) and in 31 controls.
 The severity of PSS was evaluated using a standardized organ-involvement score.
 The mean sHA was significantly higher in the patients with PSS than in controls (mean +/- SD:80 +/- 43.4 micrograms/l vs.
 42.3 +/- 19.1 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001).
 sHA was significantly higher in patients with proximal PSS than in patients with distal PSS (106.4 +/- 44.6 micrograms/l vs.
 55.4 +/- 23.8 micrograms/l, P less than 0.001).
 A positive correlation was found between sHA and the disease score (r = 0.67, P less than 0.001).
 sHA was also correlated with lung diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (r = 0.70, P less than 0.001), but only in the those patients who had abnormal lung function, and therefore presumably had lung PSS involvement.
 We suggest that sHA could be an indicator of the degree of systemic involvement in PSS.
 Its prognostic value and possible use in the follow up of patients with PSS remain to be clarified.
