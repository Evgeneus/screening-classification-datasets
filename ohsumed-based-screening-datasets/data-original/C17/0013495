Endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mediate the adhesion of eosinophils to endothelial cells in vitro and are expressed by endothelium in allergic cutaneous inflammation in vivo 
 We have compared the adhesion of 51Cr-labeled eosinophils and neutrophils to cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell (EC) monolayers that have been stimulated with IL-1, TNF, or LPS.
 Each agent stimulated the adhesion to EC of both eosinophils and neutrophils in a similar dose- and time-dependent manner.
 F(ab')2 fragments of mAb 1.2B6 (anti-endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM)-1) and mAb 6.5B5 (anti-intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1) each inhibited partially, and to a similar extent, eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to EC monolayers prestimulated with TNF (10 ng/ml) for 6 h.
 Greater inhibition of both eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion was achieved by combining the effects of mAb 1.2B6 with either mAb 6.5B5 or mAb TS1/18 (anti-CD18).
 These observations indicate that both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 are involved in the adhesion of eosinophils and neutrophils to EC stimulated with TNF.
 In order to determine whether these molecules are expressed in vivo during allergen-induced late phase allergic responses in the skin, human skin biopsies were examined at 6 h after Ag or saline challenge with the use of an alkaline phosphatase-staining technique.
 Both ELAM-1 and ICAM-1 were expressed with greater intensities in Ag-challenged biopsies, suggesting that these molecules may be involved in granulocyte recruitment in vivo.
 The similarities we have established between mechanisms of eosinophil and neutrophil adhesion to cytokine-stimulated EC suggests that factors other than differential leukocyte-EC adhesion may be responsible for the selective accumulation of eosinophils at sites of allergic inflammation.
