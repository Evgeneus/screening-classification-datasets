Deep vein obstruction and leg swelling caused by femoral ganglion.
 We present a case of a rare ganglion cyst originating from the hip joint and compressing the common femoral vein producing signs and symptoms that mimicked a deep vein thrombosis.
 Excision of the mass promptly restored normal venous return.
 This condition has not been previously reported in the English-language medical literature.
