Localization of endogenous beta-galactoside-binding lectin as a means to distinguish malignant from benign skin tissue.
 The immunolocalization of a 30-kd endogenous lectin, referred to as galaptin, was studied in various skin tumor types.
 Basal cell carcinomas expressed little or no galaptin, whereas nonmalignant basaloid cells, squamous cell carcinomas, melanoma, nevi, and stroma showed more prominent galaptin immunostaining.
 Therefore, the immunodetection of galaptin may aid the dermatopathologist in difficult histologic diagnosis.
