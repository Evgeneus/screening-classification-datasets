Vasopressin-related bullous disease of the legs.
 We report a 33-year-old man who developed cutaneous necrosis of the lower extremities with extensive bulla formation after i.v.
 administration of vasopressin for the treatment of bleeding esophageal varices.
 Due to its potent nonselective vasoconstrictive action, vasopressin not only may induce cardiac and gastrointestinal ischemia, but cutaneous ischemia as well.
 As in our patient, this may lead to extensive necrotic skin lesions at sites distant from the infusion.
