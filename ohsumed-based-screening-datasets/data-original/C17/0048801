Cyclosporine A metabolism by cytochrome P-450III occurs in microsomes from rat liver but not from normal epidermis or psoriatic lesions.
 Cyclosporine A is efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis when taken orally or injected intralesionally but not topically.
 Lack of penetration to necessary locations or rapid metabolism during passage through the epidermis may account for the ineffectiveness.
 Cytochromes P-450III in the liver are known to be involved in cyclosporine metabolism and inactivation.
 This study was undertaken to determine if an epidermal cytochrome P-450III exists that can inactivate topical cyclosporine A.
 Rats were treated with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin to induce the cytochrome P-450III family of enzymes.
 Microsomal fractions were prepared from liver and epidermis of rats and from lesional areas of psoriasis patients.
 NADPH cytochrome C reductase activity was determined as a positive control for microsomal enzymatic activity.
 Formation of metabolite 1, the predominant metabolite of cyclosporine A, by liver microsomes was increased 193% after 10 d erythromycin treatment.
 The cytochrome P-450 dependent activity in microsomes from the epidermis of control and erythromycin-treated rats and in microsomes from psoriatic tissue was at the detection limits of the assay system.
 Cytochrome P-450III gene family mRNA were detectable by polymerase chain reaction in liver but not in psoriatic or normal epidermis.
 The lack of detectable P-450III mRNA and the absence or minimal conversion of cyclosporine A to inactive metabolites by epidermal microsomes suggest that the ineffectiveness of topical cyclosporine A in psoriasis may not be due to inactivation of cyclosporine A by cytochrome P-450 in the skin.
