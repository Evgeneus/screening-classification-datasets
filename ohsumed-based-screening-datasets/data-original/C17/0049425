Intestinal mucosal permeability in inflammatory rheumatic diseases. I. Role of antiinflammatory drugs.
 Using the 51Cr-EDTA resorption test, gut permeability was measured in 129 patients with inflammatory joint diseases and in 97 control patients (42 patients with no inflammatory rheumatic disorders taking antiinflammatory medication and 55 healthy controls).
 Thirty-two patients (30 arthritis and 2 control patients) taking nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) as well as corticosteroids were excluded from statistical analysis.
 The intake of NSAID significantly increased gut permeability in controls but not in the arthritis groups.
 The same applied to corticosteroid intake.
 This could be due to the restricted number of arthritis patients who had never taken antiinflammatory drugs or to a disease related increased permeability.
 There was no statistically significant difference in altered gut permeability between patients taking NSAID and patients taking corticosteroids.
 Our findings suggest that drug induced alteration of gut permeability may not only be accounted for by an inhibition of mucosal cyclooxygenase activity, but that other enzymatic pathways in the arachidonic cascade might be implicated.
