Skin responses to intradermal histamine and leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria and in normal subjects.
 Mast cell inflammatory mediators, such as histamine, and newly formed compounds, such as the leukotrienes, cause wheal and flare when they are injected intradermally into normal subjects and may therefore play a role in the formation of urticaria.
 The effects of intradermal injections (50 microliters) of six different concentrations of histamine (range, 3.3 x 10(-4) to 3.3 x 10(-9) mol/L) and the leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 (range, 2 x 10(-4) to 2 x 10(-9) mol/L) have been compared in 10 normal subjects and in 10 patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria.
 Wheal-and-flare sizes were measured at timed intervals up to 4 hours, and area under the curve for each response over time was calculated.
 There were no significant differences in leukotriene-induced responses between groups.
 Maximum sizes of histamine-induced wheal and flare were similar in each group of subjects.
 There were, however, significant increases in mean areas under the response curve of histamine wheal and flare in the patients with urticaria (wheal, p less than 0.001; flare, p less than 0.001; analysis of variance).
 These findings demonstrate a prolongation of skin responses to histamine in patients with urticaria and suggest an impaired clearance of histamine (or other vasoactive agents released by histamine) from the skin of these patients.
