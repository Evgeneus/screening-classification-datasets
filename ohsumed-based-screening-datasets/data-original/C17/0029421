Interrater reliability of videotaped observational gait-analysis assessments.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the interrater reliability of videotaped observational gait-analysis (VOGA) assessments.
 Fifty-four licensed physical therapists with varying amounts of clinical experience served as raters.
 Three patients with rheumatoid arthritis who demonstrated an abnormal gait pattern served as subjects for the videotape.
 The raters analyzed each patient's most severely involved knee during the four subphases of stance for the kinematic variables of knee flexion and genu valgum.
 Raters were asked to determine whether these variables were inadequate, normal, or excessive.
 The temporospatial variables analyzed throughout the entire gait cycle were cadence, step length, stride length, stance time, and step width.
 Generalized kappa coefficients ranged from .11 to .52.
 Intraclass correlation coefficients (2,1) and (3,1) were slightly higher.
 Our results indicate that physical therapists' VOGA assessments are only slightly to moderately reliable and that improved interrater reliability of the assessments of physical therapists utilizing this technique is needed.
 Our data suggest that there is a need for greater standardization of gait-analysis training.
