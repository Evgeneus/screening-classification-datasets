Systemic sclerosis associated with cutaneous exposure to solvent: case report and review of the literature.
 Sclerodermatous skin changes and systemic sclerosis have been reported to occur as a result of contact with several different organic solvents.
 We describe a 41-year-old man who developed systemic sclerosis after working for 15 years in a foundry, where he had extensive cutaneous contact with multiple organic solvents (trichloroethane, xylene, trimethylbenzene, and naphthalene).
 Cutaneous exposure to organic solvents may be a factor in the etiology of some cases of systemic sclerosis.
