Disseminated hypopigmented keratoses.
 We present two cases of asymptomatic, widespread keratotic eruptions in young female patients.
 Clinically, the lesions are well-demarcated, small, hypopigmented, flat-topped papules occurring on the trunk and extremities in a uniform distribution.
 Skin biopsy specimens from one patient revealed hyperorthokeratosis, papillomatosis, and a normal amount of melanin.
 We suggest that this is a newly recognized dermatologic entity that may be descriptively termed disseminated hypopigmented keratoses.
 Disseminated hypopigmented keratoses may be distinguished by clinical and histologic criteria from similar keratotic eruptions.
 Since the lesions of disseminated hypopigmented keratoses are both inconspicuous and asymptomatic, it is likely that the disorder is more prevalent than our two cases would suggest.
