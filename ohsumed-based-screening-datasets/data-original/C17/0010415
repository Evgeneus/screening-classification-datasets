Ultrasound demonstration of a superior mesenteric artery aneurysm in a patient with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
 A large aneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery was the presumed cause of abdominal pain in an 11-year-old girl with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
 This aneurysm was readily identified by ultrasonography, suggesting that this method could be the diagnostic technique of choice in this disorder.
