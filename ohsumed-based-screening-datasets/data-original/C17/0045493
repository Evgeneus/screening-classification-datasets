mRNA for tissue-type plasminogen activator is present in lesional epidermis from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, or bullous pemphigoid, but is not detected in normal epidermis.
 Plasminogen activator (PA), which catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to the proteinase plasmin, has been implicated in a variety of cutaneous disorders.
 Lesional epidermis from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, and Hailey-Hailey disease contains elevated levels of tissue-type PA (tPA) activity compared to non-lesional epidermis or to epidermis from normal individuals.
 In the present study, we have used Northern blot analysis to demonstrate that mRNA for tPA is detectable in lesions from patients with psoriasis, pemphigus, and bullous pemphigoid, but is not detectable in normal epidermis.
 These data strongly suggest that the tPA enzymatic activity present in lesional epidermis results from enhanced synthesis of the enzyme in situ, secondary to elevated steady-state levels of tPA mRNA.
 Cultured keratinocytes likewise are shown to contain tPA mRNA.
 Previous investigators have suggested that the phenotypes of keratinocytes in culture, psoriatic epidermis, and epidermis in the process of wound reepithelialization are comparable.
 Our findings, combined with those of other investigators, suggest that elevated tPA expression may be another common feature of epidermis under these circumstances.
