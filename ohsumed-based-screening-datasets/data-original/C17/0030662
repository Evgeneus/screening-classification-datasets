Screening for corticosteroid contact sensitivity. Comparison of tixocortol pivalate, hydrocortisone-17-butyrate and hydrocortisone.
 3 corticosteroids have so far been tried as markers for corticosteroid contact sensitivity: hydrocortisone, tixocortol pivalate and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate.
 The present study compared these steroids for screening in addition to a standard patch test series.
 Of 727 patients, 28 (3.9%) reacted to tixocortol pivalate and 10 (1.4%) to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate; hydrocortisone gave an allergic reaction in 2 of 521 (0.4%) patients.
 Serial dilutions suggested that tixocortol pivalate, not marketed in Finland, caused allergic reactions which could possibly be cross-reactions to hydrocortisone.
 In contrast to previously published data, frequent cross-reactions occurred with hydrocortisone-17-butyrate and tixocortol pivalate.
 All allergic reactions to other corticosteroids found by testing with tixocortol pivalate concurred with reactions to hydrocortisone-17-butyrate.
 The study suggests that the most effective choice for routine testing for corticosteroid contact sensitivity would be both tixocortol pivalate and hydrocortisone-17-butyrate.
