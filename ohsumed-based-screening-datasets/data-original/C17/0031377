Corticosteroid sensitivity and cross-sensitivity. A review of 18 cases 1967-1988.
 506 patients were suspected of being allergic to corticosteroid medicaments in our clinic during the 22 years from 1967 to 1988.
 Patch tests were performed in these patients.
 Scratch tests, intradermal tests, and challenge tests were also carried out in some cases.
 69 patients showed positive reactions to corticosteroid products (as is).
 18 were allergic to the corticosteroid itself and 44 were sensitive to vehicle components or other active ingredients.
 In 7 cases, the allergen could not be detected.
 Patients who were allergic to corticosteroids were tested for their cross-sensitivity with our corticosteroid patch test series.
 Cross-reactions tended to occur between members of the same corticosteroid type, and some of the combinations of different corticosteroid types cross-reacted with each other.
 Corticosteroid-sensitive cases have increased in number during these 22 years.
 Corticosteroid sensitivity is not as rare as formerly thought.
