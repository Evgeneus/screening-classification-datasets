Pressure sores--a multifaceted approach to prevention and treatment.
 The incidence and effect of pressure sores on the disabled and elderly population have created a challenge to physicians and health care professionals, from emergency departments to rehabilitation units, and in the community.
 If not prevented, the morbidity and mortality of patients and the direct and indirect costs to both patients and the health care system are radically increased.
 In this article we define the impact on our health care system of pressure sores, provide an overview of a multifaceted approach to their prevention and management, and introduce successful behavioral and educational approaches for patients with chronic, recurrent sores.
 A coordinated approach with patients as informed participants and their care givers enhances the chances for success.
