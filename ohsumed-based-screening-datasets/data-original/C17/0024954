Differential synthesis of 5-lipoxygenase in peripheral blood and synovial fluid neutrophils in rheumatoid arthritis.
 In order to investigate 5-lipoxygenase enzyme regulation in neutrophils during an inflammatory reaction, we studied 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels, as well as de novo enzyme synthesis, in resting and activated neutrophils isolated from normal individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis.
 The approach used was to analyze these activities in resting peripheral blood neutrophils of normal individuals on the one hand and in peripheral blood and matched synovial fluid neutrophils isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis on the other hand.
 Our first observation was that resting peripheral blood neutrophils of either normal individuals or patients show detectable levels of 5-lipoxygenase mRNA and are able to synthesize the enzyme de novo.
 Our second observation was that inflammatory activated neutrophils from synovial fluid reveal lower 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels and enzyme synthesis than do the patient-matched peripheral blood cells.
 This is in spite of the fact that, for other proteins, synovial fluid neutrophils are equally or more active than their peripheral blood counterparts.
 We conclude that peripheral blood neutrophils are capable of synthesizing the enzyme, thus ensuring the turnover of the protein.
 Furthermore, complex regulatory mechanisms appear to take place in response to inflammation as it occurs in synovial fluids of patients with rheumatoid arthritis, leading to decreased mRNA levels and enzyme synthesis.
 Possible mechanisms of regulation are discussed and are presently under investigation.
