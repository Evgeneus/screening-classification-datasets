Shoulder arthroplasty for rheumatoid arthritis.
 Forty-two Designed After Natural Anatomy (DANA) total shoulder arthroplasties (Howmedica, Rutherford, New Jersey) were performed in 34 rheumatoid patients.
 Thirty shoulders in 23 patients were followed for a minimum of two years.
 Twelve of the 30 shoulders (40%) had significant rotator cuff tears.
 The average rating for pain improved from 3 points preoperatively to 8 points postoperatively for the overall group, and the average rating for function improved from 3 points preoperatively to 6 points postoperatively.
 Range of motion (ROM) improved substantially in patients treated with a regular glenoid component.
 Four patients were treated with hooded glenoid components designed to improve stability for shoulders in which the rotator cuff was deficient.
 In the rotator-cuff-deficient patients, pain and function improved; however, ROM was unchanged.
 Complications, including one acromial fracture and two loose glenoid components, required revision surgery.
