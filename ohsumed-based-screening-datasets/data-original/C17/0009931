Synthesis and release of phospholipase A2 by unstimulated human articular chondrocytes.
 High activity of proinflammatory, type II phospholipase A2 (PLA2) was found in synovial fluids (SF) in inflammatory arthritis.
 In search for the sources of this PLA2, we cultured human articular chondrocytes and cartilage explants from healthy, osteoarthritic and rheumatoid joints.
 All cultures, unstimulated by cytokines, released PLA2 extracellularly.
 Cultures obtained from the deep layers of the cartilage released more PLA2 than those obtained from the superficial layers.
 Deep layer explants released 0.38 to 18.16 pmol/min/mg protein PLA2/day, whereas superficial layer explants released 0.39-3.18 pmol/min/mg/day.
 Chondrocyte cell cultures continuously released PLA2, in the first day 909-46347 pmol/min/(10)6 cells and after 9-26 days of culture 166-2115 pmol/min/10(6) cells.
 PLA2 released from chondrocytes was calcium dependent and had optimum activity at pH 7.5.
 Cycloheximide markedly inhibited its release.
 Chondrocyte cultures also released muramidase (LZM) but there was no correlation between PLA2 and LZM release.
 It may be concluded that cytokine unstimulated human articular chondrocytes synthesize and release PLA2 extracellularly which is similar to that found in the SF.
 Thus, chondrocytes may possibly serve as one of the sources of intraarticular PLA2.
