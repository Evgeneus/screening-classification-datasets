The low risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients dispensed corticosteroids.
 PURPOSE: To determine the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients treated with corticosteroids.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding was assessed in a cohort of 19,880 patients from the Michigan Medicaid billing database with dermatitis and/or asthma treated with corticosteroids during 1980 to 1984.
 The frequency of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was assessed within 60 days after each corticosteroid prescription.
 RESULTS: The incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients without a past history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding who were exposed to corticosteroids was only 2.8 cases per 10,000 person-months.
 The rate of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was notably higher in patients receiving anticoagulants and those with a prior history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (23.0 and 15.9 cases per 10,000 person-months, respectively).
 CONCLUSION: Because the incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in ambulatory patients treated with corticosteroids is so low, prophylactic therapy should be restricted to high-risk patients, if it is to be used at all.
