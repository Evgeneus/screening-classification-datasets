PUVA treatment of psoriasis in the United Kingdom.
 Information concerning the operation of 134 PUVA units in 96 dermatology centres in the U.K.
 was collected by a postal questionnaire.
 The most common protocol was to give PUVA three times weekly in the treatment of psoriasis, and to choose the initial dose of UVA according to skin type.
 However, the initial UVA dose encompassed a range of five or more within each skin type.
