Plasma levels of 8-methoxypsoralen following oral or bath-water treatment.
 The plasma levels of 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) were determined in 18 patients on PUVA treatment for their psoriasis and in two control volunteers.
 Seven of the patients were on oral therapy and 13 having bath treatment.
 The plasma levels of 8-MOP were determined up to 6 h after treatment and varied between less than 10 ng/ml and 360 ng/ml for the orally treated group, and in the bath-treatment group were all less than 10 ng/ml.
