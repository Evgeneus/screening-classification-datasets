Fc epsilon receptor II/CD23 positive lymphocytes in atopic dermatitis: II. Infiltration of Fc epsilon R II(+) T cells in the skin lesion.
 Cells expressing Fc receptors for IgE (Fc epsilon R II) were identified in skin from patients with atopic dermatitis (AD), eczematous dermatitis (ED), and in skin from normal nonatopic subjects, with the use of monoclonal antibodies to human lymphocyte Fc epsilon R II, H107, and to lymphoid cell-surface antigens by double immunofluorescence staining.
 Two to four percent of infiltrating mononuclear cells expressed Fc epsilon R II, and more than half of these cells were T epsilon cells in both acute and chronic AD lesions.
 Fc epsilon R II(+) T cells (T epsilon cells) bearing CD8 infiltrated preferentially acute lesions, whereas chronic lesions contained either CD8(+) or CD4(+) T epsilon cells, or both.
 Fc epsilon R II(+) cells rarely were present in ED lesions.
 There was no significant correlation between % Fc epsilon R II(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the proportion of lesional Fc epsilon R II(+) cells, extent of skin lesions, or serum IgE levels, implying the selective accumulation of Fc epsilon R II(+) cells in the inflammatory infiltrate of AD.
 These observations suggest that the increased generation of Fc epsilon R II(+) cells in skin lesions, including CD8 (+) T epsilon cells, is involved in the pathogenesis of AD.
