Astemizole, an H1 antagonist, has no additional therapeutic effect in rheumatoid arthritis.
 Mast cells are found in increased numbers in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and may play a role in synovitis.
 They produce proinflammatory substances including histamine.
 A double blind placebo controlled study was undertaken in 60 patients with active RA using the H1 receptor blocker, astemizole, as an adjuvant to usual therapies.
 After 3 months of treatment there were no significant differences in clinical and laboratory variables between the groups.
 We conclude that H1 antagonist treatment with astemizole has no additional therapeutic effect in RA.
