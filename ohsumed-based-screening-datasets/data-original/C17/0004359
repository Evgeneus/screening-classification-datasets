Vulvar melanosis.
 Vulvar melanosis is a condition in which intensely pigmented irregular macules, clinically mimicking malignant melanoma, appear on the vulva.
 A biopsy specimen shows only marked lower epidermal pigmentation without any melanocytic atypia or nesting.
 The process is benign, and reassurance is the only treatment.
