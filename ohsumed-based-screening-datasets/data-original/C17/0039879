Contact sensitization to textile dyes: description of 100 subjects.
 We have described 100 subjects sensitized to textile dyes.
 Of these, 16 had clinically been suspected of having a textile dermatitis from among 1145 patients referred for patch testing.
 41 patients were identified from among 861 consecutive subjects tested with the GIRDCA (Italian Research Group on Contact and Environmental Dermatitis) standard series supplemented with 4 disperse dyes (Disperse Blue 124, Disperse Red 1, Disperse Yellow 3, Disperse Orange 3).
 The remaining 43 patients were identified from among 746 subjects tested with the GIRDCA standard series, supplemented with the 4 disperse dyes mentioned above and a further series of 12 other textile dyes.
 The clinical picture was extremely variable: most patients had a typical eczematous dermatitis, but we also observed persistent erythematous-wheal-type reactions, a transient urticarial dermatitis and an erythema-multiforme-like eruption.
 Among these textile dyes, Disperse Blue 124 caused most reactions.
 With the addition of the 4 disperse dyes to the GIRDCA standard series, we identified 4.8% sensitized to textile dyes, a much higher figure than the 1.4% observed among patients being patch tested on the basis of their history and the clinical findings; the addition of a further 12 textile dyes to the series further increased the detection rate to 5.8%.
 We stress the importance of routinely patch testing with textile dyes, which can help to elucidate the cause of certain kinds of atypical dermatitis.
