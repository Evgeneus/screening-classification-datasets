Morphological evidence for calcium-dependent association of calgranulin with the epidermal cytoskeleton in inflammatory dermatoses.
 The association of calgranulins, intracellular calcium-binding proteins, with the keratinocyte cytoskeleton has been studied.
 These molecules are expressed in various inflammatory dermatoses and in organ-culture explants.
 Triton X-100 extraction in the presence of calcium or EDTA suggested that calgranulins are detergent insoluble in the presence of calcium.
 The molecules were localized in a plaque-like structure at the cell periphery in lesional skin and in organ-culture explants.
 Following induction of calgranulins in vitro there was a redistribution of the intermediate filament cytoskeleton into a perinuclear halo, although desmosomes remained intact.
 These various features suggest that these members of the S-100 protein family have a role in cytoskeletal changes seen in various skin diseases.
