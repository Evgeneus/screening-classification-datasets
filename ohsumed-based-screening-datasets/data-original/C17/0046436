Testis cancer. Ichthyosis constitutes a significant risk factor.
 Testis cancer and ichthyosis are both relatively rare diseases.
 Hence the finding of six individuals with both these conditions in a small population with testicular cancer is highly conspicuous and indicates some kind of connection among such persons.
 Despite the identical clinical appearances of their ichthyoses, three of the ichthyotic subjects had no measurable activity of the enzyme, steroid sulfatase (STS) in leucocytes, a distinct characteristic of recessive X-linked ichthyosis (RXLI).
 However, the remaining three subjects had normal STS activity, a strong indicator of autosomal dominant ichthyosis (ADI).
 The STS activity in patients with testicular cancer who do not have ichthyosis (N = 30) was also within the normal range.
 The patients with testicular cancer with no skin disease had elevated serum levels of 4-androstenedione (4-AD), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) but had reduced levels of estrone and estrone sulfate.
 The other serum parameters measured did not significantly differ from normal levels.
 In essence, the hormone levels obtained for the patients with ichthyotic testicular cancer followed the same pattern, although their dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and estrone sulfate levels tended to be slightly higher than normal.
 However, no conspicuous aberrations in any of the parameters examined were observed, and why men with ichthyosis are at high risk for testicular cancer remains an unresolved issue.
