Structural requirements for recognition of the HLA-Dw14 class II epitope: a key HLA determinant associated with rheumatoid arthritis.
 Although HLA genes have been shown to be associated with certain diseases, the basis for this association is unknown.
 Recent studies, however, have documented patterns of nucleotide sequence variation among some HLA genes associated with a particular disease.
 For rheumatoid arthritis, HLA genes in most patients have a shared nucleotide sequence encoding a key structural element of an HLA class II polypeptide; this sequence element is critical for the interaction of the HLA molecule with antigenic peptides and with responding T cells, suggestive of a direct role for this sequence element in disease susceptibility.
 We describe the serological and cellular immunologic characteristics encoded by this rheumatoid arthritis-associated sequence element.
 Site-directed mutagenesis of the DRB1 gene was used to define amino acids critical for antibody and T-cell recognition of this structural element, focusing on residues that distinguish the rheumatoid arthritis-associated alleles Dw4 and Dw14 from a closely related allele, Dw10, not associated with disease.
 Both the gain and loss of rheumatoid arthritis-associated epitopes were highly dependent on three residues within a discrete domain of the HLA-DR molecule.
 Recognition was most strongly influenced by the following amino acids (in order): 70 greater than 71 greater than 67.
 Some alloreactive T-cell clones were also influenced by amino acid variation in portions of the DR molecule lying outside the shared sequence element.
