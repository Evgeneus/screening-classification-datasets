Computer-assisted image analysis of skin surface replicas.
 Using a rubber-based dental impression material, negative surface impressions were made of demarcated areas of skin and prepared as dry specimens for scanning-electron microscopy.
 Electron micrographs were taken at low magnification and, using a programmed computer-assisted image analyser, it was possible to represent quantitatively the topography of that particular body site according to the degree of circularity of the various geometric subunits.
 This technique was most applicable to skin topography with a reliable geometrical pattern of triangles and squares, a feature of hair-bearing surfaces in general and in particular, the antecubital fossa.
 Using standardized trauma of various types the origin of skin surface markings were found to be located in the dermis.
 The technique was applied to the healing of experimental trauma produced by tape stripping, the resolution of clinical eczema and a comparison of steroid-treated and untreated tape-stripped skin.
