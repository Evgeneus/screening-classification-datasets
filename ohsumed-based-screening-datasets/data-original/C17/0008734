Conjunctival involvement in pemphigus vulgaris: a clinical, histopathological and immunofluorescence study.
 Eleven patients with pemphigus vulgaris and with eye complaints had histopathological and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) studies on biopsies of their conjunctivae.
 In eight of the patients the ocular symptoms preceded the other manifestations of pemphigus.
 None of the 11 patients had any detectable conjunctival blisters or erosions.
 The conjunctivitis in three of the patients proved on histopathology and DIF to be a manifestation of pemphigus vulgaris.
 In the remaining patients, conjunctival hyperaemia with or without a mucoid discharge was observed, but there were no specific histopathological features, although one of them had a positive DIF.
