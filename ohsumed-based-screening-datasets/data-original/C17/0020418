Proliferating cells in psoriatic dermis are comprised primarily of T cells, endothelial cells, and factor XIIIa+ perivascular dendritic cells.
 Determination of the cell types proliferating in the dermis of patients with psoriasis should identify those cells experiencing activation or responding to growth factors in the psoriatic dermal milieu.
 Toward that end, sections of formalin-fixed biopsies obtained from 3H-deoxyuridine (3H-dU)-injected skin of eight psoriatic patients were immunostained, followed by autoradiography.
 Proliferating dermal cells exhibit silver grains from tritium emissions.
 The identity of the proliferating cells could then be determined by simultaneous visualization with antibodies specific for various cell types.
 UCHL1+ (CD45RO+) T cells (recall antigen-reactive helper T-cell subset) constituted 36.6 +/- 3.1% (mean +/- SEM, n = 6) of the proliferating dermal cells in involved skin, whereas Leu 18+ (CD45RA+) T cells (recall antigen naive T-cell subsets) comprised only 8.7 +/- 1.5% (n = 6).
 The Factor XIIIa+ dermal perivascular dendritic cell subset (24.9 +/- 1.5% of proliferating dermal cells, n = 6) and Factor VIII+ endothelial cells (23.0 +/- 2.3%, n = 6) represented the two other major proliferating populations in lesional psoriatic dermis.
 Differentiated tissue macrophages, identified by phase microscopy as melanophages or by immunostaining with antibodies to Leu M1 (CD15) or myeloid histiocyte antigen, comprised less than 5% of the proliferating population in either skin type.
 In addition to calculating the relative proportions of these cells to each other as percent, we also determined the density of cells, in cells/mm2 of tissue.
 The density of proliferating cells within these populations was increased in involved versus uninvolved skin: UCHL1+, 9.0 +/- 1.7 cells/mm2 versus 1.8 +/- 0.6 cells/mm2, p less than 0.01; Factor XIIIa+, 6.0 +/- 0.7 cells/mm2 versus 1.5 +/- 0.5 cells/mm2, p less than 0.01; Factor VIII+, 5.5 +/- 1.4 cells/mm2 versus 0.0 cells/mm2, p less than 0.05.
 The presence of preferential active proliferation of a T-cell subset in lesional dermis suggests that activating signals specific for this subset are contained within the psoriatic dermis in vivo.
 The activation of recall antigen-reactive T cells may be a driving force behind the dendritic cell and endothelial cell proliferation.
 Alternatively, the selective proliferation and expansion of these two constitutive cell types (Factor XIIIa+ and Factor VIII+) may result in signals that promote activation of UCHL1+ (CD45RO+) T cells.
