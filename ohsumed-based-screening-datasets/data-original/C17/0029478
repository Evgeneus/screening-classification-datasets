Acute intermittent porphyria with atypical neuropathy.
 The patient we have described had lower extremity numbness, paresthesias, constipation, urinary retention, and sexual dysfunction.
 Laboratory evaluation confirmed a diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP).
 Vitamin B6 and glucose therapy initiated resolution of symptoms.
 The sensory neuropathy described here is unusual, and we believe sexual dysfunction is a previously unreported manifestation of AIP.
