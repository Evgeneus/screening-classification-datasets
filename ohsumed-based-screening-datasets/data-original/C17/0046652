T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder arising in a background of autoimmune disease and terminating in plasma cell dyscrasia with primary amyloidosis.
 T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder, a syndrome of T-cell lymphocytosis with neutropenia has been described in patients with various autoimmune disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis.
 We report a case of T-gamma-lymphoproliferative disorder occurring in a 42-year-old white woman with a long history of dermatitis herpetiformis and subsequent development of Coomb's positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia and polymyositis.
 The peripheral blood lymphocytes showed the T-suppressor cell phenotype (CD2-, CD3-, CD8-, and CD4-).
 DNA analysis of the peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed a T-cell receptor beta-chain gene rearrangement and an immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement.
 The patient's course was marked by numerous bouts of infection.
 The unique factor in this patient was the development of a plasma cell dyscrasia and amyloidosis prior to death.
