A ganglion of the temporomandibular joint: a case report.
 Ganglion cysts of the TMJ are rare and accurate preoperative diagnosis is not usually made, although theoretically this might be possible with arthrography.
 Treatment of the condition is surgical but, if a positive diagnosis can be made, a period of conservative management could be attempted if the cyst is not excessively painful or surgery is contraindicated for any reason.
