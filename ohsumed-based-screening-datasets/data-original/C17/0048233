Long-term treatment of hirsutism: desogestrel compared with cyproterone acetate in oral contraceptives.
 OBJECTIVE: Effectiveness of 2-year treatment of hirsutism with low estrogen oral contraceptives (OCs) containing nonandrogenic or antiandrogenic progestogen.
 Evaluation of changes in plasma lipids.
 DESIGN: Ten patients treated with desogestrel 150 micrograms + 30 micrograms ethinyl estradiol, 6 with desogestrel 150 micrograms + 50 micrograms ethinyl estradiol, 10 with cyproterone acetate 2 mg + 35 micrograms ethinyl estradiol.
 Random allocation.
 Paired comparisons.
 Control group: 19 normal women, not treated.
 SETTING: Academic tertiary care.
 PATIENTS: Women with hirsutism (idiopathic and/or polycystic ovary), 24 of 26 completed treatment.
 INTERVENTION: Two-year treatment.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Hirsutism score, plasma testosterone, and lipids.
 RESULTS: Initial hirsutism scores (11.8 +/- 0.6 SE) declined with treatment (-7.2 +/- 0.4, P less than 0.01) to 4.7 +/- 0.6, almost reaching control (3.6 +/- 0.3).
 Initial plasma cholesterol (4.33 mmol/L +/- 0.30 SE), similar to control (4.78 +/- 0.24), increased slowly over 2 years (+2.04 +/- 0.34, P less than 0.01).
 High-density lipoproteins cholesterol (1.05 mmol/L +/- 0.04 SE), similar to control (1.12 +/- 0.07), did not change the 1st year and increased at 2 years (+0.57 +/- 0.11, P less than 0.01).
 No differences appeared among treatment groups.
 CONCLUSIONS: Treatment is very effective, 2 years for best results.
 The OCs tested are equally efficacious.
 Changes in plasma lipids are of some concern but of difficult interpretation.
