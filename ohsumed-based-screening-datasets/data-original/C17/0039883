alpha-Peroxyachifolid and other new sensitizing sesquiterpene lactones from yarrow (Achillea millefolium L., Compositae).
 Yarrow, Achillea millefolium L., is one of the commonest weeds of the Compositae family.
 Cases of allergic contact dermatitis have been described since 1899.
 Although 10 sesquiterpene lactones (SL) and 3 polyines have previously been identified, the sensitizers of yarrow have escaped detection.
 A reinvestigation of short ether extracts of yarrow revealed the presence of 5 unsaturated hitherto unknown guaianolides of peroxide character.
 The main SL, identified as a strong sensitizer in guinea pig sensitization experiments, was named alpha-peroxyachifolid.
 The minor SL also contribute marginally to the sensitizing capacity, while other known yarrow constituents like dehydromatricaria ester and pontica epoxide appear to play no role.
 A 5-year follow-up (1985-1990) of Compositae-sensitive patients showed that more than 50% reacted when tested with a short ether extract of yarrow.
 Exacerbation of the patch test sites by irradiation with UV light was never observed.
