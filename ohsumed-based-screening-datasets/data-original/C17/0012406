A report on radiation-induced gliomas.
 Radiation-induced gliomas are uncommon, with only 73 cases on record to date.
 The disease that most frequently occasioned radiation therapy has been acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).
 Three more cases are added here, two after irradiation for ALL and one after irradiation for tinea capitis.
 In a review of the relevant literature, the authors stress the possibility that the ALL-glioma and the retinoblastoma-glioma links point to syndromes in their own right that may occur without radiation therapy.
