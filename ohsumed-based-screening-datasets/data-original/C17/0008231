Auro-nasopharyngeal polyp and cholesteatoma.
 We report the association of an auronasopharyngeal polyp arising in a congenitally abnormal middle ear and Eustachian tube.
 Subsequently, ten years after removal of the polyp and insertion of a ventilation tube, there was recurrence of the polyp in association with cholesteatoma of the middle ear.
