Neuropeptides in psoriasis: an immunocytochemical and radioimmunoassay study.
 The present study examines the presence of neuropeptides in the skin and plasma of patients with psoriasis using the techniques of immunocytochemistry and radioimmunoassay.
 Immunocytochemistry failed to demonstrate differences in the pattern of neuropeptide innervation in psoriatic lesional skin when compared to normal skin.
 However, radioimmunoassay of skin biopsy extracts, both substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, were significantly elevated in psoriatic lesional skin when compared with both psoriatic non-lesional and normal control skin (p less than 0.001).
 There was no significant difference between the plasma levels of neuropeptides in psoriatic patients compared to those of control subjects, and no significant correlation among the plasma levels of neuropeptides with the surface area of involvement with psoriasis.
 The finding of elevated levels of substance P and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide in lesional psoriatic skin suggests that these peptides may be involved in the pathogenesis or maintenance of the psoriatic skin lesion and the development of safe and stable antagonists of these neuropeptides may have applications in the treatment of psoriasis.
