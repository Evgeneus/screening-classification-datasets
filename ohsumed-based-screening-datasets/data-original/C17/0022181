Topical metronidazole in the treatment of perioral dermatitis.
 The twice-daily topical application of 1% metroindazole cream was compared with 250 mg oral tetracycline, taken twice daily, in the treatment of perioral dermatitis in a prospective, double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, multicenter trial.
 One hundred eight patients were treated for 8 weeks.
 At the end of this time the median number of papules in the metronidazole-treated group was reduced to 8% of the initial number, and the median number in the group treated with tetracycline was reduced to 0% of the initial number.
 Although both treatments were effective, oral tetracycline was significantly more effective than topical metronidazole.
