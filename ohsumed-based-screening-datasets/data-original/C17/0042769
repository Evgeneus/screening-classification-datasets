The ethics of pressure sore prevention and treatment in the elderly: a practical approach.
 The management of pressure sores in elderly patients raises a number of ethical dilemmas for health care professionals.
 Aggressive treatment of advanced pressure sores is often inconsistent with the overall goals of therapy.
 Private and public funding for effective prevention and early treatment are restricted and constrained.
 Little information is available that proves treatment efficacy.
 Health care professionals and their institutions are often stigmatized by the occurrence of a pressure sore even though accountabilities may lie in the natural history of the disease.
 We use case analysis to identify ethical dilemmas in pressure sore prevention and management and suggest a framework for ethical decisionmaking so that health care professionals and public policy analysts can make informed judgments about patients and standards of quality care.
