Increased IL-6 production by monocytes and keratinocytes in patients with psoriasis.
 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a multifunctional inflammatory cytokine that is produced by monocytes and keratinocytes upon stimulation.
 Because psoriasis is a skin disease characterized by a hyperproliferative activity of keratinocytes and an inflammatory infiltrate, in the present study IL-6 production of monocytes and keratinocytes of patients with psoriasis was investigated.
 Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from psoriatics, atopics, and healthy controls were incubated for 24 h and, subsequently, supernatant IL-6 activity was measured using an IL-6-dependent hybridoma cell line (B9).
 Compared to controls and atopics, PBMC of psoriatics produced significantly increased amounts of biologically active IL-6.
 These findings were also confirmed by Western blot analysis using a specific antiserum directed against IL-6.
 Moreover, when the sera of the same patients were tested for IL-6 activity, sera of psoriatics contained significantly elevated amounts of circulating IL-6 in comparison to samples from atopics and healthy controls.
 In contrast to normal or uninvolved skin, keratinocytes in psoriatic lesions were remarkably positive for IL-6 as detected by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.
 In addition, IL-6 also was found to induce its own synthesis and release by monocytes.
 These findings indicate that keratinocytes and monocytes in psoriasis are activated to produce increased amounts of IL-6, which may be one of the mediators involved in the regulation of both local and systemic inflammatory reactions occurring in skin diseases such as psoriasis.
