The prevalence and nature of podiatric problems in elderly diabetic patients.
 To determine if diabetes in the elderly is associated with increased prevalence of podiatric problems, a random sample of diabetic patients (n = 74) was compared to a group of elderly non-diabetic patients (n = 79).
 The two groups were comparable in age (range 70-90 years), smoking habits, and consumption of alcohol.
 The mean duration of diabetes was 14.5 +/- 11.7 years (+/- SD), and mean serum fructosamine level was 3.3 +/- 0.66 mmol/L.
 The number of medical diagnoses and medications used was significantly higher in the diabetic group.
 Diabetic patients had modestly higher prevalence of neuropathy, vascular disease, kidney disease, and eye complications.
 The most common podiatric problem in both groups was elongated toenails.
 The prevalence of podiatric problems such as cellulitis, amputation, tinea pedia, onychomycosis, calluses, bunions, and hammer toe deformity were not increased in diabetic patients.
 Active foot ulcers were more common in diabetic patients (13/74 vs 5/79, P less than 0.05).
 It is concluded that diabetes in the elderly, unlike in young patients, increases the risk of foot problems only marginally.
