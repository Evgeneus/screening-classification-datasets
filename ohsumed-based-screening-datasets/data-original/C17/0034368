Piezogenic wrist papules: a common and asymptomatic finding.
 The first description of piezogenic wrist papules is presented.
 Twenty-nine persons were examined; 76% had pedal papules and 86% had wrist papules.
 Piezogenic papules are a common, nonhereditary finding and are not secondary to an inherent connective tissue defect.
