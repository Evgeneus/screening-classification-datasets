Acne fulminans with hepatosplenomegaly and erythema nodosum migrans.
 Acne fulminans is a rare form of acne characterized by ulcerative nodules and associated with systemic complications.
 We report the case of a 17-year-old boy with cystic acne who experienced sudden onset of acne fulminans associated with fever, weight loss, hepatosplenomegaly, and erythema nodosum migrans.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acne fulminans manifested by hepatomegaly and erythema nodosum migrans.
