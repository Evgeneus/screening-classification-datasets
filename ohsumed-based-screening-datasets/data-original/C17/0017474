Mycetoma: comparison of MR imaging with CT.
 Magnetic resonance (MR) images obtained in 18 patients with pathologically confirmed mycetoma in the body (n = 4) or lower extremity (n = 14) were retrospectively reviewed and compared with computed tomographic (CT) scans in 15 patients and surgical findings in 10.
 T1-weighted images showed an infiltrating mass (same signal intensity as muscle) involving skin, subcutaneous fat, muscles, tendons, and other tissues.
 On T2-weighted images, the mass and affected structures showed moderately increased signal intensity.
 Bone marrow involvement was detected in seven patients and was best visualized on T1-weighted images.
 CT showed moderate enhancement of the infiltrative process in all patients.
 Bone changes, seen in nine, included coarse trabeculation, periosteal reaction, endosteal proliferation, and patchy destruction.
 MR imaging and CT were comparable and correlated well with surgery in showing the extent of soft-tissue involvement.
 Early bone changes (important for therapy planning for pedal mycetoma) were seen only at CT.
 The study showed that MR imaging is sensitive for assessing the extent of mycetoma in the soft tissues.
 CT should be the method of choice for staging pedal lesions because it can be used to detect early bone involvement.
