The prevention and management of postdermabrasion complications.
 The complications of keloids, pigment changes, loss of skin texture, and enlarged facial pores remain a problem with dermabrasion patients.
 Their occurrence can be reduced by proper patient selection, proper dermabrasion technique, proper wound management, and prompt treatment.
 Keloids are rapidly resolved with the use of flurandrenolide tape covered with positive-pressure chin-strap dressings.
 Streaks of hyperpigmentation are lightened with a combination of sunscreen, opaque makeup, tretinoin, and hydroquinone lotions.
 The loss of skin texture can be prevented by not abrading too deeply and avoiding subsequent bacterial contamination during wound healing.
 However, enlarged skin pores in the central portion of the face and hypopigmentation can be permanent complications.
