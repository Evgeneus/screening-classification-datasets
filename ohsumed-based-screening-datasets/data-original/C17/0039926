Therapeutic use of cytokines in dermatology.
 Cytokines are glycoproteins produced by many different cells.
 Via binding to specific receptors on target cells they regulate the activation, differentiation, and proliferation of immune and nonimmune cells.
 After injury keratinocytes synthesize and release cytokines such as interleukins, colony stimulating factors, and growth factors.
 In addition, a network of interacting cytokines appears to be crucial to maintain proper balance.
 Dysregulation may contribute to certain diseases, particularly those of infectious and autoimmune origin.
 Therefore many of these mediators appear to be promising candidates to treat infectious and malignant diseases.
 This article briefly discusses the most important cytokines.
 Newly developed regimens with cytokines to treat cutaneous disorders will be reviewed.
