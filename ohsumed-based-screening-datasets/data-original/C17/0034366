Effect of PUVA on immunologic and virologic findings in HIV-infected patients.
 Psoralen and UVA radiation inactivate human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in vitro whereas UVB and UVC radiation under experimental conditions transactivate HIV.
 We studied the effect of systemic PUVA treatment on immunologic and virologic findings in five HIV-infected patients.
 Systemic PUVA was given in two-4-week periods, 2 months apart.
 The total irradiation ranged from 30 to 262 joules/cm2.
 All skin lesions, including therapy-resistant psoriasis vulgaris, seborrheic dermatitis, folliculitis, and chronic urticaria, cleared during the first weeks of PUVA.
 A slight increase in the CD4 lymphocyte numbers was seen in two patients.
 Serum beta 2-microglobulin values and urine neopterin values remained steady, and the elevated serum immunoglobulin values became normal in all patients.
 The PUVA treatment did not induce appearance of HIV antigen in serum and HIV isolation was repeatedly negative in all patients whose cultures were initially negative.
 Lymphocyte recall responses to purified protein derivative (tuberculin) became positive in three and to HIV-specific antigens in two patients.
 These responses, however, were transient.
 All patients except one, who was positive for HIV antigen at entry, have remained well 1 year after PUVA therapy.
