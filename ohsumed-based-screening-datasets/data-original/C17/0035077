Protein kinase C activity in normal and psoriatic cells: cultures of fibroblasts and lymphocytes.
 Protein kinase C (PKC) activity was measured in cultures of fibroblasts from biopsies of the involved and uninvolved skin of seven patients with psoriasis and from the skin biopsies of nine normal controls.
 PKC activity was significantly increased (P less than 0.005) in the particulate fraction of fibroblasts obtained from the involved areas of skin (450 +/- SEM 89 pmol/mg protein/3 min) and the uninvolved skin (394 +/- 94 pmol/mg protein/3 min) in psoriasis as compared to that of controls (103 +/- 24 pmol/mg protein/3 min).
 The soluble fraction of PKC activity was comparable in controls and in the fibroblasts obtained from involved areas and not significantly different from the values in fibroblasts from uninvolved skin.
 PKC activity was also measured in the soluble and particulate fractions of lymphocytes from 13 patients with psoriasis and from 14 normal controls.
 The PKC activity did not differ in the lymphocytes of patients with psoriasis from the controls in either the cytosolic or the membrane fractions.
 The increase in PKC activity as expressed at the membrane level of psoriatic fibroblasts may be related to an increase in sensitivity of these cells to hormones or growth factors involved in the regulation of their growth.
