Successful treatment of primary progressive follicular mucinosis with interferons.
 Follicular mucinosis is a primary idiopathic disease or a secondary, lymphoma-associated dermatosis.
 An effective standard therapy for the benign group is unknown.
 We describe a patient with primary benign disseminated progressive follicular mucinosis who was successfully treated with recombinant interferon alfa-2b and interferon-gamma.
 Interferons might act by down-regulation of activated inflammatory cells and/or by induction of enhanced elimination of extracellular mucin via increasing phagocytosis by macrophages.
