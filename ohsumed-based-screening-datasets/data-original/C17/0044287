Anetodermic prurigo nodularis (with Pautrier's neuroma) responsive to arotinoid acid.
 A woman had symmetrically distributed pruritic nodules for more than 40 years.
 Microscopically they were characterized by proliferation of nonmyelinated nerve fibers (Pautrier's neuroma) and a total absence of epidermal involvement.
 Anetoderma developed at the site of former nodules.
 Her condition responded favorably to repeated retinoid therapy with regression of nodules in those sites in which retinoid dermatitis had developed.
