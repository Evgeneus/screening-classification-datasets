Occupational contact dermatitis due to acrylonitrile.
 Within DSM Chemicals BV, a producer of acrylonitrile, skin complaints are frequent.
 The majority of these are of an irritant nature, while a smaller portion is based on acquired allergies.
 Allergological examination revealed 5 employees with an allergy to acrylonitrile.
 1 of these subjects also developed paraesthesiae in the skin sites affected, a finding not previously described for acrylonitrile.
 In the guinea pig maximization test (GPMT), acrylonitrile showed strong allergenic potential.
 For prevention and treatment of contact allergologic disorders, close cooperation between occupational health officer, dermatologist and toxicologist in chemical companies is recommended.
