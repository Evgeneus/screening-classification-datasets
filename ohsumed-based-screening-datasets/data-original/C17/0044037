Cutaneous manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Part I.
 The prevalence of dermatologic problems during the course of human immunodeficiency virus infection makes knowledge of these skin manifestations imperative to all practicing dermatologists.
 Detection of early infection is encouraged as effective therapy now exists both to delay the progression of human immunodeficiency virus-induced immunodeficiency and to prevent opportunistic infections.
 Skin manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus infection discussed in this article include the following groups: neoplastic, ie, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and squamous cell carcinoma; infectious, ie, viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoal, and arthropod infestations; and a miscellaneous group including papulosquamous, papular, vascular, autoimmune, oral, and drug-related skin disorders.
