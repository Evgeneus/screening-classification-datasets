Benign persistent papular acantholytic and dyskeratotic eruption: a case report and review of the literature.
 We report a case of a 35-year-old female with a persistent pruritic acantholytic and dyskeratotic eruption on the chest and vulva.
 The light and electron microscopic studies showed suprabasal epidermal clefting with acantholysis and dyskeratotic cells.
 We suggest that the most appropriate term for this case is that of benign persistent papular acantholytic and dyskeratotic eruption.
