Neonatal skin disorders.
 Skin disorders are commonly seen in the neonatal period.
 A recent survey of neonates demonstrated that almost every neonate had some skin lesion.
 The most common skin findings are desquamation, Epstein's pearls, sebaceous hyperplasia, milia, toxic erythema, salmon patch, hypertrichosis, and Mongolian spot.
 In addition to these common cutaneous findings, other disorders may exist and are discussed in this article.
