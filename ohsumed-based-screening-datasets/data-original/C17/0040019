Antibodies to IL-3 and IL-4 suppress helminth-induced intestinal mastocytosis.
 Rodents infected with the nematode parasite Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (Nb) develop intestinal mastocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels.
 Although IL-4 and IL-5 are necessary for stimulation of IgE synthesis and eosinophilia, respectively, the cytokines that regulate gut mast cell hyperplasia have not been identified.
 To address this question, 6- to 8-wk-old BALB/c mice were injected on day 0 and day 7 of Nb infection with a rat anti-mouse IL-4 mAb, and with polyclonal sheep (day 0) and rabbit (day 7) anti-mouse IL-3 IgG antibodies.
 Additional Nb-infected mice received equal doses of isotype- and species-matched control antibodies.
 Mice were sacrificed on days 12 or 13 post-infection, and mucosal mast cells (MMC) in sections of the small intestine were enumerated.
 Nb infection induced a 25- to 40-fold increase in MMC over that observed in uninfected controls.
 Anti-IL-3 or anti-IL-4 alone suppressed the Nb-induced MMC response by 40 to 50%, whereas both antibodies combined suppressed the MMC response by 85 to 90%.
 Anti-IL-3 alone had no effect on the serum IgE levels, which were essentially abrogated in the Nb-infected mice treated with anti-IL-4.
 Blood eosinophilia was not affected by treatment with anti-IL-3 and/or anti-IL-4.
 These studies demonstrate that IL-3 and IL-4 are physiologically important stimuli of mastocytosis in vivo, and suggest therapeutic interventions that may counteract adverse host responses to allergens as well as to parasites.
