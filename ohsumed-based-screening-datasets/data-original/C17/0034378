Alopecia totalis: is treating nonresponder patients useful?
 The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of different treatments in patients with alopecia totalis or universalis who did not respond to sensitizing therapies.
 Twenty-six patients, who had been receiving sensitizing therapy for at least 1 year without any response, were randomly assigned to receive the following treatments: topical 10% cyclosporine in oily solution (eight patients), PUVA (eight patients), and intravenous thymopentin (ten patients).
 None of them had any acceptable regrowth after at least 6 months of treatment.
 Our results suggest that other treatments are not useful in patients with 100% hair loss who fail to respond to sensitizing therapies.
