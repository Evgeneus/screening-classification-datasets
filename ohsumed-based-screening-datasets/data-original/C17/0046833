Homozygous tyrosinase gene mutation in an American black with tyrosinase-negative (type IA) oculocutaneous albinism.
 We have identified a tyrosinase gene mutation in an American black with classic, tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism.
 This mutation results in an amino acid substitution (Cys----Arg) at codon 89 of the tyrosinase polypeptide.
 The proband is homozygous for the substitution, suggesting that this mutation may be frequently associated with tyrosinase-negative oculocutaneous albinism in blacks.
