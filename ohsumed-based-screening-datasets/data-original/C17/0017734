Flecked retina associated with ring 17 chromosome.
 We report the case of a mentally retarded male with a ring 17 chromosome who had subretinal drusen-like deposits in each eye.
 This is the second report of flecked retina in a patient with ring 17 chromosome, suggesting that there may be a causal relationship between abnormalities of chromosome 17 and retinal pigment epithelial or photoreceptor dysfunction.
