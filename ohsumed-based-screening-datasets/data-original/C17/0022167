Scabies presenting as bullous pemphigoid-like eruption.
 Several diseases, at times, may be confused with scabies.
 We report the diagnosis and treatment of scabies in two patients.
 Their eruptions recurred and persisted and eventually developed blisters.
 The skin biopsy specimens submitted for light microscopy and immunofluorescence were considered to be consistent with bullous pemphigoid.
 Both patients were treated successfully with lindane and remained disease free for up to 6 months of follow-up.
