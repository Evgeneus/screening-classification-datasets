Histology of aural polyp as a predictor of middle ear disease activity.
 This study compares the histology of aural polyp with the subsequent clinical course of the middle ear disease.
 All cases of aural polyps that presented to the department during 1988 and 1989 were included.
 Patients who had previous ear surgery were excluded as were cases where the operation was part of clearance of known cholesteatoma rather than polypectomy alone.
 We found that the histology of the aural polyp was not a precise predictor of the presence or absence of cholesteatoma, nor of the subsequent course of the middle ear disease.
