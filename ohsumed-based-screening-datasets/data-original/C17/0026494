Surgical management of primary hyperhidrosis.
 Primary hyperhidrosis, although lacking a precise definition and of unknown aetiology, disrupts professional and social life and may lead to emotional problems.
 A variety of treatment methods are used to control or reduce the profuse sweating which involves mainly the palms, soles and axillae.
 The simplest method, the application of topical agents, is usually attempted first for axillary and plantar sweating.
 Iontophoresis may provide relief especially in patients with plantar or palmar involvement.
 In severe cases operative intervention is necessary.
 Excision of sweat glands is successful in patients with axillary hyperhidrosis but the role of suction-assisted removal of axillary sweat glands remains to be determined.
 Sympathectomy remains the standard by which other treatments must be judged.
 For upper thoracic sympathectomy a variety of surgical approaches are used with satisfactory relief of hyperhidrosis.
 Complications related to the surgical approach, such as Horner's syndrome, brachial plexus injuries, pneumothorax and painful scars may occur, while following sympathectomy compensatory hyperhidrosis is usual and hyperhidrosis may recur.
 Plantar hyperhidrosis which may be exacerbated or ameliorated by upper thoracic sympathectomy and which fails to respond to non-operative intervention is relieved by lumbar sympathectomy.
