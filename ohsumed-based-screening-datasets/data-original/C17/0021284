Primary total knee arthroplasty in patients with psoriasis.
 Between 1976 and 1988, 50 primary total knee arthroplasties were performed on 34 patients with psoriasis vulgaris.
 The skin lesions were graded for severity in all patients and the extent of affected body surface was mapped.
 All patients received peri-operative antibiotics.
 Only one deep infection, with Staphylococcus aureus, occurred 25 months after operation.
 The average length of follow-up was nearly four and a half years, being to a minimum of two years or until failure of the arthroplasty.
 There appears to be no increased risk of deep infection in patient with psoriasis vulgaris undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty.
