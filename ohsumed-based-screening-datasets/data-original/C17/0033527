Upper keratinocytes of psoriatic skin lesions express high levels of NAP-1/IL-8 mRNA in situ.
 In order to better understand the factors regulating disease promotion and activity in psoriasis (PS), we searched for the in situ expression of mRNA for various cytokines in long-standing PS skin lesions.
 Specific hybridization with a NAP-1/IL-8 anti-sense RNA probe was keratinocyte associated and yielded strong and specific signals exclusively in the upper layers of the lesional epidermis, but not in uninvolved skin from psoriatic patients or normal skin from non-psoriatics.
 Interestingly, NAP-1/IL-8 transcripts were focally clustered in a spotty pattern predominantly between the tips of elongated papillae, but were absent in the lower epidermal region and the dermal compartment.
 We consistently failed to detect appreciable numbers of TNF-alpha and/or IL-6 mRNA-containing cells in psoriatic lesions.
 These results support the notion that IL-8, rather than IL-6, is an important disease-promoting cytokine in PS.
 In view of the known in vitro and in vivo effects of IL-8, it is conceivable that this substance greatly contributes to the major pathologic changes seen in psoriatic skin, i.e., keratinocyte hyperproliferation and leucocyte infiltration.
 In this case, local pharmacologic down-regulation of NAP-1/IL-8 activity could be a promising therapeutic strategy in PS.
