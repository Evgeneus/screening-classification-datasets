Diagnostic accuracy of thallium-201 myocardial perfusion imaging.
 Myocardial thallium-201 (Tl-201) imaging performed in conjunction with exercise stress has enhanced the accuracy of detecting coronary artery disease among patients with chest pain.
 Sensitivity and specificity of qualitative visual Tl-201 scintigraphy for detection of coronary artery disease average 84% and 87%, respectively.
 Quantitative analysis of planar Tl-201 scintigrams has yielded sensitivity and specificity in the 90% range.
 Single photon emission computed tomographic imaging is associated with even higher sensitivity but with specificity in the 82-85% range.
 Perfusion defects representing ischemia can now be distinguished from scar by demonstration of delayed Tl-201 redistribution or enhanced uptake after reinjection of a second dose of Tl-201.
 Stenoses of the left circumflex coronary artery are less easily detected than lesions of the right and left anterior descending coronary arteries.
 False-positive Tl-201 perfusion defects may occur as a result of attenuation artifacts, most often caused by overlying breast tissue or by a high left hemidiaphragm.
 Patient motion during acquisition of single photon emission computed tomographic images results in artifactual defects on reconstruction.
 Abnormal Tl-201 uptake has been noted in patients with 1) left bundle branch block and normal coronary arteries, 2) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and 3) progressive systemic sclerosis.
