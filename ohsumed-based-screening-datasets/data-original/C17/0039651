The effect of topical administration of indomethacin on symptoms in corneal scars and edema.
 We conducted a masked randomized study of 50 patients to evaluate the effect of administration of topical indomethacin 1% suspension on symptoms in corneal scars, edema, infiltrates, and erosions.
 Patients with symptoms (photophobia, pain, itching, burning sensation, foreign-body sensation, and tearing) were treated with topically administered indomethacin 1% or placebo and monitored for eight weeks.
 The severity of the complaints was rated and the scores were evaluated (Wilcoxon rank-sum test).
 Of the 25 patients treated with indomethacin, 21 (84%) had improvement in symptoms and the severity of each of the symptoms was significantly decreased.
 Of the 25 patients treated with placebo, one (4%) had improvement in symptoms without statistical change of the severity of the symptoms.
 However, when the placebo-treated patients received indomethacin drops, the symptoms were significantly decreased (P less than .002).
 This study suggests that topical administration of indomethacin 1% may reduce ocular symptoms in patients with corneal scars, edema, or erosions.
