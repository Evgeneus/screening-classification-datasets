A novel autoantibody reactive with a 48 kDa tRNA associated protein in patients with scleroderma.
 We identify 4 patients with progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS) possessing a previously undescribed serum anti-tRNA Ab (anti-Wa antibody).
 These sera yielded identical precipitin lines under double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extract and supernatant of pig spleen homogenate as antigen sources.
 Furthermore, all 4 sera were found to react with a 48 kDa protein using immunoblotting.
 This protein was subsequently found to be associated with tRNA when immunoprecipitation was conducted.
 In a survey of autoimmune patients' sera, anti-Wa Ab was observed in 3% (4 of 130) of patients with PSS, but not in other systemic rheumatic diseases.
 None of the 4 patients with PSS with anti-Wa Ab had myositis except that one patient complained of mild myalgia.
