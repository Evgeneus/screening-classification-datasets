Ultrasonic surgical aspiration in the treatment of vulvar disease.
 Ultrasonic surgical aspiration is a useful technique for safe and accurate tissue removal.
 This study was conducted to evaluate its role in noninvasive vulvar disease.
 From December 1988 to March 1990, 27 patients underwent ultrasonic surgery; nine patients had vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) and 18 had condylomata acuminata.
 All surgical procedures were done under general anesthesia, with two patients requiring hospitalization for perineal care and pain control after extensive vulvar surgery.
 Recurrent or persistent disease occurred in four patients with condylomata acuminata and in two with VIN, with a mean follow-up of 50 weeks.
 Reepithelialization was completed within 5 weeks and no patients developed vulvar scarring.
 Adequate samples for histopathologic review were obtained in 26 patients.
 Identical histologic grading occurred in all 13 patients who had preoperative vulvar biopsies and an adequate aspiration specimen.
 Ultrasonic surgery permits precise and rapid removal of epithelial lesions with rapid healing, minimal patient discomfort, excellent cosmetic results, and histopathologic documentation.
