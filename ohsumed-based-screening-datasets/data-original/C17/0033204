The clinical and health status of patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis.
 This study was designed to document the clinical and health status of patients with recent-onset rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
 Three groups were studied: 108 patients who had had RA for greater than 1 year (established RA group), 313 patients who had had RA for less than or equal to 1 year (recent-onset RA group), and 188 healthy friend of the patients with recent-onset RA (no RA group).
 Clinical status was measured using tender joint count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and overall physician assessment.
 Health status was measured using the physical, psychological, pain, and arthritis impact scores of the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales.
 Scores on all clinical and health status measures indicated substantial disease effects in the group with recent-onset RA.
 For most of these measures, effect size analysis indicated that clinical and health status impacts in the recent-onset RA group were similar in magnitude to those found in the groups with more established disease, with scores in both groups being substantially different from those found in the no RA group.
 These results document the magnitude of the clinical and health status impacts in recent-onset RA.
 They lend support to recent arguments advocating aggressive therapy earlier in the course of this frequently disabling disease.
