Complexion changes in oral contraceptive users. Results from a phase IV multicenter trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms.
 An open-label, phase IV, multicenter survey of obstetrician-gynecologists was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a low-dose monophasic oral contraceptive, ethynodiol diacetate, 1 mg, with ethinyl estradiol, 35 micrograms.
 Surveys from 983 community-based physicians reported on 6,382 women.
 Most patients did not experience "clinically noticeable complexion changes" (5,695/6,382, or 89.2%).
 Of the 687 patients with complexion changes, nearly three-fourths reported an improvement (501/687, or 72.9%).
 A follow-up questionnaire was sent to 127 respondents (18.6%) who reported worsening of the complexion; 70% of the questionnaires were returned.
 Most complexion worsening was of slight degree (63%), reported by the patient and not the physician (84% vs.
 16%), and experienced during the first two to three months (84%).
 Although the literature includes many references to skin condition "improvement" on oral contraceptives, this report of a descriptive study gives clinicians as estimate of the incidence and severity of complexion changes in actual use.
