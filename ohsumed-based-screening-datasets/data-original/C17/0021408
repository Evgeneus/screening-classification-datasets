Pituitary hormones regulate c-myc and DNA synthesis in lymphoid tissue.
 Hypophysectomy of Fischer 344 rats of both sexes led to a rapid involution of the thymus and spleen which was associated with a profound decrease in spontaneous DNA synthesis in these organs.
 The proportion of B lymphocytes in the spleen, of T cells and their subsets (CD4+/CD8+) in spleen and thymus, and the histological structure of the involuted organs remained normal.
 Treatment of hypophysectomized animals with growth hormone (GH) or prolactin (PRL) stimulated the expression of the c-myc proto-oncogene and DNA synthesis and reversed the involution in these organs.
 Replacement doses of adrenocorticotrophic hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, or thyroid-stimulating hormone had no influence on thymus or spleen size and DNA synthesis.
 A rapid expression of c-myc was also observed in thymuses and spleens of intact rats after the injection of GH or PRL.
 In vitro physiological concentrations (2.5 ng/ml) of either ovine or rat PRL or GH stimulated the incorporation of [3H]thymidine by thymus and spleen cells.
 These results indicate that GH and PRL regulate lymphocyte growth.
 This regulatory role is likely to serve as the principal mechanism of immunoregulation by these hormones.
