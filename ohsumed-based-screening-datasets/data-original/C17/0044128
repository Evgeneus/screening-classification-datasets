Contact sensitivity to captafol in BALB/c mice.
 The fungicide captafol has been reported as causing irritant and allergic contact dermatitis in humans and in guinea pigs.
 This study investigated the ability of purified captafol to cause contact sensitization in BALB/c mice.
 Female mice were pretreated with an intraperitoneal injection of cyclophosphamide or saline.
 Applications of captafol (18.7 or 37.4 mg/ml), dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB; 5 mg/ml) or solvent (4:1 acetone:ethanol mixture) were administered to the shaved abdomen on 2 consecutive days, or on days 1, 2, 8, 15, 22 and 29.
 Following challenge with captafol (37.4 mg/ml) or DNFB (2 mg/ml) on the right ear 6 days after the last induction, ear thickness ratios (right ear/left ear) were significantly larger after challenge in captafol-induced and DNFB-induced mice compared to control mice.
 A slightly larger response was observed with the smaller induction dose level of captafol and with multiple inductions over the course of a month.
 The overall maximum response to captafol was not increased by pretreatment with cyclophosphamide.
 Histologically, ears from captafol-induced and DNFB-induced mice showed edema and cellular infiltration.
 This study demonstrated the ability of captafol to produce contact hypersensitivity in the BALB/c mouse.
