Recurrent porokeratosis.
 A 63-year-old man developed linear, annular and accuminate lesions which showed the histological features of porokeratosis.
 The lesions cleared spontaneously, recurred several months later and ulcerated, then cleared again.
 The spontaneous resolution and recurrence of the lesions is a hitherto undescribed pattern of porokeratosis.
