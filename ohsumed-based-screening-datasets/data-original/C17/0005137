Indirect revascularization of the lower extremity by means of microvascular free-muscle flap--a preliminary report.
 We describe the treatment of a patient with end-stage peripheral vascular disease and ischemic ulceration of the lower extremity in whom an obliteration of the distal arterial bed precluded conventional arterial reconstruction.
 A nonhealing dorsal foot ulcer was debrided, and soft tissue reconstruction was accomplished by the free microsurgical transfer of a muscle flap to the distal lower extremity.
 Arterial inflow to this free flap was provided by a contralateral reversed saphenous vein graft from the proximal arterial tree of the leg.
 This procedure resulted in a healed wound, stable coverage, and limb salvage.
 The patient also noted complete relief of rest pain and improvement in his claudication symptoms.
 A follow-up arteriogram was done 2 months after surgery.
 Contrast injection directly into the artery of this flap showed new blood vessel growth from the muscle flap into the foot with anastomoses of these "new vessels" to the patient's native circulation.
 This experience suggests that limb salvage may be possible by the free microvascular transplantation of a muscle flap onto the limb in selected patients whose limbs are deemed "nonreconstructible.".
