Coexistence of spherulocytic disease (myospherulosis) and membranocystic degeneration.
 A case of myospherulosis seen in a 22-year-old Japanese woman with lupus erythematosus is presented.
 Myospherules were found in subcutaneous nodules on the legs of the patient and were restricted to the areas of membranocystic change, a kind of degeneration of the adipose tissue.
 The myospherules were positive for blood group A antigens, suggesting a red blood cell origin.
 In contrast, the parent bodies of the myospherules were negative for blood group antigens.
 The coexistence of myospherulosis and membraneocystic changes has not been previously described, but might have been overlooked in the past.
