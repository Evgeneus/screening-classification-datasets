Synovial membrane histology and immunopathology in rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. In vivo effects of antirheumatic drugs.
 We examined the histologic and immunopathologic features of the synovial membrane of 18 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 12 patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who had undergone total knee arthroplasty.
 Patients were classified into 5 groups according to therapeutic regimen and disease: RA treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), RA treated with NSAIDs and prednisone, RA treated with NSAIDs and methotrexate (MTX), OA treated with analgesics, and OA treated with NSAIDs.
 There were no significant between-group differences in the percentages or the distribution pattern of the infiltrating T cell subsets (CD4, CD8), HLA-DR, or interleukin-2 receptor-bearing cells.
 However, inflammatory indices, which included the thickness of the lining cell layer and the density of the mononuclear cell infiltrate, were significantly higher in the RA patients treated with prednisone and those treated with MTX (P less than 0.05).
 Similarly, fibrosis was markedly reduced in these 2 groups.
 The RA patients treated with NSAIDs alone and the 2 groups of patients with OA demonstrated similar profiles.
 These data suggest that prednisone and MTX may inhibit the development of fibrosis without altering the subsets of the inflammatory cell population.
 This observation raises the possibility that the action of these 2 drugs may be partly mediated by the suppression of inflammatory mediators that are responsible for fibroblast activation.
