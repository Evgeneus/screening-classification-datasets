Occupational skin disease in Western Australia.
 993 cases of occupational skin disease (OSD) were diagnosed in a private dermatology practice over an 8-year period.
 Dermatologists were the major source of referral.
 The sex ratio was 2.4 males to 1 female.
 Patch tests were conducted in 79% of cases.
 Wet work industries predominated in females; in males the causative industries were more varied.
 Apprentices were affected in a high proportion of hairdressers and food handlers.
 Atopics accounted for 75% of the apprentice hairdressers.
 Atopics also were more prevalent in females with OSD than males.
 29% of all cases had suffered from OSD for over 2 years before diagnosis.
 75% of patients with OSD were less than 40 years of age at onset of OSD.
 Irritant contact dermatitis predominated over allergic contact dermatitis in all age groups except those over 60 years of age.
 Nickel was the predominant occupational allergen in females, whereas chromate was the predominant occupational allergen in males.
