Papular-purpuric "gloves and socks" syndrome.
 We report five cases of an acute, self-limiting dermatosis that has not been previously described.
 It consists of a pruritic edema and erythema of the hands and feet in a gloves-and-socks distribution and is associated with oral lesions and fever.
 The clinical course is characterized by the rapid development of petechial purpura and clearing of lesions within 1 to 2 weeks.
 The disease appears to affect only young and otherwise healthy persons and occurs mostly during the spring.
 The etiology is unknown but might be of infectious origin.
