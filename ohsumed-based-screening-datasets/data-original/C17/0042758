Clinical comparison of polyglactic acid (Vicryl) and polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon) suture material.
 Over a 1-year period, 584 repairs of surgical defects were completed using two different synthetic absorbable sutures, polyglactic acid (Vicryl) and polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon).
 No difference in scar width or postoperative complications were found between the two sutures, but polytrimethylene carbonate (Maxon) demonstrated preferable handling and tying characteristics.
