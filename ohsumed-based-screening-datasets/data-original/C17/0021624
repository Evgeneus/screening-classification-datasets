Hydrocortisone: an important cutaneous allergen.
 We have found a high incidence (4.8%) of allergy to hydrocortisone in patients with suspected allergic contact dermatitis.
 In view of this finding we would suggest that, in any condition that does not improve or that deteriorates after administration of hydrocortisone, allergy to this compound should be considered.
