Evaluation of calcium magnesium acetate and road salt for contact hypersensitivity potential and dermal irritancy in humans.
 Calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) and road salt are both de-icing agents to which workers may be dermally exposed.
 A commercial formulation of CMA (Chevron Ice-B-Gon Deicer) and road salt were tested in a human repeat insult patch test to evaluate the contact hypersensitivity potential of these materials and to evaluate irritation following single or multiple applications.
 72 of the initial 82 panelists completed the study.
 CMA and road salt (each at 10% and 30% w/w in distilled water; 0.3 ml) were administered under occlusive patches on the forearm for 14 h 3 x per week for 3 weeks.
 The panelists were challenged 2 weeks later; 2 panelists who had mild reactions were subsequently rechallenged 6 weeks later.
 Neither CMA nor road salt produced contact hypersensitivity in any panelists.
 Following the first application, moderate acute irritation was observed only at 1 skin site exposed to 30% road salt.
 Repeated exposure to CMA or road salt produced mild to moderate irritation.
 The highest incidence of moderate irritation was observed with 30% road salt.
 Thus, neither material is expected to cause significant dermal effects in exposed workers.
 CMA is expected to cause dermal irritation equivalent to or less than that caused by road salt.
