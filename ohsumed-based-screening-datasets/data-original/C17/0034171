Ankle arthrodesis with vertical Steinmann's pins in rheumatoid arthritis.
 Many techniques for ankle arthrodesis have been described but some of them are not applicable in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have also developed osteopenia and decreased bone density.
 A technique utilizing two longitudinally placed Steinmann's pins to fixate and align the joint was used in five patients with severe RA and is described here.
 Results showed a 100% fusion rate and patient satisfaction over an average follow-up time of six years.
 This ankle arthrodesis technique was found to be applicable in arthritic patients with osteopenia and decreased bone density caused by RA.
