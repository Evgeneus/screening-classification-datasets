Clinical manifestations in anticardiolipin antibody-positive patients with progressive systemic sclerosis.
 Anticardiolipin antibody-positive patients with progressive systemic sclerosis were analyzed.
 Elevated anticardiolipin antibody titers were observed in 13 of 40 cases (33%).
 Anticardiolipin antibody titer was significantly higher in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis type 1 than in those with type 2 or type 3.
 Occurrence of anticardiolipin antibody was significantly more frequent in patients positive for anti-nRNP antibodies, rheumatoid factor, or thrombocytopenia.
 In contrast, patients with proximal scleroderma, scarring, or esophageal hypomotility were positive for anticardiolipin antibody less frequently.
 These results suggest that anticardiolipin antibody might be closely associated with lupuslike clinical manifestations in a subset of progressive systemic sclerosis or definite progressive systemic sclerosis with thrombocytopenia, rheumatoid factor, or anti-nRNP antibodies.
