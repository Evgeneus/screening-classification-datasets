Iliac insufficiency fractures.
 Twenty-five post-menopausal women with one or more insufficiency fractures of the pelvic ring are reported.
 In 80% of cases the fractures were multiple and a total of 79 insufficiency fractures was identified.
 Twelve iliac insufficiency fractures were present in 11 patients located at one of three sites: above and parallel to the acetabular roof ("supra-acetabular"), extending diagonally across the iliac ala from the greater sciatic notch ("oblique iliac"), and adjacent to the sacro-iliac joint ("superomedial iliac").
 The plain radiographic appearances of these iliac fractures were typically subtle with ill defined medullary sclerosis, due to trabecular compression, the cardinal sign.
 Scintigraphy revealed the fractures as foci of increased activity which, in the presence of multiple pelvic insufficiency fractures, may be mistaken for metastatic disease.
 Computed tomography can be helpful in confirming the presence of suspected fractures, revealing further occult fractures and also excluding the likelihood of malignancy.
