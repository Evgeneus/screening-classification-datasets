Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug therapy in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Lack of association between clinical improvement and effects on sleep.
 Thirteen patients with rheumatoid arthritis (mean +/- SD age 55.8 +/- 10.5 years) received 20 mg of tenoxicam daily for 90 days following a 3-7 day "washout" period and 4 days of placebo treatment.
 Clinical evaluations were conducted at the end of the washout period and at monthly intervals thereafter.
 All-night polysomnography was performed in a sleep laboratory during the last 2 days of placebo treatment and on days 13, 14, 89, and 90 of tenoxicam treatment.
 Although there was improvement in the patients' clinical condition, there were no treatment-related changes in any of the sleep parameters.
 Eight of the 13 patients, however, were found to have primary sleep disorders.
 Four had periodic leg movements during sleep, 3 had sleep apneas, and 1 had a combination of both disorders.
 The implications of these findings in the treatment of sleep disorders in patients with rheumatoid arthritis are discussed.
