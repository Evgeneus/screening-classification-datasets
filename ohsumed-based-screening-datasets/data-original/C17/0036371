Steady-state mRNA levels of collagens I, III, fibronectin, and collagenase in skin biopsies of systemic sclerosis patients.
 Total RNA was extracted from skin biopsies of nine patients suffering from systemic sclerosis (SSc).
 Steady-state mRNA levels of collagen alpha 1(I) and alpha 1(III), collagenase, fibronectin, and beta-actin were studied using specific cDNA probes and compared to those of 12 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals.
 There was a more than three-fold elevation of collagen I mRNA levels in SSc skin compared to controls.
 No difference was found, however, for collagen III, collagenase, and fibronectin mRNA levels in SSc and control biopsies.
 The selective increase of collagen alpha 1(I) mRNA levels indicates a specific alteration of fibroblast metabolism in scleroderma.
 Analysis of mRNA levels in skin biopsies might not only offer a direct approach to the understanding of the pathophysiology of SSc, but also facilitate the monitoring of fibrotic activity in SSc patients during therapeutic trials.
