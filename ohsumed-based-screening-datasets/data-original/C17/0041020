Realities in ossiculoplasty.
 The results of ossiculoplasty are frequently reported in terms of closure of the air-bone gap.
 This parameter is a reliable indicator of the degree of technical success, and is useful in comparing different materials and types of reconstructions.
 However, assessment of the operated ear alone does not evaluate the effect of surgery on binaural hearing ability, leading to the situation where sub-optimal advice may be given to patients pre-operatively.
 This article advocates a more patient orientated method of assessing the results of ossiculoplasty.
 Previous studies have indicated that the operated ear must reach an air conduction level of 30 dB for the speech frequencies, or be within 15 dB of the other ear, to ensure that the patient will gain significant benefit.
 A graphical method for the prediction of patient benefit is presented, and compared to the rule of thumb quoted above.
 The implications for surgeons and patients considering ossiculoplasty are obvious.
 Many statements routinely made to patients prior to surgery for conductive hearing loss are unduly optimistic and unrelated to the realities of reported results.
 There is a need to determine what types of such hearing losses can be helped surgically, and more importantly to what extent the patients hearing disability can be relieved.
