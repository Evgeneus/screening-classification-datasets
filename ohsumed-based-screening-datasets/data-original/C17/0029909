Local dermal hypersensitivity from dobutamine hydrochloride (Dobutrex solution) injection.
 Two patients had local dermal hypersensitivity at the site of dobutamine hydrochloride (Dobutrex solution) injection.
 Such local dermal lesions characterized by erythema, pruritus, and phlebitis with or without bullae formation have not been reported previously (to our knowledge).
 Hypersensitivity reaction to sulfites as a possible mechanism of the dermal lesions was substantiated further by skin tests and peripheral eosinophila.
 Oral antihistamine therapy can minimize such a minor but bothersome problem.
