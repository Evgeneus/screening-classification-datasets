Microtrapdoor flap repair of laryngeal and tracheal stenosis.
 Twenty patients have undergone repair of laryngeal and tracheal stenosis by microtrapdoor accessing of scar or soft tissue and removal with the carbon dioxide laser.
 A total of 34 flap procedures were performed in the 20 patients.
 Follow-up ranged from 8 months to 4 years, and 30 of these flaps were considered successful on the basis of improvement of the airway.
 The only complications were postoperative granulation tissue in 2 patients that responded to endoscopic removal.
