Prevalence and characteristics of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies in localized scleroderma. Comparison with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Prevalence, levels, and immunoglobulin classes of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 52 patients with localized scleroderma (33 with morphea, four with generalized morphea, and 15 with linear scleroderma), in 60 healthy controls, and, for comparison, in 31 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Localized scleroderma revealed a significant prevalence of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies, mainly characterized by high levels and IgM and IgA isotypes.
 Comparison of antibody characteristics in different clinical forms of localized scleroderma showed some significant differences (levels and immunoglobulin isotypes).
 Comparison with systemic lupus erythematosus showed that frequency, high levels, and IgG isotype of anti-single-stranded DNA antibodies significantly prevailed in systemic lupus erythematosus, while the IgM isotype significantly prevailed in localized scleroderma.
 However, generalized morphea and linear scleroderma did not significantly differ from systemic lupus erythematosus as regards antibody frequency and prevalence of high antibody levels.
