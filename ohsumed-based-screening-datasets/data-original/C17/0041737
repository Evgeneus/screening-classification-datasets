 The digital imaging revolution that swept other medical specialties in the late 1970s and early 1980s is beginning to find new and important roles in dermatology.
 This technology has a wide range of educational, clinical, and research applications.
 Dermatologists should understand certain basic concepts about images and imaging techniques to take advantage of progress in this field and eventually apply it to their own research and/or clinical practice.
