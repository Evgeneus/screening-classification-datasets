Hydroa vacciniforme with unusually severe scar formation: diagnosis by repetitive UVA phototesting.
 Hydroa vacciniforme is a rare, chronic, photosensitive disorder manifested in childhood by recurrent vesicles that heal with scarring.
 Reproduction of vesicles with repetitive UVA phototesting may be an important diagnostic aid.
 Recurrent eruption resulted in severe scarring of the face and a flexion contracture of the finger in our patient.
 The clinical features and laboratory evaluation of hydroa vacciniforme are reviewed.
