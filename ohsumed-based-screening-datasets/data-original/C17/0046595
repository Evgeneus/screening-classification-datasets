Modulation of monocyte chemotactic function in inflammatory lesions. Role of inflammatory mediators.
 Monocyte recruitment and accumulation in the synovial tissue is pivotal in the evolution of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
 In the present study we examined the chemotactic potential of monocytes obtained from synovial fluid (SF) of patients with RA.
 Functionally, SF monocytes exhibited greatly diminished chemotactic activity to C5a compared with monocytes from the peripheral blood.
 In contrast, their chemotactic responsiveness to the synthetic peptide, FMLP, was nearly normal.
 To define a mechanism for this differential chemotactic dysfunction, cell-surface receptors for C5a (C5aR) and FMLP (FMLP-R) were evaluated.
 Whereas FMLP-R expression was similar on both blood and inflammatory monocytes, C5aR expression was markedly reduced on SF cells.
 Because decreased C5a binding in certain RA SF samples could not be attributed to free C5a, known or suspected components of inflammatory SF were evaluated for their ability to modulate chemotactic ligand receptors.
 Bacterial products including LPS and streptococcal cell walls, which are potent monocyte activators, down-regulated C5aR without affecting FMLP-R.
 Moreover, the cytokines IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage-CSF selectively decreased C5aR in parallel with decreased in vitro chemotactic activity to C5a.
 Thus, these data indicate that 1) synovial effusions may contain C5a and/or inflammatory mediators that modulate phenotypic and functional changes in monocytes, 2) chemotactic ligand receptors are independently regulated in inflammatory lesions, and 3) decreased C5aR expression and chemotactic potential likely provide a mechanism whereby monocyte-macrophages persist within the inflamed synovium.
