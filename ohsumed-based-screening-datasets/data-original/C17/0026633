Serum androsterone conjugates differentiate between acne and hirsutism in hyperandrogenic women.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine if among hyperandrogenic women acne may be differentiated from hirsutism by markers of peripheral androgen metabolism.
 DESIGN: Prospective outpatient study of 36 hyperandrogenic women and controls divided into groups based on the presence or absence of significant hirsutism and the presence or absence of moderate to severe acne.
 Serum levels of adrenal and ovarian derived androgens were elevated but similar in all patient groups.
 INTERVENTIONS: Measurement of serum androgens including metabolites of 5 alpha-reductase activity: 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide and sulfate and androsterone (A) glucuronide and sulfate.
 RESULTS: 3 alpha-androstanediol glucuronide and sulfate were elevated in all groups (P less than 0.05) and could differentiate between hirsute and nonhirsute patients but were similar in patients with and without acne.
 Serum A glucuronide and sulfate were only significantly elevated in patients with acne (P less than 0.01) and were higher than levels in controls and hirsute patients without acne.
 Ratios of precursor androgens to A glucuronide and sulfate were significantly higher in patients with acne compared with patients without acne (P less than 0.05).
 CONCLUSIONS: Altered peripheral metabolism in acne may favor the formation of A conjugates, which may help differentiate acne from hirsutism among hyperandrogenic women.
