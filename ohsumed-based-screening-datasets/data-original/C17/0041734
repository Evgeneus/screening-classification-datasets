Photopatch testing: the 5-year experience of the German, Austrian, and Swiss Photopatch Test Group.
 A cooperative photopatch test study was conducted by 45 dermatologic centers in Austria, Germany, and Switzerland.
 Results obtained from 1985 to 1990 are presented.
 A standard photopatch test tray of 32 substances was applied to the back of patients with suspected photosensivity.
 After applications for 24 hours, test sites were irradiated with 10 joules/cm2UVA.
 Unirradiated controls were included.
 Readings were performed immediately and 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation; responses were qualitatively graded on a 4-point scale.
 All data were stored and processed by a computer.
 With computer-assisted analysis of reaction patterns photoallergic reactions were identified and distinguished from phototoxic reactions.
 Data of 1129 patients were evaluated.
 Among a total of 2859 positive test reactions in 870 patients, 2041 in 778 patients were found to be photoinduced and 818 in 413 patients were contact reactions; 108 reactions in 83 patients were classified as photoallergic.
 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disinfectants, sunscreens, phenothiazines, and fragrances caused most often photoallergic reactions.
 Many unspecific phototoxic reactions were induced by tiaprofenic acid, promethazine, carprofen, chlorpromazine, fenticolar, wood balsam of Peru, and perfumes.
 Despite the distinction between photoallergic and phototoxic responses, many test reactions lacked relevance for the patients' dermatoses.
