The treatment of mastocytosis: an overview.
 The treatment of mastocytosis requires a recognition of specific disease patterns of involvement, with consequent institution of appropriate therapy based on the disease pattern manifested in a given patient.
 Treatment for most forms of mastocytosis is conservative and symptomatic.
 H1 and H2 antihistamines in combination or alone remain the primary drugs of choice.
 In specific cases, patients may require aspirin and/or steroids; some must be prepared to self-administer epinephrine for severe anaphylactic episodes.
 In patients with associated hematologic disorders, the treatment of the disorder will depend on the hematologic findings.
 In rare cases, and in aggressive forms of mastocytosis only, it may be necessary to consider limited forms of chemotherapy.
