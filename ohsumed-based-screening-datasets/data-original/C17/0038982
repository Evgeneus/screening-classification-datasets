Familial multiple bilateral pneumothorax associated with Marfan syndrome.
 Three members of one family, a father and two sons, inflicted with Marfan syndrome, suffered multiple bilateral episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax that required repeated drainage procedures.
 The youngest patient also had an episode of unilateral expansion pulmonary edema; he underwent sequential pleural abrasions.
 Familial pneumothorax is very uncommon, and its association with Marfan syndrome is an exception.
