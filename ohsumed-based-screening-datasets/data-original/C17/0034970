Treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis with chloroquine. Review of the literature.
 Systemic corticosteroids may be either contraindicated or not efficacious in treating the cutaneous manifestations occurring in 20% to 35% of patients with systemic sarcoidosis.
 Chloroquine phosphate has been reported to be a valuable alternative therapy for cutaneous lesions of sarcoidosis.
 With a judiciously determined daily dosage and regular 6-month ophthalmologic follow-up examinations, the risk of developing retinopathy can be avoided, because the daily dosage rate rather than total dose accumulation determines the development of chloroquine-induced retinopathy.
 We reviewed the efficacy and safety of chloroquine and its role in the treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis.
