Neurologic disorders and dermatologic manifestations in HIV-infected children.
 Cutaneous manifestations of HIV infections in childhood are common but are not the dermatologic lesions associated with HIV infection in adults.
 For example, Kaposi's sarcoma, a common finding in adults with AIDS, is rare in children.
 Other cutaneous manifestations, including bacterial and fungal lesions and viral exanthems, are common in children with AIDS and can be atypical and severe.
 Because 90% of the pediatric AIDS population acquires the virus via maternal transmission to the fetus, a dysmorphic syndrome associated with intrauterine infection has been described.
 Physicians caring for and evaluating pediatric patients at risk for AIDS should be aware of these dermatologic manifestations, so that early detection and treatment can be instituted to reduce the morbidity of the complication of HIV infection.
