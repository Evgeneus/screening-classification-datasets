The surgical treatment of ingrowing toenails.
 Two prospective studies of ingrowing toenail management were conducted.
 In the first, 163 patients (204 ingrowing nail edges) who had not had previous surgery were randomised and treated by total nail avulsion, nail edge excision, or nail edge excision with phenolisation of the germinal matrix; recurrence rates one year postoperatively were 73%, 73% and 9% respectively.
 In the second study, 63 ingrowing nail edges which had recurred after previous operations underwent nail edge excision and phenolisation.
 There was a 5% recurrence rate and 5% incidence of dystrophy of the nail one year after operation.
