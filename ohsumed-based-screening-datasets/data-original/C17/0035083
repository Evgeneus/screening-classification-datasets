Red tattoo reactions: X-ray microanalysis and patch-test studies.
 Eighteen patients who developed cutaneous reactions to red tattoos were studied to identify the chemicals responsible for the reactions to modern red tattoo pigments.
 Biopsies from the tattoos were examined histologically and the chemical composition of the red pigments was analysed by X-ray microanalysis.
 A variety of metallic elements including aluminium, iron, calcium, titanium, silicon, mercury and cadmium were detected.
 Patch tests were performed to the relevant chemicals in nine cases, and only one patient reacted to mercury.
 This study demonstrates that although reactions to mercury still occur, other red dyes containing a variety of inorganic pigments may provoke a cutaneous inflammatory response.
