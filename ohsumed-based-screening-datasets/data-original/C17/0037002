Interface-area-to-volume ratio of interstitial fluid in humans determined by pharmacokinetic analysis of netilmicin in small and large skin blisters.
 Human pharmacokinetics of netilmicin during multiple dosing were studied in serum and in the fluid of skin blisters with two different ratios of interface area to fluid volume.
 The kinetics in the blisters followed the serum concentration-time curve with a delay but with a similar elimination half-life of 2.4 h.
 The kinetics in the 40-microliters blisters followed closely the theoretically calculated concentrations of the peripheral compartment of a two-compartment model.
 In contrast, the concentrations in the 120-microliter blisters increased less rapidly, lower peaks were achieved, and concentrations decreased with a significantly longer delay.
 A very similar area-specific flow or clearance rate of 1.6 microliters.h-1.mm-2 was calculated for the interface area between the serum compartment and either the small or large blisters.
 The observed rapid mass transfer between serum and blister fluid suggests similar oscillations of concentrations in serum and in small interstitial fluid compartments.
