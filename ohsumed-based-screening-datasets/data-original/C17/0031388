Cutting oil dermatitis on guinea pig skin (I). Cutting oil dermatitis and barrier cream.
 We assessed the effect of repeated application of cutting oil on 9 guinea pigs' skin by visual scoring and skin water vapour loss measurement.
 The visual scores (severity score) were significantly higher on skin treated with cutting oil (positive control) compared to untreated skin (negative control).
 The corresponding mean SVL values were also significantly higher.
 We also assessed the effect of 2 barrier creams on the 9 guinea pigs' skin treated with cutting oil.
 The visual scores on skin treated with either barrier cream were significantly higher than positive control skin.
 The corresponding mean SVL values on skin treated with either barrier cream were also higher (not statistically significant).
 It appeared that the 2 barrier creams did not confer protection against the irritant effect of the cutting oil.
 On the contrary, barrier creams appeared to exacerbate the irritant effect of cutting oil.
