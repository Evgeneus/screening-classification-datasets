Medical defense against blistering chemical warfare agents.
 First used in World War I, chemical blistering agents present a serious medical threat that has stimulated renewed interest in the light of extensive use in recent conflicts.
 Current medical management cannot yet prevent or minimize injury from the principal agent of concern--sulfur mustard.
 Research directed at this goal depends on defining effective intervention in the metabolic alterations induced by exposure to sulfur mustard.
