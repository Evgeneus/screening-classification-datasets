Penile implants in the treatment of Peyronie's disease.
 The treatment of Peyronie's disease remains controversial.
 Patients who fail conservative therapy may require surgical intervention to restore the ability to have sexual intercourse.
 Plaque excision and dermal grafting have not been universally successful, and alternate procedures that rely on the placement of a penile prosthesis have gained in popularity.
 We reviewed our experience with 35 patients with advanced Peyronie's disease treated with a penile prosthesis.
 Preoperatively, 55% of the patients were unable to engage in intercourse due to pain or angulation of the penis and 25% were unable to achieve any erection at all.
 Postoperatively, with a mean followup of 6.9 years, 88% of the patients were able to engage in intercourse and were satisfied with the results obtained.
 In selected patients with advanced disease the implantation of a penile prosthesis remains a highly successful and satisfying alternative for the treatment of Peyronie's disease.
