Inability to interpret toxic salicylate levels in patients taking aspirin and diflunisal.
 Diflunisal, a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, is not metabolized to the free salicylate moiety, but yields serum salicylate levels.
 We describe 2 patients who unexpectedly had toxic range serum salicylate levels while taking diflunisal and aspirin for rheumatoid arthritis.
 Diflunisal is measured by standard salicylate assays, a fact not widely appreciated.
 Serum salicylate levels by these assays cannot be used to determine salicylate toxicity when a patient is taking both aspirin and diflunisal.
 High pressure liquid chromatography can be used to distinguish true salicylate toxicity from interference with diflunisal.
