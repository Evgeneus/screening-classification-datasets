Common foot problems. Relieving the pain of bunions, keratoses, corns, and calluses.
 Many of the painful foot problems seen in adults are easily treated.
 Bunions and bunionettes often respond to a change to wide, soft-toed shoes or sandals and the temporary use of a mild anti-inflammatory agent.
 Initial treatment of plantar keratoses is trimming and use of cushioning shoe inserts.
 Diffuse keratoses may require reconstructive surgery if metatarsal deformity is the cause.
 Seed corns and soft corns respond to trimming, and alleviation of pressure with padding and wearing of open-toed shoes is beneficial in these lesions as well as in hard corns.
 Surgical resection of any underlying exostosis may be required for hard or soft corns or "pump bumps," which are caused by pressure from the shoe's heel.
 In all cases, patients should be advised to change to shoes that provide plenty of room in the toe box and that minimize friction on painful areas.
