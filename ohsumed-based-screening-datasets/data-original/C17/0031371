Newborn chemical exposure from over-the-counter skin care products.
 Human exposure to potentially toxic environmental chemicals is a major concern to our society.
 Over-the-counter (OTC) skin care products are a potential source of environmental chemical exposure to newborns.
 A prospective study was undertaken to define existing newborn bathing practices and quantitate environmental chemical exposure from OTC skin care products.
 One hundred-ninety six mothers of infants discharged from our newborn nursery were asked to respond to a questionnaire concerning newborn bathing practices and OTC skin care product usage.
 Complete questionnaires were returned by 23% of the mothers.
 The average newborn had 8 +/- 3 (+/- SEM) skin care products applied with the resultant exposure to 48 +/- 18 different environmental chemicals.
 Forty-seven percent of our respondents used a baby powder.
 The average one month old was bathed 4 times a week and was shampooed 3 times weekly.
 Seventy-eight percent of the respondents reported that their newborn had a rash but only 45% of those reporting a rash sought professional medical advice.
 Thirty-seven percent of the mothers reporting a rash made a change in bathing practice or product selection.
 In view of our findings, the human newborn is exposed to a large number of environmental chemicals thorough topical OTC preparations.
 The efficacy, transcutaneous absorption and potential toxicity of these products should be investigated.
