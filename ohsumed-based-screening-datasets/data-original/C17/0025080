Endoscopic re-establishment of membranous urethral disruption.
 A total of 17 patients with traumatic membranous urethral disruption underwent urethral reconstruction via a core-through technique.
 Followup was 1 to 8 years (mean 3.7 years) postoperatively, and included 6 weeks with an indwelling catheter, periodic dilation for 6 months and occasional sounding.
 Within 1 year postoperatively, 6 patients required additional scar incision, including 3 who underwent scar resection.
 At 1 to 8 years postoperatively 6 patients had complications: 3 had stricture requiring periodic dilation (including 2 who underwent scar incision), while 2 had mild stress incontinence and 1 had nocturnal enuresis.
 Traumatic impotence was noted in 7 patients but the operation was not the cause in any.
 This method of endoscopic management was found to be an acceptable alternative to urethroplasty in cases of membranous urethral disruption.
