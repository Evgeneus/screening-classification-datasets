In-vivo epidermal nuclear reactions: a selective process.
 Epidermal in-vivo nuclear reactions of IgG occur primarily in patients with mixed connective tissue disease or systemic lupus erythematosus and have been associated with high titres of circulating antibodies to ribonucleoprotein (RNP).
 This study was carried out to examine whether these epidermal nuclear reactions are true or simply an excision artefact.
 We observed the epidermal nuclear reactions for IgG only and not for other immunoglobulins in both in-vivo and in-vitro organ-culture studies, despite the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) of all immunoglobulin classes.
 The association of the in-vitro epidermal nuclear reactions with serum RNP antibodies, although not absolute was statistically significant.
 The absorption of the serum with extractable nuclear antigen (ENA) preparation diminished the nuclear reactivity on tissue explants.
 In addition, the penetration of ANA into the nuclei of skin explants was both time and temperature dependent and was inhibited by sodium azide and by oligomycin.
 We conclude that the epidermal nuclear staining reactions observed by direct immunofluorescence on skin biopsies is selective and that the penetration of IgG into the epidermal cell nuclei is an active process and not an artefact.
