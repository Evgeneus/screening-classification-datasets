Subcutaneous cholesterol crystals mimicking calcinosis cutis in systemic sclerosis.
 A patient is described with systemic sclerosis (SSc) and subcutaneous cholesterol crystals mimicking calcinosis cutis.
 Though not detectable radiographically, basic calcium phosphate crystals were identified by alizarin red staining of aspirate from one digit.
 The value of crystal identification by microscopy in cases of SSc with presumed calcinosis cutis, but without radiographic evidence of subcutaneous calcific deposits, is emphasized.
