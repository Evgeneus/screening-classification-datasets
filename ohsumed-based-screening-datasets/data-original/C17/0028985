A 12-month treatment of severe psoriasis with acitretin: results of a Canadian open multicenter study.
 Both etretinate and its principal metabolite, acitretin, are efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis.
 Because patients with severe psoriasis often require chronic therapy, this study was undertaken to determine the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of acitretin in patients on continuous treatment for 12 months.
 The initial daily dose of 50 mg was taken for 4 weeks.
 Thereafter the dose was increased or decreased by 10 mg at monthly intervals (10 to 70 mg) to produce the optimal response with minimal toxicity.
 Seventy percent of the patients who completed 12 months of treatment showed marked improvement.
 All patients experienced adverse reactions; dry lips, hair loss, skin peeling, pruritus, and nail disorders were the most frequent.
 Fourteen patients were withdrawn from the study because of one or more intolerable adverse reactions.
