Congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear in children: a clinical and histopathological report.
 Forty-one children with congenital cholesteatoma of the middle ear seen from 1978 through 1989 are reviewed.
 The most common presentation was that of an asymptomatic white mass behind a normal intact tympanic membrane.
 Computed tomography (CT) scan was useful in documenting extension beyond the mesotympanum.
 Surgical removal was performed using an extended tympanotomy for lesions in the middle ear and tympanomastoidectomy for those that had extended into attic and mastoid air cells.
 Observation over an average 3.1-year period indicated that 80% of children were free of disease after initial surgery.
 Residual disease that required further surgery was present in 20%.
 The importance of early diagnosis of congenital cholesteatoma is strongly advocated.
 The prognosis is better when the cholesteatoma is confined to the anterosuperior quadrant of the middle ear.
 Seventeen patients in this study had such a lesion, and extended tympanotomy allowed removal of an encapsulated closed cholesteatoma with normal postoperative hearing and no residual cholesteatoma.
 The average age was 2.3 years.
 Temporal bone histopathological studies of three cases of congenital cholesteatoma demonstrate two distinct pathological types of congenital cholesteatoma.
 A "closed" keratotic cyst in the anterior mesotympanum, which is easily removed, and an "open" infiltrative type in which there is no containment of the keratotic debris and the cholesteatoma matrix is in direct continuity with middle ear mucosa.
 Surgical extirpation of the "open" type is difficult and more likely to be associated with residual disease.
