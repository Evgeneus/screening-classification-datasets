Is erythrokeratoderma one disorder? A clinical and ultrastructural study of two siblings.
 Two sisters with erythrokeratoderma are described.
 In the younger sister the clinical appearance corresponded to erythrokeratoderma variabilis (EKV), whereas in the older sister it corresponded to progressive symmetrical erythrokeratoderma (PSEK).
 Ultrastructural findings in both cases were identical.
 We suggest that EKV and PSEK are different manifestations of a single condition.
