'High single-dose' European PUVA regimen also causes an excess of non-melanoma skin cancer.
 We report the results of a long-term (12.8 years) follow-up study of the detection of malignant and benign skin tumours in patients with psoriasis, who were treated with PUVA according to the European, 'high single-dose' regimen.
 A total of 13 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and 24 basal cell carcinomas (BCC) were diagnosed in 11 of 260 patients.
 The incidence of both SCC and BCC was increased in comparison with the general Dutch population.
 The ratio of SCC to BCC in the general population was 1:8 but was 1:2.5 in our study group.
 A positive correlation was observed between the development of SCC and the total UVA dosage, the age of the patient at the start of the PUVA treatment and a history of arsenic use.
 This dose-related increase in the incidence of SCC, reported in studies from the U.S.A., has not been found in earlier European studies.
 The average time period between the start of PUVA therapy and the diagnosis of the first malignant skin tumour was 6.0 years for SCC and 4.7 years for BCC.
 Among the 49 benign skin tumours were actinic keratoses, a keratoacanthoma and 'PUVA keratoses', a newly described hyperkeratotic lesion, especially found in PUVA-treated patients.
