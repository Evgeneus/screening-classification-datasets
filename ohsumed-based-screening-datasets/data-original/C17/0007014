Association of labial salivary gland histopathology with clinical and serologic features of connective tissue diseases.
 Focal sialadenitis is now widely accepted as an objective criterion for the oral component of Sjogren's syndrome (xerostomia).
 We investigated the association between labial salivary gland histopathologic changes and the clinical and serologic features of 192 patients with suspected connective tissue disorders.
 A retrospective review of the medical records of all patients was performed, and historical, physical, laboratory, histologic, and roentgenographic data were abstracted.
 Each patient had undergone labial salivary gland biopsy as part of a rheumatologic evaluation.
 There were significant associations between positive findings on lip biopsy and the presence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (P = 0.013), positive antinuclear antibodies (titer greater than or equal to 1:80) (P = 2 x 10(-8)), and positive Ro antibodies (P = 1 x 10(-8)).
 However, sicca symptoms and glandular enlargement were not statistically associated with positive findings on lip biopsy.
 Features predictive of a positive lip biopsy included Ro antibodies (P = 0.914), keratoconjunctivitis sicca (P = 0.700), and positive antinuclear antibodies (P = 0.590).
