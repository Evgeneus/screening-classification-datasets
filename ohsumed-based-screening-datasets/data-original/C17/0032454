Syringoid eccrine carcinoma.
 Eccrine carcinomas are locally aggressive and have an infiltrative growth pattern.
 They have a variable clinical appearance and a diversity of histologic findings that often make the diagnosis difficult.
 The histologic findings, together with immunoperoxidase and enzyme histochemical studies, usually allow differentiation between eccrine carcinomas, other cutaneous neoplasms, and visceral adenocarcinomas with skin metastases.
 Provided there is no evidence of distant metastases, surgical excision is the treatment of choice.
 We report a case of syringoid eccrine carcinoma that was treated with Mohs micrographic surgery.
