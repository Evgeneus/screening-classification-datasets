Tissue expansion in the treatment of pressure ulcers.
 The authors report their experience using skin expanders in 11 patients with severe bed sores.
 The expanders, with different volumes, from 250 to 1000 cc, were generally overfilled using the cutaneous tonometer.
 In fact, with the information revealed by this apparatus on the skin in expansion, the authors were able to reduce the filling intervals without risking ulceration.
 In their experience, the results obtained were satisfactory: All patients treated achieved surgical recovery.
 The authors see a wide future for skin-expander use in pressure-ulcer treatment.
 They have a working hypothesis about using expanders to progressively advance sensitive skin in areas subject to ulceration.
 This hypothesis is based on the possibility of reexpanding the same flap several times, as has been seen in the treatment of other types of pathology.
