Sequential cerebrospinal fluid and plasma sampling in humans: 24-hour melatonin measurements in normal subjects and after peripheral sympathectomy.
 Simultaneous measurements of plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) melatonin and urinary excretion of 6-hydroxymelatonin were performed in four normal volunteers and one patient before and after upper thoracic sympathectomy for the control of essential hyperhidrosis.
 For normal individuals, hourly 24-h melatonin concentrations in plasma and CSF exhibited similar profiles, with low levels during the day and high levels at night.
 Peak plasma levels varied from 122-660 pmol/L, and the peak CSF levels from 94-355 pmol/L.
 The onset of the nocturnal increase in melatonin did not occur at the same time for each individual.
 Urinary 6-hydroxymelatonin levels also exhibited a daily rhythm, with peak excretion at night.
 The individual with the lowest nocturnal levels of circulating melatonin also had the lowest excretion of 6-hydroxymelatonin.
 In the patient with hyperhidrosis, a prominent melatonin rhythm was observed preoperatively in the CSF and plasma.
 After bilateral T1-T2 ganglionectomy, however, melatonin levels were markedly reduced, and the diurnal rhythm was abolished.
 These results provide direct evidence in humans for a diurnal melatonin rhythm in CSF and plasma as well as regulation of this rhythm by sympathetic innervation.
