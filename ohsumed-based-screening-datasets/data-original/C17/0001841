Preventing cervical cancer by treating genital warts in men. Why male sex partners need androscopy.
 The increased incidence of cancer of the genitourinary and anorectal areas has been directly related to the coexistence of genital human papillomavirus infection.
 The diagnosis and treatment of condyloma acuminatum in men is important not only to prevent cancer but also to decrease the reservoir of virus that is being transferred to women.
 Screening with androscopy (examination of male genitals with a colposcope after a vinegar solution has been applied to the skin) is indicated for all men who are at risk for this infection.
 Treatment options include chemical application, cryosurgery, laser therapy, and interferon injections.
 To be effective, treatment must include both sexual partners.
