A case of candidal umbilical granuloma.
 A case is reported of a 14-year-old boy with a mass arising from the umbilicus, which was a large, well-organized candidal granuloma.
 Cell markers showed normal numbers and distribution of peripheral T and B lymphocytes but there was no reaction to intradermal injection of Candida, suggesting a specific T-cell defect such as occurs in chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis.
