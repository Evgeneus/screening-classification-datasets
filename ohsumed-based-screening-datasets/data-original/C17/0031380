A quantitative structure activity/dose response relationship for contact allergic potential of alkyl group transfer agents.
 As part of the investigation of structure activity relationships in contact allergy, it has been shown that methyl transfer agents are capable of acting as skin sensitizers.
 This work has now been extended to a more general examination of alkyl transfer reactions.
 The modified single injection adjuvant test has been used to investigate the sensitization potential of C12, C16 and unsaturated C18 alkyl transfer agents.
 Dose responses to challenge and the patterns of cross-reactivity between these materials and methyl transfer agents have been studied.
 All alkyl transfer agents examined were potent sensitizers in the guinea pig.
 There was evidence of mutual cross-reactivity between all alkyl transfer agents examined (including methyl transfer agents).
 Analysis of the data in terms of a modified relative alkylation index showed evidence of an overload effect.
 The sensitization data has been accurately modelled using a mathematical equation.
 These results emphasize the possibilities for relating physicochemical parameters and skin sensitization potential.
 Further studies with alkyl transfer agents are in progress of amplify the observations and conclusions presented in this report.
 No in vitro model is available for the prediction of skin sensitization potential.
 Therefore an approach based on a model using physicochemical criteria is the most likely route to a reduced requirement for animal testing.
