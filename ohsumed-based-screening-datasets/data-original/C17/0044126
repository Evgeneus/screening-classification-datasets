Pre-employment screening for contact dermatitis among the pupils of a metal industry school.
 79 male pupils of a metal industry school were investigated, none of whom had yet been occupationally exposed to metals or to cutting oils.
 In 1 or 2 years, depending on their grade and age, they would all be employees in the metal industry.
 Each was patch tested with nickel sulfate 5% pet., cobalt chloride 1% pet., and potassium dichromate 0.5% pet., and 28 had a positive reaction to 1 or more of the metals tested.
 This finding indicates the necessity not only for pre-employment patch testing in industries where contact dermatitis is likely to occur, but that patch testing should be done even earlier in school children, before they decide to enter certain occupations.
