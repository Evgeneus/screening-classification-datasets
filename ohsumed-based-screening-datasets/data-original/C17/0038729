Isolation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in cutaneous blister fluid.
 The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been isolated from a number of body fluids, including semen, tears, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, breast milk, alveolar fluid, and vaginal fluid, but it has not been isolated from fluid-containing skin lesions.
 We report the isolation of HIV-1 from cutaneous blister fluid in a patient with concomitant HIV-1 infection and porphyria cutanea tarda.
 Although transmission of HIV-1 through casual contact has not been reported, appropriate precautions should be taken to avoid direct contact with cutaneous fluid-containing lesions in HIV-1-positive patients.
