HLA typing in polymorphous light eruption.
 Human leukocyte antigen typing of 41 white patients with polymorphous light eruption (limited concept) showed no significant differences when compared with the typing of 51 white control subjects.
 We previously found that actinic prurigo, an idiopathic photodermatosis particularly associated with Amerindians, has a positive association with antigens A24 and Cw4 and a negative association with A3.
 We suggest, on the basis of both laboratory and clinical findings, that polymorphous light eruption (limited concept) and actinic prurigo are two different and distinct diseases.
