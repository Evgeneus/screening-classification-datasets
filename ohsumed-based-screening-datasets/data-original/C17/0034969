Successful use of topical vitamin E solution in the treatment of nail changes in yellow nail syndrome.
 A double-blind controlled study was performed on a patient with long-standing yellow nail syndrome to investigate the potential beneficial role of topical vitamin E solution for the nail changes seen in this disorder.
 Three nails received active solution containing DL-alpha-tocopherol in dimethyl sulfoxide; three nails received dimethyl sulfoxide only; and the remainder were untreated.
 After 6 months of therapy, the three nails treated with active solution showed marked clinical improvement and a corresponding increase in nail growth rates.
 Dimethyl sulfoxide alone produced a small increase in nail growth rate and slight clinical improvement.
 Active solution was then applied to all of the nails for a further 6 months, resulting in clinical improvement and increased nail growth rates in the remaining nails.
 These beneficial effects require further study.
