Envenomation by the puss caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis).
 We discuss the case of a 52-year-old woman who developed urticarial lesions after the acute envenomation of a puss caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis).
 The puss caterpillar, one of more than 50 species of caterpillars that can cause envenomation in the United States, is considered to be one of the most serious.
 Its clinical presentation and current recommended treatments are reviewed.
