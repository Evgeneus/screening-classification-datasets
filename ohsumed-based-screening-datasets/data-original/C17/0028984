UVABA therapy for psoriasis. Efficacy with shortened treatment times with the combined use of coal tar, anthralin, and metal halide ultraviolet machines.
 Rapid clearing of psoriasis in a psoriasis treatment center setting has been obtained with a combination of short-contact coal tar, phototherapy from high-pressure metal halide lamps (consisting of UVA and UVB), and short-contact high-potency anthralin therapy.
 These intensive 1 1/2- to 2-hour treatment sessions done three or four times weekly were as efficacious as reported responses to PUVA therapy or conventional psoriasis day care therapy.
 The treatment schedule allows minimal time away from work, decreased hours per week in contact with crude coal tar, shortened UV treatment times, decreased cost, and a low risk of side effects.
 It is suggested that the use of UVA and UVB combined with anthralin (UVABA) is effective for many patients with moderate to severe psoriasis.
