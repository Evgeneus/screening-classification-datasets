Sensitizing risk of butylated hydroxytoluene based on exposure and effect data.
 A national database on chemical products (the Danish Product Register (PROBAS) was searched for products containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT).
 As of March 1990, 440 products containing BHT were registered.
 The content of BHT was below 50 ppm in 66% of these products.
 Paints/lacquers (1- and 2-component) and hardeners for 2-component paints, glues, fillers, etc.
 make up the main categories.
 No positive reactions were seen in 1336 consecutive eczema patients patch tested with BHT.
 From the widespread use of BHT, it was considered that BHT could be regarded as a safe antioxidant in the normally used concentrations.
 The possibilities, limitations, and demands of product registration as exposure estimates are discussed.
