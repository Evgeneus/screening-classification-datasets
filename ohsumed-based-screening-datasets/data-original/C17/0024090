Altered T cell subpopulations and lymphocytes expressing natural killer cell phenotypes in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis.
 Scleroderma (progressive systemic sclerosis [PSS]) is known to be associated with abnormal T cell immunoregulation.
 In the present study, we evaluated lymphocyte phenotypes in patients with PSS and normal control subjects by flow cytometry and monoclonal antibodies for total T (CD3), T suppressor (CD8), T helper (CD4), T helper-inducer (CDw29), T suppressor-inducer (CD45R), human leukocyte antigen, DR+B (CD19), DR+T, and natural killer subsets, HNK-1 (CD57) and NKH-1 (CD56) cells.
 Patients with PSS compared to normal subjects had significantly lower percentages of CD3+ (p less than 0.005) and CD8+ (p less than 0.05) (similar to several patients with rheumatoid arthritis also evaluated), as well as CD45R (p less than 0.05), T+DR+ (p less than 0.05), and NKH-1 (CD56) (p less than 0.0005) cells.
 Patients with PSS with late-limited or generalized disease had lower percentages of CD8+, CD19, NKH-1+, and CDw29, but higher percentages of CD4+, HNK-1, and CD45R cells compared to patients with early stage disease, but these results were not statistically significant.
 These unique alterations in patients with PSS may prove to be useful in monitoring the stage of disease activity for therapy and further define immunologic defects.
