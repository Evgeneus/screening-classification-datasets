Oral soft tissues in hereditary epidermolysis bullosa.
 Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is associated with diverse oral manifestations, which can potentially involve both hard and soft tissues, depending on the specific EB subtype.
 This study determined the frequency and extent of oral soft tissue involvement in the inherited forms of EB.
 Examination of 216 affected persons revealed significant differences in the oral soft tissue involvement among the various types of EB.
 The frequency of oral involvement was greater in the dominant dystrophic (81.1%) and simplex (generalized, 58.6%; localized, 34.7%) types than previously reported.
 The marked frequency of oral blistering was similar in both major subtypes of junctional (Herlitz, 83.3%; non-Herlitz, 91.6%) and recessive dystrophic EB (generalized, 100%; localized, 92.3%).
 Obliteration of the oral vestibule, ankyloglossia, and microstomia were consistent findings in generalized recessive dystrophic EB.
 Oral milia were present in all major EB categories, most prevalently in the dystrophic forms, but were not seen in all the distinct EB subtypes.
 These findings indicate that although there are no pathognomonic intraoral soft tissue manifestations in the various forms of inherited EB, there are predictable patterns of involvement associated with specific subtypes of this disease.
 Understanding the oral involvement associated with EB may aid clinicians in the development of more advanced therapeutic approaches that are compatible with and directed at the unique characteristics of each EB subtype.
