Response to sulfasalazine in rheumatoid arthritis: life table analysis of a 5-year followup.
 Eighty-six patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with sulfasalazine were followed for 5 years, or until treatment was discontinued.
 At the end of 5 years, there was a 22% probability of successfully continuing treatment.
 Most adverse effects developed in the first 3 months of treatment.
 In 38 patients treatment was discontinued because of inefficacy.
 In 18 of these, a brief period of improvement was followed by clinical relapse.
 Twenty were regarded as having no useful response to sulfasalazine.
 The treatment continuation rate of 22% at 5 years is in marked contrast to the pessimistic longterm evaluations of second line drugs that have recently been reported.
