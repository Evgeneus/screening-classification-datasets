Facial erysipelas: report of a case and review of the literature.
 The diagnosis of erysipelas is usually made clinically.
 Features that help distinguish erysipelas are acute onset, erythema, warmth, edema, pain, fever, and isolated regional involvement with clearly demarcated margins.
 High ASO titers and response to penicillin therapy are reassuring.
 Simple uncomplicated erysipelas or cellulitis in adults can usually be treated on an outpatient basis.
 Extensive facial involvement with fever and a toxic appearance warrants hospitalization.
 Facial cellulitis or erysipelas in children, unless quite limited, requires hospitalization because of the high risk of Hemophilus influenzae infection and sepsis.
 Hospitalized patients should show visible signs of resolution and be afebrile for at least 24 hours prior to discharge.
 They should be maintained on oral antibiotic therapy at home for an additional 7 to 10 days.
