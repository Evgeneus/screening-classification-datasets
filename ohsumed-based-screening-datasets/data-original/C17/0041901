Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid occurring as a sequela of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
 Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid is a chronic scarring inflammation of the ocular mucosae that can lead to blindness.
 Although cicatricial pemphigoid has been classified clinically, histopathologically, and immunopathologically, no definite initiating factor or precipitating factor has been identified.
 In this report, we describe five cases of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid that developed following an acute episode of severe ocular inflammatory injury secondary to Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
 The time lag between the onset of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and cicatricial pemphigoid ranged from a few months to 31 years.
 All five patients had linear immune deposits characteristic of cicatricial pemphigoid along the basement membrane zone of mucosal biopsy specimens as detected by either direct immunofluorescence microscopy or direct immunoperoxidase staining.
 In two patients whose serum was tested, a Western blot assay taken of keratinocyte antigens that had undergone electrophoresis reacted with the serum and identified a 120-kd epidermal antigen detected by the IgG class antibodies.
 All five patients were treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy for cicatricial pemphigoid, and we obtained objective responses.
 Severe ocular mucosal injury such as that which occurs in Stevens-Johnson syndrome may be a precipitating factor in the development of ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.
