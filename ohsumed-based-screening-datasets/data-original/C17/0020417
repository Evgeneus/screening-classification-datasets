TGF-alpha is widely expressed in differentiated as well as hyperproliferative skin epithelium.
 Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is a potent mitogen for epithelial cells that is expressed at low levels in normal epidermis and overexpressed in psoriasis.
 Epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to inhibit hair growth but stimulate the growth of sebaceous and sweat glands, suggesting a potential role for a member of the EGF/TGF-alpha family in the normal development and function of skin appendages as well as epidermis.
 The present work demonstrates TGF-alpha protein in eccrine ducts, and eccrine, sebaceous, and apocrine glands.
 The proliferative dermal hair bulb does not express TGF-alpha in contrast to the differentiated outer root sheath hair follicle epithelia.
 In addition, hyperproliferative skin diseases including bullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, squamous cell carcinoma, and psoriasis show increased TGF-alpha expression.
 Thus, TGF-alpha may play a role in the morphogenesis and function of normal skin appendages and its overexpression is common in benign and malignant hyperproliferative skin diseases.
