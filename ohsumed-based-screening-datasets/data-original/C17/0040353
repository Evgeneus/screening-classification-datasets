Intraoral reconstruction with a microvascular peritoneal flap.
 The microvascular peritoneal flap offers a new reconstructive option for closure of intraoral defects.
 The flap is easy to raise, and donor-site morbidity is low.
 Unlike fascial flaps, in which the raw surface may take weeks to "mucosalize," the peritoneal surface heals primarily.
 Finally, the rectus muscle effectively covers all forms of mandibular reconstruction, and the reliable skin paddle makes possible the closure of substantial cutaneous defects.
