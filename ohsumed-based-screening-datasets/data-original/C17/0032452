Pigmented postacne osteoma cutis in a patient treated with minocycline: report and review of the literature.
 Postacne osteoma cutis is a rare complication of acne vulgaris.
 If it occurs during a course of tetracycline or minocycline therapy, pigmented osteomas can occur as a result of tetracycline or minocycline bone complexes.
 We report a case of pigmented postacne osteoma cutis that developed after extensive acne surgery and a 2- to 3-month course of minocycline.
 Previously reported cases have been treated surgically, but our patient responded to 0.05% tretinoin cream, with transepidermal elimination of some osteomas.
