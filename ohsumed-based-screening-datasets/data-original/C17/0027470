Pachyonychia congenita tarda. A late-onset form of pachyonychia congenita.
 Pachyonychia congenita is an autosomal dominant disorder that usually develops in early infancy.
 We have observed five patients with the onset of the typical subungual hyperkeratoses of pachyonychia during the teenage years.
 Leukokeratosis and keratoderma of the palms and soles were associated.
 The family history of three of the patients suggests that pachyonychia congenita tarda is also inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
