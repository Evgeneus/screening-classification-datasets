Selective expression of immune-associated surface antigens by keratinocytes in irritant contact dermatitis.
 The expression of three immunoregulatory surface antigens by epidermal keratinocytes was studied in irritant contact dermatitis (ICD), in order to assess whether keratinocytes have a modulatory role in the pathogenesis of this disorder.
 Biopsies were taken from 48-h patch test reactions to six structurally unrelated irritants, and frozen sections immunolabeled with monoclonal antibodies to the major histocompatibility complex class II antigen, HLA-DR, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and the 88-Kd glycoprotein CD36 (OKM5), as well as to the CD3 (T cells) and CD11a (lymphocyte function associated antigen-1, LFA-1) antigens.
 We found that there was very limited expression of HLA-DR by keratinocytes, with no correlation between the extent of HLA-DR positivity and the degree of T cell infiltration into the epidermis and dermis, suggesting that interferon gamma may not be a significant mediator of ICD at 48 h.
 In contrast, keratinocytes showed extensive upregulation of ICAM-1, with an excellent spatial association between ICAM-1 expression and LFA-1 positive leucocytes in the epidermis.
 This indicates that keratinocyte ICAM-1 induction is not restricted to diseases in which antigen presentation is pivotal, but that it has a generalized role in cutaneous inflammatory reactions, promoting the infiltration of leucocytes into the epidermis.
 Immunolabeling with OKM5 revealed that CD36 is present to a variable degree on keratinocytes in normal skin.
 Differential changes in the pattern of keratinocyte expression occurred between irritants, in a manner that suggested that the CD36 antigen does not act as an adhesion molecule in ICD, but rather that its expression is related to the proliferative state of the epidermis.
 The results of this study demonstrate that immune-associated antigens are selectively expressed on the surface of keratinocytes in 48-h ICD biopsies, implying that these cells play an important regulatory role in the development of the inflammatory response to irritant chemicals.
