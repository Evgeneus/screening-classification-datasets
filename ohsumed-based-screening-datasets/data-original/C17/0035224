Rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis following intravenous vasopressin infusion.
 A continuous IV infusion of vasopressin was administrated to a patient with cirrhosis of the liver and acute gastrointestinal bleeding from esophageal varices.
 In the first 24 hours, the patient developed rhabdomyolysis and cutaneous necrosis.
 Stopping vasopressin infusion resulted in relief of these lesions.
 The rarity of these complications suggests an idiosyncratic reaction of susceptible individuals that may be related to previous vascular disease or a failure in baroreceptor regulation.
