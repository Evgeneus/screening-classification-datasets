Giant lichenification of the vulva with marked ulcerations. A case report.
 A case of vulvar giant lichenification of Pautrier showed uncommon ulcerations in the center of hyperplastic verrucoid plaques.
 The diagnosis was made from the history, clinical findings and characteristic features on the skin biopsy.
 Other causes of vulvar ulcers, such as venereal disease, chronic bullous and autoimmune diseases, and neoplastic conditions were excluded.
 We treated the patient with systemic antihistamines, topical antiseptics and corticosteroids, and sublesional injections of triamcinolone.
 The itch-scratch cycle was interrupted by the patient's wearing cotton gloves at night.
 Complete healing of the ulcers and an improvement in the pruritus was achieved within 14 weeks.
