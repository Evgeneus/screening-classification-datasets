The butterfly rash and the malar flush. What diseases do these signs reflect?
 The butterfly rash and malar flush are common facial manifestations of several disorders.
 Systemic lupus erythematosus may produce a transient rash before any other signs.
 In pellagra, symmetric keratotic areas on the face are always accompanied by lesions elsewhere on the body.
 Erysipelas produces brawny, fiery red facial lesions, and scarlet fever causes facial eruptions as part of a generalized eruption.
 Lupus vulgaris and lupus pernio produce nodules that may spread in a butterfly pattern, and seborrheic dermatitis has a predilection for the malar prominences and other areas of the face.
 Carcinoid syndrome often causes flushing attacks that vary in duration, and facial flushing that lasts throughout treatment may accompany chemotherapy if the patient has a hypersensitivity reaction.
 Deep-red rashes and/or lichenoid lesions may be caused by graft-versus-host disease in a patient undergoing bone marrow transplantation.
