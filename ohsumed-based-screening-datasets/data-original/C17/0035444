Improvement of psoriatic arthritis in a patient treated with bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia.
 We describe a woman with psoriatic arthritis who experienced a remarkable improvement of her skin and joint disease while only taking bromocriptine therapy.
 She was treated with bromocriptine for primary infertility due to hyperprolactinemia.
 The improvement in joint symptoms appeared to parallel that of the skin.
 More studies are required to determine the reproducibility of this observation.
