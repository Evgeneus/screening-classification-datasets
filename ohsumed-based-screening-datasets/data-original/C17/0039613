Molecular heterogeneity of acute intermittent porphyria: identification of four additional mutations resulting in the CRIM-negative subtype of the disease.
 Four mutations of the porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase gene that result in cross-reacting immunological material (CRIM)-negative forms of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) have been identified by in vitro amplification of cDNA from patients and by cloning of the amplified products in a bacterial expression vector.
 One mutation is a single base deletion which causes a frameshift and which is expected to result in the synthesis of a truncated protein.
 Two other mutations consist of single base substitutions and lead to amino acid changes.
 The fourth mutation is a single base substitution producing an aberrant splicing and resulting in an mRNA which would encode a protein missing three amino acids.
 DNAs from 16 unrelated CRIM-negative AIP patients were screened for the presence of these four mutations, by hybridization with oligonucleotides specific for each of the mutations, but none of the four mutations was identified in additional patients.
 The results indicate that mutations responsible for CRIM-negative AIP are highly heterogenous.
