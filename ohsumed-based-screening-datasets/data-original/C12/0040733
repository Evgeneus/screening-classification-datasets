The significance of an open bladder neck in women.
 The significance of an open bladder neck at rest has been investigated in 147 women presenting to a urodynamic clinic.
 The prevalence of this condition was 21%; there was an association with urethral sphincter incompetence but an open bladder neck was not diagnostic of it.
 It is suggested that the finding of an open bladder neck at rest during urodynamic investigation is of little consequence.
