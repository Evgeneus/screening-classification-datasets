Urethral controlled bladder substitution: a comparison between Parks S pouch and hemi-Kock pouch.
 To study the effect of the configuration of ileal reservoirs on the urodynamic features, 12 S bladders and 12 Kock pouches were compared.
 Volume capacity and pressure characteristics were studied 6 months postoperatively.
 The mean capacity of the reservoirs was 500 +/- 83 ml.
 for the S bladder and 536 +/- 56 ml.
 for the Kock pouch.
 The amplitudes of phasic contractions at 50%, 80% and 100% capacity were similar in both groups.
 However, the frequency of these contractions was higher in the S bladder.
 The intraluminal pressure at full capacity was 31 +/- 15 cm.
 water for the S bladder and 39 +/- 20 cm.
 water for the Kock pouch.
 The similar urodynamic features of the S and Kock pouches indicate their ultimate expansion into reservoirs of close physical characteristics and urodynamic behavior.
