Surgical treatment of concomitant urethral diverticulum and stress incontinence.
 Urinary incontinence is frequently associated with a urethral diverticulum in female patients.
 Preoperative evaluation including a thorough history and physical examination, voiding cystourethrogram, urethroscopy, and urodynamic studies can diagnose both the urethral diverticulum and any concomitant bladder-urethral dysfunction.
 Preoperative recognition of stress urinary incontinence or patients at risk for this problem postoperatively permits effective treatment with concomitant transvaginal bladder neck suspension and urethral diverticulectomy.
