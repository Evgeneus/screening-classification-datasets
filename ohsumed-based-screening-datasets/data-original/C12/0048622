Possible role of pure human follicle-stimulating hormone in the treatment of severe male-factor infertility by assisted reproduction: preliminary report.
 OBJECTIVE: Experimental clinical trial assessing the potential of systemic follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) to improve sperm fertilizing ability in in vitro fertilization (IVF).
 DESIGN: Retrospective clinical evaluation of severe male factor patients failing fertilization in IVF or showing severe sperm defects.
 SETTING: Academic tertiary clinical care unit.
 PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen patients (41 cycles) who failed IVF, 22 patients (32 cycles) with severe quantitative and qualitative semen abnormalities indicating poor fertilization.
 INTERVENTIONS: Treatment: FSH 150 U IM three times a week for 3 months.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(s): Pretreatment and post-treatment evaluation of endocrine profile, basic semen analysis, and fertilization and pregnancy rates.
 Hypothesis: FSH treatment may improve spermatogenesis quality by its multiple actions on the Sertoli-gamete cell compartment without interfering with testicular hormonogenic function.
 RESULTS: No significant changes were observed in the endocrine profile or in semen parameters; individual cases showed improvements in sperm concentration and motility.
 Significant increase in fertilization rate of preovulatory oocytes was demonstrated; seven term pregnancies were achieved.
 CONCLUSIONS: A multicenter randomized, double-blind trial with crossover is needed to demonstrate the benefit of systemic FSH administration and if this effect is FSH exclusive.
