Plasma concentrations of bupivacaine after supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade in patients with chronic renal failure.
 The plasma concentrations of bupivacaine and the latency and duration of anaesthesia after supraclavicular block with 30 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine were measured in 10 patients with chronic renal failure and in 10 patients with normal renal function.
 No significant difference was found between the two groups in respect of pharmacokinetic parameters, or in block latency or duration.
