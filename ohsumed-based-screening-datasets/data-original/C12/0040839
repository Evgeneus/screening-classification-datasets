Nutritional assessment in anemic hemodialysis patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin.
 Nutritional status was assessed in 25 anemic hemodialysis patients before and during erythropoietin treatment.
 Nutritional assessment included regular blood chemistry determinations, anthropometric measurements, analysis of protein content in skeletal muscle, and estimation of daily protein intake from protein catabolic rate determinations (using urea kinetic modelling) and dialysis efficiency for urea.
 These measurements were done immediately prior to erythropoietin treatment, after anemia correction and after one year of maintenance erythropoietin treatment.
 Both relative body weights and subcutaneous fat stores were low at the start, but increased significantly (p less than 0.05) during the study.
 Sixteen of the 25 patients gained weight and eight patients lost weight.
 The patients with weight gain had at the start of the study low weight indices (body weight 89.9 +/- 7.6% of ideal body weight, body mass index 20.6 +/- 1.6), significantly (p less than 0.005) lower than the patients with weight loss.
 Although protein malnutrition was not obvious from arm anthropometrics, alkali soluble protein/DNA ratio or from serum albumin determinations, ASP/DNA ratio, increased in three of five patients investigated after one year on erythropoietin treatment.
 Neither protein catabolic rate nor dialysis efficiency changed significantly during the study.
 We conclude that anemia correction with erythropoietin has a positive effect on malnutrition in hemodialysis patients.
 In patients with underweight, an adjustment of fat stores was initially observed, followed possibly by an improvement in muscle protein content.
