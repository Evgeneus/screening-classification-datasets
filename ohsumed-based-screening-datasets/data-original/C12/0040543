Congenital hydronephrosis: correlation of fetal ultrasonographic findings with infant outcome.
 Although congenital hydronephrosis is a common fetal disorder, ultrasonographic criteria for prenatal diagnosis remain poorly defined.
 In this study prenatal ultrasonographic findings were correlated with postnatal outcome in 63 fetuses with suspected hydronephrosis.
 Prenatal ultrasonographic measurements included length, anteroposterior diameter, and transverse diameter of the kidney and renal pelvis, as well as dorsal renal parenchymal thickness.
 In 45 of the 63 fetuses, hydronephrosis was confirmed postnatally.
 These infants were divided into two groups on the basis of renal status: (1) abnormal renal function and/or surgery required (n = 31) and (2) normal renal function with no surgery required (n = 14).
 The anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis was the simplest and most sensitive technique for prenatal diagnosis of congenital hydronephrosis, allowing identification of 100% of cases.
 Postnatal follow-up studies are warranted if an anteroposterior pelvic diameter is greater than or equal to 4 mm before 33 weeks or greater than or equal to 7 mm after 33 weeks.
