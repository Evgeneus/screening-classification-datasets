Androgens potentiate the effects of erythropoietin in the treatment of anemia of end-stage renal disease 
 Since androgens may increase the sensitivity of the erythroid progenitors to erythropoietin, the present studies were designed to investigate the effect of administration of androgens on the actions of exogenous erythropoietin (EPO) in hemodialysis patients.
 Studies were performed in a group of 15 adult male hemodialysis patients.
 Seven patients were treated with EPO alone at a dose of 2,000 U intravenously (IV) three times a week.
 An additional group of eight patients was treated with 2,000 U of EPO three times a week and also received 100 mg of nandrolone decanoate intramuscularly (IM) each week.
 After 12 weeks of therapy, hematocrit values increased slightly in the group receiving EPO alone, from 25.3 +/- 0.8 to 27.4 +/- 1.5.
 In contrast, EPO in combination with nandrolone decanoate resulted in a greater increase in hematocrit values, from 24.4 +/- 1.4 to 32.9 +/- 1.8 (P less than 0.001).
 The results show that the groups receiving low-dose EPO alone had a poor erythropoietic response.
 In contrast, patients receiving androgen in addition to EPO had a significantly greater increase in hematocrit values with treatment.
 Transfusions were eliminated in both groups of patients.
 These data show that androgen therapy significantly augments the action of exogenous EPO such that lower doses of EPO are sufficient for an adequate hematopoietic response.
