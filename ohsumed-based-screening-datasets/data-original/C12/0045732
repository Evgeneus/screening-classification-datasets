Effects of danazol, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, and a combination of danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist on experimental endometriosis.
 Effects of danazol, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (leuprolide), and danazol-leuprolide combination on experimental endometriosis were evaluated in female rats.
 A complete resorption of the fluid and a marked decrease in the volume of endometrium autotransplanted under the renal capsule were found after castration (1.4 +/- 0.1 mm3 in castrated, n = 14, vs 26.7 +/- 5.6 mm3 in intact control, n = 16).
 Histologic examination indicated atrophy and regression of the endometrial explant.
 These atrophic changes of endometrial explant were also induced by danazol, leuprolide, and the combination treatment.
 However, the volume of explants after combination therapy with danazol and leuprolide (1.8 +/- 1.0 mm3, n = 17) was significantly less than that after therapy with danazol (11.6 +/- 2.8 mm3, n = 20) or leuprolide alone (5.9 +/- 1.4 mm3, n = 24).
 The combination therapy (16/17) was also shown to be superior to danazol (9/20) or leuprolide alone (14/24) to induce the regression of fluid in experimental endometriosis.
 As expected, administration of leuprolide decreased the serum estradiol level, but use of danazol did not.
 These findings suggest that a combination therapy of danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, which show different modes of action, may be a potential modality in treatment of patients with advanced endometriosis.
