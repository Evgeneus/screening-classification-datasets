The value of tests predicting renovascular hypertension in patients with renal artery stenosis treated by angioplasty.
 The aim of this study was to evaluate tests predicting renovascular hypertension.
 This was done by relating the results of renal vein renin tests, the captopril test, and renal scintigraphic tests to the blood pressure outcome 12 months after relief of renal artery stenosis by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in 31 patients.
 Cure was seen in eight (26%).
 Improved blood pressure was obtained in 12 patients (39%), and in 11 patients (35%), the result for blood pressure was a failure.
 The accuracies of the two mathematical models used to analyze the renal vein renin assays were 44% and 60%.
 The captopril test showed a sensitivity of 36% and an accuracy of 43%.
 Renal captopril technetium Tc 99m-labeled pentetic acid scintigraphy gave a sensitivity of 60%.
 Stepwise logistic regression analysis of clinical variables in relation to blood pressure response revealed age as the only factor significantly related to blood pressure outcome.
 We conclude that the tests used are unfit for helping select patients for percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty and that age may have an important influence on outcome.
