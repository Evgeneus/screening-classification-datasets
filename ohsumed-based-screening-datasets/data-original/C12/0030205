Endourology of lower urinary tract.
 Two methods for obtaining percutaneous access to the bladder are described.
 Depending on whether or not urethral access is available an endoscopic or fluoroscopic technique may be applied.
 We have successfully performed suprapubic percutaneous cystolitholapaxy, antegrade fulguration of posterior urethral valves, antegrade cystourethroscopy as an adjunct for urethroplasty, and internal drainage of a bulbar urethral abscess.
 Endourologic techniques may be readily applied to the lower urinary tract and may be specifically indicated in certain situations.
