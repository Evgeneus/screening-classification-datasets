Algorithm for assessing renal dysfunction risk in critically ill trauma patients receiving aminoglycosides.
 A recent retrospective study proposed that the following screening criteria be used in identifying critically ill trauma patients receiving aminoglycosides who are at significant risk to develop renal dysfunction: (1) post-admission shock, (2) minimum serum concentration more than 2 mg/L, and (3) diagnosis of septicemia.
 The major purpose of the present study was to validate these criteria and design a corresponding algorithm for clinical use.
 All patients admitted to a trauma intensive care unit and receiving an aminoglycosides was also studied.
 All patients studied over a 7-month period.
 A control group not receiving aminoglycosides was also studied.
 All patients were evaluated for the presence of renal dysfunction (i.e., serum creatinine increase greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/dL).
 Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to compare potential associated risk factors.
 The overall renal dysfunction incidence was 10% in the treatment patients (n = 93) versus 5% in the control patients (n = 199) (p = 0.13).
 Sensitivity and specificity of the screening criteria were 67% and 92%, respectively.
 The predictive values of a positive and negative test relative to correctly labeling patients at high risk or low risk to develop renal dysfunction were 46% and 96%, respectively.
 Major risk factors associated with renal dysfunction in the treatment group were post-admission shock, minimum serum concentration more than 2 mg/L, and liver dysfunction.
 Use of three major risk factors has excellent predictive value in identifying severely traumatized patients at low risk for developing renal dysfunction while receiving aminoglycosides.
 The modest predictive value of a positive test results in conservative management of patients by avoidance of aminoglycosides, i.e., use of alternative antimicrobial agents.
