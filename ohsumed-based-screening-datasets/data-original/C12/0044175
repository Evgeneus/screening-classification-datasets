Elevated serum estradiol associated with increased androstenedione-testosterone ratio in adolescent males with varicocele and gynecomastia.
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate the testicular function in adolescents with pubertal gynecomastia associated with varicocele before and after varicocelectomy.
 DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We have studied six male adolescents 15 to 19 years of age with bilateral gynecomastia.
 They were selected among other adolescents with gynecomastia because of the presence of visible varicoceles.
 All of them had normal physical examination and secondary sexual characteristics.
 This was prospective study of 3 months' duration.
 All the patients that were included finished the study.
 SETTING: All the patients were evaluated in the Endocrine Clinic of Winthrop-University Hospital, a tertiary care unit.
 INTERVENTION: Serum testosterone (T), androstenedione (A), and estradiol (E2) responses to the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 2,000 IU for 3 consecutive days before and 3 months after varicocelectomy were determined.
 RESULTS: Varicocelectomy did not cause any significant changes in the basal (pre-hCG) levels of the steroid.
 However, the increase in T levels achieved with hCG was significantly (P less than 0.005) higher after varicocelectomy (before T, 925 +/- 212 ng%; after T, 1,649 +/- 406 ng%).
 Simultaneously, the stimulated levels of E2 and A were significantly lower (P less than 0.005) after varicocelectomy (E2, 62 +/- 12 pg/mL; A, 326 ng% +/- 80 ng%) than before (E2, 106 +/- 13 pg/mL; A, 580 ng% +/- 95 ng%).
 CONCLUSION: The reciprocal effect on the levels of T and its immediate precursor, A, suggests an impairment of the 17-ketoreductase enzyme activity.
 The increased levels of E2 after hCG and its normalization after varicocelectomy suggests that varicoceles may play a pathogenetic role in the development of gynecomastia.
