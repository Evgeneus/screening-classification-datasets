The effect of prostacyclin on intracranial pressure in patients with acute hepatic and renal failure.
 Prostacyclin was administered on 20 occasions to 12 patients with fulminant hepatic failure complicated by acute renal failure prior to commencing dialysis at a dose of 5 ng/kg.min.
 Intracranial pressure was noted to increase during the infusion from a median of 12 mmHg (95% confidence limits 9-14) to 17 mmHg (12-25), p less than 0.01, at the same time the mean arterial blood pressure declined from 79 mmHg (65-82) to 64 (56-70), p less than 0.01, and the cerebral perfusion pressure from 62 mmHg (53-67) to 44 mmHg (41-55), p less than 0.01.
 The changes were greater for those patients who subsequently died from cerebral edema.
 Patients with fulminant hepatic and acute renal failure are at risk of dying from cerebral edema.
 The direct administration of prostacyclin, used for extracorporeal anticoagulation, may cause a further increase in intracranial pressure and reduce cerebral perfusion, thus resulting in patient morbidity and mortality.
