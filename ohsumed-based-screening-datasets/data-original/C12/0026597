Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy: indications and technique.
 In spite of some long-term uncertainties, this new method for treating stones has one tenth the morbidity and risk of any comparable method of stone removal, at least in the short term.
 Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy can be used to treat 70% to 80% of stones that would otherwise require surgery to be removed.
 Using ESWL in conjunction with endoscopic procedures means that less than 1% of patients with stones will need an open surgical procedure.
 The need for metabolic evaluation and prevention of stone disease should continue to be emphasized, however, despite the lowered morbidity of treatment.
