Incidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia among residents of Rochester, Minnesota: 1980-87. A population-based study.
 The incidence and outcome of surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was studied in Rochester, Minnesota, during the period 1980-1987.
 Three hundred thirty Rochester men without a diagnosis of prostate or bladder cancer underwent prostatectomy for BPH for the first time.
 Mean and median ages were both seventy (range: 46-95).
 The incidence of initial prostatectomy for BPH among men forty-five years of age and older age-adjusted to the 1980 U.S.
 white male population was 642 cases per 100,000 persons per year (py).
 Among the 330 men undergoing initial prostatectomy for BPH, 14 (4.2%) had serious intraoperative complications, 32 (9.7%) were rehospitalized for urologic complications within thirty days of surgery, and 13 (3.9%) had other serious complications within thirty days after surgery, including 1 death (surgical mortality 0.3%).
 Forty-five patients (14%) required blood transfusions within thirty days of surgery.
 The likelihood of reoperation within six years of the initial surgery was 15.1 percent (95% CI 9.7, 20.6).
 Short- and long-term postoperative mortality was not statistically significantly different than expected based on age- and sex-specific mortality statistics for Rochester, Minnesota.
