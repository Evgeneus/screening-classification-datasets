Urophonographic studies of benign prostatic hypertrophy.
 The sonic detection and recording systems of urethral sounds generated during micturition were developed.
 This procedure was tentatively postulated as "urophonography" and its recording diagram as a "urophonogram".
 Classification of urophonograms was done on the basis of analyzing normal healthy male volunteers and patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 Four types of urophonograms were demonstrated according to the shape and characteristics.
 Types 1, 2, 3 and 4 were characterized by a diamond shape, irregular occurrences of sound spikes, the mixture of Types 1 and 2 and no remarkable sound spikes respectively.
 Types 1, 2, and 3 were found in BPH, while Type 4 was demonstrated in normal healthy male volunteers.
 After prostatectomy a high percentage of Type 4 was demonstrated.
 The frequency (Hz) of these sounds was around 650.
 Diamond shape sound showed higher value of power gain (dB) than irregular type sound.
 The wave length was around 0.50 (m).
 Comparison of urophonographic studies with conventional uroflowmetric investigation was undertaken.
 Urophonography was useful for investigations of dysfunctional voiding and lower urinary tract obstruction.
