Paediatric urolithiasis in Greece.
 A group of 44 patients, aged from 10 months to 14 years, underwent surgery for urinary calculi over a 7-year period (1982-1989).
 Eleven patients had bilateral or multiple calculi (total number of stones = 55, 20 of which were staghorn).
 Metabolic disorders (n = 25) and Proteus urinary infection (n = 15) were the 2 factors most often associated with lithiasis.
 Of the 55 stones, 51 were removed by open surgery.
 Complete stone clearance was achieved in 29 of 36 kidneys.
 Follow-up periods in the remaining 7 renal units (with small residual fragments) ranged from 3.5 to 7.5 years (mean 6.2) and revealed stone recurrence in only 2 patients.
 Evaluation of childhood urolithiasis should include thorough metabolic investigation and sound surgical judgment; effective management requires prolonged post-operative follow-up.
