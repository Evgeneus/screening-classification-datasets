Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy or extracorporeal piezoelectric lithotripsy? Comparison of costs and results.
 One thousand patients with renal stones up to 3 cm in diameter were divided equally into 2 groups matched for age, sex and stone size.
 One group was treated on the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor and the other on the EDAP LT01.
 The results showed that for stones less than 1 cm both lithotriptors were equally effective, with a stone-free rate of 87.5% for the Dornier and 90.4% for the EDAP at 3 months.
 The success rate fell more steeply for the EDAP machine, however, to become 77.2 and 42.5% respectively as the stone size increased to 3 cm.
 Treatment time was longer on the EDAP lithotriptor and more sessions were required but patients preferred it to the Dornier.
 Running costs per patient were higher on the EDAP.
