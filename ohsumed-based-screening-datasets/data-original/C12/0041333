Long-term follow-up after radical prostatectomy. Identification of prognostic variables.
 We report one of the largest series of patients treated by radical prostatectomy followed for a minimum of 10 years.
 The tumor-free survival rate at 10 years seems superior to that achieved with alternative methods of treatment.
 Pathologic stage, DNA histograms, and tumor grade all correlate with prognosis but none is sufficiently powerful as an independent factor to allow selection of patients for surgery.
 Although a survival benefit has not been demonstrated, adjuvant treatment such as postoperative irradiation or early hormonal therapy may be indicated in patients with established poor prognostic factors.
