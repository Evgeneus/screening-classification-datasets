T-cell lymphoma and mature nephroblastoma after synchronous bilateral Wilms' tumor.
 A 15-year-old boy had lymphoblastic lymphoma of the left tonsil after being treated for bilateral Wilms' tumor (BWT) at 7 months of age.
 In addition, a fully differentiated Wilms' tumor was diagnosed in the remaining, partially nephrectomized left kidney.
 Development of second malignancies in patients with a history of BWT, as compared with those with unilateral Wilms' tumor, is discussed.
 A possible explanation for the concurrently diagnosed, fully differentiated Wilms' tumor in the remaining left kidney is suggested.
