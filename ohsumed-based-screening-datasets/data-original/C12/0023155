The quality of life in women with urinary incontinence as measured by the sickness impact profile.
 The objectives of this paper were to assess the quality of life of community-living women with urinary incontinence according to age, symptom group, amount of leakage, and duration, by use of the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP).
 Thirty-six women aged between 40 and 60 years and 40 women aged 70 years or more were randomly selected from the clients attending an incontinence clinic and interviewed using the SIP questionnaire.
 Urge and stress incontinence subgroups were defined by means of a symptom questionnaire.
 Total, psychosocial, and physical dysfunctions were moderate (8%, 7%, and 8% respectively) in general, but major differences were found when age and symptom groups were analysed.
 Urge symptoms were associated with more impairment than symptoms of stress incontinence.
 The elderly women with symptoms of stress incontinence were relatively little affected, while their younger counterparts were severely affected, especially in the categories of emotional behavior and recreation and pastimes.
 We conclude that urinary incontinence in women adversely affects quality of life to a significant degree; the extent depends on the nature of incontinence and the age of the person.
