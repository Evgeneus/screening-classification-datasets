Anesthesia-free in situ extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of ureteral stones.
 Stones in the proximal, mid and distal ureter in 375 consecutive patients were treated with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in a technically unmodified Dornier HM3 lithotriptor without regional or general anesthesia.
 Adequate followup was available in 162 patients with proximal, 62 with mid and 146 with distal ureteral stones.
 The fraction of patients with stone-free ureters within 3 months after ESWL was 96, 97 and 97%, respectively.
 Of all patients only 13 (3.6%) had residual stones or fragments in the ureter after 3 months.
 The average number of ESWL sessions was 1.34 for all patients, and 1.36, 1.45 and 1.38 for those with proximal, mid and distal ureteral stones, respectively.
 A ureteral catheter with saline irrigation was used whenever it was possible to insert a ureteral catheter.
 Only 15 stones were pushed up to the kidney during catheterization and all other stones were treated in situ.
 There were more retreatments in patients in whom the stone had not been bypassed by a catheter at the initial ESWL session.
 During at least 1 treatment session 238 patients had a ureteral catheter with the tip above the stone.
 Approximately half of all patients were treated after only premedication with pethidine and diazepam, and cutaneous half of all patients were treated after only premedication with pethidine and diazepam, and cutaneous anesthesia with an anesthetic cream containing lidocaine-prilocaine (for proximal and mid ureteral stones).
 Small supplements of pethidine and diazepam were given to the other patients during the ESWL session.
 In situ ESWL of ureteral stones as described is a convenient, efficient and attractive procedure that, applied in a consequent manner, theoretically might result in a successful outcome in up to 98% of the patients.
