Inflammatory pseudotumor in childhood. A diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.
 We describe a case of inflammatory pseudotumor of the lower abdomen in a young child.
 The urinary bladder and abdominal wall were involved, and the pseudotumor simulated a malignant sarcomatous tumor.
 Surgical excision was undertaken, and the outcome was favorable.
 This rare tumor simulates a true neoplasm both clinically and morphologically and presents a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma.
 Our case and a review of the literature indicate that an effort should be made to perform a radical excision.
 This is considered the treatment of choice except if it requires a mutilating procedure.
