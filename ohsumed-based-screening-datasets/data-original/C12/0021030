Diagnosis of chronic abacterial prostato-vesiculitis by rectal ultrasonography in relation to symptoms and findings.
 A group of 36 men with chronic abacterial prostato-vesiculitis, confirmed by semen analysis and rectal ultrasonography, underwent detailed anamnesis and clinical examination.
 There was no clear relationship between the severity of the symptoms or the presence of leucocytes and the extent of the changes visualised by ultrasound.
 In 72% of cases, clinical examination also revealed signs of a previous epididymitis.
 In general, asymmetry in symptoms could be related to glandular pathology, as indicated by ultrasonography, on the ipsilateral side.
