Plasma conjugated androgens in a dialysis-dependent male as immunoreactive digitalis-like factors.
 Endogenous digitalis-like factors (DLF) including those which were immunoreactive with digoxin antibody and those which displaced ouabain from Na,K-ATPase, were isolated from the plasma of a dialysis-dependent male patient not taking digoxin.
 Plasma was passed through a C18 disposable column, the DLF eluted with methanol and separated by HPLC on a C8 column.
 Immunoreactive DLF were measured in each 1 ml HPLC fraction using radioimmunoassay (RIA) for digoxin.
 The immunoreactive peaks were determined and aliquots from each peak analyzed by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy (FAB-ms).
 The compounds in the five major HPLC immunoreactive peaks were identified as: 1) dehydroepiandrosterone glucuronide and tetrahydrocortisone glucuronide; 2) epiandrosterone glucuronide; 3) dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate and androsterone glucuronide; 4) epiandrosterone sulfate and 5) androsterone sulfate and androstanediol glucuronide.
 These immunoreactive DLF represent 70% of the total plasma immunoreactive DLF of 0.124 micrograms digoxin equivalents/l.
 Aliquots of the HPLC fractions were also assayed for ability to displace ouabain from Na,K-ATPase.
 The ouabain displacing DLF gave a very different elution pattern from that obtained by RIA with the major Na,K-ATPase ouabain displacing DLF eluting in the more polar fractions.
 They remain unidentified.
