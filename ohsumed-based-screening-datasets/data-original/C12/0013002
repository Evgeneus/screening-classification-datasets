Ultrasonographic findings of testicular microlithiasis associated with intratubular germ cell neoplasia.
 Testicular microlithiasis is an uncommon condition in which calcified concretions fill the lumina of seminiferous tubules.
 We report the case of a twenty-three-year-old white man with a metastatic germ cell tumor and normal findings on testicular physical examination, but abnormal ultrasonography of the right testis.
 Orchiectomy revealed intratubular germ cell neoplasia with testicular microlithiasis.
 Multiple circular echogenic foci on ultrasound correlated with the histologic finding of testicular microlithiasis.
 Further studies are indicated for assessing ultrasonography as an adjunct for screening the population at risk for intratubular germ cell neoplasia.
