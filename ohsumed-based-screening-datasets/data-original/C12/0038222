Plasma immunoreactive endothelin-1 in experimental malignant hypertension.
 We measured plasma concentrations of immunoreactive endothelin-1 (irET-1) in the prehypertensive and hypertensive phases in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and in malignant hypertension caused by deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt administration in SHR.
 We also measured concentrations of this peptide in another model of malignant hypertension, the two-kidney, one clip (2K1C) renovascular hypertensive rats chronically given caffeine.
 Plasma irET-1 concentrations in young (6-week-old) and mature (18-week-old) SHR did not differ from those of age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.
 Four weeks of treatment with DOCA-salt increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and plasma irET-1 in SHR but not in WKY rats.
 Eight weeks of DOCA-salt treatment further increased these values in SHR.
 Plasma irET-1 concentrations were not increased in the 2K1C rats.
 Six weeks of caffeine administration increased blood pressure, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, plasma renin activity, and plasma irET-1 in the 2K1C rats but not in the sham-operated rats.
 High-performance liquid chromatographic profiles of plasma extracts pooled from these rats with malignant hypertension showed that a major component of irET-1 eluted in the position of synthetic ET-1 (1-21).
 Furthermore, acute hypertension induced by angiotensin II or phenylephrine did not affect the plasma irET-1 concentration in rats.
 The results suggested that the plasma ET-1 concentration is increased in rat models of malignant hypertension and that the high blood pressure itself is not the main factor involved in the increase of plasma ET-1.
