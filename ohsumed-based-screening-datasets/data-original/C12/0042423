Results of Medical Research Council phase II study of low dose cisplatin and methotrexate in the primary treatment of locally advanced (T3 and T4) transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 A series of 49 previously untreated patients with category T3 or T4 bladder cancer underwent treatment with low dose methotrexate and cisplatin; 44 patients were eligible for assessment of response.
 Complete response (CR) was seen in 5 patients (11%) and partial response in 15 (34%) (overall response rate 45%).
 Treatment was reasonably well tolerated with no major morbidity and no treatment-related deaths.
 After a median follow-up of 3.5 years, the 1-year and 2-year survival rates were 70 and 30% respectively.
 Ten patients remain recurrence-free without having received "definitive local therapy" (cystectomy and/or radiotherapy) at follow-up extending from 20 to 50 months.
