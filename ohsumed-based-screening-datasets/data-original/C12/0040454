Urinary symptom and quality of life questions indicative of obstructive benign prostatic hyperplasia. Results of a pilot study.
 In a pilot study of a urinary symptom and health-related quality-of-life questionnaire for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), responses from 64 Mayo Clinic patients with cystoscopic evidence of obstructive BPH were compared with those of 14 men with no cystoscopic evidence of BPH and a community sample of 64 comparably aged men with no medical history of prostate enlargement.
 Questions which best discriminated between the groups were those dealing with urinary symptom frequency, bother due to urinary symptoms, and worry and concern about urinary problems.
 The results suggest that urinary-symptom-bother and worry due to urinary symptoms may be important additions to the more usual questions asked about urinary frequency in the identification of men with BPH.
 These findings are preliminary, however, and will be verified in an ongoing natural history study of BPH.
