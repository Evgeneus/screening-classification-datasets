A mouse model of the aniridia-Wilms tumor deletion syndrome.
 Deletion of chromosome 11p13 in humans produces the WAGR syndrome, consisting of aniridia (an absence or malformation of the iris), Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma), genitourinary malformations, and mental retardation.
 An interspecies backcross between Mus musculus/domesticus and Mus spretus was made in order to map the homologous chromosomal region in the mouse genome and to define an animal model of this syndrome.
 Nine evolutionarily conserved DNA clones from proximal human 11p were localized on mouse chromosome 2 near Small-eyes (Sey), a semidominant mutation that is phenotypically similar to aniridia.
 Analysis of Dickie's Small-eye (SeyDey), a poorly viable allele that has pleiotropic effects, revealed the deletion of three clones, f3, f8, and k13, which encompass the aniridia (AN2) and Wilms tumor susceptibility genes in man.
 Unlike their human counterparts, SeyDey/+ mice do not develop nephroblastomas.
 These findings suggest that the Small-eye defect is genetically equivalent to human aniridia, but that loss of the murine homolog of the Wilms tumor gene is not sufficient for tumor initiation.
 A comparison among Sey alleles suggests that the AN2 gene product is required for induction of the lens and nasal placodes.
