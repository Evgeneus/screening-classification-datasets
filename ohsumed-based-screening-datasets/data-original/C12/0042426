Early endoscopic realignment of complete traumatic rupture of the posterior urethra.
 Early primary endoscopic realignment of complete traumatic rupture of the posterior urethra is a simple, rapid and non-traumatic technique.
 We have recently treated 5 patients in this manner.
 All are continent and 4 are potent.
 Four patients were followed up for 1 year.
 One patient required no further management and had excellent urinary flow rates.
 The other 3 developed short secondary strictures which were managed successfully by 1 or 2 internal urethrotomies.
