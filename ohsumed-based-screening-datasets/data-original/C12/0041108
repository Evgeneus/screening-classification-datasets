Single potential analysis of cavernous electrical activity in impotent patients: a possible diagnostic method for autonomic cavernous dysfunction and cavernous smooth muscle degeneration.
 Cavernous electrical activity was recorded in 214 patients with erectile dysfunction and in 39 normal patients.
 In 34 of the 39 normal patients potentials of a uniform shape were recorded during flaccidity.
 At cutoff frequencies of 0.5 to 500 Hz.
 the duration was 8 to 18 seconds (mean 12.8 +/- 2.8, seconds, standard deviation), the amplitude was 250 to 750 microv.
 (mean 444 +/- 109 microv.) and the polyphasity was 8 to 22 (mean 13.8 +/- 3.3).
 With increasing tumescence and rigidity during audiovisual sexual stimulation, high frequency potentials of low amplitude and short duration were found in the normal patients.
 In impotent patients with an upper motor neuron or peripheral lesion specific types of potentials were observed.
 In 11 of 14 impotent patients with insulin-dependent diabetes for more than 20 years and with clinical findings of cavernous myopathy the potentials showed low amplitude, irregular shape and slow depolarizations.
 Abnormal findings of cavernous electrical activity were recorded in 51.6% of the consecutive impotent patients.
 Our clinical study suggests that single potential analysis of cavernous electrical activity may be useful in the diagnosis of cavernous autonomic neuropathy and cavernous smooth muscle myopathy.
