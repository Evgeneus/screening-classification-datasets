Neurophysiologic studies of the peripheral nervous system in nephropathic cystinosis.
 Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder in which nonprotein cystine accumulates within most body tissues due to a defect in lysosomal cystine transport.
 Neurologic declarations are only recently being recognized.
 We studied 13 cystinotic subjects (aged 5 to 21 years old), determining median motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities, F waves, peroneal motor nerve conduction velocities, sural sensory nerve conduction velocities, median sympathetic skin response, electrocardiogram R-to-R variability, and blink reflex analysis.
 The results were normal.
 We conclude that neurophysiologic testing suggests relative sparing of the peripheral nervous system in nephropathic cystinosis.
