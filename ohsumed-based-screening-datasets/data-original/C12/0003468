Anaesthesia for renal transplantation in sickle cell disease.
 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is associated with many pathological and functional abnormalities affecting all organ systems.
 Renal manifestations of SCD may result in end-stage renal disease (ESRD), which can be treated by chronic haemodialysis or renal transplantation.
 Renal transplantation was successfully performed in a 25-yr-old male with sickle cell beta-thalassaemia and nephrotic syndrome.
 We present a case report of this patient, a discussion of the renal complications associated with SCD and the perioperative management of a patient with SCD undergoing renal transplantation.
