Treatment of recurrent urethral strictures using clean intermittent self-catheterisation.
 The treatment of urethral strictures has been greatly improved by the use of the optical urethrotome.
 However, there remains a group of patients with recurrent strictures for whom the alternatives remain long-term dilatation/urethrotomy or urethroplasty.
 Over the last 3 years we have treated 65 such patients using clean intermittent self-catheterisation as a method of self-dilatation.
 This has resulted in a dramatic decrease in the number of operations performed on these patients, with no significant reduction in urinary flow rate over an average follow-up period of 20 months.
 The method offers the possibility of long-term cure and should be offered to all all such patients, reducing still further the number of patients who require urethroplasty.
