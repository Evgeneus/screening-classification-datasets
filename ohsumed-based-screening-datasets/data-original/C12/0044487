Adjunct controlled inversion therapy following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for lower pole caliceal stones.
 The lower calix is responsible for a significant number of kidneys with residual stone fragments after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*).
 To compare the effectiveness of controlled inversion therapy as an adjunctive method to the elimination of calculous fragments, 42 patients who had undergone treatment for lower caliceal stones with a Siemens Lithostar lithotriptor were reviewed.
 Of the patients 25 had no adjunctive therapy and 17 underwent controlled inversion therapy.
 The success rate, effectiveness quotient and complication rate were analyzed.
 Followup consisted of ultrasound and a nephrotomogram 1 day and 1 to 3 months postoperatively.
 Complete removal of all stone fragments was achieved in 84% of the patients without an adjunctive maneuver and in 64.7% of those treated with controlled inversion therapy.
 The effectiveness quotient was 72.4% and 35.5%, respectively.
 The group treated without adjunctive therapy had fewer retreatment sessions and a lower complication rate.
 There were no complications related to the controlled inversion therapy and patient acceptance was generally enthusiastic.
 We conclude that controlled inversion therapy did not improve the results of ESWL for lower pole caliceal calculi.
