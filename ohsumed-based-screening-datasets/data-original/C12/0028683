Health implications of obesity in American Indians and Alaska Natives.
 American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are experiencing an epidemic of diabetes, increasing rates of coronary artery disease and hypertension, and poor survival rates for breast cancer that are likely partially attributable to the increasing prevalence of obesity over the past generation.
 Obesity may also contribute to the high rates of gallstones and to adverse outcomes of pregnancy in AI/ANs.
 Although overall mortality was not associated with obesity in Pima Indians (except in the most obese men), the relationship of obesity to longevity in other AI/AN groups is not known.
 Further study of the specific health effects of obesity in various groups of AI/ANs are needed.
 In the meantime, community-based programs to prevent obesity and its sequelae should be implemented in all AI/AN communities.
