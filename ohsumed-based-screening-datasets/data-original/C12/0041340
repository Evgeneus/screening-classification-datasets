Transurethral resection and intravesical therapy of superficial bladder tumors.
 The treatment of superficial bladder cancer is aimed at eradicating existing disease, inhibiting tumor recurrence, and preventing progression to invasion or metastasis.
 Transurethral resection is the primary modality, with intravesical therapy used in some cases to kill residual overt or occult carcinoma and premalignant lesions.
 Among the agents tested extensively, BCG appears to be more effective than mitomycin C, doxorubicin, or thiotepa, especially against carcinoma in situ.
 A number of questions remain to be answered about the management of this disease.
