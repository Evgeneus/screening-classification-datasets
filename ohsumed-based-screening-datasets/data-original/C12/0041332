Ratio of polyclonal-monoclonal prostate-specific antigen levels. Discrimination of nodal status in prostate tumors that produce low marker levels.
 The preliminary data we present in this report suggest that the ratio of polyclonal-monoclonal serum prostate-specific antigen levels may add clinically useful information to that obtained using serum prostate-specific antigen levels alone.
 We hypothesize that the diversity of prostate-specific antigen ratios observed in our data reflects a diversity in the antigenic and structural attributes of prostate-specific antigen molecules found in the sera of patients with prostate cancer.
 Further, this heterogeneity of molecules is a reflection of the diverse and altered metabolic state of human prostate cancer and appears to be related to biologic behavior in individual patients.
