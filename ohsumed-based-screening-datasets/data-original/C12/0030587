Indoramin in the treatment of prostatic bladder outflow obstruction.
 A series of 40 patients took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of indoramin in prostatic bladder outflow obstruction.
 Patients were assessed clinically and urodynamically before and after 4 weeks' treatment.
 Significant improvement was seen in nocturia, volume voided, flow rates and residual urine.
 The drug was well tolerated, although 7 patients on treatment and 7 on placebo noted side effects.
 These results suggest that indoramin may be a useful agent in the symptomatic management of bladder outflow obstruction.
