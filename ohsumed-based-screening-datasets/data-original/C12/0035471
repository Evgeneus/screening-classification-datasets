Involvement of thromboxane A2, leukotrienes and free radicals in puromycin nephrosis in rats.
 Thromboxane A2 (TXA2), leukotrienes (LTs) and free radicals are considered to be possible mediators in the induction of glomerular injury and proteinuria.
 In this study, we examined the involvement of these three mediators and the protective effect of simultaneous inhibition of all three in puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) nephrosis in rats.
 A single intraperitoneal injection of PAN (100 mg/kg) induced massive proteinuria and enhanced production of TXA2 and LTs from arachidonic acid in renal cortical slices and renal glomeruli, and increased malondialdehyde levels in plasma, urine and renal cortex.
 Oral administration of CV-6504(HCl) (3 to 20 mg/kg/day, for 1 to 2 weeks), a novel treble inhibitor of TXA2 synthetase, 5-lipoxygenase and lipid peroxidation, dose-dependently attenuated PAN-induced proteinuria and the increases in these three mediators.
 Any single specific inhibitor (CV-4151, a TXA2 synthetase inhibitor; AA-861, a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; or CV-3611, a radical scavenger) or a combination of two inhibitors showed no or only a slight antiproteinuric effect, but the combination of all three inhibitors significantly reduced PAN-induced proteinuria.
 These results suggest that, these three mediators may be involved in the pathogenesis of PAN nephrosis and that CV-6504(HCl), which can simultaneously inhibit all three, may be a useful therapeutic agent for nephrosis.
