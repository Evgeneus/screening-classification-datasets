Effect of clean intermittent catheterisation on radiological appearance of the upper urinary tract in children with myelomeningocele.
 Of the 102 consecutive children with myelomeningocele who were treated by intermittent catheterisation between 1977 and 1985, 89 were investigated with regard to the development of the upper urinary tract.
 The median follow-up period was 6.7 years.
 Dilatation and vesicoureteric reflux were assessed by means of repeated urography and voiding cystourethrography.
 Of the 49 children with normal radiology at the start of catheterisation, all but 2 remained normal.
 In 27 with isolated dilatation of the upper urinary tract or reflux at the start, 17 subsequently became normal.
 Dilatation together with reflux was seen in 13 patients at the start; 3 became normal, 4 still had reflux and in 6 patients both dilatation and reflux persisted.
 Intermittent catheterisation thus had a positive effect on the upper urinary tract in the vast majority of cases.
 In children with both dilatation and reflux, however, there is a risk of deterioration and they should be followed up closely.
