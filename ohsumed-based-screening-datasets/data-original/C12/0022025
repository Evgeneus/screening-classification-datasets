Renal vascular effects of calcium channel blockers in hypertension.
 Recent evidence suggests that calcium channel blockers have specific effects on renal hemodynamics in patients with hypertension and may also slow the progression of chronic renal failure.
 When these agents are studied in vitro, their predominant effect is to reverse afferent arteriolar vasoconstriction induced by catecholamines or angiotensin II.
 Because efferent resistance may remain high, glomerular filtration rate rises while renal blood flow remains low.
 The effects in vivo are less consistent.
 In human hypertension, calcium channel blockers lower renal resistance and may raise both renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate.
 In experimental models of chronic renal disease, calcium channel blockers slow the progression of renal damage; however, variable effects on renal hemodynamics have been found.
 Other factors implicated in the progression of renal damage, including compensatory renal hypertrophy, platelet aggregation, and calcium deposition, may also be favorably influenced by these agents.
 Recent studies suggest that calcium channel blockers may have similar protective effects in patients with hypertension and chronic renal disease.
