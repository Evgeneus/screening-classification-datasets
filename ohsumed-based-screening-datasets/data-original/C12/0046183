Plasma level of atrial natriuretic peptide as an indicator of increased cardiac load in uremic patients.
 Plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) were measured by radioimmunoassay in 43 non-dialyzed uremic patients at rest and during maximal exercise to assess the possible relationship between plasma ANP levels and cardiac function, as judged by M-mode echocardiography and exercise tolerance.
 Patients with poor exercise capacity (exercise time less than 6 min) on dynamic exercise test had decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, increased left atrial diameter, and increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI), compared with patients with better exercise capacity (exercise time greater than 6 min).
 Plasma ANP was significantly higher in patients with poor exercise capacity and impaired cardiac function (202 pg/ml [95% confidence interval 119 to 284] at rest and 227 pg/ml [149 to 304] during exercise), compared with patients with better exercise capacity (75 pg/ml [50 to 102], p less than 0.005, and 123 pg/ml [80 to 167], p less than 0.05, respectively).
 Plasma ANP increased significantly (p less than 0.005) during exercise only in patients with better cardiac function.
 The best correlation among the variables studied was found between LVMI and plasma ANP concentration at rest (r = 0.56, p less than 0.001) and during exercise (r = 0.51, p less than 0.005), whereas neither blood pressure nor renal function showed any significant correlation with ANP levels.
 We conclude that plasma ANP levels are elevated in uremic patients with impaired cardiac function, correlating with increased LVMI.
 Plasma ANP determinations are useful in identifying increased cardiac load and consequent cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction with known associations with increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with chronic renal failure.
