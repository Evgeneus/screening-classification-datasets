Primary vesicoureteric reflux: treatment with subureteric injection of Polytef paste.
 A series of 34 children with 40 primary refluxing ureters were treated endoscopically with a subureteric injection of polytetrafluoroethylene paste (Polytef).
 The amount injected ranged between 0.1 and 0.8 ml (mean 0.3).
 A single injection cured the reflux in 26 ureters (65%) and the grade of reflux improved in a further 9 ureters.
 Seven ureters required a second injection and reflux was cured in 6 of these.
 The overall cure rate was therefore 80% after the second injection.
 There was one complication due to self-limiting ureteric obstruction following injection.
 The procedure is quick, easy to perform and effective.
 We have some reservations about the long-term efficiency and safety of subureteric Polytef injection in children.
