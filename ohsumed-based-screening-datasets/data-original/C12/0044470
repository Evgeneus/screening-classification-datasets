Mast cell infiltration in intestine used for bladder augmentation in interstitial cystitis.
 Two patients with histologically confirmed interstitial cystitis underwent bladder augmentation procedures (clam cystoplasty and Mainz pouch cystoplasty) because of therapy resistant low abdominal pain and decreased functional bladder capacity.
 However, symptoms of low abdominal pain and urinary retention (1 patient) persisted, and cystectomy was performed in both patients after 14 and 20 months, respectively.
 Histological examination of the specimens showed changes in the intestinal areas of the augmented bladder, resembling interstitial cystitis.
 The etiology of this phenomenon and the possible role of intestinal interstitial cystitis in augmentation failures are discussed.
