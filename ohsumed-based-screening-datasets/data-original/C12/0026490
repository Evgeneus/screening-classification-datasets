Toxicity study of first and second generation hydrogel-coated latex urinary catheters.
 The hydrogel-coated urinary catheter is a novel formulation in which the coating hydrogel polymer is claimed to reduce the level of cytotoxicity frequently associated with the use of latex catheters.
 This study was undertaken to measure cytotoxicity using in vivo techniques.
 Twelve first generation and 5 second generation hydrogel-coated latex catheters were evaluated in vivo using canine urethras.
 The results showed all catheters to cause minimal inflammatory changes of the urethral mucosa (toxicity score 0-1.2/6).
