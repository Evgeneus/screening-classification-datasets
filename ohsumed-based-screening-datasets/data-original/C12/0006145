Management of superficial G2 (pTa and pT1) bladder cancer.
 A total of 143 patients with superficial G2 (pTa, pT1) bladder cancer (48 G2pTa; 95 G2pT1) presenting between 1970 through 1987 were reviewed.
 Of 48 patients with G2pTa followed for up to eighteen years, G3 recurrence developed only in 1 (2.0%), and invasive cancer (greater than pT2) developed only in 2 (4.2%).
 They both received radiotherapy and have responded completely.
 There have been no cancer-related deaths.
 In contrast, in the 95 patients in whom the basement membrane had been breached (pT1), higher grade tumor (G3) developed in 11 (11.5%), and 15 (16%) had recurrences with invasion of muscle (greater than pT2).
 Among these there were 7 (7.3%) cancer-related deaths.
