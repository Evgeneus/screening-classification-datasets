Simple tests to determine urinary risk factors and calcium oxalate crystallization in the outpatient clinic.
 We developed 2 simple and rapid tests for measurement of constituent concentrations and the stone-forming tendency of urine in the outpatient clinic.
 The concentrations of urinary constituents of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, uric acid and oxalic acid were measured using 2 types of simple colorimetric tests (vial and quantitative filter types).
 The intensity of the color developing after a given interval was compared with a color standard of 4 levels.
 The results obtained using the colorimetric test were slightly lower in value than but significantly correlated with those obtained with standard measurements.
 The second test measured the crystal-forming ability of urine.
 A 10 ml.
 urine sample was pipetted into 4 vials that each contained different concentrations of oxalic acid and calcium.
 After a given interval the turbidity in each vial was compared with a control (0 mg.
 oxalic acid and calcium).
 If turbidity occurred in urine with low concentrations of oxalic acid and calcium the sample had a large tendency for crystals to form.
