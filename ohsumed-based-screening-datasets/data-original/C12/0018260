Nephrotic proteinuria without hypoalbuminemia: clinical characteristics and response to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition.
 Although hypoalbuminemia is a fundamental characteristic of nephrotic syndrome (NS), there are many patients with massive proteinuria that do not develop hypoalbuminemia.
 We have studied the clinical and biochemical characteristics of 19 patients with persistent massive proteinuria (greater than 5 g/d) and normal serum albumin (group I) in comparison with 16 patients with similar proteinuria excretion, but persistent hypoalbuminemia (group II).
 Most of group I patients had diagnoses suggesting glomerular hyperfiltration (focal glomerulosclerosis [FGS] associated with vesicoureteral reflux [VUR], reduction of renal mass, proteinuria associated with obesity, sclerotic phase of idiopathic crescentic glomerulonephritis [GN] in contrast with those of group II, in which membranous GN was the most frequent diagnosis.
 We prospectively investigated differences in the antiproteinuric effect of captopril, an antiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI); after 6 months of treatment, proteinuria decreased clearly in group I (7.1 +/- 1.7 to 3.7 +/- 1.7 g/d; P less than 0.001), whereas no significant changes were observed in group II (8.1 +/- 2.4 to 8.8 +/- 4 g/d).
 Serum creatinine (Scr) remained stable during captopril treatment in group I, whereas three patients in group II showed a worsening of renal function.
