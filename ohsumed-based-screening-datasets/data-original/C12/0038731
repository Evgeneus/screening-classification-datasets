Seborrheic keratoses from the genital region may contain human papillomavirus DNA.
 Sections from paraffin-embedded tissues of lesions interpreted as seborrheic keratoses localized to the pubic, genital, and crural regions were assayed for the presence of human papillomavirus types 6, 11, 16, 18, and 33 using DNA amplification followed by specific hybridization.
 Lesions with the histologic characteristics of condyloma were excluded from the study.
 Human papillomavirus DNA sequences were found in 24 (42%) of 57 seborrheic keratosis-like lesions from the genital region.
 No human papillomavirus DNA was detected in 27 control specimens that represented a variety of other processes occurring in this area.
 We conclude that human papillomavirus infection cannot be excluded in genital seborrheic keratoses.
