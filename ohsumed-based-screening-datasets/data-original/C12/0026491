Recurrent haemospermia--underlying urogenital anomalies and efficacy of imaging procedures.
 Recurrent haemospermia is often regarded as "essential".
 Following routine diagnostic procedures, we found an associated factor in 54 of 72 patients (75%).
 With one exception (prostatic carcinoma), the benign character of the disease was confirmed.
 Urogenital infection was the most frequent concomitant finding (50%); in 26 men chronic prostatis was diagnosed.
 Other disorders such as hypertension and coagulation disorders played a minor role.
 Additional investigation of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by transrectal prostatic ultrasonography revealed persistent asymmetry of the latter glands as the main finding in 20 men (28%).
 In every case seminal vesicle carcinoma was excluded; haemorrhage due to cystic distension, inflammatory lesions or ductal obstruction was associated in all cases with congenital abnormalities, chronic urogenital infection, coagulation disorders or hypertension.
