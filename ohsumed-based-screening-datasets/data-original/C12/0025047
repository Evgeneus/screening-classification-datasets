Urological manifestations of the Melnick-Needles syndrome: a case report and review of the literature.
 In 1966 Melnick and Needles described a syndrome of multiple skeletal anomalies in a 3-year-old girl.
 A dilated ureter was noted but not associated with the disorder.
 Subsequent to this report there have been 8 additional cases published of patients with the Melnick-Needles syndrome in association with a variety of urogenital and abdominal wall abnormalities.
 A 10-year-old girl with this syndrome and bilateral ureteral ectasia is described and the literature on this association is reviewed.
