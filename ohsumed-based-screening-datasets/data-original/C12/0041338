Evaluation of a new bladder tumor marker.
 Two monoclonal antibodies have been developed that bind to a shed bladder tumor-associated antigen.
 Preliminary data have demonstrated that antigen-positive tumors shed detectable amounts of antigen in the urine while antigen-negative tumors do not.
 This antigen may be differentially metabolized by normal and malignant urothelial cells.
 Further characterization of this antigen and its evaluation as a urinary marker for antigen positive bladder cancers is continuing.
