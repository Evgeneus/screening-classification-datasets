Assessment of the long-term results of subtrigonal phenolisation.
 Long-term follow-up was conducted on 97 patients who had undergone subtrigonal phenolisation for detrusor instability, bladder hypersensitivity, detrusor hyper-reflexia or interstitial cystitis.
 The procedure failed to alleviate lower urinary tract dysfunction in 57% of patients; it had an unsustained benefit in 24% and long-term success was experienced by only 19%.
 It was most effective in the hypersensitive bladder of unknown cause.
 The incidence of complications (17%) suggests that the procedure should only be undertaken if more invasive measures are the only available alternative, and the possibility of these complications should be explained to the patient.
