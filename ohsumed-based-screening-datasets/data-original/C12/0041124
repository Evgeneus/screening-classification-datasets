Epilation of hair-bearing urethral grafts using the neodymium:YAG surgical laser.
 Nonhair-bearing skin should be used when grafting is necessary during urethroplasty for stricture or hypospadias repair.
 Occasionally, this is not possible or hair-bearing skin is used inadvertently.
 Traditionally, electrocoagulation has been the method used for epilation when intraluminal hair has become a problem, such as interfering with flow, as a focus for recurrent urinary tract infection or acting as a nidus for calculus formation.
 Electrocautery also is performed during grafting in an attempt to prevent the growth of hair when hair-bearing skin is used.
 Unfortunately, due to lack of penetration the hair follicles are not destroyed and the epilating procedure fails or is only partially successful.
 The neodymium:YAG surgical laser can photocoagulate tissue to a depth up to 5.0 mm, and thus, has the ability to destroy hair follicles.
 We report 4 cases presenting with clinical problems directly related to hair-bearing urethral grafts successfully treated by neodymium:YAG laser epilation.
