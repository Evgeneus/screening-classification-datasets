Collagen and elastin in the obstructed fetal bladder.
 Histological findings of muscle, collagen and elastin in obstructed fetal bladders were compared with those of age-matched controls.
 Muscle thickness was markedly increased, however, the relative collagen content in the muscle was decreased.
 The ratio of thick-to-thin collagen fibers was markedly increased as was the amount of elastin.
 These findings suggest that the ratio of thick collagen to elastin has an important role in determining the compliance of the obstructed fetal bladder.
