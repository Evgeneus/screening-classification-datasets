Transperineal ultrasonic voiding cystourethrography using a newly devised chair.
 Using a newly devised chair for transperineal sonography we performed ultrasonic voiding cystourethrography in a total of 219 male patients and volunteers.
 The study produced adequate images in more than 80% of the people examined.
 Valsalva's maneuver during urination elicited an intermittent depression of the bladder dome toward the bladder base.
 In patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or bladder neck contracture the bladder neck did not open well.
 Urethral stricture was associated with a marked opening of the bladder neck and posterior urethra.
 In patients with detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia an involuntary contraction of the external sphincter was observed.
 These results indicate that this method is useful for screening male patients for diseases causing voiding disturbance and for making differential diagnosis of such diseases.
