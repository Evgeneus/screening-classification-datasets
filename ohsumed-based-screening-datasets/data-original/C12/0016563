Dilated renal collecting systems: differentiating obstructive from nonobstructive dilation using duplex Doppler ultrasound.
 Two patients with ileal loop urinary diversions, studied with real-time and Doppler sonography ("duplex sonography") of the kidneys, were shown to have dilated intrarenal collecting systems.
 Resistive index measurements calculated from the Doppler signal correctly identified obstructive dilatation in 1 case and nonobstructive dilatation in the other.
