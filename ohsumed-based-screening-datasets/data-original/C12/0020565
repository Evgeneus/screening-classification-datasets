Urinary excretion of endothelin-1 in normal subjects and patients with renal disease.
 To elucidate the pathophysiological significance of urinary endothelin-1 (ET-1), we measured urinary excretion of ET-1-like immunoreactivity (L1) in 17 patients with renal disease and 9 normal subjects.
 Twenty-four hour urinary ET-1-L1 excretion in patients with renal disease (358 +/- 68 ng, mean +/- SE) was significantly (P less than 0.005) greater than that of normal subjects (77 +/- 5 ng).
 In patients with renal disease.
 ET-1-L1 clearance (CET) exceeded creatinine clearance (CCR); CET/CCR (305 +/- 81%) was significantly (P less than 0.005) greater than that of normal subjects (43 +/- 13%).
 The 24-hour urinary excretion of ET-1-L1 in patients with renal disease showed significant correlation with that of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase (r = 0.587, P less than 0.05), beta 2-microglobulin (r = 0.614, P less than 0.01) and albumin (r = 0.484, P less than 0.05).
 Intravenous infusion of saline (500 ml) in seven normal subjects did not affect urinary ET-1 excretion rate.
 These data suggest that urinary excretion of ET-1 derives mainly from renal tubular secretion at least in patients with renal disease, and that degradation and/or reabsorption of ET-1 at the tubular site may also contribute to the renal handling of ET-1.
 Therefore, urinary excretion of ET-1 should serve as a potential marker for renal injury.
