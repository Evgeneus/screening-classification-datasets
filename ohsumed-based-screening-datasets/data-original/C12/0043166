Pattern of proteinuria in IgA nephritis by SDS-PAGE: clinical significance.
 Of sixty patients with IgA nephritis, none had CRF at first examination, 13 developed CRF with creatinine above 1.6 mg/dl within 6 years.
 Among these patients who had analysis of proteinuria by sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), 31 patients had middle molecular weight (MMW) proteinuria alone (pattern 1), 10 had MMW and Low MW (LMW) or tubular proteinuria (pattern 2), 10 had high MW (HMW) and MMW proteinuria (Pattern 3) and 9 had HMW, MMW and LMW proteinuria (Pattern 4).
 At the end of a follow up period of 6 years (1983-1989) patients with mixed proteinuria had a higher incidence of chronic renal failure (CRF), 11/29 (38%) compared to those with pattern 1 proteinuria, 2/31 (6%) (chi 2 = 8.7, p less than 0.005).
 Based on the glomerular selectivity index (GSI), 19 patients had nonselective proteinuria but they did not have a higher incidence of CRF.
 By the selectivity index (SI), 18 patients had nonselective proteinuria and they showed a significantly higher incidence of CRF.
 Compared to the 41 patients who did not have LMW proteinuria, 19 patients with LMW proteinuria had more severe proteinuria.
 After a follow-up period of 6 years, patients with LMW proteinuria had a higher incidence of CRF (10% versus 47%, p less than 0.001).
 The presence of LMW proteinuria indicates a less favourable outcome and the pattern of proteinuria as assessed by the SDS-PAGE appears to be a better prognostic index in IgA nephritis than the SI and the GSI.
