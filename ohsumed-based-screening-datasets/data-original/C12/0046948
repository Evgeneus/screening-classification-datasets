High-dose intravenous IgG treatment and renal function 
 In an open trial of high dose intravenous IgG (IVIG) treatment in nephrotic patients with glomerulonephritis, the first six patients so far studied showed a transient rise in plasma creatinine.
 This increase was not associated with any symptoms and the urinary deposit remained unchanged.
 Two other patients with pre-existing renal impairment but without nephrotic syndrome had a transient and reversible rise in plasma creatinine immediately after IVIG.
 These observations suggest that high-dose IVIG infusion can produce short-lived disturbances in renal function in patients with kidney diseases.
