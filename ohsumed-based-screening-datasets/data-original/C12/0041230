Counseling the infertile couple: when enough is enough.
 Therapy of infertility rarely offers a clear end point for cessation after repeated failure.
 Yet fertility treatment, especially if repeatedly unsuccessful, is associated with economic as well as emotional cost.
 Stopping treatment becomes an increasingly important option for couples whose therapy does not produce the desired result.
 It is the clinician's obligation to make infertile couples aware of this option early in the treatment plan and to give specific suggestions that allow these couples to stop treatment at a medically arbitrary, yet temporally well-defined point.
 To this end, we suggest the following for infertile couples undergoing treatment: 1) an ongoing relationship with a qualified counselor; 2) the best estimates for pregnancy rates, including the background (treatment-independent) rate, for all forms of treatment available at any point in time; 3) the option of stopping treatment from the start; 4) encouragement to seek second opinions throughout treatment; 5) time off from treatment; and 6) the opportunity to set arbitrary but relatively firm time limits.
 Incorporation of these suggestions into the therapeutic plan for infertile couples underscores the imperfect nature of infertility treatment and acknowledges that sometimes the most we can do for our patients is to help them stop.
