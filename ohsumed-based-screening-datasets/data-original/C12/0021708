Remaining problems in the treatment of patients with Wilms' tumor.
 Major advances have been made in the treatment of children with Wilms' tumor.
 Remaining areas of investigation include the role of adriamycin and the treatment of children with stage III and IV disease and the role of whole lung radiation therapy in the treatment of children with pulmonary metastases.
 Long-term follow up of successfully treated patients will provide valuable insight into the importance of genetic factors in the cause of Wilms' tumor.
