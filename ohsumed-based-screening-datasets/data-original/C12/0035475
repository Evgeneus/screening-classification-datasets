Proto-oncogene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IgA nephropathy.
 We have investigated the expression of proto-oncogenes in mononuclear cells obtained from patients with IgA nephropathy using a RNA hybridization technique.
 Patients with IgA nephropathy expressed more c-myc, c-raf, c-fos, and c-jun proto-oncogene RNA than did normal controls.
 However, no significant expression of c-N-ras, c-mos or c-myb genes was found in the mononuclear cells of these patients.
 When the amount of urinary protein excretion was used as an indicator of disease activity (greater than 1 g/day), a positive correlation was found between c-myc, c-raf, c-fos, and c-jun expression and urinary protein excretion (P less than 0.01).
 The expression of these genes correlated also with the serum IgA concentration (P less than 0.01), IgA immune complex (P less than 0.01), and histopathological changes in renal tissues obtained from patients with IgA nephropathy (P less than 0.01).
 The results of this survey suggest that abnormally regulated proto-oncogene expression in mononuclear cells may play an important role in the progression of IgA nephropathy and may be useful as an indicator of disease activity and/or prognosis.
