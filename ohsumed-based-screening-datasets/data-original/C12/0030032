Recurrent focal segmental glomerulosclerosis after renal transplantation.
 In a young adult male with chronic renal failure from focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, massive proteinuria appeared within two weeks after transplantation.
 Although allograft biopsy at eight weeks was normal, a second biopsy eight months after transplant showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis again.
 Sixteen months after transplantation maintenance hemodialysis had to be restarted.
