Comparison of transrectal prostate digital aspiration and ultrasound-guided core biopsies in 99 men.
 We compared digital transrectal needle aspiration and transrectal core prostate biopsies obtained with ultrasound guidance in 99 men.
 Both procedures were effective in identifying prostate cancer; complete sensitivity was 94 percent for aspiration and 90 percent for core biopsy.
 Aspiration confirmed 87 percent of 38 known cancers and 94 percent of 81 cancers overall, compared with 82 percent and 90 percent with core biopsies.
 The greatest number of cancers was found when both procedures were considered (95% of known and 98% of all cancers).
 Grading of both specimens was performed but was not equivalent.
 Unsatisfactory or inconclusive results by either procedure often obtained when cancer was present.
 We suggest digital transrectal needle aspiration as a first means of identifying most palpable prostate lesions.
 Transrectal core biopsies guided by ultrasonography should be used when suspicion of cancer cannot be confirmed by aspiration and when there is no palpable lesion (but clinical suspicion of cancer).
