Renal blood flow measurements using radioactive microspheres in a porcine model with unilateral vesicoureteral reflux.
 Renal blood flow was studied in Yorkshire pigs with surgically created unilateral vesicoureteral reflux using radionuclide labeled microspheres.
 The contralateral, nonrefluxing kidney served as a within-subject control and a group of nonoperated pigs without reflux served as an additional control group.
 Unilateral reflux did not change the distribution of whole renal blood flow between the refluxing and nonrefluxing kidneys.
 In addition, reflux had only minor effects upon the distribution of blood flow to cortical regions within the kidneys.
