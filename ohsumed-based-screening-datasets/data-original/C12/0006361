The future of nephrology.
 The Cellular and Molecular Age of Nephrology has dawned and the future is remarkably exciting.
 The successful attack on the major causes of renal disease, including genetic diseases, glomerulonephritis, diabetes, vasculitis, acute renal failure, and hypertension, will necessitate improved knowledge about pathogenesis.
 This new knowledge will allow early detection and target-specific therapies, the array of which is only limited by our imagination.
 The challenge to be an active player in this exciting future as a physician-scientist in the field of nephrology is indeed a rare opportunity.
