Comparative studies of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy by Dornier HM3, EDAP LT 01 and Sonolith 2000 devices.
 During a 2-year period extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was done at our institution in 70 patients with the Dornier HM3, 113 with the EDAP LT 01 and 104 with the Sonolith 2000 lithotriptors.
 The size and location of stones were comparable in all 3 series, and all treatments were done by the same team of urologists.
 Complete fragmentation occurred in 79% of the patients treated by the Dornier, 82% treated by the EDAP and 79% treated by the Sonolith devices, with 3-month stone-free rates of 66, 67 and 58%, respectively.
 Auxiliary procedures were needed in 12% of the patients in the Dornier, 13% in the EDAP and 9% in the Sonolith groups.
 Repeat treatment was necessary in 4% of the Dornier group, 42% of the EDAP group and 26% of the Sonolith group.
 Therefore, all 3 lithotriptors are effective in stone disintegration and produce satisfactory results when selection criteria for ESWL are observed.
 The most significant difference among the 3 lithotriptors is the number of repeat treatments, which reflects the power and energy output of the lithotriptors.
 In conclusion, the Dornier HM3 device has the advantage of low repeat treatment rate and easier stone localization.
 The EDAP LT 01 unit has the advantage of lower treatment costs and anesthesia-free treatment with no irradiation.
 The Sonolith 2000 device has features of the other 2 lithotriptors with a superior ultrasound image.
