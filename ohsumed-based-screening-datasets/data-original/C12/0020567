Phagocytosis in uremic and hemodialysis patients: a prospective and cross sectional study.
 Leukocyte response to phagocytic challenge was assessed in uremic and hemodialysis patients in a prospective and cross sectional study.
 Using latex, zymosan and staphylococcus as phagocytic challenge, the utilization of glucose-I-C14 and the generation of reactive oxygen species was measured in these patients.
 In uremic, non-dialysis dependent patients, the response to phagocytosis was significantly reduced when creatinine exceeded 6 mg/dl and prior to initiation of dialysis (mean serum creatinine 9.3 +/- 0.3 mg/dl) was less than half that of patients with normal renal function (P less than 0.01).
 In a prospective study of 15 patients initiated on dialysis, the metabolic response of their leukocytes was assessed sequentially.
 In eight patients, initiation of dialysis with cuprophane (Cu) membrane lead to a further decline (60%) in their metabolic response to phagocytosis at the end of four weeks of dialysis compared to pre-initiation of dialysis (P less than 0.01), whereas in seven other patients, dialysis with non-complement activating membranes did not result in a significant decline.
 Prospective cross-over studies of chronic hemodialysis patients corroborated these findings; eight patients dialyzed with new CU membranes had a significant decline of their metabolic response to phagocytic challenge acutely at the end of each dialysis and in pre-dialysis samples after two weeks of Cu dialysis, whereas their response returned back to baseline after two weeks of dialysis with non-complement activating membrane.
 In prospective and cross sectional studies, a decreased response to phagocytic stimulus was a predictor of hospitalization, primarily for infectious reasons.
