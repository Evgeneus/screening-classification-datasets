Enuresis and the voiding cystourethrogram: a re-evaluation.
 Eighty-three children with a chief complaint of nocturnal enuresis and no history of urinary tract infection (UTI) were prospectively evaluated with a contrast voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG).
 The following four historical details of presentation were noted: primary vs.
 secondary enuresis, daytime wetting, urgency, and frequency.
 Each of these four symptoms were treated as a dichotomous variable, and the prognostic value with respect to vesicoureteral (VUR) reflux was assessed using a linear logistic regression model.
 Nineteen ureters in 13 patients (16%) demonstrated VUR: grade I, 7 ureters; grade II, 5 ureters; grade III, 3 ureters; grade IV, 4 ureters; and grade V, 0 ureters.
 Three patients demonstrated renal scarring (16%) and 2 patients underwent surgery.
 The linear regression analysis revealed that no one symptom, group of symptoms, or absence of all four symptoms segregated those patients likely to have reflux with statistical validity.
 One of 6 children, therefore, who present with nocturnal enuresis and sterile urine will have reflux.
 Screening these children with a VCUG should be considered.
