Correction of anemia in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis with subcutaneous recombinant erythropoietin twice a week: a long-term study.
 Subcutaneous recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was given for 12 months twice weekly to 10 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with anemia (hemoglobin less than 9.0 mg/dl).
 All patients responded to a median weekly dose of between 37.5 to 100 (mean 55 to 105) units/kg and reached a target hemoglobin of 10-12 mg/dl in a mean of 11.7 weeks (range 5-24).
 Serum iron, iron saturation and ferritin were significantly lower and serum potassium was significantly higher than the pre-treatment level from 1 month onwards.
 Five patients without pre-treatment iron overload required oral iron supplement and 3 required oral potassium-binding resin.
 No significant change in other serum biochemical parameters was observed.
 Blood pressure remained stable during the treatment period but additional or increased dosage of antihypertensive drugs was required in 5 patients.
 Peritoneal small solute clearance and ultrafiltration and residual renal clearance did not change significantly after correction of anemia.
 The incidence of peritonitis and exit site infection was similarly unaffected.
 One patient developed a severe headache which was not associated with hypertension and responded to withdrawal of rHuEPO treatment.
 Most of the remaining patients showed improvement in subjective well-being.
 It was concluded that the subcutaneous route twice a week is a safe, convenient and cost-effective way to administer rHuEPO to patients on CAPD.
