Long-term results of simple and radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma.
 From 1974 to 1983, simple and radical nephrectomies were performed at the Chaim Sheba Medical Center (Tel Hashomer, Israel) for renal cell carcinoma.
 The authors reviewed 109 cases that were followed for a period ranging from 5 to 14 years.
 Simple nephrectomy was performed in 55 patients, and 54 patients underwent radical nephrectomy.
 The selection of the surgical procedure was based on the surgeon's preference and not on the basis of clinical stage, age, or sex.
 The surgical results and survival rates were assessed according to the pathologic stage of the tumors.
 Among patients with Stage I tumor, radical nephrectomy produced better survival rates at 5 and 10 years (P = 0.03); however, when the non-cancer deaths were excluded, the difference in survival was not statistically significant.
 For Stage I tumors the survival free of disease at 5 years was better for the radical nephrectomy group, but this difference was not statistically significant.
 No difference was noticed in the local recurrence rate between the two groups.
 Nephrectomy in patients with Stage IV disease did not alter survival regardless of the type of operation.
