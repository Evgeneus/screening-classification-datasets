Serum alpha-1 acid glycoprotein in chronic renal failure and hemodialysis.
 The total concentration and concanavalin A (ConA)-dependent microheterogeneity of alpha-1 acid glycoprotein (AAG) were studied in thirty hemodialyzed uremic patients and eighteen non-dialyzed uremic patients, by comparison with healthy volunteers.
 Serum concentrations of AAG were significantly higher in the non-dialyzed uremic (1.27 +/- 0.47 g/l) and hemodialyzed patients (1.29 +/- 0.33 g/l) than in the volunteers (0.79 +/- 0.09 g/l).
 The proportions of strongly ConA-reactive AAG fractions were also higher in non-dialyzed uremic (16.7%) and hemodialyzed patients (18.5%) than in volunteers (14.1%).
 These data may be related to an increase in bi-antennary glycans, as observed in patients on peritoneal dialysis, together with a probable change in sialylation.
 AAG serum levels and microheterogeneity were similar in non-dialyzed and hemodialyzed patients and did not appear in the dialyzed patients to depend on the type of dialysis membrane used, i.e.
 cuprophan (CU), cellulose acetate (CA), hemophan (HE), polyacrylonitrile (PAN), and polysulfon (PS), in spite of differences in biocompatibility.
 In patients dialyzed with CA membranes, there was a distinct decrease in the ConA non-reactive fraction (38.0%) and an increase in ConA slightly-reactive (42.2%) and strongly-reactive (19.7%) fractions.
 Differences in AAG serum levels and ConA reactivity between patients dialyzed with CA and PAN membranes seem to justify further investigations of other acute-phase reactants and immunological parameters.
