Non-germ cell tumors of testis.
 Testicular tumors of non-germ cell origin represent from 5 percent to 10 percent of all testicular neoplasms.
 Included in this group are sex cord/gonadal stromal tumors, most originating from Leydig or Sertoli cells, mixed tumors, and tumors of mesenchymal or hematopoietic origin.
 In addition, various miscellaneous lesions, tumor-like conditions, and secondary testicular tumors may be classified as non-germ cell tumors.
 This review covers the presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of these rare lesions.
