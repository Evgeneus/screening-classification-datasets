Zoladex versus orchiectomy in treatment of advanced prostate cancer: a randomized trial. Zoladex Prostate Study Group.
 We report preliminary results for the first 164 patients enrolled in a multicenter study comparing the endocrine effects, efficacy, and safety of 3.6 mg of goserelin acetate (Zoladex) and orchiectomy in patients with Stage D2 prostate cancer.
 Eighty-one patients were randomly allocated to receive Zoladex and 83 to orchiectomy.
 The median follow-up time for all patients was two hundred ten days.
 Median serum levels of testosterone were reduced to castrate levels (less than 50 ng/dL) within four weeks in both groups and remained suppressed for up to sixty weeks.
 An objective response according to modified criteria of the National Prostatic Cancer Project was observed in 81 percent and 78 percent of patients in the Zoladex and orchiectomy groups, respectively.
 There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the distributions of time to treatment failure or time to disease progression.
 The most commonly reported adverse events in both treatment groups were hot flashes, cancer-related pain, unspecified pain, and urinary symptoms.
 These results suggest that Zoladex may offer an alternative to orchiectomy in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
