 Direct smear examination by Ziehl-Neelsen stain for 24-hour urine and freshly ejaculated semen for 3 days as well as culture of midstream urine and semen were done on egg media.
 Urine smear was positive (+)ive in 20 patients (50%), culture was (+)ive in 23 (57.5%), whereas for semen smear was (+)ive in 3 (7.3%) and culture was (+)ive in 5 (20%).
