Comparison of endoscopic and radiological residual fragment rate following percutaneous nephrolithotripsy.
 The stone-free rate after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is primarily determined by a plain abdominal radiograph alone.
 However, the accuracy of that assessment can be challenged by renal tomography and flexible nephroscopy.
 We report on 29 patients with large renal calculi treated with a combination of percutaneous nephrolithotripsy and ESWL.
 Stone-free rates were determined by plain abdominal radiograph, renal tomography and flexible nephroscopy.
 The plain abdominal radiograph and renal tomography overestimated stone-free rates by 35% and 17%, respectively, compared to flexible nephroscopy.
 To determine stone-free rates after ESWL renal tomography is superior to a plain abdominal radiograph alone.
 Also, among patients with large renal calculi the use of the flexible nephroscope markedly improves the stone-free rate.
