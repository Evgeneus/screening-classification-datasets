Adult paratesticular sarcomas: a review of 21 cases.
 We reviewed 21 patients more than 16 years old who were seen with a diagnosis of paratesticular sarcoma from 1958 to 1987.
 Of the patients 14 presented with primary disease and 7 with recurrent disease.
 The survival of the primarily treated patients was 58% at 5 years, calculated by the product limit method.
 Of the 14 patients with primary disease 13 had grade 3/4 or 4/4 sarcoma and 13 of 14 underwent initial radical orchiectomy.
 In addition, 6 of the 14 patients underwent an adjuvant operation or radiotherapy to the groin, or groin and scrotum, and none had local relapse.
 Some patients also had chemotherapy.
 Three patients underwent adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection and 2 had microscopically positive nodes.
 All 3 patients remain without relapse.
 Six patients had relapse: 2 locally, 2 in the retroperitoneal nodes and 2 with distant metastases.
 Only 1 patient (with scrotal recurrence) was salvaged.
 Of the 7 patients referred with recurrent disease none was salvaged.
 In this series there is a 2 of 14 (14%) risk of local failure and a 4 of 14 (28%) risk of retroperitoneal relapse after radical orchiectomy.
 Since salvage has not proved successful, patients with rhabdomyosarcoma, intermediate or high grade malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or fibrosarcoma should be considered for adjuvant retroperitoneal node dissection.
 All patients should undergo adjuvant dissection or irradiation of the ipsilateral pelvic and groin nodes, and scrotum.
