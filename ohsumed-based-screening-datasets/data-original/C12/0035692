Autourethrography.
 "Autourethrography," a technique of retrograde urethrography in which the patient injects the contrast material, was used on 22 patients.
 The results of the study were compared with the results of nonemergency retrograde urethrography performed on 22 patients during an earlier 1-year period.
 The following observations of the autourethrography group were made.
 Patient tolerance was enhanced, with less discomfort and anxiety.
 There was no extravasation of contrast material outside the urethra, compared with extravasation in three of 22 patients (14%) in the control group for whom conventional techniques were used.
 Retrograde opacification of the posterior urethra was achieved in 20 of 22 patients (91%) in the autourethrography group, compared with 13 of 22 patients (59%) in the control group.
 Radiation exposure to the examining radiologist was eliminated.
 Autourethrography is a technique that has important benefits for both the radiologist and the patient.
