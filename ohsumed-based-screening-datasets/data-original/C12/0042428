Lord's procedure--the best operation for hydrocele?
 A prospective study was carried out to compare Lord's hydrocele operation with traditional surgical procedures.
 The groups of patients investigated were comparable in terms of age, period of observation, number of previous aspirations and size of hydrocele.
 The incidence of isolated hydrocele of the spermatic cord, as well as epididymal cysts, was lower in the patients who underwent Lord's procedure (7.2 versus 15.8%), as was the percentage of patients reporting post-operative pain for more than 3 days (4.3 versus 15.8%, p less than 0.05).
