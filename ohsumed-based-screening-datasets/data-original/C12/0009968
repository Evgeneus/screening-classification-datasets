Substance abuse-related spontaneous bladder rupture: report of 2 cases and review of the literature.
 Spontaneous rupture of the normal bladder associated with alcohol abuse is rare, with only 20 cases reported in the English literature to which we add 2 cases.
 Heavy alcohol ingestion predisposes the bladder to rupture by the large volume of fluid intake, its diuretic effect and the mental obtusion it produces, clouding sensory cues to void.
 alpha-Sympathomimetic drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamine, increase the resistance at the urethral sphincter and exacerbate the effects of alcohol.
 Cystography will be diagnostic, and prompt operative repair of intraperitoneal rupture is mandatory.
 Complete evaluation of the bladder, including urodynamic study, is important to eliminate underlying bladder pathological conditions.
 Substance abuse-related rupture demonstrates a typical constellation of clinical features that necessitate considering it a syndrome separate from other causes of spontaneous bladder rupture.
