A comparison of anatrophic nephrolithotomy and percutaneous nephrolithotomy with and without extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for management of patients with staghorn calculi.
 A retrospective study was conducted comparing anatrophic nephrolithotomy (10 cases), percutaneous nephrolithotomy alone (4 cases) or percutaneous nephrolithotomy combined with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (23 cases) for the treatment of large staghorn calculi.
 A comparison based on collecting system anatomy demonstrated that anatrophic nephrolithotomy resulted in a greater stone-free rate, shorter hospitalization and lower costs while complication rates were similar.
 Anatrophic nephrolithotomy should still be considered a viable treatment option, especially for patients with large branched calculi in complex collecting systems.
