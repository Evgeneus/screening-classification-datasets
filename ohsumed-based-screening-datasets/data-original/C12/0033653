Treatment options for ureteral calculi: endourology or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy.
 Two therapeutic methods, endourology and extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), can be used in the treatment of ureteral calculi.
 In a retrospective analysis during a 2-year period 236 patients treated with endourological procedures and 71 who underwent ESWL with a Siemens Lithostar were analyzed as to the success rate, effectiveness quotient, complication rate and hospitalization.
 The mean stone size was 1.12 cm.
 in the endourology group and 1.03 cm.
 in the ESWL group.
 Complete removal of all stone fragments was achieved in 93.6% of the patients treated endourologically and without retreatment.
 In the ESWL group success was obtained in 90.1%, with an 11.2% retreatment rate.
 The retreatment rate was higher (25.0%) for calculi in the mid ureter.
 The group treated endourologically had a better success rate and no retreatment was necessary.
 On the other hand, the group treated with ESWL had a shorter hospitalization and a lower complication rate.
 Followup ranged from 11 to 60 months (mean 48 months) in the endourology group and 7 to 29 months (mean 11 months) in the ESWL group.
 These observations showed that in situ ESWL therapy with the Siemens Lithostar device is the method of choice for upper ureteral stones.
 Lower ureteral calculi should be treated endoscopically.
 Mid ureteral stones larger than 1 cm.
 had better results with endoscopic procedures and those smaller than 1 cm.
 had better results with ESWL.
