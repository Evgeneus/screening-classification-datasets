Effects of dietary fatty acids in an animal model of focal glomerulosclerosis.
 The obese Zucker rat develops hyperlipidemia, proteinuria and focal glomerulosclerosis without prior changes in renal hemodynamics.
 To study the effects of oral fatty acid intake on the development of renal injury in this model, rats were fed standard chow or chow supplemented with either 14% fish oil or 14% beef tallow after unilateral nephrectomy at the age of 10 weeks.
 At 32 weeks post-nephrectomy animals were sacrificed and renal tissue saved to assess histology and glomerular eicosanoid production.
 Fish-oil treated rats had lower mean plasma cholesterol levels and developed less proteinuria than control or tallow-fed animals although there was no difference in plasma creatinine or blood pressure.
 Histological analysis showed significantly fewer sclerosed glomeruli in the fish oil group (4.0 +/- 0.8% vs.
 control 19.4 +/- 4.1%, P less than 0.0005 and vs.
 beef tallow 10.8 +/- 1.9%, P less than 0.005).
 Glomeruli derived from rats on fish oil supplements produced smaller amounts of prostaglandin (PG)E2 and of the stable metabolites of PGI2 (6-oxo-PGF1 alpha), PGF2 (PGF2 alpha) and thromboxane (TX)A2 (TXB2) than those from tallow-fed animals.
 This study demonstrates that oral fatty acid intake may influence the development of glomerulosclerosis.
 The apparent beneficial effects of fish oil have not been fully defined, but may relate to favorable changes in plasma lipid concentration and renal eicosanoid production.
