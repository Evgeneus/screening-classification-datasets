A comparison of sperm antibody assays.
 Cytotoxicity and Immunobead-binding immunoglobulin G assays agreed in 81% of sera from infertile men (n = 173), 74% of sera from their wives, 75% of seminal plasma, and 82% of cervical mucous samples (p less than 0.001; chi 2 analysis of positive and negative results) when tested against sperm from the same donors.
 Cytotoxic and immunofluorescent IgG antibody results agreed in 79% of sera from men and women, 76% of seminal plasma, and 76% of cervical mucus (p less than 0.001; chi 2 analysis of positive and negative results).
 Titers or percent binding of sperm by cytotoxicity, hemagglutination, and IgG Immunobead-binding or immunofluorescence assays in serum and secretions of husbands and wives correlated (p less than 0.001).
 A significantly increased number of positive results was observed in cytotoxic and Immunobead-binding IgG assays when the husbands' and donors' sperm were used rather than donors' sperm alone.
 On the basis of this study we conclude: (1) that cytotoxicity, Immunobead-binding IgG, and immunofluorescent IgG sperm antibody assays correlate when sperm from the same source are used, (2) that women's isoimmunity to husbands' sperm is associated with their husbands' autoimmunity to sperm irrespective of the assay, and (3) that it is desirable to use sperm from the husbands and nonautoimmune fertile men in these assays.
