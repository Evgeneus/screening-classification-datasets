Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis: ten years at one facility.
 A review of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) performed at one facility over a period of 10 years showed that age and type II diabetes mellitus were associated with the worst technique survival.
 The median survival of patients entering CAPD was not significantly different when the etiology of renal failure was chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN; 27 months), chronic interstitial nephritis (CIN; 21 months), diabetes mellitus type I (21 months), or hypertension (16 months).
 Patients with diabetes mellitus type II had significantly (P less than 0.05) worse survival (11 months).
 A patient remaining on CAPD 6 months had a 55% to 60% chance of remaining on therapy at 2 years and a 47% chance at the end of 3 years, whereas a patient with diabetes mellitus type II had a 34% conditional probability of remaining on dialysis at 2 years and 18% at 3 years.
 Sex, race, and educational achievement were not important determinants of dialysis technique survival.
 Studies are indicated to identify predictors of a poor dialysis experience.
