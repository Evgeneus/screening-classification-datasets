Weekly subcutaneous recombinant human erythropoietin corrects anemia of progressive renal failure.
 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to analyze data retrospectively from our use of weekly subcutaneous recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients with anemia.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: All anemic patients with progressive renal failure (12 predialysis and seven home peritoneal dialysis) in whom subcutaneous rHuEPO therapy was begun at, or was reduced to, a weekly dose were studied retrospectively.
 Patients were not selected for, nor excluded from, these observations for any other reason.
 Hematocrit and endogenous creatinine clearance were monitored regularly, and no other new treatment for anemia was given except oral iron.
 Iron-deficiency anemia was considered improbable because of normal red blood cell mean corpuscular volume.
 Unfortunately, iron parameters were not monitored.
 RESULTS: The hematocrit increased 4 to 9 percentage points in 4 to 13 weeks in all but two patients who were initially treated with weekly doses, and a hematocrit of 31% was achieved in these patients within 6 to 12 weeks.
 The mean effective dose to accomplish this was 150 U/kg.
 All but three patients could be maintained on weekly doses at a hematocrit of 31% or higher.
 The mean effective dose was 75 U/kg.
 CONCLUSION: It is concluded that subcutaneous rHuEPO administered weekly can correct the anemia of predialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients.
 Weekly dosing is more convenient for patients and may be less costly for Medicare providers.
