Endoscopic laser lithotripsy: safe, effective therapy for ureteral calculi.
 At our lithotripsy department more than 400 patients with renal or ureteral calculi have been treated with a pulse-dye laser for stone disease.
 We review our experience during an 11-month period when a total of 223 patients was treated.
 Of these patients 204 whose ureteral calculi were treated by laser lithotripsy are available for followup.
 The data in this series demonstrate that a miniaturized ureteroscopic system is of paramount importance in laser lithotripsy, allowing access into the ureter without dilation in the majority of patients (165 of 204).
 Lack of dilation is associated with a decrease in pain and postoperative hospitalization.
 Satisfactory stone fragmentation was accomplished in 198 of 204 procedures in this series with use of the laser alone.
 A low complication rate was observed.
 Endoscopic laser lithotripsy is a safe, reliable and cost-effective method of therapy for ureteral calculi in a community hospital setting.
