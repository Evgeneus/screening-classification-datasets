In situ oncocytic change in association with multiple renal cell adenocarcinomas.
 We report a case of in situ oncocytic change in association with two low-grade renal cell adenocarcinomas and one contralateral low-grade oncocytic adenocarcinoma.
 The in situ oncocytic change showed abundant cytoplasmic mitochondria confirmed by ultrastructural examination and phosphotungstic acid-hemotoxylin staining.
 In addition, this in situ oncocytic change expressed cytokeratin CAM 5.2 in the absence of cytokeratin AE1/AE3, as reported in oncocytic renal cell adenocarcinomas.
 Further study of in situ oncocytic change identified in kidneys resected for adenocarcinomas with regard to follow-up and management of the contralateral kidney seems indicated.
