A report on extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy results on 1,569 renal units in an outpatient clinic.
 We report our experience with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) treatment of 1,569 renal units in an outpatient clinic with a small focused piezoelectric lithotriptor.
 A stone-free rate of 93% was achieved.
 In 3.6% of the patients, mainly those with a history of surgery and/or anatomical caliceal deformations, fragments smaller than 3 mm.
 in diameter remained despite multiple ESWL sessions and intensive upside down physiotherapy.
 Of the cases 3.4%, including those without sufficient data, were considered unsuccessful.
 We treated 58 renal units in children 14 years old and younger, 55 patients had a single kidney and 7 had a horseshoe kidney.
