Carcinoma of the prostate: MR images obtained with body coils do not accurately reflect tumor volume.
 MR imaging with a body coil is unreliable in directly demonstrating tumor spread through the prostatic capsule.
 However, the likelihood of extracapsular spread of prostatic cancer rises with increasing tumor volume.
 The aim of our study was to assess the accuracy of MR with a body coil in diagnosing capsular penetration indirectly via an estimation of prostatic tumor volumes.
 Twenty-six patients with proved prostatic cancer that was clinically confined to the gland underwent MR imaging before radical prostatectomy and whole-mount pathologic sectioning of the specimen.
 Twenty of 31 lesions prospectively outlined on the MR images corresponded to cancers outlined on the pathology slides, and tumor volumes were calculated by using a voxel summation technique.
 On MR, tumor volume was underestimated in 11 of 20 cases and overestimated in nine of 20 cases.
 Only two of 20 size estimates based on MR findings were within 10% of actual tumor volume.
 Overlap in MR tumor volumes was significant between lesions with and without capsular penetration at microscopy.
 Factors contributing to inaccuracies in measurements of tumor volume on MR images included the variable histologic make-up of the tumors.
 Our results show that, although knowledge of the size of a prostatic lesion is important in predicting the behavior of the tumor, MR imaging with a body coil is not reliable for accurate estimation of tumor volume.
