Reduced bladder capacity in patients receiving intravesical chemoprophylaxis with mitomycin C.
 After complete resection of superficial bladder carcinoma (Tis-2, G1-3), 75 patients were treated prophylactically with either 20 or 30 mg mitomycin C.
 Six patients developed a substantial reduction in bladder capacity (less than 200 ml).
 In 2 patients radical cystectomy of an otherwise tumour-free fibrotic bladder was necessary.
 The results of long-term treatment (2 years) suggest that reduced bladder capacity correlates with the cumulative dosage of mitomycin C.
