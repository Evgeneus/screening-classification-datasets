Acute anuric renal failure after pigmy rattlesnake bite.
 Acute renal failure has been known to follow viper bites in up to 30% of patients, but we believe we have reported the first case in which anuric renal failure developed after the bite of a pigmy rattlesnake.
 Our patient's renal failure is thought to have been due to a combination of rhabdomyolysis and intrarenal thrombosis caused by DIC.
 Prompt surgical debridement should be offered to the victim of a bite by any poisonous snake, and antivenin should be administered to any patient with signs of systemic envenomation, with close monitoring for signs of allergic reactions.
