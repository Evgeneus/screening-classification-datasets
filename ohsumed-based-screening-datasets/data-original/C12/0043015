Value of serum alkaline phosphatase and radionuclide bone scans in patients with renal cell carcinoma.
 Ninety-one patients who underwent radical nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) were reviewed to determine the prognostic value of serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) levels and radionuclide bone scan.
 A preoperative SAP greater than 127 IU/L was a strong indicator of eventual disease progression or death, and an elevated SAP was a better predictor of eventual outcome than bone scan.
