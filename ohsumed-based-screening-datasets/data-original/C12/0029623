Recurrent failure of in vitro fertilization: role of the hemizona assay in the sequential diagnosis of specific sperm-oocyte defects.
 The results of predictive fertilization bioassays (hemizona assay, hamster ova-human sperm penetration assay), in vitro fertilization treatment, fertile donor cross-match tests with either sperm or oocytes, and oocyte micromanipulation for assisted fertilization were used to establish a pathophysiologic diagnosis in cases of recurrent failed fertilization in vitro.
 Disorders of sperm function manifested at the level of zona binding, zona penetration, oolemma fusion, and pronuclear decondensation as well as oocyte anomalies were considered to represent the specific gamete defects that led to abnormal sperm-oocyte interactions (i.e., failed fertilization).
 Our findings show that the sequential application of bioassays can elucidate specific sperm or oocyte defects that characterize functional abnormalities among sperm populations.
