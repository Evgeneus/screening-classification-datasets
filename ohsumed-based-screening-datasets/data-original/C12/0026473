Acute changes in kidney function following extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy for renal stones.
 Seventeen patients were subjected to analysis of various renal functional parameters before and after extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) for renal stones.
 Thirteen patients were observed at 2 weeks and 3 months.
 Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was not influenced by ESWL as based on unchanged serum levels of creatinine, beta 2-microglobulin and creatinine clearance.
 A significant increase in urinary excretion of beta 2-microglobulin, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase and alkaline phosphatase, with return to pre-treatment values within 4 to 5 days, reflected transient disturbances in proximal tubular function.
 Urinary albumin excretion was increased 0-24 h after ESWL.
 No significant alterations were observed in plasma renin activity or serum aldosterone due to ESWL.
 Serum lactic dehydrogenase remained significantly increased for 2 weeks.
 In addition, significant changes in several blood and urine parameters were caused by immersion in water and intravenous infusions during treatment and were not specifically due to ESWL.
