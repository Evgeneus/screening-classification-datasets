Somatosensory evoked potentials in acute renal failure: effect of parathyroidectomy.
 Effects of acute renal failure (ARF) on somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) were studied in rats.
 Cervical and cortical SEPs were measured both before and after bilateral ureteral ligation.
 A significant augmentation of amplitudes and an increase in latencies of the cortical SEP were observed in ARF.
 The peripheral nerve conduction velocities were unchanged.
 Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in uremic rats were significantly elevated after the bilateral ureteral ligation.
 In previously parathyroidectomized rats, the bilateral ureteral ligation had no effects on amplitudes of SEP or serum PTH levels.
