Upper tract tumours following cystectomy for bladder cancer. Is routine intravenous urography worthwhile?
 The incidence and presentation of upper tract tumours were studied in 180 patients who had previously undergone cystectomy for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 Intravenous urography was performed routinely 3 months after cystectomy, 1 year later and at 3-yearly intervals thereafter.
 Ten patients developed upper tract tumours; 1 presented with loin pain and the remainder with haematuria.
 Six patients underwent nephroureterectomy and 5 of them lived for at least 4 years; 4 were inoperable and only 1 survived longer than 6 months.
 In this series, all patients with upper tract tumours presented with symptoms and routine intravenous urography failed to detect any asymptomatic lesions.
 Routine radiological assessment of the upper tracts to detect tumours is not justified following cystectomy.
