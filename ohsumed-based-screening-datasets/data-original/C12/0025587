Pharmacokinetics of active vitamins D3, 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in patients on chronic hemodialysis.
 Two active forms of vitamin D3, 1 alpha, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha, 25 [OH] 2D3) and 1 alpha-hydroxyvitamin D3 (1 alpha, [OH] D3) are widely used for treating osteodystrophy in patients with chronic renal failure.
 Since the pharmacokinetics of these agents during long-term oral administration are unclear, we measured the circulating concentrations of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D before and after their long-term oral administration in patients receiving maintenance hemodialysis.
 After 12 weeks of treatment with a daily dose of 1 alpha, (OH) D3 (0.5 micrograms), the administration of a single dose (2 micrograms) of 1 alpha, (OH) D3 showed that the area under the curve over 24 h (AUC) was increased significantly compared with day 1 of therapy.
 In contrast, after the treatment with a daily dose of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D3 (0.25 micrograms), a single dose of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D3 (1 microgram) did not exhibit this effect on the AUC.
 A single dose of each agent produced no significant change in either the peak increment above basal values or the elimination half-time (T 1/2) of circulating plasma 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D.
 The overall basal concentration of 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D achieved by 1 alpha, (OH) D3 after 12 weeks of administration was cumulative, but this effect was not observed in patients on 1 alpha, 25 (OH) 2D3.
 These data indicate that the pharmacokinetics of the two forms of active vitamin D3 did not differ as to peak increment and T1/2 except for the AUC, even after long-term dosage.
