A new lymphocyte serotyping using cytotoxic antibodies from secondary recurrent aborters and its application in cases of recurrent abortion and infertility.
 Using nonanti-human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) lymphocytotoxic antibodies derived from women with an abnormal pregnancy history including secondary recurrent abortion, a new series of serotyping was performed on lymphocytes from 37 couples (74 individuals), and the compatibility between the couples shown by the typing was investigated.
 The data demonstrated that both couples with primary recurrent abortion and infertile couples with repeated failure of embryo transfers after in vitro fertilization showed significantly close reaction patterns between partners than normal child-bearing couples by principal component factor analysis.
 It was concluded that this serotyping provides useful information on histocompatibility in the field of pregnancy immunology and that some cases of infertility because of implantation failure, as well as primary recurrent abortion, might be caused by underlying immunogenetical problems.
