An improved method for computerized tomography-planned transperineal 125iodine prostate implants.
 Transperineal 125iodine implants of the prostate can be performed with ultrasound guidance, a simple technique that has met with widespread acceptance.
 However, ultrasound does not allow good visualization of the pubic bones in relation to the pelvic outlet, and the pubic bones may interfere with needle placement in the anterior peripheral aspect of the prostate.
 Adequate irradiation of the entire periphery of the prostate is important to assure tumor control, since most tumors are multicentric and may involve the anterior aspect of the prostate.
 A computerized tomography-based treatment planning procedure that allows for angulation of transperineal needles to avoid the pubic bones and still reaches the most peripheral aspects of the gland is described.
 The technique also allows for the use of transrectal ultrasound and fluoroscopy to verify correct needle placement in the prostate at the procedure.
 Early treatment results, based on prostate specific antigen and regression of palpable tumors, are encouraging.
