Parenteral ofloxacin in treatment of pyelonephritis.
 The interim findings of two studies of intravenous ofloxacin for the treatment of pyelonephritis are presented.
 The findings are from one center of a multicenter trial.
 In the first study intravenous (IV) ofloxacin was given to 34 patients with urine-culture-positive pyelonephritis.
 After three days of intravenous therapy patients could be switched to oral ofloxacin.
 Microbiologic eradication occurred in 97 percent and clinical cures in 97 percent of the patients treated with ofloxacin.
 There were three probable drug-related adverse events.
 In the second comparative study 38 patients with pyelonephritis were randomized to receive IV ofloxacin with the option of switching to oral ofloxacin after three days.
 IV ceftazidime was given to 30 patients with pyelonephritis with the option of switching to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) after three days.
 Microbiologic cures were experienced by 97 percent of the ofloxacin patients and by 100 percent of the ceftazidime patients.
 Probable drug-related adverse reactions were experienced by 3/28 ofloxacin patients and by none of the ceftazidime patients.
 These interim study findings indicate that the intravenous preparation of ofloxacin is efficacious in the treatment of pyelonephritis and that it is safe.
 In addition, IV ofloxacin is as efficacious as IV ceftazidime for the treatment of pyelonephritis.
