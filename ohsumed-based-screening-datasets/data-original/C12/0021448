Combined technetium radioisotope penile plethysmography and xenon washout: a technique for evaluating corpora cavernosal inflow and outflow during early tumescence [published erratum appears in J Nucl Med 1991 Jul;32(7):1374]
 Combined technetium radioisotope penile plethysmography and xenon washout is a new technique that measures both corporal arterial inflow and venous sinusoidal outflow during early tumescence in patients with erectile dysfunction.
 Fourteen patients were studied using 99mTc-RBCs to measure inflow and 133Xe or 127Xe in saline to measure outflow.
 Tumescence was induced by injecting papaverine intracorporally.
 Peak corporal rates corrected for outflow (r = 0.88) and uncorrected for outflow (r = 0.91) and change in volume over 2 min centered around peak flow [corrected] (r = 0.96) all correlated with angiography.
 Outflow measurements did not correlate with intracorporal resistance.
 Thus, outflow rates alone could not be used to predict venous sinusoidal competence.
 Normal inflow rate is greater than 20 ml/min; probable normal 12-20; indeterminate inflow 7-12; and abnormal inflow less than 7 ml/min.
 Technetium-99m radioisotope penile plethysmography and xenon washout can be performed together and both provide a method for simultaneously evaluating the relationship between corporal inflow and outflow rates in patients with erectile dysfunction.
