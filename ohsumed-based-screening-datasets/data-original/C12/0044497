Spongiosography: a valuable adjunct to the diagnosis of urethral strictures.
 To obtain better information on fibrotic tissue damage in urethral strictures we performed spongiosography, that is opacification of the spongy body by injection of contrast medium, in 32 patients in whom the diagnosis had already been established by uroflowmetry, urethrography and urethroscopy.
 Another 18 patients with erectile dysfunction served as the control group.
 The investigation was well tolerated by all patients and no side effects or complications were encountered.
 Attenuation or even interruption of the contrast medium within the corpus spongiosum on spongiosography clearly revealed the fibrosis in urethral strictures.
 The extent of scarring was completely independent of the clinical symptoms and urethrographic findings.
 Accordingly, our decision on the appropriate surgical treatment was based mainly on the results of spongiosography.
 If used as an additional routine investigation in cases of urethral stricture spongiosography may help to decrease the recurrence rate in the future.
