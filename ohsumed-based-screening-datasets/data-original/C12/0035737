Efficacy and safety of aztreonam in the treatment of patients with renal failure.
 The efficacy and safety of aztreonam for treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections in patients with renal failure were evaluated in an open study.
 Thirty-nine patients (22-82 years old) with renal failure (chronic, 25; acute, 14) were treated for 40 severe gram-negative bacterial infections.
 All 41 gram-negative pathogens isolated were sensitive to aztreonam; the pathogens included Escherichia coli (12), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8), Klebsiella species (7), Proteus species (7), Enterobacter species (5), Serratia marcescens (1), and Acinetobacter species (1).
 Complete cure (clinical and bacteriologic) was achieved in 31 (77.5%) of 40 infections and improvement (clinical improvement with or without bacteriologic cure) in four (10%).
 Bacterial eradication of 34 (82.9%) of the infecting pathogens was achieved.
 The only significant adverse effect noted was a slight, transient elevation in the level of serum transaminases in four patients (10%).
 Renal function of the patients improved with treatment.
 Levels of serum creatinine decreased from 3.79 +/- 2.84 to 3.30 +/- 2.52 mg/dL after treatment (P less than .002).
 It was concluded that aztreonam is effective and safe for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections in patients with renal failure.
