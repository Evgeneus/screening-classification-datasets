Desmopressin for diabetes insipidus, hemostatic disorders and enuresis.
 Arginine vasopressin preparations have been used in the treatment of diabetes insipidus for many years.
 Compared with older antidiuretic agents, the synthetic analog desmopressin is more potent, longer acting and easier to use.
 It is available for intravenous, subcutaneous and intranasal administration.
 Desmopressin may be useful in the treatment of hemostatic disorders such as von Willebrand's disease and hemophilia A.
 It has also been used for nocturnal enuresis.
 The vasopressor effects of arginine vasopressin preparations have been exploited for use as a temporizing measure in controlling acute gastrointestinal bleeding.
 Side effects such as hyponatremia and water intoxication are uncommon when these drugs are used with proper precautions.
