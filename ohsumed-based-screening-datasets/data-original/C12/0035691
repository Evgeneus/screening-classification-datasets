Ureteral jets in healthy subjects and in patients with unilateral ureteral calculi: comparison with color Doppler US.
 Color Doppler ultrasound was used to image the ureteral jets in 17 healthy subjects and 26 patients with ureteral calculi proved with intravenous urography.
 In patients with ureteral calculi, three patterns of ureteral jets were seen: no detectable urine flow from the symptomatic side (12 patients), low-level continuous flow from the symptomatic side (four patients), and periodic ureteral jets on the symptomatic side that were not significantly different from ureteral jets of healthy subjects (10 patients).
 Of the 12 patients with high-grade obstruction on urograms, 11 had ureteral jets significantly different from those of healthy subjects (either no detectable ureteral jets or continuous low-level jets on the symptomatic side).
 Only three of the 11 patients with low-grade obstruction or nonobstructing stones had ureteral jets that were different from those of healthy subjects.
 It is concluded that analysis of ureteral jets with color Doppler can enable detection and qualitative determination of the degree of ureteral obstruction in many patients with unilateral ureteral calculi.
