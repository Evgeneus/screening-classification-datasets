Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia in patients with solid tumors without acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
 Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) developed in two patients with solid tumors without acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 In patients with neoplastic solid tumors, as in those with hematologic malignancies, Pneumocystis is a possible cause of pneumonia.
 Management protocols evaluating pulmonary infiltrates in this patient population must include tests for PCP.
