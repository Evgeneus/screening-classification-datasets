M inverted V glansplasty: a procedure for distal hypospadias.
 Minimal hypospadias is a commonly encountered anomaly.
 Duckett's innovative meatoplasty and glanuloplasty (MAGPI) procedure has become a standard operation for the correction of these lesions.
 Although usually successful, the complication of meatal retraction has been recognized at times after a MAGPI.
 The M inverted V glansplasty was designed to address the factors leading to meatal retraction and the abnormal glans shape sometimes seen after the MAGPI.
 The M inverted V glansplasty derives its name from the initial M-shaped incision that reconfigures during the course of the procedure into an inverted V.
 Of 16 boys followed for more than 2 months after an M inverted V glansplasty 14 have achieved good results.
 The remaining 2 cases had a definite degree of meatal retraction but because of the meatal and glanular relationships they have a good cosmetic result.
 The technique, its indications and its limitations are described.
