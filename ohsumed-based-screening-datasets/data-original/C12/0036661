The anal continence plug: a disposable device for patients with anorectal incontinence.
 Anorectal incontinence is most commonly found in the elderly, but colorectal surgeons now see an increasing number of younger patients with this condition.
 Although medical and surgical treatments are available, a proportion of patients remain refractory to therapy.
 We investigated the efficacy of three designs of anal continence plug.
 8 women and 2 men (mean age, 52 years) who were incontinent to both liquid and solid stool tested each plug for three consecutive weeks.
 1 patients withdrew from the study.
 The median weartime for the optimum plug design was 12 h, and there were no episodes of incontinence in 82% of the periods during which the plug was in place.
 Patients required a median of eleven plugs per week, and in 82% of cases insertion was as easy as with a suppository.
 Plugs may have a place in the management of patients with anorectal incontinence.
