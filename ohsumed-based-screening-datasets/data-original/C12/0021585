Recurrent prolonged erections and priapism as a sequela of priapism: pathophysiology and management.
 Veno-occlusive priapism may be associated with prolonged corporeal ischemia, subsequent fibrosis of the corpora and impotence.
 We report on 6 patients who presented with an unusual sequela of veno-occlusive priapism, recurrent episodes of prolonged erections or priapism.
 In all cases the subsequent episodes were idiopathic and veno-occlusive, occurred with a frequency ranging from several times per day to once per month and were symptomatically disabling.
 Pharmacocavernosometry ruled out mechanical occlusion of corporeal venous drainage by demonstrating elevated flows to maintain intracavernosal pressures following smooth muscle contraction and markedly decreased flow rates following smooth muscle relaxation.
 Treatment of the recurrent episodes with intracavernous self-injection of phenylephrine resulted in successful detumescence.
 The use of oral phenylpropanolamine reduced the frequency and duration of the recurrences, and markedly reduced the need for adrenergic self-injection.
 It is proposed that this syndrome may develop secondary to the initial ischemic episode, resulting in a functional alteration of the adrenergic and/or endothelial-mediated mechanisms that control penile tumescence and maintain penile flaccidity.
