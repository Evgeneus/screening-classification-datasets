Expression of D-mannose binding sites on human spermatozoa: comparison of fertile donors and infertile patients.
 OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis that defective expression of D-mannose binding sites (presumptive elements of the sperm-zona pellucida binding mechanism) is related to male infertility was tested.
 DESIGN: Experiments were performed on sperm samples from two groups of men classified, respectively, as fertile and infertile, based on their reproductive history.
 SETTING: The study was carried out in an andrologic laboratory of a University Hospital.
 PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Fertile men were healthy sperm donors; infertile men were patients with fertility problems.
 INTERVENTIONS: D-mannose binding sites were visualized by fluorescence microscopy using a mannosylated neoglycoprotein probe.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The hypothesis as reported in the objective section was formulated before data collection and was not modified thereafter.
 RESULTS: Sperm from fertile men displayed a characteristic pattern of changes in the expression of D-mannose binding sites during in vitro capacitation.
 This pattern was altered in sperm from infertile men.
 CONCLUSIONS: If the relationship between defective expression of D-mannose binding sites and decreased sperm fertilizing ability is validated by parallel tests of sperm-zona binding, it may be used for development of chemical tests replacing the current ones using human zonae pellucidae.
