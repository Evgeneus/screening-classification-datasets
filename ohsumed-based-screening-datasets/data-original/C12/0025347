2,8-Dihydroxyadenine lithiasis in a Japanese patient heterozygous at the adenine phosphoribosyltransferase locus.
 All reported cases of 2,8-dihydroxyadenine (DHA) lithiasis have been due to functional homozygous deficiency of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT).
 Here we describe the first case of DHA lithiasis in a patient who has functional APRT activity in cultured lymphoblasts.
 The patient is heterozygous for Japanese-type (type II) APRT deficiency as demonstrated by starch-gel electrophoresis and DNA sequence analysis.
 We also demonstrate the use of starch-gel electrophoresis for differentiation between the type II mutant enzyme and the wild-type enzyme.
