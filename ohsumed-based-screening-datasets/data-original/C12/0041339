Molecular and immunologic approaches in the management of bladder cancer.
 Because of the heterogeneous nature of bladder cancer and the various therapeutic options available, the management of the disease is a constant challenge to clinicians.
 A variety of new biologic approaches are beginning to unravel some of the pathophysiology underlying the behavior of these tumors and provide means to assess it at the clinical level.
 Monoclonal antibodies are particularly well suited for more immediate application as diagnostic and prognostic tools and may also have an impact on the treatment of patients with bladder cancer.
