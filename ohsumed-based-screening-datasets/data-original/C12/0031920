Alfuzosin for treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy. The BPH-ALF Group.
 To assess the long-term efficacy and safety of alfuzosin, a selective alpha 1-adrenergic antagonist, 518 symptomatic patients with benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) were randomised to received either alfuzosin (daily dose 7.5-10 mg) or placebo for 6 months.
 Obstructive and irritative symptoms, assessed according to the Boyarsky scale, significantly improved in the alfuzosin group compared with the placebo group (p = 0.0004).
 Fewer patients in the alfuzosin group than in the placebo group dropped out due to lack of efficacy (6.8% vs 14.6%, p = 0.004) and the prevalence of spontaneous acute urine retention was lower in the alfuzosin group (0.4% vs 2.6%, p = 0.04).
 By 6 months, mean urinary flow rates had increased (p less than 0.05) and residual volume had decreased (p = 0.017) in the alfuzosin group, although the two groups were broadly similar with respect to increase in peak flow rate.
 The overall incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups, which led to the withdrawal of 10.8% and 9.0% of patients, respectively.
 The findings emphasise the magnitude of the placebo response in symptomatic patients with BPH and show that treatment with alpha 1 adrenergic antagonist drugs provides long-lasting improvement in such patients.
