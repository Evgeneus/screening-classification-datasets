Case report: dextran-induced acute anuric renal failure.
 Acute renal failure is an infrequent adverse reaction following the administration of dextran-40.
 We report a case of anuric acute renal failure in a 59-year-old female following the administration of 90 gm of dextran-40 and radiocontrast.
 An increased risk secondary to radiocontrast-induced ischemia is discussed in relationship to the pathogenesis of the dextran-induced acute renal failure.
 In addition, plasmapheresis is demonstrated to be of potential therapeutic benefit.
