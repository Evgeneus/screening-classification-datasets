Massive cystic ureteral diverticula in infancy.
 We report 2 cases of massive abdominal distension due to a mid ureteral diverticulum.
 In a 1-year-old boy the mid ureteral diverticulum was associated with an atrophied chronically scarred kidney.
 In a female newborn the diverticulum was associated with an upper pole ureter of a completely duplicated system.
 To our knowledge this type of ureteral diverticulum has not been reported previously.
