Vasculogenic impotence. Duplex and color Doppler imaging.
 Varicoceles, although only occasionally symptomatic, are reported to occur in 20% to 50% of infertile or subfertile men.
 Ligation or occlusion of the spermatic vein in these patients has improved semen quality in many instances.
 Recently, it has been recognized that varicoceles can be bilateral or subclinical and thus detected only by imaging.
 Sonographic diagnosis of varicoceles and percutaneous occlusive therapy are reviewed in this article.
