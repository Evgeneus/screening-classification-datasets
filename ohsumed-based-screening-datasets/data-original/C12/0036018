Prostatic specific antigen related to clinical status 1 to 14 years after radical retropubic prostatectomy.
 Serum prostatic specific antigen (PSA by Tandem-R immunoassay) was measured in 190 patients after radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer.
 Serial measurements were made in all patients operated on in the past 3 years; 131 had undetectable levels and 59 had levels in the detectable range.
 Only 10% of the patients with undetectable PSA following surgery had seminal vesical involvement or positive lymph nodes.
 None of the patients with undetectable PSA have had clinical recurrence within the 41 months of mean follow-up.
 In 14 patients who had PSA serially measured since surgery, detectable levels were found within 6 months of operation and 7 of these patients had clinical progression within 2 years; 39 patients had detectable PSA after radical prostatectomy with no clinical evidence of recurrence.
 Biopsy of the anastomosis was performed in 11 patients with isolated detectable PSA after surgery and local recurrence was established in 4.
 PSA was detectable later in the follow-up of 45 patients operated on before the PSA assay became available but the date when PSA actually became detectable is not known.
 A relatively new method of estimating that date and constructing a corresponding Kaplan Meier curve is presented.
 PSA is an effective marker for monitoring patients after radical prostatectomy as it often detects early persistent disease in patients with detectable measurements 6 months post-operatively or recurrent disease in patients with later rising levels.
