Relationship between use of diuretics and continence status in the elderly.
 Although diuretics have been implicated as a cause of urinary incontinence, no evidence has been presented prior to this report to confirm such a relationship.
 Our epidemiologic survey of 1,956 respondents sixty years of age and older in Washtenaw County, Michigan, revealed 24.6 percent of men and 36.9 percent of women were current users of a diuretic medication.
 Comparisons between users and non-users of diuretics and continence and incontinence status revealed no significant difference in the prevalence of incontinence in either gender.
 However, when male respondents who had cystometric examinations were analyzed, it was found that diuretic users who have uninhibited detrusor contractions (UDC) had a significantly higher prevalence of urinary incontinence (85.7%) when compared with non-users with UDC (25%) (p = 0.009).
 Among men who did not have UDC, use or non-use of diuretics showed a similar relationship but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.085).
 There were too few female respondents with UDC to make meaningful analysis in this group.
