The surgical treatment of chordee without hypospadias in men.
 During a 2-year period we treated 26 young men for chordee without hypospadias.
 Many of these patients had straight erections as children but a ventral curvature developed as they achieved puberty.
 We describe the anatomical findings and discuss the possible cause for the development of this anomaly.
 Surgical therapy begins with a circumcising incision and reflection of the skin to expose the shaft of the penis.
 The corpus spongiosum containing the urethra was mobilized by resecting the dysgenetic tissue in the dartos and Buck's fascia layers.
 In 1 patient this dissection was sufficient to straighten the penis but in the remaining 25 the penis was not straight.
 In those patients we mobilized the dorsal bundle of vessels and nerves, and removed 1 or several ellipses of tunica albuginea to equalize the lengths of the ventral and dorsal aspects of the corpora cavernosa.
 The corpus spongiosum usually is elastic and the curve almost never is caused by shortness of the urethra, which stretches to fit the straightened penis.
 In 24 of the 26 patients the curvature was resolved with 1 operation, while 2 needed a second procedure.
