Recombinant human erythropoietin and renal anemia: molecular biology, clinical efficacy, and nervous system effects 
 Anemia (hematocrit less than 25%) predictably accompanies chronic renal failure and is present in over 90% of patients on chronic dialysis.
 Relative erythropoietin deficiency is the proximate cause.
 Recombinant human erythropoietin recently became available for research and clinical use.
 Erythropoietin production is regulated by a single copy gene located on chromosome 7; its expression has been shown in the kidney, liver, and macrophages.
 It is glycosylated protein of 166 amino acids with a molecular weight of 34,000 D.
 When given to patients with the anemia of renal failure, erythropoietin causes a dose-dependent rise in hematocrit to the normal range within 8 to 14 weeks.
 Complications of this response are minimal except for a significant incidence of hypertension.
 When the anemia is corrected, the patient's quality of life, cognitive function, and brain electrophysiology improve dramatically.
 Recombinant human erythropoietin represents a major breakthrough in the treatment of patients with chronic renal failure.
 Current reimbursement constraints limit its full application.
