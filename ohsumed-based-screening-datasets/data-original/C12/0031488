Norepinephrine overflow and renin pattern of the individual kidney in patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis.
 This study was performed to determine divided renal efferent sympathetic nerve activity from kidneys in seven patients with renin-positive, unilateral renal artery stenosis before and 30 minutes after an acute intravenous dose of 1.25 mg enalaprilat.
 Renal norepinephrine release was calculated from split renal plasma flow, venoarterial plasma concentration gradients across the kidney, and the fractional extraction of tritiated norepinephrine.
 All patients had unilateral renin secretion, the affected kidney increasing its plasma renin activity gradient 1.7-fold, whereas no statistically significant change was noted on the contralateral side in response to enalaprilat.
 Total norepinephrine release to plasma and norepinephrine plasma clearance (assessed by isotope dilution) were similar before and after administration of enalaprilat (approximately 400 ng/min and 1.0 l/min), despite a 26% fall in mean arterial pressure (from 125 mm Hg, p less than 0.01).
 Heart rate remained unchanged.
 After enalaprilat, norepinephrine venoarterial difference increased in the renin-secreting kidney (from 264 to 396, SED = 57 pg/ml, p less than 0.05), whereas it increased only slightly in the contralateral kidney (from 149 to 256, SED = 72 pg/ml, NS).
 Tritiated norepinephrine extraction fell approximately 25% (p less than 0.01) in both kidneys.
 Thus, renal norepinephrine spillover increased from 49 to 62, SED = 9 ng/min (NS) and from 81 to 129, SED = 17 ng/min (p less than 0.05) from the affected and the contralateral kidney, respectively.
 Hence, in this relatively small study in patients with renovascular hypertension, no evidence for increased renal nerve activity could be observed in the affected kidney, despite its marked renin production.
