Hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children. A serious hazard of undercooked beef.
 Hemolytic-uremic syndrome is the leading cause of acute renal failure in childhood.
 Its incidence in North America is increasing.
 Escherichia coli O157:H7 is the most common infectious trigger and is spread by contaminated beef products as well as from person to person.
 Antibiotics or antidiarrheal medications should not be used in the treatment of E coli hemorrhagic colitis or hemolytic-uremic syndrome.
 Mortality in children with the syndrome has fallen to less than 10% in North America, largely because of careful attention to nutrition, maintenance of a normal fluid and electrolyte balance, and careful monitoring.
 Education and emotional support of the family are important aspects of the treatment program.
