The fate of aggregated immunoglobulin A injected in IgA nephropathy patients and healthy controls.
 Organ uptake of IgA-containing immunologically active material was studied in humans by intravenous (IV) injection of 131I-labeled heat-aggregated human secretory IgA (HAS-IgA) in nine patients affected by primary IgA nephropathy and 10 normal volunteers.
 Aggregated secretory IgA was found to be removed almost exclusively by the liver.
 The peak activity in liver was reached at 21.1 minutes (range, 18 to 26 minutes) in patients and 19 minutes (range, 14 to 22 minutes) in controls.
 The rate of increase of liver radioactivity was found to be significantly slower in patients (with a mean slope of 5.0; range, 3.4 to 7.1 v 7.6, 5.6 to 11.4; P less than 0.02).
 The mean liver to precordium ratio at the peak time was significantly lower in patients (mean value, 2.3; range, 1.9 to 3.1) compared with controls (mean value, 3.3; range, 2.4 to 4.0) (P less than 0.02).
 These data confirm the pivotal role of the liver in the removal of aggregated IgA in humans and the defective clearance capacity of this test probe in IgA nephropathy patients.
