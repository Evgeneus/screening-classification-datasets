The risk of ligation of the left renal vein in resection of the abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 The left renal vein can be ligated during aortic operation to attain better access to the perirenal aorta.
 This maneuver has been considered safe, with a low incidence of postoperative renal complications.
 This study was done to evaluate the risk of left renal vein ligation and its influence on renal function in patients with elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
 The records of 332 patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a five year period were reviewed.
 The clinical and operative data of patients who had left renal vein ligation and those who did not were similar.
 Left renal vein ligation was not associated with an increased mortality rate but was strongly associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a clinical diagnosis of postoperative azotemia.
 Nine of 13 patients who had left renal vein ligation had postoperative azotemia compared with 21 of 319 patients without left renal vein ligation (p less than 0.001).
 The mean change of preoperative and postoperative creatinine value was an increase of 1.92 milligrams per deciliter in patients with left renal vein ligation in contrast with 0.26 milligram per deciliter in patients without ligation (p less than 0.00075).
 Thus, ligation of the left renal vein increases the risk of postoperative renal complications and its use should be selective.
