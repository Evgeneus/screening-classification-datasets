Kinetics of pulmonary leukocyte sequestration in man during hemodialysis with different membrane-types.
 Although it has been suggested that pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes could account for membrane-dependent white blood cell depletion in HD, direct evidence in patients is still lacking.
 Therefore a study was initiated to test whether and how leukocytes distribute in the lung circulation during HD with different membranes.
 Thirteen patients suffering from chronic renal failure underwent lung scintigraphy during HD with cuprophane (n = 3), hemophane (n = 8) and polysulfone (n = 2) lowflux capillary dialyzers.
 Isolated autologous leukocytes were labelled with 99m-Technetium and reinfused before starting HD.
 Distribution of leukocyte related activity was registered by lung scintigraphy.
 In comparison to normal lung scintigraphy performed without HD, an impressive redistribution peak was demonstrated 10-20 min after the start of HD with cuprophane and also to a lesser extent with hemophane.
 When HD was performed with polysulfone the decrease in activity was delayed but no real redistribution was obtained.
 In accordance with other phenomena, such as peripheral leukopenia and changes in granulocyte oxidative metabolism, pulmonary sequestration of leukocytes takes place in man in the initial phase of HD and appears to be strongly dependent on the type of membrane.
