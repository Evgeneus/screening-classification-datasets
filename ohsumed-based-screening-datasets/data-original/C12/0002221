Selection of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy.
 There are several areas of concern in dealing with clinical stage B disease.
 First, understaging is common.
 Second, recognition of extension into the seminal vesicles is important.
 Third, the patient's predicted life expectancy must be taken into account.
 Moreover, even clinically localized prostate cancer may have metastasized, and the need for surgical staging by lymph node dissection has been a significant factor in the authors' preference for radical retropubic rather than radical perineal prostatectomy.
 Neither of the two serum markers in clinical use is an absolute predictor of stage.
 Analysis of tumor ploidy may prove useful, and transrectal ultrasound warrants further study.
 In the elderly patient, the urologist certainly may elect to monitor the tumor without definitely deciding on operative versus conservative treatment.
