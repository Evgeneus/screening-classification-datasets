Serum ferritin: a tumor marker for renal cell carcinoma.
 Serum ferritin levels in 32 patients with renal cell carcinoma were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively.
 Serum ferritin concentration was significantly higher in renal cell carcinoma patients compared to controls (259.10 versus 61.30 ng./ml., p less than 0.001).
 Furthermore, there was a steady and statistically significant increase in serum ferritin levels with advancing disease stage, as well as a significant decrease in serum ferritin levels after nephrectomy for stages 1 and 2 disease.
 The intracellular content of ferritin as estimated by polyclonal antibody was dramatically increased in renal cancer tissue compared to normal parenchyma.
 Although serum ferritin regulation is complex and only partly understood, the present study suggests that serum ferritin may be a useful tumor marker for renal cell carcinoma.
