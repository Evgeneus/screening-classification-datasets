Nonpharmacologic treatment of urinary incontinence.
 Standard therapy for urinary incontinence often includes pharmaceutical agents that carry a risk of side effects or interactions with other drugs.
 As an alternative, several nonpharmacologic management approaches are available.
 Scheduled voiding regimens are effective for patients who have uninhibited detrusor contractions, even when cognitive impairment is present.
 In motivated patients, pelvic muscle exercise is effective for stress incontinence.
 These methods are safe and inexpensive, and studies indicate that they can be as effective as or more effective than pharmaceutical agents.
 Other nonpharmacologic approaches to management include biofeedback techniques and electrical stimulation therapy.
