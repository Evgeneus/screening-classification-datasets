N-terminal pro atrial natriuretic peptide in human plasma.
 N-Terminal pro ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide) in human plasma has been measured by radioimmunoassay after extraction on Sep-Pak cartridges.
 Immunoreactive N-terminal pro ANP circulates in human plasma at higher levels than alpha-hANP (approximately 20-fold higher in normal subjects) and was elevated in patients with essential hypertension, cardiac transplantation and patients with chronic renal failure.
 In chronic renal failure patients undergoing hemodialysis, C-terminal ANP (ANP 99-126), but not N-terminal ANP, declined significantly after dialysis.
 Gel filtration experiments demonstrated a single peak of N-terminal ANP immunoreactivity, eluting in parallel with synthetic human pro ANP 1-67, indicating a similar molecular size and the absence of low molecular weight N-terminal fragments.
