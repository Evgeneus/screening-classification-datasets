Oxalate, silicon and vanadium in acquired cystic kidney disease.
 We have investigated the importance of several clinical and laboratory parameters on the development of acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) as detected by ultrasonography in 19 patients who had received dialysis therapy for at least three years.
 We were particularly interested on the possible effect of the serum levels of oxalate and silicon, which can produce tubular obstruction, and that of vanadium, which can affect cell proliferation.
 The severity of ACKD increased with the duration of dialysis and was greater in men than in women.
 Positive correlations were observed between the grades of ACKD and the levels of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and parathyroid hormone, while there was a negative correlation between ACKD and serum ferritin levels.
 The serum levels of oxalate, silicon, and vanadium, pre- and postdialysis, were markedly and significantly higher than those in normal controls, but there was no significant correlation between these levels and the duration of dialysis therapy or severity of ACKD.
 The pre- and postdialysis levels of vanadium were not significantly different, while the levels of oxalate and silicon were significantly lower in the postdialysis samples.
 No significant correlations were detected between ACKD and age of the patients, blood pressure, protein catabolic rate, efficiency of dialysis index, or the serum levels of iron, sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, aluminum, and beta 2-microglobulin.
