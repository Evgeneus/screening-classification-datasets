Effect of apomorphine on penile tumescence in men with psychogenic impotence.
 In a double-blind study using physiological recording of penile tumescence, brachial subcutaneous apomorphine hydrochloride injections elicited penile erections in men with psychogenic impotence.
 This observation is compatible with the hypothesis of central dopaminergic involvement in human penile erection.
 Since apomorphine is believed to induce erections by its effect on brain monoamine pathways, apomorphine response may have diagnostic use in evaluating the etiology of erectile failure.
