Permanent urethral stents for detrusor sphincter dyssynergia.
 A series of 22 patients, most of whom had spinal injuries with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia, have had Medinvent Wallstents placed across the distal mechanism.
 All but 8 patients had undergone outflow surgery and 11 had had repeated unsuccessful sphincterotomies.
 The proximal end of the stent was placed over the verumontanum unless fertility was contemplated, when it was placed immediately below the verumontanum.
 Fifteen patients achieved complete voiding after placement of the first stent; 3 developed bladder neck obstruction after stenting, but in 1 of these cases resolution occurred after bladder neck incision.
 The 3 patients with artificial urinary sphincters failed to improve after stenting.
 Use of the urethral stent for patients with detrusor sphincter dyssynergia and failed sphincterotomy is a major advance.
 It should probably be the primary treatment in selected cases.
 Its effect on fertility is currently under assessment.
