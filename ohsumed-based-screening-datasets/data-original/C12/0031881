Diagnostic and therapeutic technology assessment. Vasoactive intracavernous pharmacotherapy for impotence: intracavernous injection of prostaglandin E1.
 The DATTA panelists consider PGE1 to be a useful addition to the family of vasoactive agents used to treat organic impotence.
 It is associated with fewer side effects than either papaverine or phentolamine.
 Although most patients can achieve an erection with PGE1, some will not, and the other vasoactive agents may be of benefit in these cases.
 Synergy has been demonstrated when papaverine and PGE1 are used together, and a combination of the two in reduced dosages may be effective in producing an erection with a reduction in side effects.
 Intracavernosal therapy should be prescribed and monitored by a urologist who is experienced in the treatment of impotence and who is able to treat any of the potential side effects.
 Whether long-term use of local injections will produce additional complications is yet to be determined.
