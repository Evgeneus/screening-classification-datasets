Clinical and histologic features of iron-related bone disease in dialysis patients.
 Forty-eight dialysis patients undergoing bone biopsy were analyzed for clinical history, blood biochemical values, bone histologic findings, bone aluminum content (BAC), bone iron content (BIC), bone iron stores, and histochemical staining of bone aluminum and bone iron.
 Four patients had significant trabecular bone iron staining alone; eight patients had significant bone iron and bone aluminum staining; 13 patients had significant bone aluminum staining alone; and 23 patients showed no significant bone aluminum or iron staining.
 Patients with significant bone iron staining were younger (37.4 +/- 5.3 years v 53.2 +/- 2.3 years, P less than 0.01, mean +/- SEM) and were more likely to be anephric (P less than 0.001) and to have a history of prior renal transplantation (P less than 0.10).
 The 12 patients with significant bone iron staining had received more blood transfusions than those without bone iron staining (96 +/- 22.8 U v 22 +/- 5.8 U, P less than 0.005).
 Patients with bone iron accumulation had higher levels of serum ferritin (3,594 +/- 1,138.4 micrograms/L [ng/mL] v 265 +/- 60.1 micrograms/L, P less than 0.01) and lower levels of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) (349 +/- 150 microLEq/mL v 1,801 +/- 397 microLEq/mL [386 +/- 166 pmol/L v 1,990 +/- 439 pmol/L], P less than 0.005).
 BIC was also higher in these patients (1,008 +/- 149 micrograms iron/g bone v 300 +/- 46.5 micrograms iron/g bone, P less than 0.001) and higher than normal BIC (256 +/- 44.2 micrograms iron/g bone, eight normals).
 Bone marrow iron stores were positively related to serum ferritin levels (P less than 0.01) and trabecular bone iron staining (P less than 0.10).
 All 13 patients with osteomalacia demonstrated significant bone aluminum staining; seven of these patients demonstrated concomitant significant iron staining.
 Fourteen of 15 patients with severe hyperparathyroidism showed no significant iron or aluminum staining.
 Our data indicate that iron will probably not accumulate within bone until all other storage sites (eg, bone marrow) are fully saturated.
 The presence of lower levels of iPTH in iron-overloaded patients raises the possibility that iron overload may induce a state of relative hypoparathyroidism.
 The most important determinant for the presence of osteomalacia seems to be the presence of significant aluminum staining.
 No specific bone histologic finding was related to the presence of bone iron staining, but the rarity of isolated significant bone iron staining makes it difficult to evaluate bone histologic diagnoses that might be solely attributable to iron.
