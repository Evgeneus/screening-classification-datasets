Effect of long-term epoetin beta therapy on the quality of life of hemodialysis patients.
 Differences in quality of life were observed using two separate patient populations with end-stage renal disease who were on maintenance hemodialysis.
 The first population (91 patients) received epoetin beta (Marogen Sterile Powder, Chugai-Upjohn, Inc., Chicago, Ill.) for an average of 18 months.
 The second population (96 patients) did not receive this therapy.
 The measured quality of life parameters included a number of global and psychological well-being measurements and the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), as well as energy, activity levels, appetite, work, and sexual function.
 When adjusted for covariates (health status and demographics), 16 of 26 parameters were significantly higher (p less than .05) in patients receiving epoetin beta.
 All mean scores for global measurements were significantly higher.
 Significantly higher scores were also obtained for total SIP and total psychosocial subscale, as well as for sleep, home management, recreation, emotional behavior, social interaction, ability to work, and energy.
 While not statistically significant, all of the remaining measurements were higher for epoetin beta than for untreated patients.
