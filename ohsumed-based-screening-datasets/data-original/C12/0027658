Use of percutaneous nephrostomy in malignant ureteric obstruction.
 Seventeen patients with malignant disease underwent percutaneous nephrostomy to relieve renal failure secondary to ureteric obstruction.
 Renal function improved in 88%.
 The median survival time was 18 weeks and 58% left the primary hospital to return home or to a terminal care hospice.
 Minor complications occurred in 58%.
 The use of bilateral nephrostomy tubes conferred no greater benefit than a unilateral tube.
 Intervention in malignant ureteric obstruction may confer some benefit and should not necessarily be viewed with pessimism.
