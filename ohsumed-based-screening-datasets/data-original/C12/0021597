Bladder outlet obstruction versus impaired detrusor contractility: the role of outflow.
 The uroflow curves of 45 men with either bladder outlet obstruction or impaired detrusor contractility were retrospectively reviewed.
 The definitive diagnoses were attained by clinical and video-urodynamic studies with simultaneous detrusor pressure and uroflow measurements.
 Eight parameters were analyzed to determine if uroflow can differentiate obstruction from impaired contractility.
 There were no differences between the 2 groups in any of the parameters.
 This finding suggests that uroflowmetry as a single examination cannot distinguish between bladder outlet obstruction and impaired detrusor contractility.
