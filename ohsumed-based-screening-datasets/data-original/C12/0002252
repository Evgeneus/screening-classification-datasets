Transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis after M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) chemotherapy.
 The M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) regimen has been utilized at our two institutions to treat 17 patients with advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 We report 2 cases of carcinomatous meningitis resulting from metastatic transitional cell carcinoma which occurred in patients treated with M-VAC.
 Review of the literature suggests that our experience with central nervous system metastases is not unique, and that treatment of advanced stage transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder with M-VAC may enhance the incidence of meningeal metastases.
 Carcinomatous meningitis, although rare, is a rapidly fatal manifestation of metastatic transitional cell carcinoma if left untreated.
 However, prompt diagnosis and early aggressive therapy may result in palliation and stabilization of neurologic status.
 We review the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of transitional cell carcinomatous meningitis.
