Adverse urinary symptoms after total abdominal hysterectomy--fact or fiction?
 Urinary symptoms before and after total abdominal hysterectomy in a study group of 80 pre-menopausal women were compared with those in a control group of 78 pre-menopausal women who had dilatation and curettage alone.
 No urinary symptom was found more commonly after hysterectomy than after curettage, whilst stress incontinence was less common in the study group.
 Transient symptoms occurred more frequently after hysterectomy.
