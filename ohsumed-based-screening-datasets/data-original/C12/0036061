Bone scan as a stratification variable in advanced prostate cancer.
 The serial technetium 99 (99Tc) bone scans of 76 patients with Stage D-2 prostate cancers were reviewed.
 Sites of metastases in skeletal areas in decreasing order were vertebrae, ribs, pelvis, long bones, and skull.
 Patients with one or two involved skeletal areas had a significantly longer progression-free interval and survival time than patients with three or more bony areas of uptake.
 Bone scans might be used as a stratification variable in future prospective clinical trials of Stage D-2 prostate cancer.
