Liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 activity in experimental infection: study of the relative effects of infectious stress and malnutrition.
 OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of infection and malnutrition on liver glutathione and cytochrome P450 (P450) in rats.
 DESIGN: Controlled experimental groups (12 groups).
 ANIMALS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats.
 INTERVENTIONS: Experimental endocarditis, pyelonephritis, or peritonitis were caused.
 Controls included free-fed rats and sham-operated rats, pair-fed to infected animals.
 Infection was verified by tissue culture.
 Rats were killed 3 days (acute infection) or 10 days (chronic infection, except endocarditis) after the induction of infection.
 RESULTS: Sham rats had lower liver weights, liver/body weight, and liver glutathione values than controls.
 Infected rats had larger liver weights and liver/body weight ratios and liver glutathione content than shams, and larger liver/body weight ratios than controls (acute infection).
 Infected rats had lower P450 values than both shams and controls.
 CONCLUSION: The malnutrition associated with infection caused decreased liver weight and glutathione content.
 Infection increased the liver weight, and liver glutathione content, but caused severe reduction in liver P450.
 If the same finding is true in infected patients, it could have consequences for the management of such patients.
