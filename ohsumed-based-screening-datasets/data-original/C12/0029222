Ureteral catheter tip separation: potential risk using the open-end Flexi-Tip ureteral catheter.
 Ureteral catheters are a vital part of the urological armamentarium.
 We report 2 cases in which the flexible tip portion of an open-end Flexi-Tip ureteral catheter became disjointed from the shaft within the renal collecting system during endourological procedures.
 The etiology, prevention and management of this complication are discussed.
