Spermatic cord for onlay coverage of urethral defect.
 Segmental urethral necrosis may accompany scrotoperineal gangrene, and primary closure of the urethral defect may unacceptably reduce urethral dimensions.
 This dilemma has been managed successfully in 5 patients by application of the intact spermatic cord to the urethral defect and approximation to its margins.
 A representative case is described.
