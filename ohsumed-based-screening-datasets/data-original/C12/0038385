Causes of death in patients with tuberous sclerosis.
 Of the 355 patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) examined at the Mayo Clinic, 49 had died (9 of causes other than TSC).
 We attempted to determine what pattern of organ involvement occurred most often in the 40 patients who died of TSC.
 One baby died of cardiac failure due to cardiac rhabdomyomas, and one child died of rupture of an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta.
 Eleven patients died of renal disease, which was the commonest cause of death.
 Ten patients died as a result of brain tumors, and four patients (who were 40 years of age or older) died of lymphangiomyomatosis of the lung.
 Thirteen patients with severe mental handicaps died of either status epilepticus or bronchopneumonia; in all but one of these patients, the only source of information was the death certificate.
 Survival curves show a decreased survival for patients with TSC in comparison with that for the general population.
 Patients with TSC need lifelong follow-up for early detection of potentially life-threatening complications.
