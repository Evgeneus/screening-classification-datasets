Transvaginal ultrasonography and urodynamic evaluation after suspension operations: comparison among the Gittes, Stamey and Burch suspensions.
 Radiological and ultrasonographic imaging enables the objective determination of bladder neck position and movement in stress urinary incontinence.
 Postoperative results were evaluated in 60 patients after Burch colposuspension (29) or bladder neck suspension according to the Gittes (18) or Stamey (13) method.
 No differences in continence rates were noted 3 months postoperatively (Gittes 83%, Stamey 85% and Burch 93% of the patients).
 Late results were assessed by urodynamic evaluation and transvaginal ultrasonography.
 The largest decrease in continence rate was observed after the Gittes procedure (44% of the patients continent, mean followup 14.7 months), in comparison with the Stamey (69% continent after 34.6 months) and Burch (86% continent after 30.5 months) procedures.
 Urodynamic parameters showed no significant differences for the 3 groups.
 Transvaginal ultrasonography did not indicate a correlation between absolute resting or stress position of the bladder neck and continence.
 The main factor concerning continence was the rotation angle and descent of the bladder neck during stress.
 Our data indicate that transvaginal ultrasonography is a safe and reliable method to evaluate the postoperative outcome for stress urinary incontinence.
