Recurrent urethral stricture disease managed by clean intermittent self-catheterization.
 We studied 41 patients with urethral stricture who had failed at least 1 operation, and were being maintained with filiform and follower dilation every 6 to 12 weeks.
 The patients were instructed in clean intermittent self-catheterization with a 16F red rubber catheter, which was performed every 1 to 30 days.
 Followup from 9 to 36 months revealed excellent compliance and average peak uroflow rates increased from 5.5 cc per second before dilation to 17.1 cc per second at the last followup visit.
 Clean intermittent self-catheterization is a simple method to maintain a patent urethra and obviates the need for further operations or painful dilations.
