Radiotherapy for palliation of locally advanced prostatic carcinoma.
 Some patients present with distressing symptoms due to locally advanced prostatic carcinoma which may be refractory to hormonal manipulation and/or surgical treatment.
 Over an 8-year period 26 patients received local palliative radiotherapy for recurrent bleeding and lower urinary outflow tract obstruction.
 All were treated with conventional external beam radiotherapy and all but 2 obtained useful palliation of symptoms, especially those with recurrent bleeding.
 We also found that radiotherapy could be given to the majority of patients on an out-patient basis in 2 or 3 fractions.
 This was well tolerated and there were few side effects.
