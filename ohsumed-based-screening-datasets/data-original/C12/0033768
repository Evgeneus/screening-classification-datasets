Gentamicin and vancomycin removal by continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
 The dispositions and dose requirements for vancomycin and gentamicin were investigated in a 58-year-old man who was receiving long-term continuous venovenous hemofiltration.
 Estimates of clearance were obtained using a Bayesian parameter estimation program and stayed remarkably consistent throughout the therapy.
 Single daily doses of both vancomycin and gentamicin generally maintained the profiles for both drugs around the target ranges of peak 5-10 mg/L (gentamicin) and 25-40 mg/L (vancomycin) and trough less than 2 mg/L (gentamicin) and less than 10 mg/L (vancomycin).
