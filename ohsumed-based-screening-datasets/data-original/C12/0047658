Atrial natriuretic peptide in dialysis patients under various conditions of volume homeostasis.
 Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and plasma renin activity (PRA) were studied in 19 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) under haemodialysis (HD).
 On the basis of clinical findings, patients were divided into three groups: group A, 6 patients, of mean age 41 +/- 15 years, without heart failure and in need of ultrafiltration (658 +/- 282 ml h-1); group B, 6 patients, of mean age 54 +/- 15 years, without heart failure under isovolaemic HD; group C, 7 patients, of mean age 60 +/- 3 years, with heart failure (NYHA III-IV) and in need of ultrafiltration (607 +/- 120 ml h-1).
 The highest predialysis ANP levels were found in group C (1534 +/- 471 pg ml-1) followed by group A (476 +/- 168 pg ml-1) and group B (236 +/- 138 pg ml-1) (normal range 62 +/- 27 pg ml-1).
 Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate did not correlate with ANP levels in either of the groups.
 However, iso-osmotic reduction of the body weight by ultrafiltration was correlated with decreasing ANP levels during HD (for groups A and C, r = 0.88 and 0.98, respectively).
 Isovolaemic HD did not alter ANP concentrations (group B).
 All patients received a volume bolus at the end of HD, and they responded with an instant increase in ANP concentration, which was most pronounced in patients with concomitant heart failure.
 PRA was not significantly correlated with ANP levels during HD.
 In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that there is a sensitive response of ANP levels to changes in body fluid status in ESRD.
