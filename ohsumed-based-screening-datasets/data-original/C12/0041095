Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy: an outpatient procedure.
 At many centers circumstances have dictated that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL*) be performed on an outpatient (that is same-day surgery or 1-day stay) basis.
 At our center, Louisiana Lithotripter, Inc., which is a privately owned ESWL unit located at Tulane University Hospital, we have had the opportunity to treat patients in the inpatient and outpatient setting since inception.
 Since our first ESWL treatment on December 18, 1985 we have treated more than 2,500 patients.
 Additionally, our unit was named an American Urological Association Training Center in October 1986, resulting in more than 200 urologist, nurse and technician trainee visits.
 The first 1,779 cases through December 31, 1988 have been thoroughly reviewed.
 The rate of outpatient ESWL has increased from 22% of the first 100 cases to more than 90% of the last 100.
 The cumulative over-all rate reached 70%.
 Currently, more than 95% of our cases are planned as same-day procedures.
 Safe and effective outpatient ESWL is able to be performed with first generation technology, paving the way for appropriate clinical application to newer technological modalities.
