The Madigan prostatectomy.
 A total of 59 patients with bladder outflow obstruction underwent the Madigan prostatectomy.
 The method, results and complications are described.
 For select patients with large benign adenomas without a median lobe or hematuria we believe the technique to be the operation of choice, particularly in younger patients.
 Advantages include absence of postoperative hematuria and clot retention, a decreased requirement for blood transfusions, a 16F postoperative catheter with early removal, avoidance of post-catheter stricture, a low rate of postoperative urinary infection, a short comfortable period of hospitalization and, in the long term (median followup 6 years), preservation of potency and antegrade ejaculation.
