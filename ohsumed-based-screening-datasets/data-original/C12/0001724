Congenital nephrosis as a cause of elevated alpha-fetoprotein.
 Two cases of congenital nephrosis were detected through routine maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening of 95,135 patients.
 No other cases of congenital nephrosis from this group were reported, resulting in an incidence of approximately one in 47,500 in this low-risk population.
 In both of these cases, similar to other reported cases of congenital nephrosis having MSAFP screening, the protein concentrations were greater than or equal to 10 multiples of the median (MOM).
 Therefore, in the case of an MSAFP over 10 MOM and a normal ultrasound examination, congenital nephrosis should be included in counseling regarding the possibility of undetected malformations.
 Furthermore, in the case of a pregnancy with elevated amniotic fluid AFP with negative acetylcholinesterase and normal ultrasound, the possibility of congenital nephrosis should be mentioned, regardless of family history or ancestry.
 When a pregnancy is terminated because of these biochemical findings, special and immediate attention to the fetal kidneys using electron microscopy is necessary to evaluate properly the possibility of congenital nephrosis.
