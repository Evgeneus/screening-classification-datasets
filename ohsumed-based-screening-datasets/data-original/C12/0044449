Pharmacologically induced erections among geriatric men.
 Intracavernous injection of vasoactive drugs for the treatment of erectile impotence has become a standard therapeutic technique.
 Previous reports detailing experience with this treatment are based on patient populations significantly younger than most patients who suffer from impotence.
 The geriatric population, which comprises the majority of patients with importance, is unique due to the physical, psychological and social changes associated with the aging process.
 To characterize better elderly men with impotence, and determine whether intracavernous injection therapy is safe and effective in this age group, a retrospective analysis was performed upon patients attending the male sexual dysfunction clinic at our university medical center who received a standard papaverine and phentolamine mixture (30 mg.
 papaverine and 1.0 mg.
 phentolamine per ml.).
 The etiology of impotence, degree of patient satisfaction and complication rate of 65 patients 65 years or older (mean age 70 years) undergoing papaverine plus phentolamine self-injection therapy were compared to a similar size group of impotent men approximately 20 years younger (mean age 47 years).
 Significant differences in etiology of impotence were evident between the 2 groups.
 Treatment response rates were equal for the 2 age groups although elderly patients required a higher dose of papaverine and phentolamine to obtain an erection, and used the medication less frequently.
 Complications were few, of minimal consequence and occurred with equal frequency between the 2 age groups.
