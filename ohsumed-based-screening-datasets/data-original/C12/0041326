The incidental renal mass. Management alternatives.
 The problem of the incidental renal mass will confront all urologists with increasing regularity, and no universal strategy can be employed.
 Complete excision of the mass, including a margin of normal tissue, may be adequate therapy if a cancer is present and will preserve renal parenchyma if the lesion is benign.
 Care must be taken not to stretch the limits of this approach.
 Larger lesions (greater than 3-4 cm) are likely to be cancer and are better treated with a nephrectomy.
 While this management philosophy is logical and appealing, it has not been validated by clinical experience, and caution must still be exercised.
