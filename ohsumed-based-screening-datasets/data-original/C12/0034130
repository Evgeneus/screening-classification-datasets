Clinical outcome and health care costs in renal revascularization--percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty versus reconstructive surgery.
 Clinical outcome and health care costs related to investigation, treatment with either percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) or reconstructive surgery, and follow-up of patients with renovascular hypertension with or without uraemia were analysed in 21 PTRA-treated and 16 operated patients.
 Most renal artery stenoses were atherosclerotic.
 Nineteen PTRAs were successful or partly successful and two failed; the patients were operated on without delay.
 All surgical reconstructions were successful.
 In the PTRA group six restenoses occurred after 4-24 months.
 Four were treated with re-PTRA and two were operated on.
 No recurrence occurred in the operated group.
 At the end of follow-up (median 48, range 9-84 months) primary patency in the PTRA group was 69 per cent and in the operated group 100 per cent.
 Secondary patency in the PTRA group was 100 per cent.
 With regard to hypertension, including primary and secondary results, 19 out of 21 (90 per cent) patients were improved in the PTRA group and 13 out of 16 (81 per cent) in the operated group.
 The diagnostic and preprocedure costs were the same in both groups, whereas the procedure and postprocedure costs were lower in the PTRA group.
 However, the follow-up costs were considerably higher because of recurrences and their treatment in the PTRA group.
 The total median cost of reconstructive surgery was 12 per cent higher than for PTRA, a non-significant difference.
