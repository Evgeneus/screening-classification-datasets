Sodium handling by deep nephrons and the terminal collecting duct in glomerulonephritis.
 The present study was designed to characterize the effects of anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) glomerulonephritis (GN) on sodium handling by surface nephrons, deep nephrons and the terminal collecting duct segment.
 Studies were performed in rats during hydropenia and volume expansion.
 In hydropenia, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and sodium excretion tended to be lower in rats with GN than in controls.
 However, the major differences between the control and GN animals were seen in volume expansion.
 In the volume expanded groups fractional excretion of sodium was greater in controls (3.20 +/- 0.51%) than in GN (1.20 +/- 0.36%, P less than 0.01).
 Despite this, delivery to end proximal sites was similar in the two groups in absolute terms and higher in the expanded GN group compared to the expanded controls.
 Absolute sodium delivery to the bend of the loop of Henle in the expanded GN rats was decreased in absolute terms but increased in fractional terms compared to expanded controls.
 However, fractional delivery of sodium to the base of the terminal collecting duct was less in GN (3.71 +/- 1.39%) than in controls (7.19 +/- 0.96%, P less than 0.002).
 In both groups, fractional delivery between tip of the collecting duct fell compared to base (P less than 0.05) but delivery to the tip was again greater in controls (5.49 +/- 1.08%) than in GN (1.51 +/- 0.47%).
 In GN 62.6 +/- 5.0% of delivered sodium was reabsorbed between collecting duct sites, nearly twofold that of controls (28.8 +/- 9.4%, P less than 0.01).
 Thus, fractional sodium reabsorption in the collecting duct was enhanced by GN.
