Ambulatory urodynamics.
 Long-term ambulatory urodynamic monitoring has been employed in 20 patients in an attempt to detect detrusor abnormality not appreciated by conventional cystometry.
 In 9 female patients with the "urge syndrome" it detected 2 previously unrecognised cases of detrusor instability; in 4 enuretic patients, only 1 of whom was known to be unstable previously, unstable contractions were confirmed, and 2 of 7 cystoplasty patients had high amplitude contractions detected only on ambulatory assessment.
 The technique provides a more sensitive index of lower urinary tract function than conventional cystometry in such patients.
