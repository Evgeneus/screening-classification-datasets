Control of morbidity due to Schistosoma haematobium on Pemba Island: egg excretion and hematuria as indicators of infection.
 The variability of Schistosoma haematobium egg excretion using a quantitative syringe filtration technique and the variability of hematuria detected visually and by reagent strips were studied in a population of 520 subjects from the village of Pujini (Pemba Island, Zanzibar, Tanzania) for 6 consecutive days.
 A high degree of day-to-day variability of egg excretion within subjects was found both in the whole population and in the 5-19 year age group.
 Subjects with 1 urinary egg count of greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine were not similarly classified in 36-61% of the other 5 examinations and 4-16% of their other examinations were negative.
 Gross hematuria had a specificity of almost 100%, when related to a positive filtration on any day, and was closely related to egg counts of greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine.
 The finding of a strongly positive reaction for hematuria on a given single day was closely associated with the subject having a high egg count (greater than or equal to 50 eggs/10 ml urine) on at least one of the 6 days of the study.
 At the primary health care level, single highly positive semiquantitative values for hematuria were a more useful diagnostic indicator than a single egg count to select patients with heavy infections for selective population chemotherapy.
