Endoluminal sonography of the urinary tract: preliminary observations.
 Endoluminal sonography of the urinary tract was performed by using endoluminal ultrasound transducers contained within 2-mm-diameter catheters.
 The catheters were inserted into the urinary bladder via the urethra and advanced into the ureters and renal pelvis under cystoscopic control; then, cross-sectional images of the bladder, ureters, and renal pelvis were obtained.
 Two dogs and seven human patients were studied.
 In one dog, a 4.5-mm pseudopolyp, which was surgically created in the bladder wall, was successfully imaged; in the other, stones 2 mm or larger inserted into the bladder were identified.
 Of the seven patients, sonography showed stones embedded in the renal parenchyma (one patient) and the mucosa of the distal ureter (one patient).
 These were ultimately confirmed by their eventual removal.
 In a third, sonography showed a tumor of the distal ureter and identified the depth of the tumor.
 This was confirmed by biopsy.
 In a fourth, sonography clearly showed a crossing vessel as the cause for narrowing of the proximal ureter.
 In a fifth, sonography showed that the cause of a ureteral stricture was idiopathic.
 In the last two cases, sonography did not reveal a cause for hematuria.
 In these last three cases, negative sonographic results were confirmed by direct ureteroscopic examinations and follow-up studies.
 Our observations based on this limited study suggest that endoluminal sonography is a useful procedure for diagnosing diseases of the urinary tract.
 Further study is warranted.
