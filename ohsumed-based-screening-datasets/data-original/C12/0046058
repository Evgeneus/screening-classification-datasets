Comparison of low molecular weight heparin and standard heparin in hemodialysis.
 The anticoagulant and antithrombotic effect of heparin has been known for many decades.
 Since low molecular weight heparin has been available, several advantages over standard heparin were observed, especially in long-term use during hemodialysis.
 In 27 patients, we found a lower bleeding risk, a lower need for erythrocyte transfusions, a lesser increase in activity of various coagulation factors, and lower triglyceride levels.
 Therefore, low molecular weight heparin would appear to be a good alternative to standard heparin in dialysis patients.
