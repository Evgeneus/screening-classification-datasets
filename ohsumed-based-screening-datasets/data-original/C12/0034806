Ascorbic acid supplements in patients receiving chronic peritoneal dialysis.
 Ascorbic acid supplements are commonly prescribed to patients with end-stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis.
 To establish the need for ascorbic acid supplements, we evaluated seven chronic peritoneal dialysis patients during a supplement-free (phase I) period, and while receiving oral ascorbic acid (0.57 mmol/d [100 mg/d]) (phase II).
 Because of a proposed interaction with vitamin B6, patients were additionally supplemented with pyridoxine HCl (59.6 mumol/d [10 mg/d]) (phase III).
 Plasma levels and dialysate removal rates of total ascorbic acid and plasma pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) were measured at the end of each phase.
 During phase I, plasma ascorbic acid levels (normal, 45 to 57 mumol/L [0.8 to 1.0 mg/dL]) declined slightly from 74 +/- 11 mumol/L (1.3 +/- 0.2 mg/dL) to 62 +/- 11 mumol/L (1.1 +/- 0.2 mg/dL) (P less than 0.02) at the end of the third week, and then remained stable to the end of the fourth week.
 Plasma ascorbic acid levels were no different in patients with or without residual renal function.
 With the addition of vitamin C supplements, plasma ascorbic acid levels increased by 45% of the baseline value at the end of phases II (P less than 0.001).
 The dialysate removal rate of ascorbic acid was 0.28 +/- 0.03 mmol/d (50 +/- 6 mg/d) at the end of phase I, and increased by 57% of the baseline value at the end of phases II (P less than 0.001).
 However, the peritoneal clearance of ascorbic acid remained unchanged during all phases the study.
 Pyridoxine depletion or repletion had no effect on plasma ascorbic acid levels (P greater than 0.05).
