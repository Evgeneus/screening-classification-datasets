Forced hydration prior to renography in children with hydronephrosis. An evaluation.
 We have developed a method of diuretic renography for the assessment of upper urinary tract obstruction in children.
 A maximal diuresis under standardised conditions is obtained by forced intravenous hydration over a 2-h period prior to renography.
 We evaluated the predictive value of this method for the clinical and functional outcome in 73 children with apparent unilateral pelviureteric junction obstruction.
 The predictive value of a non-obstructive pattern was 94%, while the predictive value of an obstructive pattern could not be assessed accurately because the patients concerned subsequently underwent operation.
 The method is safe and reliable and offers advantages over conventional diuretic renography.
