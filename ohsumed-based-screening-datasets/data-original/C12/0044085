Moderate protection of renal function and reduction of fibrosis by colchicine in a model of anti-GBM disease in the rabbit.
 A rabbit model of renal glomerulosclerosis induced by anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody was used to determine whether colchicine would protect renal function and reduce fibrosis.
 Initial studies established the time course of renal function changes and fibrosis.
 Colchicine at a dose of 0.02 to 0.04 mg/kg per day injected ip was begun at day 4 when injury had been initiated, and the experiment was ended at day 21 when fibrotic changes were established.
 Colchicine significantly reduced the rise in serum creatinine (serum creatinine = 2.7 +/- 0.3 mg% in vehicle-treated animals versus 1.8 +/- 0.1 mg% in colchicine-treated animals) and interstitial fibrosis (fibrosis score = 2.6 +/- 0.2 in vehicle-treated versus 1.5 +/- 0.2 in colchicine-treated animals).
 Colchicine treatment did not significantly affect weight, anti-guinea pig immunoglobulin level, % fibrocellular crescents formed, hydroxyproline per gram (dry weight) in tissue, or urine protein: creatine ratio.
 Regression analysis was performed to examine the interrelationships between variables for all animals and the effect of colchicine on pairs of variables.
 No clear-cut site of colchicine action could be identified.
 These data show that colchicine, in doses that could be used in humans, protected renal function by about 25% and reduced interstitial fibrosis in a model of severe crescentic nephritis.
