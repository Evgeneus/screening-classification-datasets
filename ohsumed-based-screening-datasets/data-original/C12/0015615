Small cell carcinoma of the prostate.
 This report details clinical and pathologic aspects of a patient with small cell undifferentiated carcinoma of the prostate and systemic hyperglucagonemia.
 A panel of potential serologic markers was evaluated in order to document additional evidence of ectopic hormonal production.
 Immunocytochemical markers were sought in tissue samples from the primary neoplasm and a lung metastasis.
 Stains were positive for corticotropin (ACTH) and gastrin in both the prostate and in the lung, but no evidence of excess secretion was documented.
 These findings are consistent with the notion that neuroendocrine activity is common in undifferentiated small cell carcinomas, regardless of their site of origin.
