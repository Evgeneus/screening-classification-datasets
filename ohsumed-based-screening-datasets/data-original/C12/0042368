A multicenter clinical trial of epoetin beta for anemia of end-stage renal disease.
 Patients with anemia of end-stage renal disease were studied for 36 weeks to determine efficacy, safety, and long-term benefits of epoetin beta administration.
 A total of 131 patients participated in the 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled portion of the multicenter study.
 For the first 6 weeks (fixed-dose period), patients were randomized to receive 100 U/kg of epoetin beta or placebo thrice weekly; in the second 6 weeks (dose-adjustment period), the dose of epoetin beta ranged from 50 to 150 U/kg thrice weekly.
 Of the 131 patients who entered the placebo-controlled period, 122 crossed over to a 24-week open-label period, where all patients received active drug and doses of epoetin beta could be individually titrated after the first 6 weeks.
 One hundred patients completed the 36-week study.
 In all phases of the study, epoetin beta was shown to produce a consistent, sustained increase in hemoglobin (baseline, 7.1 +/- 0.1 to 10.5 +/- 0.2 g/dL) and hematocrit (baseline, 21.5 to 32.7%), which virtually eliminated the need for packed red blood cell transfusions.
 Reticulocyte counts rose initially in response to epoetin beta and stabilized at levels higher than baseline throughout the remainder of the study period (baseline, 1.7 to 2.5%).
 The placebo group showed no change in these parameters during the double-blind period.
 Similar patterns of response were seen in the original placebo group after crossover to active drug (mean hemoglobin increase, 2.6 +/- 0.5).
