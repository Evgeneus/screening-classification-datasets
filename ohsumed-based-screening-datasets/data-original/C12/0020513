Rhabdomyolysis and renal failure following a wolf attack: case report.
 Trauma-induced rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric renal failure are well recognized.
 The mechanism of trauma in reported cases has been burns, crush injuries, or compression syndromes.
 We report a case of myoglobinuric renal failure in a 5-year-old boy who suffered primarily lacerations and penetrating wounds from a wolf attack.
 We are unaware of any other reports of nonvenomous bites or penetrating trauma causing rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuric renal failure.
 Early suspicion, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition result in an excellent prognosis.
 Pathogenesis, treatment, and a review of the literature are presented.
