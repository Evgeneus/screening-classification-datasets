Controlled trial of infusion cavernosometry in impotent and potent men.
 Infusion cavernosometry often is performed to diagnose venous leak impotence.
 However, normal values have seldom been established in proved potent men.
 We performed a prospective study of infusion cavernosometry on nocturnal penile tumescence confirmed potent male volunteers and impotent men.
 Of 20 potent male controls 19 had resistance values of greater than 5 (mm.
 Hg.minute)/ml.
 Of 38 impotent men 20 (53%) had resistance values of less than 5 (mm.Hg.
 minute)/ml.
 There was considerable overlap between resistance values and infusion rates in potent and impotent men.
 Impotent men with resistances of greater than 5 (mm.Hg.minute)/ml.
 more often had normal nocturnal penile tumescence results than men with lower resistance values.
 Venous leakage is a significant cause of impotence.
