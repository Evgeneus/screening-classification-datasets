Transvenous occlusion of clinical and subclinical varicoceles.
 Forty-four subfertile men with a palpable or clinically suspected varicocele underwent physical examination, nuclear scan, and testicular venography.
 The ability of these tests to detect a varicocele was compared.
 The sensitivity of physical examination was 0.94 on the left and 0.35 on the right.
 Specificity was 0.22 on the left and 0.77 on the right.
 The sensitivity of nuclear scan was 0.97 on the left and 0.73 on the right.
 Specificity was 0.56 on the left and 0.50 on the right.
 Patients with varicoceles demonstrated by venography were treated with testicular vein embolization.
 There were no complications except two asymptomatic subintimal injections, both of which occurred on the right side.
 A total of 19 patients had pre- and post-embolization semen analyses performed.
 The total motile sperm count increased from 27.0 million to 35.5 million.
 The overall pregnancy rate in the embolization-treated group was 43.7 percent.
