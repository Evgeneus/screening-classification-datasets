The ability of systematic transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy to detect prostate cancer in men with the clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 Multiple directed and systematic ultrasound guided biopsies of the prostate were performed in 73 men with the clinical diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).
 Seven men (10%) had prostate cancer.
 Of the 67 patients with benign biopsies 40 underwent subsequent transurethral prostatectomy and 2 (5%) had prostate cancer.
 Multiple directed and systematic biopsies of the prostate detected 78% of the nonpalpable prostate cancers diagnosed in the study population.
 Radical prostatectomy was performed in all 9 men with prostate cancer: there were 3 small organ-confined tumors, 5 large organ-confined tumors and 1 stage C tumor with 1 focus of microscopic capsular penetration.
 Our results suggest that multiple directed and systematic ultrasound guided biopsies are capable of detecting low volume nonpalpable prostate cancer in men with BPH.
 However, the exact indication for pre-treatment ultrasound guided biopsy of the prostate in men with symptomatic BPH remains unclear.
 It may be that use of this modality is most appropriate for patients undergoing pharmacological therapy or balloon dilation of BPH rather than for those undergoing transurethral prostatectomy.
