Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist improves the efficiency of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation/intrauterine insemination.
 OBJECTIVE: Leuprolide acetate (LA) has improved the efficiency of human menopausal gonadotropins (hMG) in in vitro fertilization cycles.
 We hypothesized that the combination of LA/hMG/intrauterine insemination (IUI) would be more efficacious than hMG/IUI cycles.
 DESIGN: During an 18-month period, all patients completing either a hMG/IUI cycle (group I) or a LA/hMG/IUI cycle (group II) had the characteristics and outcomes of their stimulation cycles assessed.
 The groups were not prospectively randomized.
 SETTING: Referral center at a tertiary care hospital.
 PATIENTS: One hundred twenty three patients in group I completed 219 cycles, and 64 patients in group II completed 102 cycles.
 Twenty-eight of the patients who failed to conceive with hMG/IUI were advanced to group II.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pregnancy/IUI is compared between the two groups.
 RESULTS: Group II demonstrated significantly greater clinical pregnancy/IUI than group I (26.5% and 16.0%, respectively, P less than 0.05), as well as a higher live birth/IUI (21.6% and 12.8%, respectively, P less than 0.05).
 No difference was present in the rate of fetal wastage or multiple births.
 CONCLUSIONS: In our patients with recalcitrant infertility, the addition of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist to hMG/IUI improved the pregnancy rate, without increasing the rate of multiple births or fetal wastage.
