Cost-benefit analysis of pharmacologic erection program (PEP) versus penile prosthesis 
 We compared the current dollar inclusive costs of the two most commonly implanted penile prostheses with our pharmacologic erection program (PEP).
 The inclusive cost of implantation for the inflatable penile prosthesis (IPP) is $9,000 and for the malleable penile prosthesis (MPP) $3,150.
 The inclusive cost of PEP at maximal dose and maximal frequency of use over a five-year period is $3,450.
 Penile prosthesis was found to be more cost-effective for the long-term treatment of younger impotent men, whereas in the elderly group the use of PEP over a limited time span may be equally or more cost-effective.
