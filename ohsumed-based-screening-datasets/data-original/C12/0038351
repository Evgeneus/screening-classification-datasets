Distal hypospadias repair by urethral sliding advancement and Y-V glanuloplasty.
 Different techniques are available today for repairing distal (coronal and subcoronal) hypospadias but none is universally recommended.
 We developed the technique of a distal urethral advancement glanuloplasty operation that is specifically intended for distal hypospadias repair even with mild chordee.
 Mobilization of the distal urethra is performed for 1.0 to 1.5 cm.
 after subcoronal circumcision and a deep Y-shaped incision of the glans.
 The mobilized urethra is dorsally split and slid forward to the tip of the dart of the glans previously prepared.
 Glanuloplasty is performed using the 2 lateral flaps of glans tissue.
 From January 1987 to December 1989 we used this technique in 74 cases of distal hypospadias with mild or no chordee (patient age 18 months to 9 years, mean 3.5 years).
 A transurethral catheter was left indwelling for 3 to 4 days.
 Hospitalization time was 5 (plus or minus 1.5) days.
 Results after 4 to 40 months of followup are encouraging cosmetically and functionally.
 All patients were cured.
 In 3 cases (4%) meatal stenoses occurred requiring meatotomy and in 8 boys meatal dilations were performed on an outpatient basis.
 In 1 case (1.3%) a fistula developed, which was subsequently repaired without further complications.
 This operation may be successfully used in most cases of distal hypospadias, with a low complication rate and excellent cosmetic results.
 It also may be used if mild chordee is present, thus reducing the indications for flip-flap urethroplasty in those cases when meatal advancement procedures may not be effective.
