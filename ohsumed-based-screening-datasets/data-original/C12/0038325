Urodynamic evaluation of the patient with an imperforate anus: a prospective study.
 Prospective urodynamic evaluation of 14 patients with an imperforate anus revealed detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia in 4.
 Subsequent contrast voiding cystourethrograms demonstrated radiographic changes in all 4 cases, consisting of bladder trabeculation, new onset of vesicoureteral reflux or hydroureteronephrosis.
 Of the 4 patients 3 had a high (supralevator) imperforate anus, while 1 had a low (infralevator) lesion.
 Two patients had bony vertebral abnormalities and 2 had normal plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging of the spine.
 Therefore, early urodynamic study is recommended for all patients with an imperforate anus and it should complement neonatal uroradiographic evaluation.
 The finding of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia should alert the urologist to the need for adjunctive management.
