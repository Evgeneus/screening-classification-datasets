Measurement of tissue perfusion by dynamic computed tomography.
 A method for quantifying tissue perfusion by dynamic computed tomography (CT) is described.
 By applying a nuclear medicine data processing technique to time-density data from a single-location dynamic CT sequence, tissue perfusion can be determined from the maximum gradient of the tissue time-density curve divided by the peak enhancement of the aorta.
 Using this method, splenic perfusion was measured at 1.2 ml min-1 ml-1, normal renal cortical perfusion at 2.5 ml min-1 ml-1 and normal renal medullary perfusion at 1.1 ml min-1 ml-1.
 Changes in cortical and medullary perfusion in renal failure and hypertension were demonstrated.
 The ability of dynamic CT to provide quantitative functional information is not well recognized and is potentially of value when studying structures, such as the renal cortex and medulla, that cannot be anatomically resolved by standard functional imaging techniques.
