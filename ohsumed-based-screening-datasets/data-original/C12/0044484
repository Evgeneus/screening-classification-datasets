Effects of interferon beta ser and transforming growth factor beta on prostatic cell lines.
 The effect of interferon beta ser (IFN beta ser) on the growth of three prostatic cancer cell lines DU-145, PC-3 and LNCaP was studied.
 IFN beta ser inhibited growth of anchorage dependent semiconfluent monolayers and anchorage dependent colony formation of both DU-145 and PC-3 in a dose dependent manner but had no effect on LNCaP.
 Transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta 1) inhibited proliferation of DU-145 and PC-3 cells in 1% but not 8% fetal calf serum.
 The combination of TGF beta 1 and IFN beta ser was additive in its effects on growth.
 Neither epidermal growth factor (EGF) nor transforming growth factor alpha (TGF alpha) reduced the antiproliferative effect of IFN beta ser on these cells.
 These antiproliferative effects were reproduced in studies on primary epithelial cell cultures derived from prostate specimens with various pathologies.
 The potential use of IFN beta ser in combination with hormonal therapy to delay the development of hormone refractory tumors is discussed.
