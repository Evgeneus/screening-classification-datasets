Effect of occluding the urethra while recording urethral stress profile.
 The correlation between clinical and tonometric incontinence is frequently poor, with urethral profile results that do not correspond to clinical reality.
 Among potential causal factors, we have attempted to determine the importance of the absorption of kinetic energy from the mass of urine driven against the urethral captor (the hydraulic ram effect).
 Twenty patients (average age 50 +/- 10 years, para 2) suffering from genuine stress urinary incontinence, underwent urodynamic investigation with a constant air-flow pneumatic catheter equipped with two captors separated by an inflatable cuff located just above the urethral captor to block the inrush of urine into the urethra.
 After cystometric examination had excluded an unstable bladder, two urethral profiles were registered successively, first with cuff deflated, and then with cuff inflated.
 The values for urethral functional length (FL) and transmission factor (TF) show no significant changes.
 The values for the maximal urethral closing pressure (MUCP) were significantly lower in the second profile (cuff inflated) in 18 of 20 cases (average decrease 7 cm H2O), which corresponds to 14 percent of the average MUCP measured during the first profile (cuff deflated).
 The depression quotient increased from an average 0.80 to 1.05 from first to second profile.
 This study allows quantification of the urethral "hydraulic ram effect" which modifies determination of the MUCP during registration of urinary stress profile.
