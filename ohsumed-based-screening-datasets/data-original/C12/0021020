Is there a place for conservative surgery in the treatment of renal carcinoma?
 Since 1981, 31 patients have undergone conservative surgery for malignant renal tumours and have been followed up for at least 2 years.
 The techniques included enucleation or resection (wedge resection or partial nephrectomy).
 In 10 patients the indications for kidney-sparing surgery were absolute, while in the remainder the conservative surgical approach was a deliberate choice.
 The tumours varied in diameter from 1.3 to 12 cm and no metastases were detected on pre-operative screening.
 One patient died post-operatively from myocardial infarction.
 In the remaining 30 there were no local recurrences.
 Two patients died from skeletal metastases (1 with bilateral malignancy) and 2 underwent surgery in the post-operative period for haemorrhagic complications.
 The efficacy of conservative surgery in the local control of renal cancer is an argument in favour of its wider use.
