Management of primary nonrenal parenchymal malignancies with vena caval thrombus.
 We report our experience with the management of 7 primary nonrenal parenchymal malignancies with vena caval tumor thrombus.
 Included are 3 cases of adrenal cortical carcinoma and 1 each of transitional cell carcinoma, embryonal cell testicular carcinoma, pheochromocytoma and primary small cell carcinoma of the lung with metastases to the kidney.
 Surgical treatment and followup are presented, as well as a review of the literature.
 An aggressive surgical approach is warranted because prolonged survivals free of disease are possible.
