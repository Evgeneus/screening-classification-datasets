Simplified captopril renography in diagnosis and treatment of renal artery stenosis.
 To improve the diagnosis and forecast the response to surgery or renal angioplasty in patients with hypertension and renal artery stenosis, we employed a simplified captopril renography protocol in conjunction with renal arteriography in 94 clinically selected patients.
 Fifty hypertensive patients (group 1) with a high clinical likelihood of renovascular hypertension were evaluated using a simplified captopril renography protocol and renal angiography on the arterial side.
 Criteria for normal captopril renal scintigrams were established based on this original cohort and validated in an additional 44 clinically comparable patients (group 2).
 Renal revascularization or nephrectomy was performed in 39 patients, and success of the procedure was determined in the 34 patients for whom 3-month follow-up was available.
 In the 94 patients, 44 (47%) had renal artery stenosis.
 Simplified captopril renography was 91% sensitive and 94% specific in identifying or excluding renal artery stenosis in the combined group, with no difference in the diagnostic utility between groups 1 and 2, or in those with renal insufficiency (n = 38) or those with bilateral disease (n = 17).
 Scintigraphic abnormalities induced by captopril were strongly associated with cure or improvement in blood pressure control following revascularization or nephrectomy (15 of 18), while the lack of captopril-induced changes was associated with failure of such intervention (13 of 16) (p = 0.0004).
 We conclude that simplified captopril renography is highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis in a clinically selected high-risk population and that the test accurately predicts the success or failure of therapeutic intervention.
