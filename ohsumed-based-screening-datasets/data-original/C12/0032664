Urinary incontinence among hospitalized persons aged 65 years and older--United States, 1984-1987.
 Urinary incontinence (the involuntary loss of urine so severe as to have social or hygienic consequences) affects at least 10 million persons in the United States.
 This problem is particularly common among persons aged greater than or equal to 65 years; in this age group, urinary incontinence is present in 15%-30% of community-dwelling (i.e., not hospitalized or in long-term-care institutions) persons, 15%-34% of those hospitalized in acute-care institutions, and about 50% of all long-term-care institution residents.
 This report summarizes a study of urinary incontinence among persons greater than or equal to 65 years of age discharged from hospitals in the United States from 1984 through 1987.
