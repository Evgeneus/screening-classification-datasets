Electroejaculation following retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy.
 Transrectal electroejaculation was performed in 24 men who were anejaculatory from retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy.
 Of the men 23 had undergone retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy because of testis cancer.
 Seminal emission was achieved in all patients.
 In 21 patients greater than 10 x 10(6) progressively motile sperm with normal morphology were obtained.
 The average sperm count and motilities obtained were 289 x 10(6) and 18%, respectively, for the antegrade fractions, and 2,051 x 10(6) and 13%, respectively, for the retrograde fractions.
 Of the 3 azoospermic failures 2 had chemotherapy-induced testicular damage and 1 had carcinoma in situ of the remaining testis.
 A total of 19 couples underwent artificial insemination with electroejaculated sperm.
 There were 7 pregnancies achieved in 74 insemination cycles (36.8% of the couples conceived for a 9% cycle fecundity).
 Routine semen parameters could not predict which couples would be successful in achieving pregnancy.
 There were 2 first trimester spontaneous abortions.
 Five healthy children have been born.
 Electroejaculation is an excellent treatment for anejaculation that persists following retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
