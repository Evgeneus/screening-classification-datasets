Intraperitoneal insemination in the treatment of male and unexplained infertility.
 For couples with unexplained or male infertility, intraperitoneal (IP) insemination in induced cycles is a method that increases the chance of fertilization.
 Seventy-seven couples with male subfertility were subjected to 120 IP insemination cycles and 31 with unexplained sterility to 44 cycles.
 As a consequence of the treatment, 23 pregnancies were obtained, with pregnancy rates of 23% per cycle and 32% per patient for unexplained infertility and 11% and 17% for male subfertility.
 Pregnancy loss rate was quite elevated: 9 clinical abortions and 1 ectopic.
 Intraperitoneal insemination appears to be a relatively noninvasive way to deal with unexplained or male factor infertility, well worth trying before moving on to more invasive and costly approaches, such as gamete intrafallopian transfer or in vitro fertilization.
