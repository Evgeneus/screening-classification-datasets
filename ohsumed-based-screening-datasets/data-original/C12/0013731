Renal artery stenosis: in vivo perfusion MR imaging.
 The intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) model of perfusion and diffusion imaging was applied to an in vivo canine model of unilateral renal artery stenosis and was compared with relative renal blood flow determination with radioactive microspheres.
 The percentage relative renal blood flow as determined with radioactive microspheres correlated closely with the percentage apparent diffusion coefficient.
 If this method can be adapted to human imaging, it may provide a noninvasive means for detecting renal artery stenosis.
