Loracarbef versus cefaclor in the treatment of urinary tract infections in women.
 In a double-blind, prospective, randomized study, 108 college women with acute urinary tract infections were treated for 7 days with either loracarbef (LY163892) at 200 mg once daily (n = 53) or cefaclor at 250 mg three times daily (n = 55).
 The cure rates at 5 to 9 days after treatment in the loracarbef and cefaclor groups were 96 and 90%, respectively.
 Both loracarbef and cefaclor are safe, well tolerated, and effective in the treatment of urinary tract infections in women.
