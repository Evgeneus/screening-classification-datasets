Hemodialysis-related amyloidomas of bone.
 Lytic bone lesions secondary to amyloid deposition are a recently described complication of long-term hemodialysis.
 The authors refer to these tumorlike deposits as amyloidomas in a review of the subject and four proved cases.
 This entity typically appears as multiple well-defined, juxta-articular lytic lesions without matrix calcification.
 The duration of hemodialysis is probably the greatest risk factor for development of these intraosseous amyloidomas.
 Ultrastructurally, this new type of amyloid originates from beta 2-microglobulin, a low-molecular-weight serum protein that is not filtered by standard dialysis membranes.
