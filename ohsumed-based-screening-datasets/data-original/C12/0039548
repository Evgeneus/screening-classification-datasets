Renal cell carcinoma in children.
 Six cases of renal cell carcinoma in children between seven and nineteen years of age are reported.
 These patients differ from those with Wilms tumor chiefly in the age of presentation and response to chemotherapy.
 Radiographically, renal cell carcinoma cannot be distinguished from Wilms tumor.
 While the natural history of renal cell carcinoma appears to be similar in children and adults, it may have a more favorable prognosis below the age of ten years.
