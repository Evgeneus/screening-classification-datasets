Extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction for renovascular hypertension.
 Extracorporeal reconstruction can be applied to the successful repair of stenoses in the distal renal artery and its hilar branches.
 This study evaluates the short- and long-term results of extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction in 65 patients, including 5 children, with renovascular hypertension who were treated from 1974 through 1989.
 The mean age of the patients was 37 years (range, 7 to 67 years).
 The cause of the stenoses was arteriosclerosis in 8 patients, fibrodysplasia in 54 patients, and miscellaneous in 3.
 Hypertension was severe before treatment with a mean blood pressure of 187/147 mm Hg that was reduced to a mean of 159/102 mm Hg after medical therapy.
 Ten patients had renal dysfunction.
 Results were evaluated both at short-term intervals (mean, 7.9 months; 64 patients) and long-term intervals (mean, 5.9 years; 60 patients), after surgery.
 Blood pressure responses were classified as beneficial (cured/improved) or failures.
 Anatomic results were evaluated by angiography in 98% of the patients at the short-term interval and in 77% of the patients at the long-term interval.
 Extracorporeal renal artery surgery was performed on 78 kidneys among 65 patients (unilateral, 45 patients; bilateral, 13 patients; unilateral extracorporeal and contralateral in situ, 7 patients).
 In most of the cases autologous arterial graft was used for reconstruction.
 Early in the series one patient died as a result of the operative procedure (1/65, 1.5%).
 A beneficial blood pressure response occurred in 53 patients (53/65; 82%) at the short-term interval and in 49 patients (49/61; 80%) at the long-term interval, with the average blood pressure at the short-term interval being 138/85 mm Hg and at the long-term interval being 139/85 mm Hg.
 Renal function improved in all patients with preoperative renal dysfunction.
 Graft stenosis or occlusion of the main renal artery was neither observed at the short-term interval nor at the long-term interval.
 However, residual stenoses were observed in 9 of the 163 reconstructed distal branches (5.5%).
 Extracorporeal renal artery reconstruction with autologous arterial grafts can be effectively applied to lesions of the distal main renal artery and its hilar branches with durable functional results.
