Impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation in isolated thoracic aorta of rats with daunomycin-induced nephrosis.
 A single i.v.
 injection of daunomycin (10 mg/kg) into rats produced severe proteinuria and hypercholesterolemia without atherosclerosis on the 20th and 40th days after the treatment.
 However, these changes were not observed on the 5th day.
 No change in systolic blood pressure was seen through the 40-day experimental period.
 Relaxation to acetylcholine, A23187 and nitroprusside was examined in aortic rings precontracted with phenylephrine (3 x 10(-6) M).
 Acetylcholine-induced relaxation was significantly attenuated in the nephrotic rats on the 20th and 40th days, in comparison to the control animals.
 In aortic rings taken from control and nephrotic rats on the 40th day, removal of the endothelium or treatment with methylene blue (10(-5) M) completely abolished the relaxation induced by acetylcholine (10(-5) M).
 In addition, acetylcholine (10(-5) M) induced a transient increase in the aortic cyclic GMP and this increase was completely abolished by removal of the endothelium.
 In the preparations of nephrotic rats on the 20th and 40th days, the cyclic GMP levels stimulated by acetylcholine (10(-5) M) were decreased to about 50% in comparison to their respective control.
 A23187 also evoked diminished relaxation in nephrotic rats on the 20th and 40th days.
 However, on the 40th day after the treatment, the effects of nitroprusside in relaxing the aorta and in elevating the cyclic GMP level in the aorta were not altered by nephrosis.
 In addition, the nitroprusside-induced relaxation and cyclic GMP accumulation were not affected by removal of the endothelium.
 These results indicate that endothelium-dependent relaxation is attenuated with the development of nephrosis.
