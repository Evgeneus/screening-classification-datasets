Remission of hepatitis B-associated membranous glomerulonephritis in human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has been associated with several renal diseases, the most common being membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN).
 The role of concurrent human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in affecting the course of the renal involvement is largely unknown.
 We report the case of a HIV-infected adult male with chronic HBV-associated MGN who had complete remission of the nephrotic syndrome associated with spontaneous seroconversion from hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive to HBeAg-negative.
 The present case illustrates that HIV infection does not preclude improvement of chronic HBV infection or an associated membranous nephropathy.
 Such improvement may be dependent on the ability of the host immune system to clear HBeAg.
