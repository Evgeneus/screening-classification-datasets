Combination of Anandron with orchiectomy in treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. Results of a double-blind study.
 A multicenter, randomized double-blind study was carried out in 203 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, in order to compare the efficacy of complete suppression of androgens achieved with surgical castration and nilutamide (Anandron), 100 mg t.i.d.
 The combined therapy was well-tolerated by patients, and they noted a better relief of bone pain after six months than those in the control group.
 There was a greater number of favorable responses in the combined treatment group.
 In addition, despite a similar median progression-free actuarial rate, the combined treatment (nilutamide plus orchiectomy) offered an improved survival time over orchiectomy alone.
