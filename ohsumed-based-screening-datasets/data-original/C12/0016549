Management of spinal cord compression secondary to metastatic prostatic carcinoma.
 Spinal cord or cauda equina compression from prostatic cancer is an oncologic emergency necessitating prompt evaluation and treatment.
 The strong correlation between pretreatment motor status and treatment outcome underscores the importance of immediate treatment before further neurologic deterioration and before the damage to the spinal cord becomes permanent.
 Patients with known osseous metastases should be alerted by their clinicians to seek medical help within hours should they develop weakness in an extremity.
 Prompt MRI of the entire spine should be done prior to treatment.
 Myelography should be reserved for those patients who cannot undergo a technically adequate or expeditious MRI study.
 The convenience of MRI relative to myelography allows clinicians to diagnose actual or impending spinal cord compression earlier.
 High-dose steroids (dexamethasone) should be instituted immediately, and endocrine therapy should be started if not already in use.
 Ambulatory and moderately paraparetic patients seem best treated initially with radiation alone.
 Immediate surgical decompression should be used in patients with an expected lifespan of at least 6 months who deteriorate during radiation, who have had previous radiation to the involved site, or who have a potentially correctable unstable spine.
 In addition, paraplegic patients or severely paraparetic patients with recent neurologic deterioration should be treated with immediate surgical decompression if they are judged reasonably able to tolerate the surgery.
 These patients should then receive postoperative radiation treatment.
