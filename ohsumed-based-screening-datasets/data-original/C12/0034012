Regression of reactive systemic amyloidosis due to ankylosing spondylitis following the administration of colchicine.
 We describe a patient in whom nephrotic syndrome due to renal amyloidosis occurred 4 years into the course of severe ankylosing spondylitis with peripheral joint and extraarticular involvement.
 Treatment with colchicine was accompanied by reversal of proteinuria, and histologic regression of amyloid deposits was documented from bone marrow obtained from the femoral heads during total hip arthroplasties staged 1 year apart.
