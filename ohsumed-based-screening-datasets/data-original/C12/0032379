Continuous intra-arterial administration of recombinant interleukin-2 in low-stage bladder cancer. A phase IB study.
 Toxicity and clinical effects of intra-arterial (IA) continuous infusion of recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) were evaluated in twelve patients with low-stage transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder (T1NOMO; G1 to G2).
 rIL-2 dosages were escalated from 18 x 10(3) to 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d in four groups of three patients.
 After two 5-day courses, separated by a 48-hour interval, evaluation of clinical response and transurethral resection (TUR) were carried out.
 World Health Organization (WHO) Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 2 of 12 patients (hypotension/mental confusion and fever, respectively); all side effects rapidly disappeared after infusion was abandoned.
 No laboratory toxicity developed in any patient.
 Two pathologically proven complete responses (CR) were achieved using 18 x 10(4) IU/m2/d, and three partial responses (PR) were achieved using 18 x 10(5) IU/m2/d in two patients and 18 x 10(6) IU/m2/d in one patient, giving an overall response rate of 42%.
 All objective responses are still ongoing after a mean follow-up time of 23 months (range, 12 to 32 months).
 Local relapses occurred 3 months after TUR only in two nonresponders.
