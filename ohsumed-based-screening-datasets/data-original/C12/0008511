Clinical experience implanting an inflatable penile prosthesis with controlled-expansion cylinder.
 Ninety-four patients with erectile dysfunction underwent implantation of controlled-expansion inflatable penile prosthetic cylinders.
 Most of these patients had aneurysmal dilatation of the corpora cavernosa after prior implantation of inflatable devices.
 Follow-up of forty-six months has shown their efficacy to be excellent for management of primary impotence, penile straightening procedures, and revision after cylinder leaks.
 None of the patients has had recurrence of the primary condition that required revision.
