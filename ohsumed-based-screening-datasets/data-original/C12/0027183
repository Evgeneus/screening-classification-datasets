Neurogenic bladder simplified.
 Neurogenic bladder dysfunction, if not properly diagnosed and treated, can lead to rapid deterioration of renal function by compromise of the upper urinary tracts.
 Two major categories of neurogenic bladder (detrusor hyperreflexia areflexia) have been discussed including the pathophysiology of the voiding dysfunction and the typical radiographic findings.
 Radiologists studying patients with suprasacral cord lesions should be aware of the causes, symptoms, and treatment of autonomic dysreflexia.
 Although video urodynamics is the state-of-the-art modality for evaluating complex or refractory neurogenic bladder, the practicing radiologist with an understanding of this condition can detect many radiographic changes in the lower urinary tract that suggest neurogenic dysfunction of various types.
