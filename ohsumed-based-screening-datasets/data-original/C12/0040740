Neurophysiology of the striated urethral sphincter in multiple sclerosis.
 Urethrovesical dysfunction is common in patients with multiple sclerosis.
 We present the results of urodynamic and neurophysiological studies in a series of 24 patients with multiple sclerosis associated with urinary symptoms.
 Urethral sphincter electromyography showed only minor abnormalities but studies of central conduction demonstrated abnormal sensory conduction in 88% and abnormal motor conduction in 80% of the patients studied.
 These abnormalities of central conduction correlated well with the urodynamic findings.
