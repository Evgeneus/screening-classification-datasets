The management of transitional cell carcinoma in solitary renal units.
 Ten patients with urothelial malignancies involving a solitary functioning renal unit were treated at our center for an average of 24 months or until death.
 These patients were all managed by parenchyma-sparing methods, including percutaneous as well as ureteroscopic tumor resection.
 Of our patients 9 have received adjunctive chemotherapy in the form of bacillus Calmette-Guerin instillations.
 At the time of this report 5 of our patients were alive without evidence of disease, 4 were alive with evidence of either residual or recurrent neoplasia and 1 was dead of disease 5 years after original presentation.
 Patients with higher grade tumors or carcinoma in situ did less well than patients with low grade disease.
 We present an analysis of our experience with this complex patient population and discuss the implications of these data within the context of a growing literature on the topic of upper tract urothelial malignancy.
