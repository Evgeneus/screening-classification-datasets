Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and intrauterine insemination for treatment of infertility 
 Empirical therapy for subfertility using assisted reproductive technologies recently has gained popularity; however, the cost-effectiveness of these therapies, compared with an untreated control group, has not been established.
 Similarly, there has been no comparative cost analysis of the utility of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI in the management of the same condition.
 Significant PRs in untreated couples with subfertility mandate the design and execution of controlled trials to ascertain the role of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI in infertility therapy.
 Various disorders of subfertility have been treated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI.
 The rationale for this therapy is the increase in gamete density at the site of fertilization, as with GIFT and IVF when used for management of the same problems.
 The live birth rate per initiated cycle and risk of complications are similar to results recently reported for GIFT and IVF.
 The utility of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI still remains controversial.
 When the relatively low direct and indirect costs of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation and IUI are considered, acknowledging the lack of prospective, controlled studies, this procedure appears to be at least as cost-effective as GIFT and IVF.
