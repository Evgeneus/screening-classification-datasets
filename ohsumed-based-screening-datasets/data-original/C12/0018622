Percutaneous nephrolithotomy and the solitary kidney.
 We reviewed 53 patients with stones in a solitary kidney who had undergone percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
 Previous surgery on that kidney had been performed in 35.8%, and 50.9% had other medical conditions including 26.4% who had impaired renal function.
 Staghorn or partial staghorn calculi were present in 52.9% and an additional 18.8% had multiple stones.
 Postoperative complications in 18.8% of the patients included sepsis, the need for transfusion and 1 death of bronchopneumonia.
 Percutaneous nephrolithotomy alone resulted in a 77.3% rate free of stone or fragments of 2 mm, or less.
 This rate increased to 86.8% with the addition of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy or open surgery (2 patients).
 Only 1 patient suffered long-term deterioration in renal function.
 Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is a safe procedure in the solitary kidney.
 It should be considered in those patients with complex stone burdens and impaired renal function when reduction in stone bulk and improved renal function may allow other treatment modalities to be used.
