Effect of radiation combined with hyperthermia on human prostatic carcinoma cell lines in culture.
 The effect of radiation combined with heat on three human prostatic carcinoma cell lines growing in vitro was investigated.
 Cells were exposed to different radiation doses followed by heat treatment at 43 degrees C for one hour.
 Heat treatment, given ten minutes after radiation, significantly enhanced the radiation response of all the cell lines studied.
 The combined effect of radiation and heat produced greater cytotoxicity than predicted from the additive effects of the two individual treatment modalities alone.
 These results indicate that a combined treatment regimen of radiation plus hyperthermia (43 degrees, 1 hr) might be an important tool in maintaining a better local control of prostatic cancer.
