Dilatation of the prostatic urethra with 35 mm balloon.
 A series of 54 men, 25 with acute urinary retention and 29 with cytometrically proven bladder outflow obstruction (BOO), underwent dilatation of the prostatic urethra using a 35 mm fixed diameter, low compliance balloon.
 In 42 patients this was performed under cystoscopic guidance and in 12 patients under fluoroscopic control.
 Three months following dilatation, 13/27 patients (48%) with BOO who returned for review were rendered unobstructed and 19/27 (70%) were symptomatically improved.
 By 6 months only 3 remained unobstructed but 15 remained symptomatically improved.
 Nine months after dilatation 14 patients retained symptomatic improvement but only 2 remained unobstructed.
 Of the 25 patients treated for acute retention only 6 voided spontaneously, 1 of these relapsing into retention at 2 months and another at 4 months.
 No patient was rendered unobstructed but 2 patients (who declined prostatectomy) noted an improvement in their obstructive symptoms at both 3 and 6 months.
 No patient developed retrograde ejaculation following dilatation.
 Balloon dilatation to 35 mm has no role in acute urinary retention but may have a role in younger men with BOO who wish to avoid prostatectomy and the risk of retrograde ejaculation.
 In these patients careful follow-up is required.
