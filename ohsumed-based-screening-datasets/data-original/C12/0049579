Effector mechanisms in organ-specific autoimmunity. I. Characterization of a CD8+ T cell line that mediates murine interstitial nephritis.
 To further investigate mechanisms of cell-mediated tissue destruction in an organ-specific autoimmune disease, we have established and characterized a nephritogenic CD8+ T cell line.
 This target antigen-specific effector T cell line, M52, was derived from bulk populations of CD8+ T cells isolated from susceptible animals immunized to produce anti-tubular basement membrane (alpha TBM) disease.
 Our studies show that M52 retains the phenotypic and functional characteristics of nephritogenic T cells induced in vivo.
 M52 mediates antigen-specific delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to the target antigen 3M-1, it is cytotoxic to 3M-1-expressing renal tubular epithelial cells in vitro, and it adoptively transfers interstitial nephritis to naive syngeneic recipients.
 Clonal analysis of these nephritogenic CD8+ T cells reveals distinct functional phenotypes within the M52 cell line.
 We have isolated a cytotoxic CD8+ clone, M52.26, which is not DTH-reactive to 3M-1, and multiple DTH-reactive clones which mediate less efficient cytotoxicity to 3M-1-expressing target cells.
 Cytofluorographic analysis of four randomly selected clones reveals alpha beta T cell receptor expression.
 Further characterization of these functionally distinct CD8+ T cell clones will help to define their respective roles in mediating tubular epithelial cell injury and the inflammatory lesion of autoimmune interstitial nephritis.
