Elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and mild fetal uropathy.
 Sixty-one consecutive patients referred because of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) levels and 80 referred for second-trimester ultrasound for other reasons were examined.
 Ultrasound examination of the genitourinary tract and assignment of phenotypic sex was done by ultrasonographers blinded to the MSAFP results.
 Among male fetuses with elevated MSAFP, 33% had pyelectasis compared with only 5% of controls.
 Among female fetuses, pyelectasis was seen in 16% of cases and no controls.
 Increased MSAFP not caused by an open neural tube defect may be seen in conjunction with mild benign uropathy in the second trimester.
