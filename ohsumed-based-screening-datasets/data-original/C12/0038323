The use of intravesical oxybutynin chloride in children with neurogenic bladder.
 Intravesical oxybutynin chloride was administered to 10 children with neurogenic bladder (myelomeningocele in 9 and imperforate anus in 1) and urinary incontinence refractory to regimens of intermittent catheterization and oral anticholinergic medication.
 Therapy consisted of instillation of 5 mg.
 crushed oxybutynin chloride in 10 cc sterile saline twice daily.
 Of the children 5 (50%) became completely dry day and night, 3 (30%) achieved daytime continence alone, and 2 did not improve clinically and remained in diapers.
 Urodynamic study revealed increases in bladder capacity up to 335% over baseline and decreases of maximum filling pressures to 63%.
 No local or systemic side effects were noted.
 Surgical bladder augmentation was avoided in those who clinically responded to this therapy.
