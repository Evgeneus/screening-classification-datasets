Pedicle patch urethroplasty.
 The pedicle patch urethroplasty provides an alternative single-stage vascularised graft procedure for the repair of moderately severe hypospadias.
 Over a 7-year period, 38 primary hypospadias repairs were performed employing this technique.
 The fistula rate was 18% in the 34 patients reviewed, but there were few other significant complications.
 The operation is recommended when the urethral plate can be preserved and the penis straightened in boys who are unsuitable for a meatal-based flap.
