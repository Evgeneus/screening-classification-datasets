Mobile extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy.
 During the last 18 months, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) has been provided at Epsom District Hospital using a mobile unit containing a Dornier HM4 lithotriptor.
 Patients with upper ureteric and renal stones were selected for treatment, which was performed without anaesthesia or sedation as a day-case procedure; 83 patients were treated, 5 of them with bilateral stones.
 Seventy patients required 1 treatment session, 17 required 2 and 1 patient required 3.
 There were no serious complications but 3 patients needed ureteroscopy to remove obstructing stones.
 The overall success rate was 86%.
 The cost to treat each NHS patient was 253 pounds.
 Mobile lithotripsy as a day-case procedure is a safe and cost-effective means of treating urolithiasis and can be performed in a District General Hospital.
