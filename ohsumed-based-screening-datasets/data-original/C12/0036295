Pelvic muscle exercise for stress urinary incontinence in elderly women.
 PURPOSE: To compare pelvic muscle exercise to pharmacologic treatment of stress urinary incontinence, the most common cause of urine leakage reported by community-living elderly women.
 SUBJECTS: Convenience sample of 157 community-living women, aged 55 to 90 years, after completion of a comprehensive diagnostic evaluation.
 METHODS: Eighty-two subjects were randomly assigned to the exercise protocol (with a 34% attrition rate).
 Pelvic muscle exercises were taught and monitored for 6 months.
 Phenylpropanolamine hydrochloride was given to the other group in a dose of 50 mg a day, increasing to 50 mg twice a day.
 MAIN RESULTS: Treatment outcomes (subjective improvement, self recorded frequency of wetting) were equally satisfactory in both groups.
 The response to exercises was as good in 5 months as in 6.
 It was also as good when the minimum recommended number of exercises per day was 80 as when it was 125.
 CONCLUSIONS: Among those completing the protocol, pelvic exercises were beneficial in reducing stress incontinence, and the benefit was comparable to that produced by phenylpropanolamine.
