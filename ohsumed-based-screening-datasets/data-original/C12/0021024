Artificial urinary sphincters around intestinal segments--are they safe?
 Artificial urinary sphincters (AUS) were implanted around intestinal segments to achieve urinary continence in 8 patients and faecal continence in 1.
 In 6 patients the cuff was placed around the lower end of the cystoplasty following bladder neck (5) or urethral (1) erosion.
 Four are completely dry, 1 on self-intermittent catheterisation (SIC).
 One has mild stress incontinence.
 In 1 patient the cuff eroded at 8 months.
 Two patients had cuffs implanted parastomally to create continent diversion.
 One is satisfactory on SIC and the other had her AUS explanted because of life-threatening metabolic acidosis.
 The rectal cuff was explanted because of faecal impaction above the cuff.
 As an absolute last resort, placing an AUS round a cystoplasty appears little more hazardous than round bladder neck.
 The use of the AUS for continent diversion has not been pursued because of reliable techniques of non-prosthetic continent diversion.
 The current model of the AUS is unsuitable for the treatment of faecal incontinence.
