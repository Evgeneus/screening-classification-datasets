Gamete intrafallopian transfer by hysteroscopy as an alternative treatment for infertility.
 OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of the hysteroscopic cannulation by flexible catheter of the fallopian tubes for gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT).
 DESIGN: We studied the pregnancy rate (PR) and the safety of this new technique.
 SETTING: All patients were enlisted for GIFT at our Reproductive Medicine Unit.
 PATIENTS: We treated 26 patients whose infertility causes were terminal tubal damage, male factors, unexplained factors, and endometriosis.
 Patients with uterine tubal ostia unsuitable for gamete transfer or cervical incontinence were not included in the group.
 INTERVENTIONS: The patients underwent ovulation induction and oocyte retrieval by transvaginal ultrasonically guided puncture.
 The gamete transfers were carried out by hysteroscopic procedure using a flexible catheter put through the operating channel.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The efficacy was evaluated by the PR (25.9%).
 RESULTS: Seven clinical pregnancies were obtained, but two patients aborted during the first weeks of pregnancy.
 No ectopic pregnancies were observed.
 CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that hysteroscopic GIFT is an alternative, safe, effective, and not invasive technique for fertility problems.
