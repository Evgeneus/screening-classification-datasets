Angioplasty of renal arteries: a report of ten year's experience.
 Report of PTA of renal arteries in 288 patients.
 Primary results show good to optimal dilatation of the arteries (60.6% to 78.6%).
 One third of all cases achieved optimal blood pressures.
 In about 40% antihypertensive drugs had to be administered, in about 30% blood pressure remained unchanged although PTA was effective.
 PTA of renal arteries is the best method of treating renal hypertension, also because of the low rate of complications.
