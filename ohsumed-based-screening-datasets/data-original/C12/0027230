Intracavernous pharmacotherapy in psychogenic impotence.
 Twenty-five men with psychogenic impotence but without serious psychopathology were considered for intracavernosal therapy with papaverine hydrochloride and phentolamine mesylate.
 A total of 20 proved suitable and began self-injection in conjunction with sex therapy; 8 patients had return of spontaneous erections without pharmacotherapy, although one of them needs to keep the medication in his refrigerator.
 The other 12 patients are continuing self-injection therapy.
 Psychotherapy with self-injection may be helpful in the management of psychogenic erectile impotence.
