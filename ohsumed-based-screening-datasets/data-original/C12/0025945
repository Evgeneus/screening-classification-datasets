Renal functional reserve in long-term survivors of unilateral Wilms tumor.
 We hypothesized that long-term survivors of unilateral Wilms tumor would have a decreased renal functional reserve secondary to the consequences of hyperfiltration in the nephrons of the remaining kidney.
 Therefore we evaluated the renal functional reserve in 12 long-term survivors of Wilms tumor after unilateral nephrectomy (mean +/- SE: 15 +/- 1.1 years; range 9 to 23 years).
 We measured the creatinine clearance before and after an acute, oral protein load to determine the renal functional reserve.
 Study subjects and control subjects were matched for age, gender, and body surface area.
 The basal creatinine clearances were similar (Wilms group 132 +/- 13 vs control group 142 +/- 11 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = not significant (NS].
 There was no significant difference in the renal functional reserve between long-term survivors of Wilms tumor and matched control subjects (Wilms group 17 +/- 11 vs control group 25 +/- 11 ml/min/1.73 m2; p = NS).
 The change in creatinine clearance was not secondary to volume expansion because the fractional excretion of sodium was unchanged with protein loading (Wilms group before loading 0.92 +/- 0.12 vs after loading 0.99 +/- 0.13 (p = NS); control group before loading 0.91 +/- 0.12 vs after loading 1.0 +/- 0.14 (p = NS)).
 We conclude that up to 15 years after nephrectomy for unilateral Wilms tumor in childhood, there is no evidence of hyperfiltration injury.
