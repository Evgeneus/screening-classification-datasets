Effect of LH-RH analogue in patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 Twelve prostatic hyperplasia patients with total urine retention and, consequently, a permanent catheter, were treated for six months with luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LH-RH) analogue having long-term effect.
 Seven of the 12 patients no longer needed a permanent catheter after the six-month treatment period.
 Transurethral resection of the prostate was performed for 3 patients.
 The remaining 2 patients continued to have a catheter.
 The mean prostatic volume, which was 83 g at the start of the study, fell by 51 percent, to 41 g.
 Treatment with LH-RH proved to be safe even for patients in poor physical condition, and it also seemed to improve symptoms of prostatic hyperplasia.
