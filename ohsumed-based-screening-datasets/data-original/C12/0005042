Radical prostatectomy for clinical stage T1-2N0M0 prostatic adenocarcinoma: long-term results.
 A total of 441 stage T1-2N0M0 and 11 stage T1-2N0M0 cancer patients with an elevated acid phosphatase level only, and 18 stage T1-2N+M0 cancer patients underwent radical prostatectomy.
 Analysis of the 441 stage T1-2N0M0 cancer patients demonstrated that failure and survival were a function of the disease being organ-confined, specimen-confined or margin-positive, with 10-year failure rates of 12, 30 and 60%, respectively.
 Of the patients with positive margins 44 were and 79 were not irradiated postoperatively.
 Postoperative radiation produced no survival advantage.
 No difference in interval to failure or of survival could be identified between 105 patients whose disease was diagnosed by transurethral resection and 328 who had a palpable abnormality.
 Eleven patients had negative bone and node findings but they had an elevated acid phosphatase level.
 All 8 patients not treated with immediate androgen deprivation failed within 36 months.
