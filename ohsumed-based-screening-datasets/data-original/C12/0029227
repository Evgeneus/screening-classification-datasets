Pneumoscrotum after spontaneous pneumothorax with air leak.
 A case of pneumoscrotum associated with a chest wall air leak following placement of a chest tube for spontaneous pneumothorax is reported.
 The patient recovered uneventfully once the air leak surrounding the tube was successfully closed at the entry wound.
 Two previous cases have described pneumoscrotum occurring after colonoscopy and after diagnostic peritoneoscopy.
 All 3 (previous and current) cases report the associated development of subcutaneous and retroperitoneal emphysema, which provides a possible etiological mechanism for this entity.
