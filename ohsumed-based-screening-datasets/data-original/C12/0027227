Evolution of endoscopic urethropexy: seven-year experience with various techniques.
 The surgical techniques for correction of stress urinary incontinence continues to evolve particularly those utilizing the endoscopic approach.
 Various forms of endoscopic urethropexy have been performed in 142 women with a minimum of one-year follow-up.
 The cure rate for the entire series was 94 percent.
 In the last two years the no-incision technique was used whenever feasible (31 patients) with an identical cure rate of 94 percent.
 Varying degrees of urinary retention occurred in 58 percent and was even more prevalent following the no-incision technique (68%).
 Owing to the high incidence of urinary retention a punch suprapubic cystostomy is now used in most patients.
 We conclude that endoscopic urethropexy is an effective means of correcting stress urinary incontinence.
 The no-incision technique is associated with even less morbidity and a reduction in hospital stay without compromising the outcome.
