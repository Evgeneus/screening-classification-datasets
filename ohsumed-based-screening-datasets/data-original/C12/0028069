von Hippel-Lindau disease: inadequacy of angiography for identification of renal cancers.
 Selective renal angiograms were retrospectively evaluated for the identification of renal cell cancers in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL).
 Seven patients underwent angiography and surgery because of solid or complex renal masses identified at cross-sectional imaging.
 Nine kidneys underwent detailed examination by the surgeon and by a pathologist.
 There were 31 renal cancers.
 Angiography had enabled identification of only five cancers (16%), and six others (19%) had been suspected.
 Cancers detected angiographically were larger than those not detected (P less than .05).
 Solid tumors tended to appear less hypervascular than expected and occasionally had the angiographic appearance of atypical cysts.
 There were no false-positive angiograms.
 Angiography revealed only one cancer not previously suspected and changed the surgeon's approach for only one kidney (11%).
 The sensitivity and specificity of angiography were 35% and 100%, respectively.
 In these patients, selective renal angiography is not helpful for the detection or exclusion of cancer in a kidney.
 It does not have a limited role for vascular mapping prior to partial nephrectomy or tumor enucleation.
