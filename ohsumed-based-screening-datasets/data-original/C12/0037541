Treatment of pharmacological priapism with phenylephrine.
 Pharmacological prolonged erections or priapism due to anesthesia were treated in 36 patients with intracorporeal injections of phenylephrine.
 Detumescence was obtained rapidly in every case and no marked side effect was reported.
 Considering the possible toxicity of other adrenergic agents, phenylephrine is strongly recommended in the treatment of priapism.
