Neo-adjuvant (pre-emptive) cisplatin therapy in invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 Following 2 pilot studies which showed 57 and 61% response rates to intravenous cisplatin for transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder prior to definitive treatment, the West Midlands Urological Research Group (WMURG) and the Australian Bladder Cancer Study Group (ABCSG) independently began randomised trials to test the survival benefit of neo-adjuvant intravenous cisplatin prior to radiotherapy in T2-T4 M0 transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 Both trials failed to recruit their target numbers of 250 patients in the West Midlands and 320 in Australia.
 Since they had similar treatment protocols and eligibility criteria, they were combined in an overview analysis, achieving a total number of 255 patients.
 Each treatment group was compared with its own control group and the differences were pooled to give an overall result.
 There was no difference in survival between treated and control patients.
 The odds ratio was 1.13 with the control groups faring marginally better than the chemotherapy groups.
 Even with 255 patients the 95% confidence interval of the odds ratio was wide (0.80-1.57).
 Although there is no clear evidence of a clinically worthwhile benefit from neo-adjuvant cisplatin, this approach must be tested in a larger study using combination treatments with greater activity in metastatic disease.
