Randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial on treatment of frequency, urgency and incontinence related to detrusor hyperactivity: oxybutynin versus propantheline versus placebo.
 Clinical efficacy and adverse effects of oxybutynin and propantheline in the treatment of symptoms related to detrusor hyperactivity were studied in a randomized, controlled, double-blind multicenter trial.
 Of 169 patients entered into the study 154 were evaluable for statistical analysis.
 Mean grade of improvement (visual analogue scale) was significantly higher with oxybutynin (58.2%) versus propantheline (44.7%) and placebo (43.4%).
 Mean bladder volume at first involuntary cystometric contraction was significantly increased with oxybutynin (+57.0 ml.) versus placebo (-9.7 ml.).
 Mean maximum cystometric bladder capacity was also significantly increased with oxybutynin (+80.1 ml.) versus placebo (+22.5 ml.).
 Rate of inquired possible adverse effects was significantly higher for oxybutynin (63%) versus propantheline (44%) and placebo (33%).
 However, only 5 patients dropped out of the study because of adverse effects (oxybutynin 2 and propantheline 3).
 No serious or lasting adverse effects were encountered with dryness of the mouth being the major complaint.
 Oxybutynin has statistically significant effects on subjective symptoms and objective urodynamic parameters in patients with detrusor hyperactivity compared to propantheline.
