Pheochromocytoma of the urinary bladder.
 A case of pheochromocytoma of the bladder involving a ureteral orifice is presented, with a review of the literature.
 We discuss general management principles of bladder pheochromocytoma and factors specific to the management of our case, which allowed complete removal of the benign tumor while preserving bladder and ureteral function.
 Imaging modalities for localizing extraadrenal pheochromocytomas are reviewed.
