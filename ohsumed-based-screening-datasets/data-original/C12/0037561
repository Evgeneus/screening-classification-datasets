Ureteronephroscopic marsupialization of obstructing peripelvic renal cyst.
 Flexible ureteronephroscopy has been used for numerous therapeutic applications in the upper urinary tract.
 We report a case of a large peripelvic renal cyst causing obstruction to the ureteropelvic junction, which was treated by incising the wall of the cyst into the renal pelvis with the ureteronephroscope.
