Effects of prostatectomy on sexual function.
 We evaluated the effects of prostatectomy on sexual function in 210 patients, 49.6 percent of whom underwent transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), and the remainder had suprapubic transvesical prostatectomy (SPP).
 Pre- and postoperative interviews with detailed questionnaires were utilized.
 Postoperative sexual dysfunction was reported by 18 of 152 patients (11.8%) who were functioning normally prior to surgery.
 The incidence of postoperative impotence was evenly distributed between the TURP and SPP groups and was age-related; it was highest among older patients.
 We further observed a strong correlation between the presence of a permanent sexual partner and the preservation of potency.
 We conclude that the risk of postoperative impotence is dependent on both the patient's age and the presence of a partner, and should be discussed with the patient preoperatively.
