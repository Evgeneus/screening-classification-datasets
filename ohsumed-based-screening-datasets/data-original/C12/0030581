Urinary retention after pyeloplasty.
 A retrospective review of 37 pyeloplasties, performed between 1984 and 1988, revealed that 38% of patients had post-operative retention requiring catheterisation, compared with 8% in an age and sex matched group of patients undergoing cholecystectomy.
 This suggests that direct surgical trauma to the upper genitourinary system may inhibit bladder function.
 We therefore suggest that pre-operative catheterisation should be considered in theatre, for patients undergoing pyeloplasty.
