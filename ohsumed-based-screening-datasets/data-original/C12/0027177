Current status of imaging indeterminate renal masses.
 In 1986 Bosniak proposed a classification of cysts and cystic renal masses in an attempt to define precisely the radiologic findings for lesions not requiring further evaluation and for those that should be explored surgically in an attempt to salvage normal renal parenchyma.
 This classification has been extremely useful in expanding the number of patients treated conservatively.
 The following entities can be considered benign and require no further evaluation: the classic simple cyst (Bosniak category 1), a cyst with benign calcification (see Fig.
 1A and B), a hyperdense cyst (see Fig.
 2), and a cyst with thin (less than or equal to 1mm) septations (see Fig.
 5A; Bosniak category 2).
 When any of the following features are present, further evaluation is warranted: aggressive calcifications (see Fig.
 1C-E), abnormal density not fulfilling the criteria of a hyperdense cyst (see Figs.
 3 and 4), or nodular septations (see Fig.
 5B and C), or wall thickening (see Fig.
 7; Bosniak) category 3).
 Small masses that cannot be characterized accurately also require further evaluation.
 Multiloculated masses(see Fig.
 9) require surgery (Bosniak category 3).
 Most cases of multiple localized renal cysts can be distinguished from multiloculated masses and do not require surgery (see Fig.
 10).
 Evaluation of cyst fluid by MR imaging has not been proved reliable in differentiating benign and malignant masses.
 MR imaging will become more useful when its spatial resolution equals that of CT.
 Masses that remain indeterminate after careful evaluation by ultrasonography and CT scanning can be evaluated additionally by angiography or cyst puncture.
 Management options for persistent enigmatic masses include follow-up radiologic studies, exploration, local excision, and nephrectomy.
