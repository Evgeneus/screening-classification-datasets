Intraplatelet serotonin, beta-thromboglobulin, and histamine concentrations and thromboxane A2 synthesis in renal disease.
 Intraplatelet serotonin (5-HT), beta-thromboglobulin (beta-TG), and histamine content as well as platelet total thromboxane A2 (TXA2) synthesizing capacity were measured in 53 patients with chronic renal disease: nephrotic syndrome (n = 18); end-stage renal failure (ESRF; n = 13); continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD; n = 9); hemodialysis (HD; n = 13).
 These indices of platelet function were correlated with plasma total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG) concentrations.
 When compared with controls, intraplatelet 5-HT was significantly reduced in all patient groups studied and beta-TG was diminished in all patient groups except CAPD.
 Total platelet TXA2 synthesizing capacity was increased in ESRF and HD groups.
 Intraplatelet histamine content was not altered in any of the patient groups studied.
 There was a significant inverse correlation between intraplatelet 5-HT content on the one hand and plasma TC, LDL-C, and TG on the other.
 The depletion of intraplatelet 5-HT and beta-TG and the increase in total TXA2 synthesizing capacity are consistent with platelet activation in chronic renal disease.
 The correlation between these indices of platelet activation and TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG suggests that changes in the concentrations of these lipids may contribute to the activation of platelets in these conditions.
