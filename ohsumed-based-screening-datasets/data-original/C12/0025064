Effect of magnesium on calcium oxalate urolithiasis.
 Previous studies have shown that hypomagnesuria induced by magnesium deficient diet causes calcium oxalate crystal deposition in renal tubules of hyperoxaluric rats and administration of magnesium to these rats results in prevention of calcium oxalate crystallization in their kidneys.
 Based on these studies magnesium was claimed to be beneficial for calcium oxalate stone patients.
 However, hypomagnesuria is not a common phenomenon.
 To better understand the role of magnesium as an inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystallization in urine, we studied the effect of magnesium on calcium oxalate urolithiasis in rats on a regular diet and a hyperoxaluric protocol.
 Excess magnesium was administered to male rats on regular diet and a lithogenic protocol.
 Magnesium administration to hyperoxaluric rats did not result in significant changes in urinary excretion of calcium or oxalate or in calcium oxalate relative supersaturation.
 Urinary excretion of citrate was also not significantly altered.
 Some animals from both groups, those on magnesium therapy and those not on magnesium therapy had crystals deposited in their renal tubules.
 We conclude that excess magnesium has no significant effect on calcium oxalate urolithiasis in normomagnesuric conditions.
