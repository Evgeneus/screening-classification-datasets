The influence of hemodialysis on intraocular pressure: III. Aqueous humor dynamics and tissue hydration.
 Intraocular pressure, aqueous flow, outflow facility, outflow resistance, and both corneal and lens thickness were measured in patients receiving regular hemodialysis three times a week to test for induced variations of these parameters.
 No statistically significant differences occurred in any of the measurements taken.
 This study confirms that patients undergoing hemodialysis are not susceptible to glaucomatous disease.
