Evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary thyroid abnormalities in children with end-stage renal disease 
 Patients with end-stage renal disease may have abnormalities of growth and of gonadal and thyroid hormones, so we attempted to determine the mechanisms that may be involved in the altered thyroid function.
 We evaluated serum thyroid hormone levels, their changes immediately after hemodialysis, the serum thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) response to thyrotropin releasing hormone, and the circadian pattern of serum TSH in nine children with end-stage renal disease who were between 7 1/2 years and 17 years 1 month of age.
 Seven patients had been receiving hemodialysis for a median of 3.3 years; the other two were receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 Four patients had low serum total thyroxine (T4) values, and all nine had low free T4 values.
 Mean concentrations of total T4, free T4, and total triiodothyronine (T3), which were significantly less than normal before hemodialysis, returned to normal levels immediately after dialysis.
 Postdialysis thyroid hormone increases did not correlate with the decrease in weight or the increase in hematocrit observed immediately after dialysis.
 All but one patient had basal TSH levels within the normal range.
 Three patients had a deficient TSH response to thyrotropin releasing hormone, and the TSH response was prolonged in all of them.
 The mean (+/- SD) nocturnal TSH surge was 50 +/- 68%.
 Five of the eight patients studied had a nocturnal TSH surge below the normal range (95% confidence limits 47% to 300%).
 Serum free T4 values correlated with the TSH nocturnal surge (r, 0.73; p less than 0.05).
 Our findings support the hypothesis that some patients with end-stage renal disease have central hypothyroidism.
