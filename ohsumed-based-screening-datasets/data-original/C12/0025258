Hydroureteronephrosis after spinal cord injury. Effects of lower urinary tract dysfunction on upper tract anatomy.
 The hypothesis that upper tract changes in the absence of vesicoureteral reflux are a function of chronically elevated intravesical pressure has had increasing impact on the management of the lower urinary tract in patients with lower tract dysfunction secondary to neurogenic bladder disease.
 The application of our growing ability to measure bladder and bladder outlet function objectively and in a more physiologic manner through expanding urodynamic techniques will continue to provide information that can be applied to the diagnosis and treatment of lower urinary tract dysfunction and hydroureteronephrosis after spinal cord injury.
 Current methods of classifying lower urinary tract behavior have not provided the ability to identify accurately those patients at greatest risk for upper tract deterioration.
 The application of new techniques and the use of new measures may increase our ability to identify these patients.
