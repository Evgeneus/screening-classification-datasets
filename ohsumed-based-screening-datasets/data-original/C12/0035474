Identification of a low molecular weight inhibitor of osteoblast mitogenesis in uremic plasma.
 A low molecular weight inhibitor of cartilage sulfation has been detected in the plasma of dialysis patients.
 Preliminary studies of this inhibitor have suggested that it may have a role in decreasing bone mass, possibly by suppressing bone cell proliferation.
 Since the in vitro bioassay of crude sulfation inhibitor preparations is relatively nonspecific, we investigated whether there might also be an inhibitor of osteoblast mitogenesis in uremic plasma.
 We fractionated plasma and plasma ultrafiltrates from dialysis patients by gel filtration chromatography and looked for inhibition of mitogenesis in cultured osteoblasts.
 Material from fractions with a molecular weight range of 750 to 900 inhibited osteoblast mitogenesis.
 The inhibitory effect, however, could be overcome with serum or insulin-like growth factor-I, suggesting that the mechanism of inhibition was not growth factor dependent.
 Further characterization of the inhibitor revealed that it was not a peptide or a polar lipid.
 We conclude that uremic plasma contains a bone cell mitogenic inhibitor which may have a role in regulating bone remodeling in adults and bone growth in children.
