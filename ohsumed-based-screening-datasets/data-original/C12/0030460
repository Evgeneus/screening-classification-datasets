Pagetoid carcinomatous involvement of the penile urethra in association with high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.
 We present a case of pagetoid carcinomatous involvement of the penile urethra and periurethral glands following cystoprostatectomy for high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder.
 Previously reported cases with involvement of the urethra are reviewed.
 This condition is believed to be a rare variant of transitional cell carcinoma in situ.
