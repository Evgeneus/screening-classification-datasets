Drug-induced renal toxicity. Help in recognizing offending agents.
 Drug-induced kidney disease is common, especially in hospitalized patients, and prompt recognition of the various nephrotoxic syndromes is important because many are reversible.
 Risk factors should be assessed before patients are given an agent that may cause acute renal failure (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, aminoglycoside antibiotic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, radiocontrast agent).
 Discontinuation of the responsible drug is often the only necessary therapy.
