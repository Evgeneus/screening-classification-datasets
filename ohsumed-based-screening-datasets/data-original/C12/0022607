Pathogenesis of oxalate urolithiasis: lessons from experimental studies with rats.
 Calcium oxalate (CaOx) urolithiasis in rats is induced by producing hyperoxaluria.
 Depending on the degree and length of hyperoxaluria, CaOx crystals may either form in the nephron or the bladder and may or may not be retained in the kidneys.
 Crystals may nucleate in one part of the nephron and be retained in another part.
 Papillary collecting duct tubular epithelium and its basement membrane appear to be involved in crystal retention in the kidneys.
