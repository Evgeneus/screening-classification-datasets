Repair of pelvic fracture posterior urethral defects using an elaborated perineal approach: experience with 74 cases.
 A total of 74 patients with posterior urethral distraction defects (1.5 to 7 cm.
 long) that followed pelvic fracture was managed by a 1-stage perineal repair.
 End-to-end anastomosis was performed in all cases but in 66 a variety of surgical maneuvers were necessary to accomplish a tension-free anastomosis.
 These techniques, which included distal urethral mobilization, corporeal body separation, inferior pubectomy and supracrural urethral rerouting, were resorted to in a sequential manner as needed.
 Excellent results were achieved in 96% of the cases.
 These surgical techniques are described and discussed.
