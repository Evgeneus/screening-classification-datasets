Parathyroid autotransplantation 
 This paper reviews the technique, indications and results of parathyroid autotransplantation.
 Autotransplantation is most commonly indicated following parathyroidectomy for renal osteodystrophy, but can also be used in primary hyperplastic hyperparathyroidism, re-exploration of the neck and radical neck surgery.
 The success of the technique ranges from 75 to 100 per cent.
