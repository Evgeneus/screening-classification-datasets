A lethal complication of papaverine-induced priapism.
 A large series of patients was treated for impotence with intracorporeal injections of papaverine and phentolamine with no major complications and no deaths reported.
 We report on a 45-year-old black man with advanced multiple sclerosis who died after such therapy.
 When the first self-administered injection of phentolamine and papaverine failed to produce an adequate erection the patient injected a second dose that resulted in priapism and death of massive pulmonary embolism.
