Comparison of hemostasis with two high-flux hemocompatible dialysis membranes.
 Eight adults with chronic renal failure were dialyzed using polyacrylonitrile (AN 69) or polysulfone (PS) membranes with a high (HHR) or low (LHR) continuous non-fractionated heparin regimen--a total of either 90 or 50 IU/kg body weight.
 With the HHR, for a mean anti-Xa (aXa) activity of around 0.40 IU/ml, no plasma activation of coagulation was observed; fibrinopeptide A (FPA) was in agreement with the residual blood volume (RBV) and the state of the bubble trap, especially with the PS membrane.
 With the LHR, for a mean aXa below 0.21 IU/ml, there was only moderate activation of coagulation.
 The PS membrane gave different results from the AN 69 membrane, RBV values on the HHR and aXa being lower on both the HHR and LHR, with FPA values being regularly lower on the LHR.
 The decrease in plasma beta-TG on the LHR was more marked with the PS than with the AN 69 membrane due to loss on dialysis or adsorption, as shown by the arterio-venous difference.
 The increase in plasma PF4 was related to the effect of heparin.
 However, there was no platelet activation.
 On the LHR, platelet count and intraplatelet beta-TG and PF4 levels remained very stable.
 The two high-flux membranes were very hemocompatible and require only low doses of heparin, but the dialyzer with AN 69 membrane need its geometry improving.
