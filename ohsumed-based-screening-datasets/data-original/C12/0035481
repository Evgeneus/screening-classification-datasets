Beta 2-microglobulin deposition in bone in chronic renal failure.
 Recently, there have been reports of beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2 m) related amyloid deposition in perineural and periarticular tissues in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis, but it has been rarely described in bone.
 We, therefore, examined previously obtained bone biopsy specimens in patients receiving long-term hemodialysis to determine the prevalence of beta 2 m deposition in bone and to assess the relationship between beta 2 m deposits and bone histomorphometry.
 We found beta 2 m deposits in bone in 8% of 224 patients examined.
 Bone deposition of beta 2 m was absent in patients who were on dialysis for less than six years, but was present in 19% who dialyzed longer than 10 years.
 beta 2 m deposits were found in specimens from the iliac crest, femoral bone, tibia, vertebra and rib.
 In the iliac crest beta 2 m deposition was localized predominantly to the periosteum.
 Among these patients with beta 2 m in iliac crest periosteum, 62% had suffered a femoral neck fracture compared to only 4% of matched patients who had negative staining for beta 2 m in the iliac crest (P less than 0.001).
 Histologically, osteitis fibrosa seemed more common in patients positive for beta 2m than in patients negative for beta 2m deposition.
 We conclude that beta 2m deposition in bone is common in uremic patients who have received hemodialysis longer than 10 years.
 The high prevalence of femoral neck fracture in patients with beta 2m localized to the periosteum of the iliac crest suggests that this involvement may be useful to predict susceptibility to femoral fracture.
