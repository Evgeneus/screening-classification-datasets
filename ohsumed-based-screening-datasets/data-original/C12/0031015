IgA-IgM nephropathy. A subgroup of primary mesangial glomerulonephritis.
 The renal biopsy material of Tampere University Central Hospital comprises 1992 renal biopsy specimens, accessioned during the years 1978-1989.
 Among these, there were three cases of mesangial glomerulonephritis with a peculiar type of immunofluorescent reactivity.
 Striking mesangial deposits of both IgA and IgM were found in glomeruli, whereas C3 deposits were absent or present in slight amounts.
 The light microscopic findings ranged from mild mesangial glomerulonephritis to more advanced forms of sclerosing glomerulopathy.
 Electron microscopic examination disclosed an increase of mesangial matrix, together with mesangial and paramesangial electron-dense deposits.
 Two of the patients had microscopic hematuria associated with proteinuria, and one had isolated proteinuria.
 The authors propose that this group of cases may represent a new subgroup of primary mesangial glomerulonephritis that has not been described previously.
 They differ immunohistologically from both IgA nephropathy and IgM nephropathy, and therefore could be designated as IgA-IgM nephropathy.
