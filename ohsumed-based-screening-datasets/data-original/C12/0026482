Relationship between bladder morphology and long-term outcome of treatment in patients with high pressure chronic retention of urine.
 A group of 32 men undergoing bladder outflow surgery for high pressure chronic retention (HPCR) of urine were studied prospectively.
 At the time of treatment marked morphological changes in the bladder wall were demonstrated histologically, but after a mean follow-up of 42.9 months residual urine had decreased significantly and renal function had improved or stabilised in 28 patients (84%).
 Four patients deteriorated but in 3 of these another potential cause for loss of renal function was present.
 The majority of patients have a good long-term prognosis following treatment for HPCR.
