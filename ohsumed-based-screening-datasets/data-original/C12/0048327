Long-term observation after intravesical metaphylaxis with mitomycin C in patients with superficial bladder tumors.
 After transurethral resection of a superficial bladder tumor 63 patients were treated by chemoprophylaxis with mitomycin C over a period of two years: 33.3 percent experienced recurrent disease under metaphylaxis and 42 patients who remained recurrence-free during instillation therapy were observed further for an average of 26.4 months.
 During this period 26.2 percent of the patients showed recurrences ranging between two to forty-four months after completing instillation.
 The majority of the patients in whom recurrent tumors developed also had recurrent tumor processes before the instillation therapy was begun.
 Of the 42 patients 73.8 percent stayed recurrence-free during the observation period of twelve to fifty-four months after completing instillation therapy.
 In conclusion, during an average observation period of 50.4 months, 52.4 percent of the patients in this study showed recurrences.
