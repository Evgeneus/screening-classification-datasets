Renal hemodynamics, plasma amino acids and hormones after a meat meal in progressive nephron loss.
 Ten patients with chronic renal failure (GFR 29-97 ml/min), on free diets providing 1 g/kg B.W.
 of proteins, ingested an oral protein load (meat meal, 2 g/kg B.W.).
 GFR and RPF increased significantly over baseline with no change in filtration fraction.
 Within 30 min of the meal and for the next 3 h a statistically significant increase was observed in the plasma concentrations of the following amino acid groups: essential, non-essential, total, branched-chain, ketogenic, glycogenic, glycogenic and ketogenic, basic, acid, polar and non-polar.
 At 30 min the smallest increase was seen in acid and polar amino acids (6.7% and 7.6%, respectively).
 At 180 min the largest increase (78.8%) was seen for glycogenic and ketogenic amino acids and total plasma amino acids were 1.58 times baseline.
 After the meat meal plasma glucagon and insulin rose significantly, while growth hormone, plasma renin activity and aldosterone did not vary.
