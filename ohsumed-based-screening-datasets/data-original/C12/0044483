Acquired cystic disease of the kidney analyzed by microdissection.
 Four cases of acquired cystic disease of the kidney (ACDK) were studied by the microdissection technique (MD) of Darmady and Baert to analyze the cystic transformation.
 No patient had a history or clinical evidence of the adult polycystic disease of the kidney (APDK).
 Hypothetical models related the pathogenesis of cystic transformation to either obstructive or degenerative factors.
 Microdissection was performed in four nephrectomy specimens of hemodialyzed patients and a total of 155 nephrons were isolated.
 The atrophy of the glomeruli has already been described histopathologically but MD demonstrated the existence of nephrons consisting of sclerotic glomeruli and enlarged segments between the atrophic convoluted proximal and distal tubules.
 Diverticula and cysts were located, above all along the proximal (mainly dilated) convoluted tubules: they were always in continuity with the tubules.
 Phase contrast microscopy showed a patent lumen in 80% of the proximal and distal convoluted tubules, and a regular lining of the cysts.
 These data support the hypothesis that ACDK is the result of hyperplasia and dilation of remaining nephrons, rather than a result of obstruction and/or fibrosis.
