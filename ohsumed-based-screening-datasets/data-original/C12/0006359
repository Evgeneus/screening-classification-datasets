Temporary loss of limb function secondary to soft tissue calcification in a patient with rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure.
 A case of unusually severe soft tissue calcification with temporary loss of limb function in a patient with rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure (ARF) is described.
 A large dose of intravenous (IV) calcium was administered early in the hospital course to treat hypocalcemia, and hemodialysis, when initiated, was with a 1.75-mmol/L calcium dialysate.
 This case illustrates the danger of administering calcium supplementation and raises questions about the use of normal to high dialysate calcium concentration in the early stages of rhabdomyolysis-induced oliguric ARF.
 Calcium supplementation should be reserved for patients with clear clinical signs of hypocalcemia and dialysate calcium should be adjusted to prevent excessive positive calcium balance.
