Urinary incontinence. Not a 'normal' part of aging.
 Urinary incontinence is a common problem that affects millions of elderly men and women and their caregivers.
 Evaluation of incontinence is easy and inexpensive and does not require hospitalization.
 A basic evaluation consists of history taking (including a review of drug use), physical examination, and appropriate laboratory testing.
 Urodynamic evaluation may also be necessary.
 Treatment may consist of behavior modification techniques (eg, Kegel exercises, biofeedback, bladder retraining), use of a mechanical device or pharmacologic agent, or surgery.
 Should medical and surgical methods fail, alternatives are available to ensure patients' well-being and comfort.
