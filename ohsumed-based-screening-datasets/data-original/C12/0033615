Radical prostatectomy for localized prostatic carcinoma in the renal transplant patient.
 Three renal transplant patients had prostatic carcinoma after transurethral prostatectomy at 2 weeks, 2 months and 12 years following transplantation.
 One patient had stage A1 disease, while 2 had stage A2 prostatic carcinoma.
 All patients underwent radical retropubic prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection.
 All patients had residual cancer in the radical prostatectomy specimen but none had nodal or capsular involvement.
 The surgical technique and rationale for management are discussed.
