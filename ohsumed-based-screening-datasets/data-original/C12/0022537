Genital human papillomavirus infection 
 Human papillomavirus is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted diseases.
 In the past ten years, 60 different types of papillomavirus have been identified.
 Although the virus often causes asymptomatic genital infection, it has been strongly associated with lower genital tract carcinoma; therefore, its detection and eradication are important.
 All patients with evidence of human papillomavirus infection should undergo colposcopy and, depending on the extent of infection and the type of histology, should receive definitive treatment.
