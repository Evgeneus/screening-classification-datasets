Renal artery imaging: a prospective comparison of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography with conventional angiography.
 This study describes a systematic comparison of intra-arterial digital subtraction angiography (DSA) of the main renal arteries with conventional angiography (CA), the currently accepted "gold standard" for the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis.
 Twenty-five patients scheduled for abdominal aortography for various indications underwent first DSA then CA.
 The DSA and CA images were evaluated for number of renal arteries, presence and grade of renal artery stenosis, presence of post-stenotic dilation or fibromuscular changes, and diagnostic and pictorial adequacy of the images.
 DSA was found to be diagnostically adequate in 92% of cases, compared with 96% for CA.
 In evaluating significant main renal artery stenosis, which the authors assumed to be any stenosis greater than 50%, there were 10 such stenoses seen by CA.
 DSA also detected 10 cases, but there was 1 false positive and 1 false negative, yielding a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 98%.
 There was also close correlation of DSA and CA for the few cases of post-stenotic dilatation and fibromuscular dysplasia encountered.
 The authors conclude that DSA is an acceptable substitute for CA in the evaluation of patients for main renal artery stenosis.
