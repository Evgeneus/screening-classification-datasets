Clinical outcome of fetal uropathy. I. Predictive value of prenatal echography positive for obstructive uropathy.
 Clinical followup was performed in 73 neonates with a prenatal echographic suspicion of uropathy.
 Of 42 patients with a prenatal suspicion of unilateral hydronephrosis only 15 had pathological obstruction and 2 had multicystic dysplastic kidneys.
 Among 10 infants with a prenatal suspicion of bilateral hydronephrosis only 1 had true bilateral obstruction and 2 had unilateral obstruction.
 In 2 patients hydroureteronephrosis seen on prenatal echography was due to massive bilateral vesicoureteral reflux.
 In this group there was also a multicystic dysplastic kidney and 1 patient with bilateral cystic dysplasia.
 There was a prenatal suspicion of cystic disease in 8 infants.
 Postnatally, diagnosis was multicystic dysplastic kidney in 2 patients and a simple renal cyst in 4.
 The remaining 2 neonates had obstructive uropathy.
 Finally, of 13 neonates with a prenatal suspicion of anatomical-echo-structural abnormalities a definitive abnormality could be established in only 8.
 The predictive value of prenatal echography positive for obstructive uropathy was 34.6%.
