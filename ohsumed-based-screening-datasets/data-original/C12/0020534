Glucose-induced insulin secretion in uremia: effects of aminophylline infusion and glucose loads.
 To explain mechanisms responsible for derangement of insulin release in uremia, we investigated glucose metabolism through three different tests in 14 patients with end-stage chronic renal failure.
 These tests were: intravenous glucose tolerance test with 0.33 g/kg of glucose solution (IVGTT); IVGTT with 0.5 g/kg of glucose solution (IVGTT2); IVGTT during aminophylline infusion (IVGTT + A).
 Twelve of the patients had IVGTT repeated after two to four months of thrice-weekly regular hemodialysis (IVGTT3).
 In each test we measured plasma glucose (G), immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and C-peptide.
 We also calculated glucose constant decay (K), insulin production (IRI area), insulinogenic index (IGI), and insulin resistance index (RI).
 Twenty-nine healthy volunteers formed the normal controls for IVGTT.
 As compared to controls, during IVGTT uremic patients showed significantly lower values in K, IRI area and IGI, and showed a significant RI value increase.
 During IVGTT2, IRI are values were higher than during IVGTT but IGI and K values were unchanged.
 During IVGTT + A both IRI area and IGI values were higher than during IVGTT.
 After hemodialysis treatment (IVGTT3) K, IRI areas and IGI increased significantly as compared to the predialysis period.
 K increase after hemodialysis correlated directly to IGI increase and inversely to RI changes.
 IGI increase during IVGTT3 was directly correlated to IGI rise during IVGTT + A.
 From these data we infer that defective insulin release in uremia is due to a decrease of beta-cell glucose sensitivity rather than to their functional exhaustion.
 An impaired adenyl cyclase-cAMP system may have an important role in the pathogenesis of this abnormality.
