Correction of hypophosphatemia in patients on hemodialysis using a calcium-free dialysate with added phosphate.
 Three patients on long term hemodialysis were found to be hypophosphatemic.
 They were treated using a calcium-free dialysate to which phosphate was added to give a final concentration of 1 or 2 mmol/l.
 All corrected their low phosphates.
 Hypocalcemia developed in two patients when the calcium infusion rate was 15 ml/hour of 10% CaCl2.
 It is recommended that this should be increased to 20 ml/hour.
 Under these circumstances, correction of hypophosphatemia is possible with the transfer of approximately 30-35 mmol phosphate over a four-hour dialysis.
