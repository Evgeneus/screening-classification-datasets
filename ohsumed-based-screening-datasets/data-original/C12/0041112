Effect of meal on the physiological and physicochemical actions of potassium citrate.
 The effect of meals on the physiological and physicochemical actions of potassium citrate was examined in 8 patients with nephrolithiasis maintained on a constant metabolic dietary regimen.
 Potassium citrate (20 mEq.
 3 times per day), whether given with food or on an empty stomach, significantly increased urinary pH, citrate and potassium, and decreased urinary calcium and ammonium.
 Moreover, potassium citrate decreased urinary saturation of calcium oxalate and uric acid, although it slightly increased that of brushite.
 However, there was no significant difference in these measures when the drug was given with meals from the time when it was given on an empty stomach.
 Thus, the effect of potassium citrate on urinary risk factors is unaffected by food.
