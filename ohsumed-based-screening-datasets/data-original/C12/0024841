Pharmacokinetics of fosinopril in patients with various degrees of renal function.
 Single-dose kinetics of fosinopril, a new phosphorus-containing angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor and its active diacid, fosinoprilat, were investigated in patients with mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment and in those with normal renal function.
 After an intravenous dose of 14C-fosinoprilat (7.5 mg), total body clearance of fosinoprilat was significantly greater (p less than 0.05) in patients with normal renal function than in renally impaired patients but was not related to the degree of renal impairment in patients with creatinine clearance values of 11 to 72 ml/min/1.73 m2.
 Decreases in renal clearance were compensated for by increases in hepatic clearance, so that total clearance was maintained.
 After oral 14C-fosinopril (10 mg), plasma kinetics and bioavailability of fosinoprilat were similar for the three groups of renally impaired patients.
 The dual elimination of fosinoprilat by the liver and the kidney distinguishes fosinopril from other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors.
