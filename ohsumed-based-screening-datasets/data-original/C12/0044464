Clinical outcome of fetal uropathy. II. Sensitivity of echography for prenatal detection of obstructive pathology.
 Among 8,579 neonates born between February 1, 1981 and March 31, 1987, and cleared by prenatal sonography for significant urinary tract abnormality 158 subsequently were hospitalized because of signs or symptoms of urinary tract disease, predominantly urinary tract infection.
 Evaluation of these 158 patients revealed 24 with vesicoureteral reflux, 7 with duplicated systems (2 of which showed reflux), 1 with the syndrome of Fraley, 1 with pyelectasis and 5 with mild hydronephrosis (3 secondary to reflux and 2 with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid renal scans considered to be nonobstructed).
 There was no incidence of significant obstructive uropathy that had been missed by the previous prenatal sonography and that surfaced subsequently to cause morbidity in this series.
 The principal disorder of the urinary tract that may fail prenatal investigation is vesicoureteral reflux.
