The absorption of chlortetracycline following transscrotal instillation for the treatment of primary hydrocele testis.
 We describe the absorption of chlortetracycline from the emptied hydrocele sac, which was instilled to treat a primary hydrocele of the testis.
 The study included 7 patients and 2 control subjects who were given 500 mg.
 chlortetracycline.
 Plasma concentration was determined at 0, 1/2, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours after instillation, and in 2 patients plasma levels also were determined at 48 and 72 hours.
 The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC1) was calculated in each case by using the trapezoidal rule.
 In the control group the plasma level was determined at 0, 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours after instillation.
 The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC2) was calculated by the formula AUC2 = Co/Kc.
 The fraction F of absorption can be expressed as F = AUC1/AUC2; median F = 0.67 (range 0.41 to 0.92).
 We conclude that chlortetracycline passes readily and almost completely through the tunica vaginalis lining the hydrocele sac.
