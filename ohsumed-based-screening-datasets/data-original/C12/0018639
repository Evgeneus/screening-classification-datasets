Nonspecific magnetic resonance appearance of renal oncocytomas: report of 3 cases and review of the literature.
 We report the magnetic resonance appearance of 3 cases of solitary renal oncocytomas.
 All lesions were of low to moderate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and became considerably brighter on the more heavily T2-weighted images.
 One lesion contained a large central area of cystic degeneration, while the other 2 were solid.
 A central stellate scar was present in the smaller of the 2 solid lesions.
 Our observations lend further support to earlier reports on the nonspecific magnetic resonance features of oncocytomas.
