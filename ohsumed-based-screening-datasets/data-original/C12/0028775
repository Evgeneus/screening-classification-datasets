Renal oncocytomas--an Australian experience.
 A review was made of 24 cases of renal oncocytoma seen between 1978 and 1989.
 There was considerable overlap between the clinical presentation of renal oncocytomas and renal carcinomas.
 Although pre-operative radiological, cytological and pathological investigations may suggest the presence of an oncocytoma, these studies cannot make a definitive diagnosis.
 We recommend that these tumours be treated as potential renal carcinomas until post-operative microscopic evaluation proves otherwise.
