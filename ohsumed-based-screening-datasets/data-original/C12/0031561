Serum sex hormone-binding globulin and serum nonsex hormone-binding globulin-bound testosterone fractions in prepubertal boys with chronic renal failure.
 We had previously reported that serum sex hormone binding-globulin (SHBG) decreases and serum non-SHBG-bound testosterone (T) and free T increase significantly from infancy to late prepuberty in normal prepubertal children of both sexes.
 We had also shown an age-related delay in these changes in hypopituitary boys, which was reversed by GH treatment.
 Stunted growth and delayed puberty are conspicuous features of chronic renal failure (CRF).
 As another model of delay of growth and development, serum SHBG and serum T fractions were determined in 13 boys with CRF on chronic dialysis.
 In CRF, mean serum SHBG was significantly higher (99.1 +/- 68.9 nmol/L; P less than 0.05) than in 31 control (C) children of similar ages (66.2 +/- 34.9 nmol/L), while serum non-SHBG-bound T and free T were significantly lower (0.16 +/- 0.12 in CRF vs.
 0.24 +/- 0.12 in C and 0.010 +/- 0.005 in CRF vs.
 0.016 +/- 0.01 in C, respectively).
 On the other hand, serum total T (1.31 +/- 0.88 in CRF vs.
 1.08 +/- 0.56 in C) and serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I; 1.06 +/- 0.74 in CRF vs.
 1.35 +/- 1.70 in C) were not significantly different.
 A significant negative correlation between serum SHBG and chronological age as well as a significant positive correlation between serum non-SHBG-bound T and chronological age were found.
 For a given age, serum SHBG was higher, while serum non-SHBG-bound T was lower in patients with CRF (by analysis of covariance, P less than 0.01).
 It is postulated that, as has been proposed for hypopituitary boys, this delayed increment in serum T fractions could be responsible for the delay in the onset of puberty reported in CRF.
 It is known that GH decreases serum SHBG, acting on hepatic cells either directly or through the action of IGF-I.
 Since it has been suggested that patients with CRF have peripheral resistance to GH or IGF-I, the high levels of SHBG that we have detected in prepubertal boys with CRF could be taken as an additional evidence of this biological resistance.
