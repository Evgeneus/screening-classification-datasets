Parenteral antibiotic therapy for patients in nursing homes.
 Since the number of aged Americans who require long-term care in nursing homes is increasing, attention has been focused on the cost-effective provision of medical care in the nursing home.
 In this health care setting, pneumonia and serious urinary tract infection are common among patients.
 These infections can now often be treated successfully with use of parenteral antibiotic therapy in the nursing home, thereby not subjecting the patient to the added stress of hospitalization.
 However, the physician's decision to use parenteral antibiotic therapy for the nursing home resident is complex and must be guided by the patient's condition, the wishes of the patient and family, the frequent shortage of professional staff, and the cost of the drug.
 Nevertheless, with these factors in mind, compassionate, high-quality care can often be provided in the nursing home in a cost-effective fashion.
