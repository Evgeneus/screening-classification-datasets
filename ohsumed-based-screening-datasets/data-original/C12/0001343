Importance of a neurologic evaluation in women with lower urinary tract dysfunction.
 The normal coordinated functions of the bladder and urethra are controlled by a set of central and peripheral reflex mechanisms.
 Disruptions of these neuronal reflexes may produce abnormalities in the storage and expulsion of urine.
 Electrophysiologic testing can be employed to complement other urodynamic tests used in the evaluation of these patients and also to document that abnormalities previously thought to be anatomic in origin in reality may be secondary to neurologic dysfunction.
