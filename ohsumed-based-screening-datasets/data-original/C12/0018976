Candida pyelonephritis complicating traumatic C5 quadriplegia: diagnosis and management.
 We present the first reported case of Candida pyelonephritis in a spinal cord injured patient.
 In addition to multiple courses of empiric antibiotics, the neurogenic bladder and alteration in cell-mediated immunity found in spinal cord injured patients may have increased this patient's susceptibility to fungal disease.
 A 50-year-old patient with C5 motor functional quadriplegia developed Candid albicans pyelonephritis while undergoing rehabilitation.
 The patient had several surgical procedures and multiple courses of antibiotic therapy during acute hospitalization.
 He continued to have a hectic fever curve, leukocytosis with increased band forms, lethargy, and progressive uremia during rehabilitation.
 Successful investigation of the patient's condition included assessment of serologic tests for Candida precipitin antigen; multiple blood and urine cultures; exclusion of other causes of hectic fever; abdominal computerized tomogram, which revealed a left kidney hypodensity with irregular margins; and a retrograde pyelogram, which demonstrated multiple renal pelvic-filling defects.
 Cystoscopically placed ureteral stents, which relieved the genitourinary obstruction, drained gross pus from which Candida albicans was cultured; the patient was treated with amphotericin B and showed clinical improvement.
 Pathogenesis, presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of Candida pyelonephritis are reviewed.
