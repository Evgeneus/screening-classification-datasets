The use of albumin in clinical practice.
 The use of albumin in the clinical setting continues to generate controversy.
 Periodic shortages and the high cost of albumin have compelled many hospitals to develop guidelines regarding albumin administration.
 Our purpose is to review the human studies involving albumin.
 Particular emphasis will be placed on comparative trials involving albumin and the less expensive crystalloid solutions.
 It is hoped that this review will assist the clinician in making judgements concerning the appropriate use of albumin.
