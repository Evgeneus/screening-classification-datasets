Red cell membrane during erythropoietin therapy in hemodialysis and in hemodiafiltration.
 This study assessed the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) on red cell membrane behaviour in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and hemodiafiltration (HDF).
 We studied erythrocyte osmotic fragility (EOF), mechanical fragility (EMF) and deformability (ED) before and after r-HuEPO therapy in patients on conventional dialysis treatment with a cuprophan membrane and in subjects undergoing HDF with a polyacrylonitrile membrane.
 Non-uremic, non-anemic subjects were enrolled as controls.
 Red cell membrane defects were more evident in HD than in HDF; r-HuEPO seemed to improve deformability in both groups compared to controls (p less than 0.005) possibly through the great production of red cells during this therapy.
