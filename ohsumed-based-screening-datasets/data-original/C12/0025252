Postprostatectomy incontinence. Pathophysiology, evaluation, and management.
 Given the prevalence of bladder dysfunction (i.e., poor compliance or detrusor instability) as a cause of postprostatectomy incontinence, urodynamic studies are essential in the evaluation of such patients.
 Appropriate management strategies based on the findings of a pertinent history and physical examination, appropriate radiologic studies, and urodynamics optimize the opportunity for successful treatment.
 Because bladder dysfunction frequently accompanies sphincter insufficiency, bladder dysfunction must be diagnosed and treated effectively before implantation of an artificial urinary sphincter.
