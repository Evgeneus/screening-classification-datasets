Different pathohistological presentations of acute renal involvement in Hantaan virus infection: report of two cases.
 We present two patients with Hantaan virus infection, admitted to the Department of Nephrology, Skopje, at the same time, with the same clinical presentation (chills, fever, abdominal pain, hemorrhages, nausea, headache, proteinuria, hematuria, oliguria, acute renal failure) but with different pathohistological findings and different disease courses.
 In the first case diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis was found, with a complete recovery of renal function after a month, with a mild proteinuria and erythruria during the second and the third month.
 In the second case, glomeruli were normal in general, with slight mesangial proliferation found in two out of twenty, but interstitial edema, lymphocyte infiltrations and tubular changes were noted.
 Complete recovery was not noted after 3 months of follow-up.
 The patient is now without hemodialysis treatment, with polyuria, in the stable phase of chronic renal failure which is not improving.
