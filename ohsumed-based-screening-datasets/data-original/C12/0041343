Preoperative and postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy using CISCA (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin) in the treatment of invasive transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 Fifteen patients with invasive (T2-T4) transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder were scheduled for three courses of CISCA followed by radical cystectomy and two additional courses of CISCA.
 Seven patients completed the entire protocol, and 13 completed all the preoperative courses.
 Seven of 13 patients demonstrated downstaging of their cancers.
 Of these patients, one has died, one is alive with disease, and five are free of disease at 7 to 38 (mean 17) months.
 Of the six patients without downstaging, one survives free of disease at 42 months and one is alive with disease 12 months after cystectomy.
 Downstaging appears to be an important prognostic indicator.
 Additional studies are being conducted to determine if neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves long-term survival.
