Balloon dilation of the distal ureter to 24F: an effective method for ureteroscopic stone retrieval.
 Early in our ureteroscopic experience, in an effort to facilitate retrieval of ureteral calculi with the 11.5F and 12.5F rigid ureteroscopes, the distal ureter was routinely balloon dilated to 24F.
 Among 131 ureteroscopic procedures all consecutive 108 distal ureteral calculi were successfully removed.
 However, only 65% of 23 upper ureteral calculi were extracted.
 A followup excretory urogram (6 weeks or later) in 86 patients revealed no distal ureteral strictures.
 A followup cystogram in 30 patients showed low grade vesicoureteral reflux in 20% of the patients and none of these individuals was symptomatic.
 As such, balloon dilation of the distal ureter to 24F appears to be well tolerated.
 Presently, given the advent of smaller ureteroscopes and lithotriptor probes, such extensive ureteral dilation is necessary only in a minority of patients with distal ureteral calculi.
 In these few patients with calculi resistant to lithotripsy balloon dilation of the ureter to 24F may allow for successful, safe stone extraction, thereby precluding open ureterolithotomy.
