Klebsiella pneumoniae urinary tract infection complicated by endophthalmitis, perinephric abscess, and ecthyma gangrenosum.
 We have reported the case of an immunocompromised patient with a K pneumoniae bacteremia admitted with endophthalmitis.
 The source of the infection was an asymptomatic left renal calculus associated with a perinephric abscess.
 Persistent bacteremia resulted in the development of ecthyma gangrenosum, which has not previously been associated with Klebsiella spp infection.
