Gallbladder and pancreatic metastases from bilateral renal carcinoma presenting with hematobilia and anemia.
 A case of bilateral metachronous renal cell carcinoma with gallbladder and pancreatic metastases, presenting with hematobilia and anemia is presented.
 The presentation of metastatic renal cell carcinoma with hematobilia and anemia is previously unreported.
 This case illustrates (1) the occasionally very long interval between metachronous renal carcinoma; (2) this tumor's propensity to unusual metastases and unpredictable presentation; and (3) the significant palliation which may be achieved by appropriate surgical resection of these metastases.
