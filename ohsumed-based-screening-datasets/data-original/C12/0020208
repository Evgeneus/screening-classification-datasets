Prognostic factors for survival of patients with advanced urothelial tumors treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin chemotherapy.
 Between February 1983 and February 1986, 132 patients with advanced urothelial tract tumors were treated with methotrexate, vinblastine, Adriamycin (doxorubicin), and cisplatin (M-VAC) chemotherapy.
 Analysis of prognostic factors for survival of the first 92 patients was undertaken using the Cox proportional hazards model.
 Normal alkaline phosphatase and high Karnofsky performance status (KPS) were predominant for long survival.
 Patients 60 years or older at initiation of therapy were likely to survive longer than younger patients, perhaps indicating physician selectivity of older patients for this therapy, and those with initial hemoglobin in the normal range were also likely to survive longer.
 The additional 40 patients' data were used to validate the model.
 Clinical implications of the prognostic factors are discussed.
