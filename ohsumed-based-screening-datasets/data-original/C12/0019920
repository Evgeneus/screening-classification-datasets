Pericardial metastasis from testicular seminoma: appearance and disappearance by echocardiography.
 At the time of initial diagnosis, testicular malignancy is usually limited to the testicle and infradiaphragmatic lymph nodes.
 Metastases initially follow the retroperitoneal lymph channels and subsequently extend to the supradiphragmatic lymph nodes in the mediastinum and supraclavicular fossa.
 Testicular metastases to the pericardium are rare and usually asymptomatic.
 These lesions are most commonly identified at autopsy; therefore, the actual incidence is unknown.
 The authors report a 32-year-old man with testicular carcinoma, who developed asymptomatic pericardial metastases without concomitant supradiaphragmatic nodal or pulmonary metastases.
 They review the efficacy of echocardiography in diagnosis and follow up or pericardial metastasis.
