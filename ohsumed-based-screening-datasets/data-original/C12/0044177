The microsperm penetration assay: development of a sperm penetration assay suitable for oligospermic males.
 OBJECTIVE: To develop a specialized sperm penetration assay (SPA) for the evaluation of sperm from oligospermic patients.
 DESIGN: The development of the assay is in four parts: determine optimal sperm number; demonstrate quality control; establish statistical limits for fertile population; compare results to in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome.
 SETTING AND PATIENTS: A group of 63 patients with oligospermia and/or poor motility and a group of 17 fertile donors were compared using the optimized SPA and the micro-SPA.
 Sperm from a third group of 35 patients were simultaneously incubated with human ova (IVF) and hamster ova (micro-SPA).
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Both types of SPA scores are expressed as a sperm capacitation index (penetrations per ovum).
 Outcome of IVF is expressed as a percent of ova fertilized.
 RESULTS: Using 25,000 sperm was found to be optimal.
 The normal fertile range was statistically determined to have a lower limit (-2 SD) of 2.0 penetrations per ovum.
 When scores from 63 male factor patients were compared using the optimized SPA, only 43% had sufficient swim-up sperm.
 However, the micro-SPA could accurately test 100% of the samples because it requires only one tenth the number of sperm.
 CONCLUSION: The micro-SPA provides a valuable diagnostic test for the evaluation of the male factor patient.
