Evidence of infection with organisms producing Shiga-like toxins in household contacts of children with the hemolytic uremic syndrome.
 We conducted a prospective study in 87 household contacts of 51 children with hemolytic uremic syndrome to determine the frequency of infection with Shiga-like toxin-producing bacteria.
 Gastrointestinal tract symptoms occurred in only 1 of 87 contacts.
 Free fecal toxin was detected in 25 of 64 (39%) of the household members.
 Neutralization with specific antisera to Shiga-like toxins I and II (SLT-I, SLT-II) revealed that in 6 of these household contacts only SLT-I was present in stool, in 10 only SLT-II was present and in 9 both toxins were found.
 Thirty-three percent of the hemolytic uremic syndrome families in which 2 or more members were studied had more than 1 household member with free fecal toxin in stool.
 None of the household contacts was found to have E.
 coli 0157:H7 in feces.
 Serum samples were available in 77 household contacts; 75% (58 of 77) had serum neutralizing titers of greater than or equal to 1:4 to 1 or both toxins.
 In those contacts for whom paired sera were available, seroconversion was found in 10 of 24 (42%).
 These data show that household contacts of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome are commonly colonized with Shiga-like toxin-producing E.
 coli and seroconversion to Shiga-like toxins occurs frequently in family members of children with hemolytic uremic syndrome.
