A new technique for continent urinary reservoir reconstruction.
 A new technique for urinary reservoir reconstruction has been applied to 14 patients following radical cystectomy.
 The sigmoid colon was used in 10 cases and the ileum in 4.
 The pouch is constructed of adjacent detubularized intestinal segments.
 The continence mechanism is achieved by the formation of a double-jacket intestinal tube anastomosed to the skin.
 All patients except 1 were continent during stressful situations and resting with easy catheterization of the pouch.
 Urodynamic study in 3 cases showed a low pressure sigmoid reservoir with an average of 15 cm.
 water, and the tube had good tone with an average of 35 cm.
 water and a 5.5 cm.
 functional length.
 The technique is simple, can be applied to either the sigmoid colon or ileum and results in urinary continence with easy catheterization.
