Adenocarcinoma of the prostate involving 2 cell types (prostate specific antigen producing and carcinoembryonic antigen producing) with selective metastatic spread.
 Of 3 patients with clinically localized adenocarcinoma of the prostate 2 were treated by radical prostatectomy and 1 was treated with radiation therapy.
 Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) values were elevated before therapy.
 After treatment the PSA levels were decreased to zero.
 All 3 patients later had evidence of metastatic tumor spread to the liver with elevation of serum carcinoembryonic antigen but not PSA.
 Immunohistochemical staining of the 2 primary tumors from the prostatectomy specimens identified 2 cell clones, one immunoreactive to PSA and prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and nonimmunoreactive to carcinoembryonic antigen, and the other immunoreactive to carcinoembryonic antigen but not PSA or PAP.
 Biopsy of a hepatic metastasis in 2 patients confirmed anaplastic carcinoma of the carcinoembryonic antigen-producing cell type.
 Immunohistochemical staining of a lymph node metastasis identified the PSA-producing cell type only.
 Such results suggest selective metastatic spread of each cell type to its own organ tropic site.
 Occasional carcinoembryonic antigen-producing prostate cancers may metastasize to the liver.
 Serum carcinoembryonic antigen measurements occasionally may be useful in the management of certain prostate adenocarcinoma patients.
