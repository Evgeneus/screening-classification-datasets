Renal angioplasty for renovascular disease: a reappraisal.
 The exact role of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) for the treatment of renal artery stenoses (RAS) remains unclear.
 Therefore we analysed the outcome of unselected renal artery PTA in 30 subjects with angiographically proven unilateral RAS (Group I) compared with that of 19 who had RAS but were treated medically (Group II) and 21 who had essential hypertension but who underwent angiography (Group III).
 Good blood pressure control was achieved in all three groups but those who underwent PTA had a small but significant fall in their requirement for antihypertensive medications (p less than 0.05).
 However, no patient was "cured" of hypertension and blood pressure was able to be controlled in both Group II and Group III subjects without an increase in their number of antihypertensives.
 Serum creatinine did not improve significantly during follow-up in those who underwent PTA and was not different from that of Group II subjects at follow-up.
 Although unselected renal artery PTA for RAS may make blood pressure control easier it does not delay or prevent further deterioration in renal function and should not be used for this purpose.
