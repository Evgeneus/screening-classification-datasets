Detection of vascular complications in renal allografts with color Doppler flow imaging.
 One hundred ninety-five color Doppler flow (CDF) examinations were performed in 146 renal allografts to assess the capabilities of this technique in detecting intra- or extrarenal vascular complications.
 Conventional angiography was also performed in 44 transplants.
 In the group of transplants with angiographic correlation, CDF sonography enabled correct identification of 30 of 34 vascular complications.
 CDF showed 10 of 11 significant stenoses of the renal artery or of one of its main branches.
 There were two false-positive renal artery stenoses (one normal artery and one 40% stenosis).
 Nine of nine renal artery thromboses and the single pseudoaneurysm were also identified.
 Within the parenchyma, CDF sonography demonstrated five of five segmental infarcts, two of two postbiopsy arteriovenous fistulas, and three of six segmental or interlobar artery stenoses.
 Measurement of peak systolic velocity showed a significant difference (P less than .05) between a group (n = 8) with significant stenosis of the renal artery or one of its main branches (mean, 215.2 cm/sec +/- 32) and a group (n = 14) without stenosis (mean, 99.2 cm/sec +/- 19).
