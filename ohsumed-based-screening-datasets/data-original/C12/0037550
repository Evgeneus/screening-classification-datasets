Effect of temporary occlusion of hypogastric arteries on blood loss during radical retropubic prostatectomy.
 We report on a prospective, partially randomized study of 130 patients, examining the effect of temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries on intraoperative blood loss, perioperative blood replacement and change in preoperative to postoperative hematocrit.
 We observed no significant difference in any of these parameters when comparing patients who did and did not undergo intraoperative occlusion of the hypogastric arteries.
 These findings suggest that temporary occlusion of the hypogastric arteries during radical prostatectomy does not have a major effect on the blood loss associated with this operation.
 Extensive collateral circulation to the prostate and a substantial venous component of blood loss may explain these findings.
 Banking of 3 units of autologous blood preoperatively would have decreased the need for homologous transfusions in the majority of patients.
