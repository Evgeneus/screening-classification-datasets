Experience with peritoneal oocyte and sperm transfer as an outpatient-based treatment for infertility.
 Fifty-nine patients underwent 74 peritoneal oocyte and sperm transfer procedures.
 Forty-nine had previously failed treatment with inseminated frozen donor sperm and 10 had unexplained infertility.
 All procedures were carried out under ultrasound direction on an outpatient basis without general anesthetic by the transabdominal or vaginal route.
 Eighteen (24%) procedures resulted in pregnancy.
 Of these patients, 16 have delivered live infants (1 set of triplets, 2 twins, and 13 singletons) and 2 miscarried.
 Peritoneal oocyte and sperm transfer offers an outpatient-based alternative to gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT) for in vivo conception.
 It can also be used in patients scheduled for intrauterine insemination where stimulation is excessive because the number of oocytes replaced can be limited.
