Diet and hyperoxaluria in the syndrome of idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis.
 Hyperoxaluria is an important risk factor in patients who form calcium oxalate stones within the urinary tract.
 It occurs in patients with primary hyperoxaluria, enteric hyperoxaluria, and the syndrome of idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis.
 In the latter condition, the specific causes of the hyperoxaluria are not well defined.
 Diet and the availability of calcium and oxalate from the diet within the intestine are important factors in the hyperoxaluria that is present in some of these patients with idiopathic calcium oxalate urolithiasis.
 Other abnormalities in endogenous metabolism or transport of oxalate may play a role in the hyperoxaluria in some of these patients.
