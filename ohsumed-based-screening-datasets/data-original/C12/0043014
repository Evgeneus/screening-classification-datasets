Prostate cancer screening in younger men: prostate-specific antigen and public awareness.
 The American Cancer Society recommends annual digital rectal examination for men over forty years of age.
 We evaluated 414 men between forty and fifty-nine years of age with a questionnaire, digital rectal examination (DRE), and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) determination.
 One hundred ninety were forty to forty-nine years old, and 224 were fifty to fifty-nine years old.
 Four patients in the forty to forty-nine age group had elevated PSA determinations, and 7 had abnormal findings on DRE.
 Using prostate ultrasound and biopsy, no cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed.
 Ten patients in the fifty to fifty-nine age group had elevated PSA determinations, and 5 were diagnosed to have prostate cancer.
 These data suggest that PSA may have utility in detecting cancer in younger men.
