Accuracy of imaging modalities in staging the local extent of prostate cancer.
 In this study, none of the evaluated clinical staging methods was found to predict reliably the presence or absence of extracapsular growth of histologically proved carcinoma of the prostate.
 In this respect, digital rectal examination, transrectal ultrasound, CT, and MR imaging cannot contribute to treatment decisions in localized prostate cancer.
 Further studies are under way to determine the value of 7.5-MHz scanners in transrectal ultrasound and high-resolution surface coils in MR imaging.
