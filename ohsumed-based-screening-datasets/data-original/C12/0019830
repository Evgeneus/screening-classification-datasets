Tumor-targeted chemotherapy with lipid contrast medium and macromolecular anticancer drug (SMANCS) for renal cell carcinoma.
 Twenty-five patients with renal cell carcinoma were treated with a lipophilic macromolecular drug, poly(stylene-co-maleic acid)-conjugated neocarzinostatin (SMANCS) dissolved in lipid contrast medium (Lipiodol).
 The drug was injected by catheterizing the renal artery and another feeding artery in 24 patients, and in the common hepatic artery in 1 patient with metastases to the liver after a radical nephrectomy.
 The procedure of selective arterial administration of 3-20 mg/mL of SMANCS/Lipiodol was simple to perform and was required once every two to three weeks.
 Total dose of SMANCS for each patient varied from 3 to 57 mg.
 Both SMANCS and Lipiodol accumulated more selectively in tumor than in any other tissue and remained in the neovasculature and extracapillary space for a long time.
 CT pattern of the remaining oil contrast medium in the tumor was characterized by the high-density area localized mainly in the periphery of the tumor around the central necrosis.
 When hyperviscosity Lipiodol (Lipiodol HV) was used as lipid contrast medium, it remained more persistently in the tumor and disappeared more slowly than Lipiodol.
 Moreover, the pronounced anticancer effect was recognized when SMANCS/Lipiodol HV was administered compared with only SMANCS/Lipiodol.
 Severe side effects, such as myelosuppression, unendurable pain, paralytic ileus, etc., were not observed.
 This targeting chemotherapy may be of great significance for advanced renal cell carcinoma.
