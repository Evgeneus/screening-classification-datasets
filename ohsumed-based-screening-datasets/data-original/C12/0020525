Glomeruli synthesize nitrite in experimental nephrotoxic nephritis.
 Activated macrophages synthesize nitric oxide (NO) from L-arginine.
 In culture, the major stable end product is nitrite (NO2).
 Activated macrophages accumulate in glomeruli and are responsible for injury in experimental immune complex glomerulonephritis.
 We examined NO2- production by isolated glomeruli and urinary NO2- in accelerated nephrotoxic nephritis in the rat.
 Normal glomeruli did not produce NO2- spontaneously or when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 microgram/ml) or A23187 (2 microgram/ml).
 Cultured mesangial cells at first or seventh passage did not produce NO2- spontaneously or when stimulated.
 Nephritic glomeruli spontaneously produced NO2 at all times studied; this production was maximal at 24 hours after induction of glomerulonephritis (158.4 +/- 8.4 nmol/48 hr/ml, N = 3).
 The production of NO2- was inhibited 75 to 100% by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), and this inhibition was reversed by L-arginine, indicating NO2- production from L-arginine via NO.
 The production of NO2- was increased by LPS (1 microgram/ml) at 2, 7 and 21 days.
 NO2- was undetectable in normal rat urine; however, it was present in urine of rats with glomerulonephritis (Day 0 to 1:8161 +/- 2605 nmol/24 hr.
 N = 12).
 The production of NO in nephritic glomeruli may have implications for both the mechanism of glomerular injury and glomerular hemodynamics.
