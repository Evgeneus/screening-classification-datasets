Early catheter removal vs. conventional practice in patients undergoing transurethral resection of prostate.
 A retrospective analysis of 127 of 146 consecutive patients undergoing transurethral resection of the prostate from February 1985 to January 1988 (3-year period) was performed.
 The catheter was removed on postoperative day 1 in 66 patients (group I) and on postoperative day 2 in 61 patients (group II).
 There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of population age, weight of resected glands, operative time, and management.
 Both groups I and II had 8 complications following catheter removal.
 Postoperative hospital stay was reduced by an average of 1.37 days in group I.
 Total hospital cost was reduced by approximately $466.00.
 We conclude that catheter removal on postoperative day 1 is safe with no added morbidity while having the advantage of reduced hospital costs.
