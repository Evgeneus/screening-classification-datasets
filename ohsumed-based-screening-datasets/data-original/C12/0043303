Combined recombinant human erythropoietin-blood letting strategy for treating anemia and iron overload in hemodialysis patients.
 We studied the feasibility of treating refractory anemia and post-transfusional serious hemochromatosis in a patient undergoing hemodialysis (3x4 h weekly) for fourteen years, with recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) associated with blood-letting.
 Blood transfusion previously received by the patient at a rate of two units of packed red cells every month for nine years was stopped and r-HuEPO (80 U/kg b.w.) was administered i.v.
 at the end of each hemodialysis.
 When Hct increased over 30%, approximately 40 ml of blood was removed per hemodialysis session in an attempt to accelerate iron loss.
 Excellent control of anemia and hemochromatosis was achieved after seven months of treatment.
 The patient's general condition and skin pigmentation were significantly improved.
