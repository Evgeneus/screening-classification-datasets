Evaluation of Clinitek 200 and Rapimat II/T for screening for urinary tract infection.
 Two machines, the Clinitek 200 and the Rapimat II/T, were evaluated for their ability to screen urine samples for significant bacteriuria and other elements indicative of urinary tract pathology.
 The automated screening procedures were compared with a conventional approach of microscopy and quantitative culture for 1020 urine specimens obtained from patients in a 700 bed general hospital.
 When compared with the bacterial culture method both machines gave identical results with a negative predictive value of 0.99, while when compared with microscopy alone the Clinitek 200 and Rapimat II/T gave negative predictive values of 0.92 and 0.87, respectively.
 It is concluded that both machines would provide cost effective screening of urine specimens.
