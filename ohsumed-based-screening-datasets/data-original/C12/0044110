Prostate-specific antigen levels from completely sectioned, clinically benign, whole prostates.
 Clinically benign whole, untrimmed prostates and pelvic lymph nodes were obtained from 105 patients at autopsy.
 All 105 patients had premortem serum from which prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were obtained.
 Sixty-eight did not have carcinoma of the prostate (CAP), 28 had CAP less than 1 ml and 9 had CAP larger than 1 ml.
 Eleven untrimmed prostates weighed 80 g or more and eight had elevated PSA levels (more than 4.0 ng/ml): five of eight without CAP, two of two with CAP less than 1 ml, and one of one with CAP larger than 1 ml.
 Ninety-four whole untrimmed prostates weighed less than 80 g and 20 had elevated PSA levels: ten of 60 without CAP, two of 26 with CAP less than 1 ml, and eight of eight with CAP larger than 1 ml.
 This study suggests that PSA levels from patients with untrimmed prostates weighing 80 g or more (equivalent to a 60-g trimmed prostate) are usually elevated regardless whether CAP is present.
 However, CAP less than 1 ml, in untrimmed prostates less than 80 g, usually does not elevate PSA levels whereas CAP larger than 1 ml usually does (P less than 0.0001).
 The likelihood that elevated PSA levels, from patients with untrimmed prostates less than 80 g, are due to CAP larger than 1 ml increases as the PSA level increases.
