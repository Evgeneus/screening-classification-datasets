Ureteral triplication and ureterocele: report of 3 cases and review of the literature.
 We report 3 cases of ureterocele associated with ureteral triplication and review the literature.
 Ureteral triplication was type I in 2 patients and type II in 1.
 Diagnosis was established preoperatively in 2 cases and intraoperatively in 1.
 All patients were initially treated by upper pole partial nephrectomy and aspiration of the ureterocele, leaving the ureteral stump open in the retroperitoneum.
 Subsequent excision of the ureterocele and ureteral reimplantation for persistent ipsilateral vesicoureteral reflux and recurrent urinary tract infections were required in 2 cases.
