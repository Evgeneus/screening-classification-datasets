Prostate-specific antigen and prostatic acid phosphatase: biomolecular and physiologic characteristics.
 PSA is a 34-kd 240-amino acid glycoprotein produced by the prostatic epithelial cells.
 It is a member of the glandular kallikrein gene family and has a high sequence homology with human glandular kallikrein (hGK-1).
 PSA is a serine protease and has chymotrypsin-, trypsin-, and esterase-like activities.
 It is secreted into the seminal fluid where it degrades two seminal vesicle proteins that are important components of the semen coagulum, thus playing an important role in semen liquefaction.
 The production of PSA protein appears to be under the control of circulating androgens acting through the androgen receptor.
 Therefore, the significance of a low serum PSA value in a patient who has undergone previous antiandrogen therapy may not be the same as that for a patient who has not received endocrine treatment.
