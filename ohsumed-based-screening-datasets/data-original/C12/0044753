Transcriptional repression mediated by the WT1 Wilms tumor gene product.
 The wt1 gene, a putative tumor suppressor gene located at the Wilms tumor (WT) locus on chromosome 11p13, encodes a zinc finger-containing protein that binds to the same DNA sequence as EGR-1, a mitogen-inducible immediate-early gene product that activates transcription.
 The transcriptional regulatory potential of WT1 has not been demonstrated.
 In transient transfection assays, the WT1 protein functioned as a repressor of transcription when bound to the EGR-1 site.
 The repression function was mapped to the glutamine- and proline-rich NH2-terminus of WT1; fusion of this domain to the zinc finger region of EGR-1 converted EGR-1 into a transcriptional repressor.
