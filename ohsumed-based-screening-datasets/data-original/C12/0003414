Chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome after the treatment of head and neck cancer. A case report.
 A 62-year-old woman who was being treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck developed a chemotherapy-related hemolytic-uremic syndrome during the second cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy consisting of cisplatin, bleomycin, and methotrexate.
 Though the syndrome was suspected early, attempts at reversing the hematologic and renal abnormalities were unsuccessful.
 At postmortem examination, the characteristic microvascular lesions of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome were found in the kidneys.
