MR imaging of the seminal vesicles.
 MR imaging (0.35 and 1.50 T) was used to assess the appearance of the seminal vesicles.
 The size and signal intensity of normal seminal vesicles vary with the age of the subject.
 In general, on T2-weighted images, the signal intensity of normal seminal vesicles is lower than that of fat in prepubertal children, similar to or higher than that of fat in adults, and similar to or lower than that of fat in patients older than 70 years of age.
 Endocrine and radiation therapy will influence the size and signal intensity of the seminal vesicles.
 The purpose of the essay is to illustrate the spectrum of seminal vesicle disease, including congenital anomalies, inflammation, and neoplastic disease.
 Although MR imaging is helpful in depicting seminal vesicle abnormalities, it does not allow differentiation of benign from malignant disease, distinction of hemorrhage due to tumor invasion from postbiopsy changes, or distinguishing between glandular obstruction due to tumor infiltration and mechanical compression.
