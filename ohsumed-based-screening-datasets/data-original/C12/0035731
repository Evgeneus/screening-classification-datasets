Aztreonam monotherapy as prophylaxis in transurethral resection of the prostate: a multicenter study.
 The efficacy and safety of aztreonam in the prophylaxis of urinary tract infection following transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in patients with preoperatively sterile urine were studied in a multicenter trial including 300 patients at six Italian urology centers.
 The present report describes the first 192 patients enrolled in the protocol.
 Aztreonam or placebo was administered to each patient in three doses, which were given at the induction of anesthesia and 8 and 16 hours later.
 The development of bacteriuria was monitored by cultures of urine obtained before surgery, 3 days later, at removal of the bladder catheter, at discharge from the hospital, and at a follow-up visit 39-46 days after surgery.
 A febrile peak was observed for 6% of aztreonam-treated patients and for 20.9% of the placebo group (P less than .005), while bacteriuria was reported in 17.9% and 59.3% of these groups, respectively (P less than .001).
 From our data, TURP appears to be a clean-contaminated procedure requiring antibiotic prophylaxis, and aztreonam appears to reduce significantly the incidence of postoperative bacteriuria after this surgical procedure.
