Histopathological "self control" in transurethral resection of bladder tumours.
 Between 1979 and 1989, 462 bladder tumours were resected in 319 patients using the differentiated technique.
 After transurethral resection (TUR) that was considered optically to be complete, histopathological examination of the specimen revealed residual tumour in 35% of cases.
 The danger of insufficient resection increases in relation to the depth of infiltration (pT) and is closely associated with the growth pattern of the tumour.
 The differentiated form of TUR is important in determining the depth of infiltration, peripheral expansion of the tumour and the completeness of removal.
