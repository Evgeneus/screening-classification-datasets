Prostatic involvement in Wegener's granulomatosis.
 Two cases of Wegener's granulomatosis presenting with prostatic involvement are described and compiled with the five previously detailed cases.
 Each of these patients presented with obstructive symptoms, proteinuria, leukocyturia, and hematuria.
 The urinary sediment normalized with treatment of the underlying granulomatous vasculitis.
 Wegener's granulomatosis is a rare cause of prostatic obstructive symptoms, but should be considered whenever the relatively unusual entity of granulomatous prostatitis is diagnosed.
 One patient was initially treated exclusively with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).
 He responded, but noted recurrence during the 15th month of treatment.
 We also report on this patient's antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers, which correlated with clinical assessment and predicted recurrence 2 months before elevation of the Westergren sedimentation rate (WSR) and clinical diagnosis.
