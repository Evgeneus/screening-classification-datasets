Palpable masses in the prostate: superior accuracy of US-guided biopsy compared with accuracy of digitally guided biopsy.
 The accuracies of digitally guided biopsy versus ultrasound (US)-guided biopsy of the prostate were compared in 112 consecutive men with palpable prostatic lesions who had previously undergone conventional digitally guided biopsy and in which the results were negative for carcinoma.
 US-guided biopsies were performed with either the transperineal (n = 51) or transrectal (n = 61) approach, by means of previously described methods.
 All US-guided biopsies were performed within 3 months after the most recent conventional biopsy.
 In 44 patients (39.3%) with negative results of conventional biopsies, the results of US-guided biopsy revealed cancer.
 The transrectal and transperineal digitally guided biopsies were equally inaccurate, and the transrectal and transperineal US-guided biopsies showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy.
 The patients accepted and tolerated both US techniques equally well; neither technique was associated with significant complications.
 It is concluded that all patients with a palpable nodule should undergo US-guided biopsy if the result of conventional digitally guided biopsy is negative for cancer and the diagnostic US scan suggests an abnormality.
