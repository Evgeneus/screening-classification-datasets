Management of foreskin problems.
 One hundred consecutive cases of boys with foreskin problems referred to local paediatric surgeons in the Edinburgh area were studied.
 Fifty five underwent circumcision and the remainder were managed more conservatively with or without the use of local or general anaesthetic.
 Although sometimes avoiding general anaesthetic, the more conservative methods involved more frequent visits to the clinic, a larger number of complications, and a longer follow up period.
 Despite the vogue for conservatism, circumcision still has an important part to play in the management of troublesome foreskins in children.
