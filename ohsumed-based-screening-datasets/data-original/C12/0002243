Inverted papilloma of renal pelvis: flexible ureteroscopic diagnosis and treatment.
 A case is reported of inverted papilloma of the renal pelvis in a patient with previous transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 The renal pelvic lesion was diagnosed and treated with a flexible ureteropyeloscope.
 Although nephroureterectomy was avoided, the patient must be carefully followed endoscopically and radiographically for recurrence of lesions throughout the urinary tract.
 This case represents the first report of the endoscopic diagnosis and treatment of an inverted papilloma of the renal pelvis.
 It demonstrates the vast potential for endoscopic diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance throughout the urinary tract.
