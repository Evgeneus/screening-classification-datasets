Correlation of radionuclide urodynamometric and clinical data in 20 men with urinary symptoms.
 Radionuclide uroflowmetry was performed in 20 patients.
 These data were correlated with other urologic data, the treatment decision, and the patient's clinical status five to twelve months after testing.
 In 19 patients the follow-up period confirmed the expectations of the therapeutic plan.
 We conclude that the radionuclide uroflowmetry technique provides the urologist with objective data which can assist in the decision to perform surgery.
