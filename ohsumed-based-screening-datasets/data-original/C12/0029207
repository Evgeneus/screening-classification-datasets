Cancer control following anatomical radical prostatectomy: an interim report.
 Cancer control following anatomical radical prostatectomy was evaluated in 586 men who were followed for 1 1/2 to 8 years (median followup 4 years, 166 men followed 5 years or longer).
 The 5-year actuarial rate was 4% for local recurrence alone, 5% for distant metastases alone, 2% for distant metastases in association with local recurrence and 3% for death of or with disease, while 10% of the men had elevated levels of prostate specific antigen without local recurrence or distant metastases.
 When the actuarial status at 5 years was evaluated by clinical stage there was local recurrence alone in 0% of men with a clinical stage A1 or B1 nodule, and 4% with stage B1, 7% with stage A2 and 8% with stage B2 disease.
 When evaluated by pathological stage at 5 years local recurrence alone was noted in 2% of men with organ-confined disease, 8% with specimen-confined disease and 8% in whom the disease involved the surgical margin, seminal vesicles or pelvic lymph nodes.
 Recognizing that two-thirds to three-quarters of all local recurrences occur within the first 5 years, these data suggest that the anatomical approach to radical prostatectomy is associated with local control rates that are equal to or greater than other series reported in the literature.
 However, without a randomized study it is impossible to compare one clinical series to another, and followup evaluations at 10 and 15 years will be necessary to confirm these findings.
