Bladder cancer. Human leukocyte antigen II, interleukin-6, and interleukin-6 receptor expression determined by the polymerase chain reaction.
 The prediction of tumour biology rarely rests upon a single characteristic of the malignancy.
 The analysis of a single gene can complement standard histologic evaluation.
 The investigation of new parameters as well as the routine clinical analysis of gene expression is often limited because of the small amount of tissue available.
 This is particularly true of de novo human bladder cancers because they are generally small or handled in such a way as to hinder the analysis of multiple different parameters.
 Analysis of expressed mRNA by the polymerase chain reaction (RNA/PCR) is a method that allows the development of a profile of bladder cancer gene expression.
 The authors report the use of the RNA/PCR method to examine in bladder cancer the expression of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II gene family (HLA-DR, DQ, and DP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R).
 All de novo transitional cell carcinomas, one squamous carcinoma, and two transitional cell carcinoma cell lines expressed the majority of HLA class II genes.
 All samples expressed IL-6R RNA whereas production of IL-6 message was limited to one of the cell lines and to the high-grade bladder cancers.
 These results were combined with stage, grade, and DNA content to develop a profile of the cancers examined.
 Although an improved predictive index based on gene expression analysis by RNA/PCR has not been realized, a broader survey of human tumors for expression of these genes and others is likely to refine the classification of bladder cancer.
