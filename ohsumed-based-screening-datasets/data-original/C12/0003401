Sarcoid reaction mimicking intrathoracic dissemination of testicular cancer.
 The close observation of patients treated for testicular cancer led to the suspicion of intrathoracic and/or mediastinal metastases on radiologic examination in a number of patients without other evidence of relapse.
 This report presents two patients with combined seminomatous and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors with isolated sarcoid reactions of hilar and interlobular lymph nodes, detected concomitant with diagnosis and 12 months after diagnosis, respectively.
 Histologic examination appears to be imperative in these cases to avoid unnecessary chemotherapy.
