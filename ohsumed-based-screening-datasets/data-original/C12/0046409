Renal sonography in asymptomatic persons with spinal cord injury: a cost-effectiveness analysis.
 A prospective study was undertaken to determine the cost effectiveness of the screening ultrasound examination during the annual check-up of persons with spinal cord injury (SCI).
 Fifty-two patients, who were otherwise free of illness at the time of examination, were questioned for a history of genitourinary (GU) symptoms and evaluated with a plain film KUB, 24-hour creatinine clearance determination, and renal ultrasound.
 In those 36 patients without histories of GU symptoms, renal ultrasound alone discovered no treatable pathology.
 Of the 16 patients with histories of GU symptoms, renal ultrasound did show treatable disease in 13%.
 Effectiveness of the annual SCI follow-up may be maintained in the demonstration of treatable disease by the selective use of renal sonography only in those patients with histories of GU symptoms.
