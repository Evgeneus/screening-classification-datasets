Detailed anatomy of the internal spermatic vein and the ovarian vein. Human cadaver study and operative spermatic venography: clinical aspects.
 The exact anatomical course of the spermatic vein and the ovarian vein (gonadal) has not been described in detail previously.
 To determine the precise anatomy of the gonadal veins an autopsy study of 70 fresh human cadavers (40 men, 10 women, 10 male stillborns and 10 female stillborns) was performed by making a resin cast of both gonadal veins which then was carefully dissected.
 The study showed absence of valves in the spermatic vein, cross-communications between the right and left spermatic veins, and communication between the spermatic and renal capsular veins, spermatic and ipsilateral ureteral veins, and spermatic ipsilateral colonic veins.
 For clarification of the presence of valves intraoperative antegrade spermatic venography was done in 6 men with and 5 without varicocele.
 In both groups valves were not detected.
 These observations regarding the anatomy of the spermatic vein and the ovarian vein may help to explain related clinical conditions.
