Current status of cyclosporin A in the treatment of membranous, IgA and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.
 The effects of cyclosporin A (CyA, Sandimmun) therapy in various types of primary glomerular diseases are discussed.
 In membranous nephropathy, the data strongly support a positive effect in this disorder, but there have been no control trials thus far to indicate the risk-benefit ratio, the need for adjunctive therapy such as steroids, or what to expect in terms of time to response or duration of response.
 The risk of nephrotoxicity needs to be more precisely quantitated both from a functional and pathological perspective.
 Proper prospective controlled trials are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of CyA in this disease.
 In both IgA and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, the data are more sparse.
 Although isolated studies have suggested a benefit in both these categories, the risks are also evident and more careful pilot studies are indicated before any further conclusions can be drawn as regards the use of this agent in these disorders.
