The absence and effect of induced menopause by gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs on lower urinary tract symptoms and urodynamic parameters.
 The clinical and urodynamic relationship between the onset of menopause and the appearance of lower urinary tract symptoms has been studied in 12 premenopausal urinary symptom-free patients in whom hypoestrogenism was induced by treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs.
 No urodynamic changes in the cystometric, uroflowmetry, and urethral pressure profile measurements were found after 6 months of treatment.
 Clinically, only one patient had diurnal frequency after treatment.
 We conclude that estrogen deficiency in the absence of aging and other factors leading to urinary symptoms is probably of minimal significance as a cause of lower urinary tract disability in the immediate menopausal period.
