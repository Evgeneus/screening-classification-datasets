In vivo comparative evaluation of hemodialysis tubing plasticized with DEHP and TEHTM.
 The migration of plasticizers from blood lines was studied in 11 patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis for a period of six months.
 Di-2-ethylhexylphthalate (DEHP), the conventional plasticizer, was compared with tri-2-ethylhexyltrimellitate (TEHTM).
 A liquid chromatography method for quantitative determination of DEHP and TEHTM in human blood plasma is described.
 During treatment with tubing containing DEHP, the plasma level of DEHP rose from 0.10 micrograms/ml (less than 0.05-0.17 n = 11) to 0.70 micrograms/ml (0.30-1.6 n = 11).
 When the patients were changed to tubing containing TEHTM, the concentration of DEHP was below or close to the detection limit and TEHTM could not be detected.
 No adverse events of either tubing were found as regards acute toxic effects, performance or applicability.
