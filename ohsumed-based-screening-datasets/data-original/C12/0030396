Identification, characterization, and quantitation of soluble HLA antigens in the circulation and peritoneal dialysate of renal patients.
 Human lymphocyte antigen (HLA) class I and class II antigens and beta 2 microglobulin (B2M) were identified in peritoneal dialysate (PD) and serum from patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) using monoclonal antibodies in an enzyme-linked immunoassay.
 The HLA class I and class II antigens each exhibited approximate molecular weights of 50,000 to 60,000 daltons by chromatography on Sepharose CL 6B.
 Class I antigens in serum and PD fluid were associated with B2M.
 Free B2M (Mr 11,500) also was detected in both sera and PD fluids.
 Unlike class I antigens, class II antigens were not found to have attached B2M.
 Class I and class II antigens eluted from 2-diethylaminoethanol ion exchange gradient columns at 0.07 mol/L (molar) phosphate buffer pH 7.2 and migrated with alpha 2-beta 1 mobility in agarose electrophoresis.
 Class I antigens were purified from ESRD patients' PD fluid by solid-phase immunoaffinity chromatography.
 Enzyme-linked immunoassay demonstrated that this purified protein was composed of a class I heavy chain and B2M.
 Class I allospecificity was confirmed by neutralization on known HLA typing antisera in a microcytotoxicity assay.
 Soluble HLA class I antigen preparations specifically inhibited blast transformation of responder lymphocytes in mixed lymphocyte culture reactions.
 Inhibition was dose dependent and ranged from 0% to 95%.
 The presence of soluble HLA antigens in body fluids may play an important part in the immunologic tolerance to self.
 This study demonstrates a ready source of large quantities of soluble HLA for detailed analysis.
