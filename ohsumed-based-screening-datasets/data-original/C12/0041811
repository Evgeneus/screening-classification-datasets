Technetium-99m-MAG3 clearance as a parameter of effective renal plasma flow in patients with proteinuria and lowered serum albumin levels.
 Although the renal clearance of 99mTc-MAG3 is about 60% of the 131I-hippurate clearance, 99mTc-MAG3 clearance may be useful to estimate ERPF.
 In one study, however, proteinuria seemed to influence the MAG3/hippurate clearance ratio.
 In order to establish whether proteinuria or serum albumin level has influence on this ratio, a comparison was made between 99mTc-MAG3 clearance and 131I-hippurate clearance in 14 patients.
 There was a good linear correlation between MAG3 and hippurate clearance, although the standard error of estimate of ERPF from MAG3 was relatively large, which remained unexplained.
 No correlation was found between proteinuria and MAG3/hippurate clearance ratio nor between serum albumin level, GFR, FF, ERPF and the MAG3/hippurate clearance ratio.
 We therefore conclude that there is no correlation between proteinuria and albumin level and the MAG3/hippurate ratio.
 A reasonable estimation of ERPF with MAG3 can be made in patients with proteinuria and lowered serum albumin levels although the estimation may be less accurate.
