Non-invasive assessment of arteriogenic impotence: a comparative study.
 This study was undertaken to determine the relative accuracy of computerised Doppler waveform analysis and colour coded duplex ultrasonography in the diagnosis of arteriogenic impotence.
 Twenty men with ostensibly normal penile haemodynamics were compared with 50 men whose impotence was considered due to compromised penile haemodynamics.
 In each patient the penile arterial inflow was assessed by both methods of investigation, which were performed at an interval of 2 weeks.
 The results demonstrated both techniques to be sensitive in detecting penile artery insufficiency but colour coded duplex ultrasonography was significantly more accurate.
