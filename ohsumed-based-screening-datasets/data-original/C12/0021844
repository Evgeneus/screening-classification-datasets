Inflammatory pseudosarcoma (pseudotumor) of the bladder.
 Inflammatory pseudosarcoma of the bladder is a rare benign entity that cannot be differentiated from malignant tumor at radiologic examination alone.
 Only pathologic examination can enable a definitive diagnosis.
 The authors report two cases of these benign tumors in patients with no history of bladder disease or trauma; the tumors were large, demonstrated invasion into local tissues, and recurred in one case after incomplete transurethral resection.
