Spontaneous recovery of renal function after resection of contralateral hypernephroma.
 We report a case of nonfunction of an anatomically normal kidney associated with a contralateral hypernephroma.
 X-ray and radionuclide imaging suggested a disturbance of the contralateral renal blood flow at the microvascular level.
 Normal function resumed after tumor resection.
 The implications for management are discussed.
