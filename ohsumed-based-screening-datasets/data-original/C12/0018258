Low-protein diet and glomerular size-selective function in membranous glomerulopathy.
 We studied the effect of dietary protein restriction on glomerular function and proteinuria in nine patients with membranous nephropathy.
 Patients were randomly assigned to a 3-month period of a normal protein diet (NPD, 1.3 mg/kg/d) or of a low-protein diet (LPD, 0.6 mg/kg/d), in a cross-over design.
 Dietary protein restriction did not affect glomerular filtration rate (47.8 +/- 10.7 and 49.0 +/- 13.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, LPD and NPD, respectively) and renal plasma flow (456 +/- 119 and 499 +/- 161 mL/min/1.73 m2, LPD and NPD, respectively), nor did it significantly improve glomerular permselective function, as shown by urinary protein excretion (3.1 +/- 2.2 and 3.5 +/- 2.8 g/d, LPD and NPD, respectively) and fractional clearance of albumin, IgG, and neutral dextran molecules of graded molecular size (radii ranging from 2.8 to 6.0 nm).
 These results indicate that reduction of protein intake to 0.6 g/kg/d does not improve glomerular size selectivity in membranous nephropathy.
 Thus, in current clinical practice, a protein-restricted diet does not appear to be effective in reducing proteinuria in this category of patients.
