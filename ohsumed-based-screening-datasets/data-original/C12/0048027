Prostate specific antigen levels after definitive irradiation for carcinoma of the prostate.
 Prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels were determined in 78 patients judged clinically to be free of disease at intervals of 36 or more months (range 38 to 186 months, median 87 months) after completion of irradiation therapy by 125iodine implantation or external beam radiation.
 Of this select group of patients 38% had undetectable serum PSA levels (0.5 ng./ml.
 or less) and 38% had PSA levels that were within normal limits (4.0 ng./ml.
 or less).
 All stages and grades were represented.
 Undetectable PSA levels were only rarely found (3%) in patients with carcinoma of the prostate before treatment.
 In 24 of these 78 patients a negative biopsy of the irradiated prostate had been obtained 18 to 42 months after treatment.
 When the PSA level was drawn, which ranged from 7 to 16 years after treatment, an equal percentage of these biopsied patients had either an undetectable, normal or elevated level.
 Irradiation is able to decrease PSA to undetectable levels in some patients with prostatic carcinoma.
 Whether this reflects suppression of marker production alone or, more importantly, ablation of prostate cancer producing that marker remains to be determined.
