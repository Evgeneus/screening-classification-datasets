Flow cytometric determination of the multidrug resistant phenotype in transitional cell cancer of the bladder: implications and applications.
 We detail our experience with a monoclonal antibody to detect the cell surface P-glycoprotein product of the multidrug resistance gene (MDR-1) in the human bladder.
 A total of 32 patients had 44 different specimens analyzed.
 The samples consisted of 8 normal bladders, 21 transitional cell carcinomas, 1 mucinous adenocarcinoma, 3 P-0 bladder wall specimens and 10 nonmalignant urothelial samples from cystectomies.
 P-glycoprotein was not detected in the normal adult or pediatric bladder.
 Bladder specimens from 3 children with a neurogenic bladder revealed enhanced expression (21%, 14% and 4% positivity).
 Transitional cell carcinoma usually demonstrates low expression at diagnosis (less than 6%), although 3 patients had enhanced initial expression (11%, 12% and 31%).
 Three patients treated with chemotherapy demonstrated 56%, 76% and 50% expression of MDR-1.
 Nonmalignant tissue from cystectomy specimens had low expression of MDR-1.
 The specificity of this system was confirmed with human bladder cell lines.
 The ability of flow cytometry to detect and quantify the expression of MDR-1 may allow for the early detection of chemotherapy resistance in patients with transitional cell carcinoma treated with systemic and intravesical therapy.
