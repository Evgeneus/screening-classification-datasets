Priapism as a manifestation of isolated genital vasculitis.
 Vasculitis may affect virtually any organ system in the body.
 We describe a patient who presented with priapism due to isolated genital vasculitis.
 This responded promptly to oral corticosteroids.
 In patients presenting with priapism, a possible underlying vasculitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis; the treatment for this may be nonsurgical.
