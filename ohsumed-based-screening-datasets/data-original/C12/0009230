Surgical complications of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 Surgical experience with 260 consecutive patients with chronic renal failure receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at one medical center from 1980 to 1989 is reviewed.
 Patients received CAPD for a mean of 24.2 months (range: 3 days to 91 months).
 Catheter longevity consistently improved in all but 1 year from 1984 to 1989, as did exit-site and tunnel infections.
 Of 311 catheters inserted, 151 (49%) required removal, of which 111 (74%) were attributed to peritonitis.
 Cumulative patient survival was 80%, 60%, and 53% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively.
 Diabetic patients had statistically significant lower survival rates.
 Additional complications including catheter leakage, catheter malposition, catheter obstruction, and abdominal wall hernias were negligible.
 Although CAPD is not free from serious complications, our data show remarkable improvement since 1980 in catheter longevity, hospital stay, and infection rates.
