Can stage A1 tumor extent be predicted by transurethral resection tumor volume, per cent or grade? A study of 64 stage A1 radical prostatectomies with comparison to prostates removed for stages A2 and B disease.
 We studied 64 totally embedded radical prostatectomy specimens of stage A1 prostate cancer.
 The transurethral resection specimens were studied and compared to previously studied stages A2 and B cancer in which tumor volumes also were calculated.
 At radical prostatectomy 6% of the specimens had no residual cancer, 74% had minimal cancer and 20% had substantial cancer.
 Although most stages A2 and B tumors were larger, there was overlap among all stages.
 Transurethral resection tumor volume, per cent and grade were not statistically correlated with either radical prostatectomy residual tumor volume, or whether tumor was classified as minimal or substantial.
 Gleason sum 2 to 4 versus 5 to 7 tumor on transurethral resection showed no difference in predicting radical prostatectomy residual tumor or minimal versus substantial tumor status.
 Because 20% of all stage A1 cancers have substantial tumor at radical prostatectomy unpredictable by transurethral resection, radical prostatectomy remains an option for young men with stage A1 prostate cancer.
