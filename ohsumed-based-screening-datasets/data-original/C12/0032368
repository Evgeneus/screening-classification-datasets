Right atrial extension of an embryonal carcinoma of the testis.
 A case of embryonal carcinoma of the testis extending into the inferior vena cava and the right atrium is presented.
 Tumor extension was demonstrated preoperatively by computed axial tomography.
 Successful resection of the intravascular and right atrial extension was achieved using extracorporeal circulation.
 It is concluded that intravascular and right atrial extension is not a contraindication to radical surgery.
 This type of metastasis raises the same therapeutic and prognostic problems as those raised by tumor masses in the lungs or lymph nodes found after chemotherapy for malignant nonseminomatous germ cell tumor of the testis.
