Diagnostic usefulness of post-void film in intravenous urogram.
 A survey was sent to urologists to assess their subjective evaluation of the post-void film in the intravenous urogram (IVU).
 Most of the urologists believed that the post-void film should be a routine part of all IVUs, particularly in men over forty years of age, and estimated that the film contributed useful information in 30 percent of cases.
 One hundred fifty IVUs were reviewed to assess the actual value of the post-void film in 119 different patients.
 In these patients, the postvoid film was seen to give unique information not available by history or films of the filled bladder in only 3 percent of the cases.
 Therefore, we conclude the post-void film should not be a routine part of every IVU, and should be obtained on an as-needed basis only.
