Acquired renal cystic disease: implications for the urologist.
 Acquired cystic kidney disease has become increasingly recognised as a significant risk in patients with end-stage renal disease, especially in those maintained on chronic haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.
 A review of the literature indicates that nearly 50% of patients on dialysis for more than 3 years develop renal cystic changes.
 The major complications of this condition are neoplasia and spontaneous renal haemorrhage.
 The risk of developing renal carcinoma has been estimated to be more than 30 times higher in dialysis patients with cystic changes than in the general population.
 Our experience with 5 patients is reported, including 3 with renal tumours and 1 with metastatic disease.
 Careful surveillance of dialysis patients using yearly ultrasonography and computed tomography is recommended.
 The evolving indications for radical nephrectomy in this disease are discussed.
