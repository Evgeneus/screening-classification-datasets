Intermittent torsion: association with horizontal lie of the testicle.
 The importance of making an early diagnosis of intermittent testicular torsion cannot be over-emphasized.
 We report on 3 patients with recurrent episodes of severe testicular pain but who were pain-free at evaluation.
 All 3 patients were found to have a horizontal lie of the symptomatic testicle and a normal vertical axis in the contralateral asymptomatic testicle.
 Scrotal exploration revealed a bell-clapper deformity in all 3 patients.
 A history of recurrent scrotal pain and horizontal testicular lie, even in the absence of pain at the time of physical examination, is a strong indication for exploration and bilateral testicular fixation.
