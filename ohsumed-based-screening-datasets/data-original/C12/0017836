Miliary tuberculosis presenting as hepatic and renal failure.
 A 67-year-old man developed hepatic and renal failure over a six-day period.
 Despite full supportive measures, he died on his 11th day of hospitalization with fulminant DIC and hepatic, renal, and respiratory failure.
 Postmortem examination revealed acid-fast bacilli in virtually all organ systems.
 Miliary tuberculosis should be considered as a potentially treatable cause of hepatic failure.
