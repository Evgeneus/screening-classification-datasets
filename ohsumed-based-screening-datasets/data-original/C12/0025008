Identification of male-factor semen samples prior to insemination and in vitro fertilization.
 Semen analyses carried out as part of the clinical in vitro fertilization or intrauterine insemination protocols provide important information that determine the type of clinical treatment of the male partner and the sperm processing method.
 It is postulated that the sperm of male-factor patients cannot survive hypoosmotic stress conditions because of defective sperm membrane function.
 To test this, 0.1 ml of semen from each of 102 patients was placed in 1.0 ml of 150 mosmol/liter eosin citrate fructose solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 degrees C.
 The percentage viability of the sperm cells was then determined.
 The results indicated that patients with two or more abnormal semen parameters had a significantly lower percentage viability while in the hypoosmotic solution (40.6 +/- 4.7%), in contrast to non-male-factor patients (69.0 +/- 1.6%).
 Donor sperm (N = 32) serving as controls (73.3 +/- 2.1%) had a viability in hypoosmotic solution similar to that of non-male-factor patients.
 The data suggest that sperm of male-factor patients are less able to survive the hypoosmotic stress conditions as shown by the percentage viability in hypoosmotic solution and emphasize the importance of using less stressful sperm processing methods for in vitro fertilization or insemination in these patients.
