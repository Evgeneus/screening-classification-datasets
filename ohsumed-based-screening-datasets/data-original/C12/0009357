Lack of prognostic value of nucleolar organizer region enumeration in transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.
 Enumeration of silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions is of limited use in grading transitional cell tumors of the bladder.
 We attempted in this article to establish whether or not such a technique would be helpful in predicting the prognosis of such tumors within rather than between grades.
 In the study population of 11 high-grade transitional cell carcinomas of the bladder, no correlation was found between clinical outcome and mean nucleolar organizer region count.
