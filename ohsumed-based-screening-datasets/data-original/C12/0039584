Antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies: the nephrologist's perspective.
 Serologic tests for antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) provide diagnostic and prognostic information in patients with nephritis and systemic vasculitis.
 Four case histories are discussed that illustrate ANCA positivity in patients with renal impairment caused by interstitial, rather than glomerular, nephritis.
 Renal biopsy should continue to be used to diagnose the cause of renal impairment in ANCA-positive patients.
