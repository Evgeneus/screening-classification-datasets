The MAGPI hypospadias repair in 1111 patients.
 The meatal advancement and glanduloplasty (MAGPI) procedure was first described in 1981 for the repair of distal hypospadias.
 In the past decade, our experience has grown to more than 1000 procedures.
 An excellent surgical result requires careful case selection, avoiding cases with thin or rigid ventral parameatal skin or a meatus too proximal or too wide.
 The glans wrap to support the advanced ventral urethral wall requires a solid tissue approximation in two layers to prevent a retrusive meatus.
 Meatal stenosis can be avoided by assuring an adequate dorsal Heineke-Mikulicz tissue rearrangement and making an incision from within the urethral meatus well distally into the urethral groove.
 The MAGPI procedure routinely is performed on an outpatient basis without any urinary diversion.
 Our experience in 1111 cases during 12 years has required a second procedure in 1.2% of cases.
 The overall success rate with the MAGPI procedure suggests that it should continue to be used in the repair of distal hypospadias.
