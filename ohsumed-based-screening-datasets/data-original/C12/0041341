Will Rogers and the results of radical cystectomy for invasive bladder cancer.
 Disease-free survival rates for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer treated by radical cystectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy with or without adjuvant chemotherapy are 75% to 80% in stage B disease, 60% in stage C disease, and approximately 50% in stage D disease.
 Vascular invasion is an important prognostic factor in meticulously staged patients.
 Powerful selection factors, including more accurate clinical and pathologic staging and improved surgery, as well as unspecified selection factors, may contribute to the improved results.
 In order to evaluate the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy, a randomized, controlled study is necessary.
