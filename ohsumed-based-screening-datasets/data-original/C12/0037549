Elevated plasma chromogranin-A concentrations in prostatic carcinoma.
 Chromogranin-A is considered a sensitive immunohistochemical tissue marker in neuroendocrine prostatic carcinoma.
 We report that the plasma chromogranin-A level was elevated in 48% of 25 patients with stage D2 prostate cancer, and suggest that this marker can be used to monitor the clinical course of these patients.
