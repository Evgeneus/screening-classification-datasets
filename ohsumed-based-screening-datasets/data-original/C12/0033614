Decrease in renal vascular resistance in University of Wisconsin solution preserved kidney transplants.
 Renal vascular resistance was compared in 2 groups of renal grafts: group 1-16 kidneys perfused with University of Wisconsin solution and group 2-16 kidneys perfused with Euro-Collins solution.
 Both groups had comparable donors and recipient criteria.
 Renal blood flow was measured by a miniaturized pulsed Doppler probe fixed on the graft renal artery.
 Renal vascular resistance was calculated either according to the formula: renal vascular resistance (mm.
 Hg/ml.
 per second) = systemic arterial pressure (P)/renal blood flow or through the renal vascular resistive index (RVRI): RVRI = systolic flow velocity - diastolic flow velocity/systolic flow velocity = (S-D)/S.
 Renal vascular resistance estimation seems to be more contributory than renal blood flow in assessment of renal graft reperfusion disorders.
 Our results show that University of Wisconsin solution seems to preserve intrarenal arterial caliber better with a decrease in intrarenal vascular resistance, thus, allowing for a higher arterial graft perfusion flow.
