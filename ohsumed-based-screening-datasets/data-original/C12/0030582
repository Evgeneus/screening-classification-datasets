Incontinence in the elderly: objective demonstration and quantitative assessment.
 Subjective and objective methods of demonstrating incontinence and assessing its severity have been compared in a group of elderly patients with a high incidence of severe urge incontinence.
 It was found that 24-h in-patient monitoring of urine leakage was the most sensitive method of demonstrating incontinence, with videourodynamic testing almost as good.
 In comparison, a 1-h pad test was poor.
 Visual inspection during physical examination seldom demonstrated leakage.
 For quantitative assessment of severity, 24-h monitoring gave the most reproducible results; it was also able to reveal significant changes in severity in response to pharmaceutical treatment.
 A 1-h pad test was less reproducible and suggested changes that were only poorly consistent with 24-h monitoring.
 The subjective responses of the patients were not useful in assessing changes in the severity of incontinence.
 Twenty-four hour monitoring thus stands out as a superior method of demonstrating and assessing incontinence.
