Surgical treatment of eyelid retraction associated with thyroid eye disease.
 Fifteen patients (22 eyelids) were treated for upper eyelid retraction related to thyroid eye disease by recessing the levator aponeurosis and Muller's muscle through a lid crease incision.
 Neither spacers nor traction sutures were used, and the recessed muscles were not sutured to any of the surrounding tissues.
 The patients were not sedated and thus were able to sit up during the procedure; final lid heights also were determined with the patients in the sitting position.
 There were no overcorrections or undercorrections during follow up of at least 3 months.
