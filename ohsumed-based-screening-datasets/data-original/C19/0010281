Oral contraception in disease states.
 Oral contraceptives are clearly contraindicated in patients with a history of thromboembolic disease, ischemic heart attack, or cerebral stroke.
 Patients requiring long-term anticoagulant treatment can be treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs to prevent ovulation, because ruptured follicles can cause massive intraperitoneal bleeding.
 Patients with essential hypertension and severe liver diseases should also discontinue treatment 4 weeks before major elective surgery.
 Migraine and diabetes mellitus are regarded as relative contraindications, depending on the individual situation.
 Long-term diseases, such as Crohn's disease, epilepsy, and sickle cell anemia, also require individualized consultation.
