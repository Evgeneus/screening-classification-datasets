Measurement of bone collagen degradation in hyperthyroidism and during thyroxine replacement therapy using pyridinium cross-links as specific urinary markers.
 Urinary excretion of the bone collagen derived pyridinium cross-links pyridinoline (PYD) and deoxypyridinoline (DPD) was measured in 19 patients (4 M:15 F) with untreated thyrotoxicosis, and 20 pre-, and 20 postmenopausal women taking T4 100-200 micrograms daily for autoimmune hypothyroidism.
 Both PYD and DPD excretion (nanomoles per mmol creatinine) was elevated in the thyrotoxic patients compared to 287 controls; median 131 vs.
 26 and 37.5 vs.
 7.2, respectively, P less than 0.0001.
 In premenopausal women mean urinary pyridinium cross-link excretion and serum osteocalcin levels were similar in both T4-treated and matched control groups, despite suppression of serum TSH concentrations to below 0.1 mU/L in 14 of the 20 taking T4.
 In postmenopausal women mean (+/- 1 SE) urinary PYD excretion (nanomoles per mmol creatinine) was raised in those taking T4, relative to euthyroid controls; 40.0 +/- 2.7 vs.
 32.1 +/- 2.3, P less than 0.05.
 DPD excretion and serum osteocalcin levels were also higher, but not significantly.
 When only the T4-treated women with a subnormal serum TSH were considered the difference in PYD excretion was more marked, and mean DPD excretion was also significantly elevated; 13.7 +/- 1.3 vs.
 10.1 +/- 0.8, P less than 0.05.
 Conclusion: bone collagen breakdown is increased in thyrotoxicosis, and in postmenopausal women taking sufficient T4 to suppress serum TSH.
 Similarly treated premenopausal women appear to be at lower risk.
