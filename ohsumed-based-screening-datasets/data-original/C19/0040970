Comparison of intact, midregion, and carboxy terminal assays of parathyroid hormone for the diagnosis of bone disease in hemodialyzed patients.
 The predictive value of three different RIAs of PTH for the diagnosis of the histological type of bone disease has been compared in 24 asymptomatic patients on chronic hemodialysis who had never been exposed to aluminum intoxication and who agreed to have a bone biopsy after double tetracycline labeling.
 The serum concentrations of PTH were measured using a two-site immunoradiometric assay for intact PTH(1-84) and region specific assays directed against the C-terminal (53-84) fragment or the midregion (44-68) of the molecule.
 The bone histomorphometric analysis showed that six patients had nonaluminic adynamic bone disease with low bone formation rate (BFR), eight had mild hyperparathyroidism characterized by increased bone resorption and normal BFR, nine had severe hyperparathyroidism with increased BFR, and only one had true osteomalacia with increased osteoid seam thickness.
 All PTH assays correlated with the various parameters of bone resorption and bone formation and were able to differentiate the histological type of bone disease only when groups of patients were considered.
 For classifying individual patients into severe hyperparathyroidism and adynamic bone disease groups, the intact PTH assay had the best predictive value with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of at least 70%.
 A nonaluminic adynamic bone disease was observed in more than 50% of the patients who had normal intact PTH levels (6/11).
 It is concluded that the intact PTH measurement is superior to C-terminal and midregion assays for the prediction of the histological type of bone disease in hemodialyzed patients and should be of considerable value to adapt their treatment in order to avoid the emergence of both severe hyperparathyroidism and adynamic bone disease.
 In the absence of aluminum intoxication it seems that maintaining intact PTH concentrations 1 to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal would correspond to the best bone histology.
