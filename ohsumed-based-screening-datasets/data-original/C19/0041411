Treatment of diabetes in the elderly.
 Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common medical problems in elderly patients.
 There is a strong rationale for therapy in most patients with diabetes, even those who are asymptomatic.
 Family physicians should be aware of several age-associated differences in the management and treatment of diabetes in older patients.
 For elderly patients, dietary modifications may include an increase in the percentage of carbohydrates and a decrease in the percentage of fat.
 For obese patients, dietary therapy should also emphasize a decrease in overall calories.
 Oral hypoglycemic agents are generally used as the initial drug therapy.
 Insulin therapy should be instituted when oral agents fail to reduce the blood glucose level, when the blood glucose level is very high and in other special circumstances.
 A careful choice of medications for other common problems associated with diabetes, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia and peripheral neuropathy, is also essential.
