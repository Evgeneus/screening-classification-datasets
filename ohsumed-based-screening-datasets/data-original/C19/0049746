Oral ofloxacin therapy for invasive external otitis.
 The clinical efficacy and safety of orally administered ofloxacin (400 mg twice daily) were evaluated in 24 adult patients (17 men and 7 women; mean age, 65.8 years) with pseudomonal invasive external otitis (IEO).
 The patients were divided into two groups: group A, (n = 9) suffering from a mild form of IEO, and group B (n = 15), suffering from a more severe form of the disease.
 Diabetes mellitus was the main underlying disease in these patients.
 Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the only pathogen in 18 infected ears and part of the polymicrobial flora in an additional 6.
 Cure was observed in 83.3% of the patients.
 Two of the cured patients required more than one course of ofloxacin treatment.
 Development of P aeruginosa resistant to ofloxacin (n = 3) and severe allergic reaction (n = 1) required the discontinuation of ofloxacin therapy.
 Other side effects such as nausea, arthralgia, and vaginal itching were minimal.
 Oral administration of ofloxacin seems to be an effective, convenient, relatively safe, and economical therapy of IEO caused by the susceptible organism.
