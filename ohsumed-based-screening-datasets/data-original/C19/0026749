Peripheral glucose metabolism in acromegaly.
 The present study was designed to determine the effect of chronic GH excess on forearm muscle glucose uptake and oxidation during the postabsorptive state and after an oral glucose challenge.
 Nine normal subjects and 10 nondiabetic acromegalic patients (5 of them with normal glucose tolerance) were studied after an overnight fast (12-14 h) and for 3 h after the ingestion of 75 g glucose.
 Peripheral glucose metabolism was analyzed by the forearm technique to estimate muscle exchange of substrate combined with indirect calorimetry.
 Decreased forearm glucose uptake was observed in the acromegalic patients compared to that in the normal subjects (380 +/- 84 vs.
 709 +/- 56 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h) with diminished nonoxidative glucose metabolism (262 +/- 81 vs.
 572 +/- 53 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h).
 The acromegalics with normal glucose tolerance also showed decreased forearm glucose uptake and nonoxidative glucose metabolism compared to normal subjects (271 +/- 124 vs.
 709 +/- 56 and 133 +/- 110 vs.
 572 +/- 53 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h, respectively).
 Muscle glucose oxidation did not differ significantly in normal subjects, the entire group of acromegalic patients, and the acromegalics with normal glucose tolerance (137 +/- 18 vs.
 118 +/- 22 vs.
 138 +/- 34 mumol/100 mL forearm.3 h, respectively).
 Serum FFA levels and lipid oxidation rates were similar in the normal subjects and the acromegalic patients, and declined in a similar fashion after glucose ingestion.
 Insulin levels were significantly higher in acromegalic patients than in normal subjects before and after glucose loading.
 In conclusion, this study showed that the insulin resistance occurring in the presence of chronic GH excess is accompanied by impaired muscle glucose uptake and nonoxidative glucose metabolism, which are early derangements because they are also observed in acromegalic patients with normal glucose tolerance.
