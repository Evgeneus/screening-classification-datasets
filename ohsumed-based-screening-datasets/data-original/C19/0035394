Single-dose subcutaneous iodine-131-iodohippurate for determination of renal plasma flow.
 Subcutaneous administration of a single dose of 131I-iodohippurate was used for determination of renal plasma flow (RPF) in 20 subjects during water diuresis.
 Slow release of tracer (200 microCi) permitted serial clearance measurements over 5 hr that were compared to standard, constant infusion, PAH clearance (mean 379.5 +/- 34.9 ml/min/1.73 m2, range 50.9 to 696.3 ml/min/1.73 m2).
 RPF(Isotope) was 424.9 +/- 30.3 ml/min/1.73 m2 (range 144.4 to 746.5 ml/min/1.73 m2) and highly correlated with RPFPAH (r = 0.883, p less than 0.0001).
 This technique permits prolonged studies of renal plasma flow under steady-state conditions without constant infusion.
