Association between exercise and other preventive health behaviors among diabetics.
 Two hundred and seventy patients were studied to investigate the cross sectional association between exercise and other preventive health behaviors in a diabetic population.
 Patients included both insulin and noninsulin dependent diabetics and were recruited from the Family Practice and Pediatrics Clinics at Bowman Gray School of Medicine.
 During screening, patients underwent a physical examination as well as completing a survey to assess exercise and health behavior habits.
 Three exercise groups were compared: (a) patients who expended more than 600 kilocalories per week during exercise, (b) patients who expended 600 kilocalories or less, and (c) patients who did not exercise.
 The mean body weights of both exercise groups were found to be less than the nonexercise group, and the heavy exercise group also had a lower mean body mass index.
 Heavy exercisers reported greater caloric intakes than both moderate and nonexercisers.
 There were no differences found concerning the composition of their diets among groups.
 The heavy exercise group reported wearing their seatbelts a greater percentage of the time and visited the dentist more often compared with the sedentary group.
 There were no significant differences found among exercise groups concerning blood sugar monitoring, alcohol consumption, smoking, or in obtaining periodic health examinations.
 It was concluded that exercise was associated with several, but not a majority, of other healthful behaviors in a population of diabetics.
