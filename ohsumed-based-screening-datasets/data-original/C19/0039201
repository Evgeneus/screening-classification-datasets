Adrenocortical insufficiency with normal serum cortisol levels and hyporeninaemia in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 The acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been associated with abnormalities of adrenocortical function, and hypoaldosteronism due to hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism (HHA).
 We here report the case of a woman with AIDS associated with orthostatic hypotension, persistent hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, in whom basal serum cortisol levels were normal and serum renin activity was low.
 Subsequent post-mortem examination revealed almost complete adrenocortical destruction.
 A possible explanation of this apparently contradictory combination of findings is discussed, together with the therapeutic implications for similar cases.
