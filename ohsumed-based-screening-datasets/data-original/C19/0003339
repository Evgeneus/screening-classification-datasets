Mastalgia refractory to drug treatment.
 Management of the patient with mastalgia who fails to respond to first line therapy is a difficult problem and there is a group of patients who do not respond to any therapy.
 A group of 126 patients with mastalgia who failed to respond to first line therapy and completed further treatment options was studied.
 The response rate of those with cyclical mastalgia fell to 57 and 25 per cent for second and third line therapy respectively.
 Equivalent figures for non-cyclical mastalgia were 24 and 21 per cent.
 Danazol maintains a high response rate after the failure of other drugs, whereas the second line response to bromocriptine and evening primrose oil is poor.
 Unresponsive patients were matched to a group of patients who responded to first line therapy, and reproductive and historical factors were compared using the chi 2 test, but failed to identify which patients would respond to therapy.
