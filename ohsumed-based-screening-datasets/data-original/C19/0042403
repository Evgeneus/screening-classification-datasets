Ultrasonic detection of parathyroid adenomas.
 High-resolution real time sonography was used to evaluate patients with suspected primary hyperparathyroidism.
 A total of 12 consecutive patients was scanned pre-operatively.
 The sensitivity of the procedure was 92% and the specificity 97%.
 In our hospital sonography is the procedure of choice for localizing enlarged parathyroid glands prior to surgical exploration.
