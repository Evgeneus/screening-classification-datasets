Relation of hyperglycemia early in ischemic brain infarction to cerebral anatomy, metabolism, and clinical outcome.
 We studied the relation of serum glucose level measured in the first 12 hours of symptoms to the clinical findings, results of computed tomography (CT), and patterns of cerebral metabolism in 39 patients who had acute ischemic cerebral infarction.
 Structural damage was assessed by CT.
 Metabolic disruption was assessed using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (PET).
 Median initial serum glucose concentration was 155 mg/dl (6.7 mM).
 Clinical recovery was significantly poorer in patients with initial serum glucose levels higher than the median (p less than 0.05, chi square).
 PET tended to show normal results or minor abnormalities in patients with initial glucose levels less than the median, as opposed to lobar or multilobe abnormalities in patients with levels that were higher than the median (p less than 0.05, Kendall's Tau b).
 The severity of hypometabolism in the ischemic region, expressed as the percent asymmetry of local cerebral glucose metabolism between homologous brain regions, was greater in patients with initial glycemia concentrations higher than the median (p less than 0.001, t test).
 Relationships of serum glucose level with metabolic derangement and structural damage, but not outcome, held true in patients without a history of diabetes mellitus.
