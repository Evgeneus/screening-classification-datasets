Transsphenoidal management of Rathke's cleft cysts. A clinicopathological review of 10 cases.
 We report detailed data on 10 patients who underwent transsphenoidal microsurgical management of histopathologically confirmed Rathke's cleft cysts.
 Preoperatively, pituitary dysfunction was present in 90%, headaches in 80%, hyperprolactinemia in 70%, and visual interference in 40%.
 Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging had 90% and 100% sensitivity, respectively, in disclosing the lesion.
 The mean follow-up duration was 22 months.
 There was no mortality.
 The only morbidity was sustained diabetes insipidus in one case.
 Resolution or improvement in preoperative dysfunction occurred in the majority of patients: headaches in 100%, visual deficits in 75%, normalization of hyperprolactinemia in 83%, and reversal of panhypopituitarism in 33%.
 We conclude that Rathke's cleft cysts can be managed safely and effectively with transsphenoidal drainage and partial excision of the wall.
