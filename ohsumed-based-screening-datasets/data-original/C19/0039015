Nonpharmacological treatment of hypertension in diabetes mellitus.
 Hypertension may be partially or completely controlled by appropriate use of nondrug therapies.
 Because diabetic patients are so often hypertensive and because the same nondrug therapies effective for treatment of hypertension may also benefit the diabetes, the use of nondrug therapies is particularly important in these patients.
 Evidence about the effectiveness of various nondrug therapies is provided along with practical suggestions to improve patient adherence to them.
