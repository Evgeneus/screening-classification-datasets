Necrotizing fasciitis in irradiated tissue from diabetic women. A report of two cases.
 Two diabetic women with pelvic malignancies developed necrotizing fasciitis within the irradiation fields.
 Despite aggressive surgical and medical therapy, both died when their health became too unstable for them to tolerate further surgery to resect the residual infection.
 We attribute their poor outcome to several factors.
 First, postradiation tissue changes obscured the early clinical findings necessary for a prompt diagnosis and made the identification of adequate surgical margins difficult.
 Second, diabetic patients have increased susceptibility to this infection.
 Third, the cumulative effects of radiation, diabetes mellitus and other factors that are common in patients with gynecologic malignancy (advanced age, vascular disease, obesity) favor the development, progression and persistence of necrotizing fasciitis.
 Radiographic studies were helpful in defining the extent of the infection in one patient.
