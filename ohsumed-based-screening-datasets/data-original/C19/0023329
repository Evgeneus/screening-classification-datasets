Results of transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas and Rathke's cysts.
 Fourteen patients undergoing transsphenoidal extirpation of craniopharyngiomas or Rathke's cysts underwent endocrinological evaluation before and after surgery.
 One patient died during the procedure because of uncontrollable arterial bleeding.
 The other patients were followed for up to 16 years (average, 8.5 years).
 One patient had recurrence of tumor 12 years after surgery.
 Another patient, the only one operated on because of a recurrent craniopharyngioma after previous radiation therapy, died 2 years after the transsphenoidal operation.
 No patient recovered pituitary functions that had been lost before surgery.
 One patient, who had an isolated growth hormone deficiency, and another, who had panhypopituitarism with sustained antidiuretic hormone secretion, had no change postoperatively from their preoperative endocrine status.
 The other 11 patients lost pituitary function and required pharmacological replacement of one to four pituitary hormones.
