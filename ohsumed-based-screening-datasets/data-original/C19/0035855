Biological markers in chromium exposure assessment: confounding variables.
 An estimated two million tons of chromate production waste pollution has caused a major environmental and public health concern in Hudson County, New Jersey.
 As part of an occupational exposure assessment, urinary and red blood cell (RBC) chromium measurements were performed on 52 state employees who worked either near a contaminated site or elsewhere.
 Samples were collected so as to minimize contamination, and they were analyzed using sensitive techniques.
 These workers also completed a questionnaire that addressed potentially important third variables.
 Individual analyses suggested that exercise, drinking beer, past employment in chromium-related occupations, and diabetic status had an important effect on urinary chromium levels.
 These variables were entered into a regression model and were all found to be significant predictors of urinary chromium level (p less than .10).
 Some variables were also examined for their influence on RBC chromium level, but none had a measurable effect.
