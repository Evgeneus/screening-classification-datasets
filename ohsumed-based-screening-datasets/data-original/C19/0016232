Somatostatin analogue, octreotide, reduces increased glomerular filtration rate and kidney size in insulin-dependent diabetes.
 To determine whether treatment with a somatostatin analogue can reduce kidney hyperfiltration and hypertrophy in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, we studied 11 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and glomerular hyperfiltration.
 The patients were assigned randomly to receive continuous subcutaneous infusion of either octreotide, 300 micrograms/24 h (five patients) or placebo (six patients) for 12 weeks.
 At baseline, mean glomerular filtration rate and mean total kidney volume were not significantly different in the two groups.
 However, after 12 weeks of treatment, the mean glomerular filtration rate was significantly lower in the octreotide group (136 mL/min per 1.73 m2; range, 91 to 158 mL/min per 1.73 m2) than in the placebo group (157 mL/min per 1.73 m2; range, 138 to 184 mL/min per 1.73 m2).
 Furthermore, the mean total kidney volume was significantly lower after treatment in the octreotide group (379 mL/1.73 m2; range, 307 to 454 mL/1.73 m2) than in the placebo group (389 mL/1.73 m2; range, 347 to 465 mL/1.73 m2).
 Glycemic control did not change significantly in either group.
 We conclude that subcutaneous infusion of octreotide for 12 weeks reduces increased glomerular filtration rate and kidney size in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus despite the fact that glycemic control remains unchanged.
