Changing pattern of bone and joint infections due to Staphylococcus aureus: study of cases of bacteremia in Denmark, 1959-1988.
 Of the 15,170 cases of bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus that occurred in Denmark between 1959 and 1988, we review 525 cases of acute hematogenous osteomyelitis and 185 cases of septic arthritis that developed subsequent to the bacteremia and 134 cases of contiguous osteomyelitis in which the bacteremia developed secondarily.
 The pattern of acute infections of bones and joints has changed over the three decades studied.
 The frequency of secondary bone or joint infections due to S.
 aureus bacteremia has changed, as have the phage-type pattern and antibiotic resistance of the infective strains.
 The prevalence of hospital-acquired cases has increased and the age distribution of patients has changed, as is reflected in an increasing number of older patients.
 The localization of hematogenous osteomyelitis has shifted, and the vertebral column is now the most common site of infection.
 The rate of chronic cases of osteomyelitis that occur following acute hematogenous osteomyelitis has been reduced from 34% to 6%.
 The mortality associated with S.
 aureus bacteremic infections of bones or joints is low compared to that associated with other cases of S.
 aureus bacteremia.
