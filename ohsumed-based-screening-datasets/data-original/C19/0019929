Prevalence and association of asteroid hyalosis with systemic diseases.
 We performed a cross-sectional study of 12,205 patients, which identified 101 patients (0.83%) with asteroid hyalosis.
 These patients were examined for associated systemic and ocular conditions.
 Diabetes mellitus was found in 29 of the patients with asteroid hyalosis (29%), as compared to ten of 101 (10%) control subjects (P = .0007).
 An increased prevalence of systemic arterial hypertension (61 of 101 [60%] patients with asteroid hyalosis compared with 29 of 101 [29%] control subjects; P = .0001) and atherosclerotic vascular disease (30 of 101 [30%] patients with asteroid hyalosis compared with 13 of 101 [13%] control subjects; P = .006) was also discovered in the asteroid hyalosis group.
 Additionally, patients with asteroid hyalosis were found to be more hyperopic than control subjects (P = .009).
