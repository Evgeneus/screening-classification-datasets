Economic cost of diabetes mellitus--Minnesota, 1988.
 For diabetes mellitus (DM) and other chronic diseases, important indicators of disease burden include morbidity, mortality, measures of disability and quality of life, and economic burden.
 Because of limited data, however, the economic burden of DM has been difficult to measure.
 Although national costs for DM have been estimated recently (1-5), state-specific estimates have, in general, not been possible.
 This report summarizes an analysis prepared by the Minnesota Diabetes Surveillance Project (MDSP), Minnesota Department of Health, that estimated the economic impact of DM in Minnesota for 1988.
