Risk of neoplasia and malignancy in "dominant" thyroid swellings.
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the risk of neoplasia and malignancy in "dominant" thyroid swellings.
 DESIGN--Prospective analysis during six years.
 SETTING--Thyroid clinic serving the Grampian region.
 PATIENTS--574 consecutive patients presenting with a discrete thyroid swelling, of whom 179 (31%) were classified clinically as having a dominant area of enlargement within a multinodular gland.
 RESULTS--After clinical and cytological assessment 77 dominant swellings were excised.
 Of the excised swellings, 45 were non-neoplastic and 32 neoplastic, including 11 malignant lesions.
 The minimum incidence of neoplasia and malignancy in all 179 dominant swellings was therefore 18% and 6% respectively.
 CONCLUSION--Dominant thyroid swellings should be regarded with greater clinical suspicion than has been traditional.
