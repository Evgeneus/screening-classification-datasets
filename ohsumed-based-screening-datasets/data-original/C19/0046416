Pseudonormoglycemia in diabetic ketoacidosis with elevated triglycerides.
 A 24-year-old newly diagnosed male patient with diabetes presented with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) (pH 7.16, HCO3 6.0) and extreme hypertriglyceridemia (239.35 mmol/L).
 The diagnosis of DKA was delayed because of the apparent depression of the true serum glucose (to 11 mmol/L).
 He was treated with intravenous (IV) insulin and rehydration, which normalized his pH, HCO3, and triglyceride levels.
 To the authors' knowledge, this is both the highest triglyceride level recorded and the first report of a high triglyceride level as the apparent cause of a factitiously low glucose level.
