Hormonal and local factors in hypertension.
 The cause of primary (essential) hypertension remains unknown, but a number of circulating hormones and endothelium-derived factors are probably involved.
 This review summarizes recent evidence on the roles of hyperinsulinemia, the renin-angiotensin system, atrial natriuretic factor, and three endothelium-derived factors--prostacyclin, endothelium-derived relaxing factor, and endothelin.
