Thyrotropin-secreting pituitary adenomas: report of seven cases.
 Seven patients with hyperthyroidism due to a TSH-secreting pituitary macroadenoma have been observed of a total of 800 patients with pituitary tumors over a period of 15 yr.
 Serum TSH levels varied between 1.1-36.3 mU/L.
 The serum alpha-subunit level was low in 1 case, while in 4 other cases the concentration was elevated and varied between 3.7-7.8 micrograms/L.
 Serum TSH beta levels were normal in the 4 cases in which it was determined.
 Serum GH or PRL levels were elevated in 5 cases.
 In 1 patient the cosecretion of TSH, GH, and PRL was confirmed by immunocytochemical examination.
 Serum TSH and alpha-subunit responses to TRH, GnRH, CRF, GRF, dexamethasone, methimazole, T3, and bromocriptine administration were variable when studied.
 Serum TSH and alpha-subunit circadian rhythms were absent in 1 case and inverted in another.
 A serum alpha-subunit pulsatility without TSH pulses was observed in 1 patient.
 Five patients underwent transsphenoidal adenomectomy.
 Three of 4 patients operated on in our center were cured, but a recurrence of the adenoma was found in 1 of them after 5 yr.
 The fifth patient was not cured.
 Treatment with octreotide in 3 patients resulted in normalization of serum TSH, GH, and thyroid hormones levels.
 Cosecretion of PRL in 1 case and alpha-subunit in 2 cases was also inhibited.
 Partial tachyphylaxis occurred in 1 patient.
 In summary, heterogeneity in clinical presentation, hormonal expression, and therapeutic response appears to characterize these TSH-secreting adenomas.
