Isolated cryptococcosis of the adrenal gland.
 A case of isolated adrenal cryptococcosis is reported.
 A patient with a history of diabetes mellitus had symptoms of left flank pain.
 Roentgenological and sonographic findings of the adrenal gland were indicative of a malignant tumour.
 Tissue obtained from surgery showed fungal granuloma and a poorly encapsulated cryptococcal organism was identified by special stains.
 A post-operative serum cryptococcal antigen test was positive, and the patient was successfully treated with surgery and a course of amphotericin B.
 After a 7-month follow-up period, there is no evidence of recurrence or dissemination.
