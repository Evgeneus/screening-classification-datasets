Apathetic thyrotoxicosis in adolescence.
 We here describe a case of apathetic thyrotoxicosis in a 16-year-old female subject who presented with a range of non-specific symptoms.
 Apart from a history of significant weight loss, there were no other signs or symptoms indicative of hyperthyroidism.
 The diagnosis was made incidentally upon thyroid function testing, and there was a prompt clinical response to anti-thyroid therapy.
 The diagnostic pitfalls of this unusual presentation in the young are highlighted.
 A history of weight loss and a clinical index of suspicion will lead to the diagnosis, which is readily confirmed biochemically.
