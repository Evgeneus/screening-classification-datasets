Abnormal erythemal response and elevated T lymphocyte HRPT mutant frequency in Cockayne's syndrome.
 In three children with Cockayne's syndrome (CS), skin exposed to ultraviolet radiation responded transiently either with erythematous papules or an exaggerated sunburn-like response, without chronic actinic damage.
 Irradiation monochromator tests demonstrated an abnormal delay or reduction in the threshold to ultraviolet (UVB) irradiation-induced erythema similar to that of xeroderma pigmentosum (XP).
 As with XP there was an elevated frequency of mutants resistant to 6-thioguanine in circulating T lymphocytes.
 The mutant frequency in a single obligate heterozygote was normal.
 In contrast to XP, in the two CS individuals studied, adaptive cell-mediated immunity and natural killer cell function were normal.
 Because the risk of skin cancer is very high in XP but not in CS, the normal immune function in CS provides evidence that immune surveillance may be important in UV tumorigenesis.
