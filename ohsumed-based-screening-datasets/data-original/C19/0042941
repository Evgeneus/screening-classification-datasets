Hyperechoic renal medullary pyramids in infants and children 
 Fifty-five children (34 boys, 21 girls; age range, 1 day to 18 years) with increased echogenicity of the renal medullary pyramids at ultrasound evaluation were identified.
 The clinical diagnoses associated with hyperechoic medullary pyramids could be separated based on the presence or absence of hypercalciuria.
 Patients with drug-induced hypercalciuria included 10 infants treated with furosemide, two treated with long-term steroid therapy, and one treated with excessive amounts of vitamin D.
 Other clinical conditions associated with hypercalciuria included renal tubular acidosis (n = 10), Bartter syndrome (n = 5), hyperparathyroidism (n = 3), Williams syndrome (n = 2) and medullary sponge kidney (n = 2).
 Ten children with transient renal insufficiency and three with sickle cell disease had normal urine calcium concentration.
 Isolated disease entities accounted for the remainder of cases.
 A specific diagnosis can usually be made in a patient with hyperechoic renal medullary pyramids by using a systematic clinical approach that includes evaluation of patient age, serum and urine calcium concentration, and renal function.
