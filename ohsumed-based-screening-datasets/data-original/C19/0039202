Expression of type III hyperlipoproteinaemia in a subject with secondary hypothyroidism bearing the apolipoprotein E2/2 phenotype.
 Post-surgical hypothyroidism developed in a now 43-year-old woman with complete insufficiency of the anterior pituitary gland who discontinued levothyroxine replacement therapy.
 Serum cholesterol and serum triglyceride levels increased in parallel, and classical type III hyperlipoproteinaemia (HLP) with xanthoma striata palmaris developed.
 The patient is homozygous for apolipoprotein (apo) E2.
 The case reported here represents the first example of manifestation of type III hyperlipoproteinaemia in a subject with secondary hypothyroidism bearing the apo E2/2 phenotype.
