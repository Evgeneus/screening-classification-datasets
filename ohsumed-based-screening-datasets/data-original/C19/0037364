Octreotide stimulates insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) levels in acromegaly.
 Insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) circulate in a complexed state with several binding proteins (BPs).
 Of these, IGFBP-1 is regulated by hormonal and nutritional factors.
 The somatostatin analogue, octreotide, has been used to effectively control hypersomaototropism in acromegaly.
 IGFBP-1 levels were measured by RIA in 17 acromegalic patients receiving octreotide.
 Serum hormone sampling was conducted hourly for 8 hr periods.
 Among 13 octreotide responders, mean pre-treatment basal GH, IGF-1, and IGFBP-1 levels were 19 +/- 5 micrograms/L, 1021 +/- 168 micrograms/L, and 36 +/- 8 micrograms/L respectively.
 One month following octreotide treatment, an acute subcutaneous injection (100 micrograms) maximally attenuated GH to 3 +/- 0.6 microgram/L (18% of control, P less than 0.03) and IGF-1 to 467 +/- 75 micrograms/L (46% of control, P less than 0.008) after 4 hrs.
 IGFBP-1 levels, however, were stimulated to 95 +/- 16 micrograms/L (297% of control, P less than 0.003) during the same time period.
 A significant increase in IGFBP-1 levels occurred within 2 hrs (158% of baseline, P less than 0.03), and was sustained until the 7th hr following injection.
 Insulin, a known suppressor of IGFBP-1, did not change during this time.
 Among the 4 octreotide non-responders, mean basal IGFBP-1 levels were 42 +/- 4 micrograms/L, and 4 hrs following octreotide administration IGFBP-1 was 40 +/- 7 micrograms/L.
 Octreotide induced a dynamic inverse relationship between circulating GH and IGFBP-1 levels (r = -0.73, P less than 0.001).
 The absence of IGFBP-1 changes in octreotide non-responders and the non-suppression of insulin in octreotide responsive patients, suggest a direct GH-mediated mechanism of IGFBP-1 regulation in octreotide treated patients with acromegaly.
 IGFBP-1 may be another useful marker in evaluating the response of acromegaly to octreotide treatment in patients who experience clinical benefit but equivocal GH and IGF-1 attenuation.
