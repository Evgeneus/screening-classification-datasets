Addison's disease.
 Addison's disease is an uncommon endocrine condition manifested by a variety of nonspecific symptoms, such as malaise, anorexia and nausea.
 Symptoms usually do not occur until most of the adrenal gland has been destroyed.
 Autoimmune disease has surpassed tuberculosis as the primary cause of Addison's disease.
 Nevertheless, tuberculosis still accounts for a significant proportion of cases.
 The rapid adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is useful for identifying adrenal insufficiency.
 Maintenance therapy consists of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
