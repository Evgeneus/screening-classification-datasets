The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone pulse generator in men: abnormalities and clinical management.
 Most men with hypogonadotropic eunuchoidism have absent luteinizing hormone and presumably absent luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone pulses.
 Pulsatile luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone therapy is effective in restoring normal gonadotropin secretion and testicular function and inducing fertility in men with hypogonadotropic eunuchoidism.
 Furthermore, pulsatile (versus continuous) luteinizing hormone-releasing stimulation of the pituitary gland is an absolute requirement for normal gonadotropin secretion.
 Men with idiopathic oligoazoospermia and selective elevation of follicle-stimulating hormone levels have slow luteinizing hormone and presumably luteinizing hormone-releasing pulse frequency.
 In these men, pulsatile luteinizing hormone--releasing treatment is effective in decreasing serum follicle-stimulating hormone levels, but it is unclear whether spermatogenesis and fertility are improved.
