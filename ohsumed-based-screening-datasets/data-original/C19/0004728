Screening diabetic patients for microalbuminuria.
 Abnormal rates of urinary albumin excretion have been shown to predict the development of nephropathy and may signal atherosclerotic disease in diabetic patients.
 This study demonstrated the feasibility of measuring microalbuminuria in diabetic patients from a large family practice population.
 Although only one half of the 473 diabetic patients offered free screening took advantage of the testing, those participating did not differ in terms of sex, race, type of diabetes, mean age, systolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose levels from those not electing to participate.
 Over 40% of those screened had abnormally elevated albumin excretion rates as defined as greater than 0.02 g of albumin per gram of creatinine.
 Those participating in the screening perceived the process as useful and were able to comply with directions for overnight urine collection.
 Results show that screening for microalbuminuria in diabetic patients cared for by family physicians is feasible, simple, and inexpensive.
 Interventions to slow or reverse the progression of abnormal microalbuminuria and future risk for nephropathy in those with diabetes are underway.
