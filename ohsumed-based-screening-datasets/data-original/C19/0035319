Reversible hypertriiodothyroninaemia due to adrenal insufficiency.
 It is well known that an excess of glucocorticoids affects thyroid tests.
 The effect of adrenal deficiency on thyroid hormones is less well defined.
 We here describe the case of a 33-year-old woman with Cushing's disease who was cured by trans-sphenoidal surgery.
 During the postoperative period, a secondary adrenal insufficiency developed.
 The thyroid blood tests then revealed elevated L-triiodothyronine (T3) levels and a decrease in reverse T3.
 These findings suggest that secondary adrenal deficiency may be associated with high T3 levels, which may be due to an increase in the peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3.
