The incidence of thyroid stimulating blocking antibodies during the hypothyroid phase in patients with subacute thyroiditis.
 The etiology of subacute (de Quervain's) thyroiditis (SAT) is uncertain, although it probably represents a nonspecific inflammatory response by the thyroid to a variety of viruses.
 It has been suggested that nonimmune processes are involved in SAT patients who have negative autoantibody titers.
 The disease has a variable course; although it is self-limited in most cases, some patients develop transient hypothyroidism, and others do not during the recovery period.
 The present study was performed to evaluate the occurrence of TSH receptor antibody (TRAb), measured by RRA (TSH binding inhibitor), TRAb measured by stimulation assay (thyroid-stimulating antibody), and TRAb measured by blocking assay [TSH-blocking antibody (TSH-BAb)] activity in 68 patients with SAT who had negative autoantibody titers.
 The patients were divided into 2 groups: group I, 31 patients who developed hypothyroidism during the recovery period; and group II, 37 patients who remained euthyroid during recovery.
 Positive immunoglobulin activity occurred in about 20% of group I patients during follow-up, but in only 3% of group II patients.
 About 20% of group I patients developed positive TSH-BAb activity and were hypothyroid, requiring exogenous hormone therapy for 1.2-3.5 yr, whereas hypothyroidism was relatively transient in group I patients who had negative TSH-BAb activity (2-6 months).
 Although increased TSH-BAb activity may account for hypothyroidism in some patients with SAT, the precise mechanism for the development of transient hypothyroidism in SAT remains enigmatic.
