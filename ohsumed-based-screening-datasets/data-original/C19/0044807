Case report: hypothyroidism due to pneumocystis carinii thyroiditis in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Pneumocystis carinii is the most common cause of opportunistic pulmonary infection in AIDS patients and disseminated disease is being recognized with increasing frequency.
 We describe a patient with cavitary pulmonary disease, lymphadenopathy, thyroiditis, and associated hypothyroidism, all a result of P.
 carinii.
 The organism was easily demonstrated in a fine-needle aspirate specimen of the thyroid.
 This is the second reported case of clinically apparent Pneumocystis thyroiditis and the first reported case of hypothyroidism due to an opportunistic infection in a patient with AIDS.
 Clinicians should be aware of this entity and request a Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate stain of appropriate cytology specimens to make the diagnosis.
