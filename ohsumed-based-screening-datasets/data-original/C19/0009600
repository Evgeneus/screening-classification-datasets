Anti TSH-receptor antibodies in pregnant patients with autoimmune thyroid disorder.
 The study was designed to test further the usefulness of the radioreceptor assay of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) binding inhibitory immunoglobulins (TBII) and the bioassay of thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSAb) or TSH stimulated cAMP response inhibitory antibodies (TBkAb) in the prediction of neonatal thyroid dysfunction.
 Of 63 pregnant women with a current or past history of autoimmune thyroid disorder, 11 (one with active and six with a past history of Graves' disease and four with autoimmune thyroiditis) gave birth to a baby with transient hyper or hypo-thyroidism.
 Only high maternal titres (which could persist after partial thyroidectomy) of anti TSH-receptor antibodies (TRAb) led to neonatal hyperthyroidism.
 Both types of assay were able to detect the antibodies responsible for transitory neonatal autoimmune thyroid disease.
 TBII values reflected TSAb titres so that there was a significant correlation between the results of both assays in women with Graves' disease and in neonatal sera.
 Positive TBII and TBkAb activities were present in 5 of the 28 women with autoimmune thyroiditis.
 Therefore, when TBII is positive, the functional characterization of the antibodies warrants the use of the bioassay.
