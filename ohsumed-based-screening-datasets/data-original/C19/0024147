PET as a tool in the clinical evaluation of pituitary adenomas.
 Positron emission tomography (PET) was used in over 400 examinations in patients with pituitary adenoma.
 It was demonstrated that PET with carbon-11-methionine can give valuable complementary information in the diagnosis of this tumor due to PET's ability to adequately depict viable tumor tissue in contrast to fibrosis, cysts and necrosis.
 Furthermore, PET with dopamine D2 receptor ligands can characterize the degree of receptor binding and thus give information as to the prerequisites for dopamine agonist treatment.
 Most important is the very high sensitivity given by PET with carbon-11-methionine in the evaluation of treatment effects.
 It is concluded that when properly used PET can be fully justified in the clinical handling of patients with pituitary adenomas and other intracranial tumors.
