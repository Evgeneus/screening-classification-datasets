Definitive localization of X-linked Kallman syndrome (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia) to Xp22.3: close linkage to the hypervariable repeat sequence CRI-S232 [published erratum appears in Am J Hum Genet 1990 Nov;47(5):883]
 Kallmann syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous disease characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia.
 Six families in which the disorder followed an X-linked inheritance were investigated by linkage analysis.
 Diagnostic criteria were uniformly applied and included tests for hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia.
 Close linkage was found by using the hypervariable repeated sequence CRI-S232 (DXS278) previously mapped to Xp22.3.
 At a maximum lod score of 6.5, the recombination fraction was calculated as .03.
 Of 30 fully informative meioses, one recombination between the disease locus and the loci recognized by probe CRI-S232 was observed.
 When an independent approach is used, these results confirm the X-linked Kallmann syndrome assignment previously made by deletion mapping, and allow definitive localization of the syndrome assignment previously made by deletion mapping, and allow definitive localization of the syndrome to the Xp22.3 region.
 This opens the way to carrier detection and to the identification of a gene responsible for this disorder.
