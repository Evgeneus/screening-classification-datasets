Hypercholesterolemia in diabetes and glucose intolerance in the U.S. population.
 The prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, according to the guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program, has been determined in a national survey of diabetes and glucose intolerance.
 Rates of elevated total cholesterol in people with diabetes in the United States are only slightly greater than in those without diabetes after adjusting for age and sex.
 Nevertheless, high or borderline high total cholesterol is common in diabetes and is present in 70% of adults with diagnosed diabetes and 77% with undiagnosed diabetes in the U.S.
 population.
 Of these individuals, 95% have evidence of coronary heart disease or two or more risk factors for heart disease and should therefore have their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol measured.
 Based on our national data, LDL cholesterol levels warranting dietary treatment for hypercholesterolemia would be expected in 85% of these people.
 Although elevated LDL cholesterol is uncommon in people with diabetes who have total cholesterol of less than 200 mg/dl, other risk factors for coronary heart disease are very frequent (100% of men, 73% of women), and low total and LDL cholesterol may mask low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
 Therefore, investigation of blood lipid levels and coronary heart disease risk factors should be routine in all patients with diabetes, and treatment strategies should include management of lipid disorders and the multiple other risk factors for coronary heart disease that are highly prevalent in these patients.
