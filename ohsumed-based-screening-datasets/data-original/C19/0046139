Sonography in neonatal congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
 Adrenal gland size was evaluated in six infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
 All of the infants had a severe deficiency of the 21-hydroxylase enzyme resulting in the salt-losing form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
 The adrenal measurements were compared with those of 40 consecutive age-matched, asymptomatic infants.
 Mean adrenal length was 14.4 mm and width was 1.9 mm in asymptomatic infants, whereas in infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia mean adrenal length was 23.7 mm and width was 5.3 mm.
 Although infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may have normal-sized adrenal glands, mean length measurements of 20 mm or greater and mean width measurements of 4 mm or greater suggest the diagnosis.
