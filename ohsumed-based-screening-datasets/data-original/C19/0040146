Can urinary thyroid hormone loss cause hypothyroidism?
 Four patients presented with nephrotic syndrome associated with hypothyroidism; none had thyroid antibodies.
 Hypothyroidism resolved on remission of nephrotic syndrome in two patients; thyroxine (T4) replacement was ineffective during periods of gross proteinuria in another, and the fourth had had normal thyroid function a year before presentation.
 Urinary T4 excretion was measured in ten further patients with proteinuria.
 It was detectable in the urine in five, who had significantly lower serum free T4 (8.5 [95% confidence interval 5.8-11.2] vs 13.9 [11.1-16.7] pmol/l; p less than 0.01) and free triiodothyronine (3.1 [2.2-4.0] vs 4.9 [3.8-6.0] pmol/l; p less than 0.01) concentrations than the five patients without detectable urinary T4.
