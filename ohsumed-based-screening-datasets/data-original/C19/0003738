Hypothyroidism and pleural effusions.
 Serous effusions have been thought to be an unusual complication of hypothyroidism and most commonly have been associated with ascites, pericardial fluid and heart failure.
 Pleural fluid as an isolated finding in hypothyroidism is apparently rare and complete analysis of these hypothyroid-associated pleural effusions has not been described.
 To determine the frequency, chemical characteristics and clinical associations of hypothyroidism and pleural effusions, the medical records of 128 patients with hypothyroidism (defined by an increased serum TSH concentration) were reviewed.
 The majority of effusions in patients with hypothyroidism were due to other diseases.
 Effusions solely due to hypothyroidism appeared to be a real entity.
 These effusions were borderline between exudates and transudates and showed little evidence of inflammation.
