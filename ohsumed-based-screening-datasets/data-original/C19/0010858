Soft tissue calcification in renal failure.
 Disorders of phosphorus, calcium, and vitamin D are common in patients with renal failure.
 Medical management, including dietary phosphorus restriction, administration of phosphate binding agents, and calcium and vitamin D sterol supplementation, must be instituted to control serum concentrations of these substances because of the loss of normal homeostatic mechanisms.
 If these measures are not employed, soft tissue calcification and hyperparathyroidism may result.
 We report the case of a 22-year-old woman with endstage renal disease treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis who developed secondary hyperparathyroidism and tumorous calcinosis as a result of noncompliance with dietary phosphorus restriction and phosphate-binding agent therapy.
 The etiology and treatment of soft tissue calcification in patients with renal disease are discussed.
 Compliance with dietary restrictions and phosphate binding agents is frequently problematic in this population.
 Pharmacists should play an active role in educating patients with renal disease on the consequences of noncompliance with dietary and drug therapy.
