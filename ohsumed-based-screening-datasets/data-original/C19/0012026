Distribution of deletions and seven point mutations on CYP21B genes in three clinical forms of steroid 21-hydroxylase deficiency.
 To characterize mutations in the CYP21B gene that are responsible for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), DNA samples from 91 French patients have been studied by allelic-specific oligonucleotide hybridization and Southern blot analysis.
 Seven sites mostly found in the CYP21A pseudogene and deletions of the functional CYP21B gene have been screened.
 Gene conversions involving small DNA segments accounted for 57% of the tested mutations and probably cause 74% of the mutations responsible for the disease.
 Complete deletion of the CYP21B gene accounted for 18% of the CAH mutations in the whole sample and for 21% in the classical form of the disease.
 Three mutations were found associated with specific clinical forms of the disease: a G-C substitution in the seventh exon was associated with the late-onset form of the disease, and both an 8-bp depletion in the third exon and complete deletion of CYP21B were associated with the salt-wasting form.
