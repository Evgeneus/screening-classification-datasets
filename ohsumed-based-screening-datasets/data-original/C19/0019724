Direct evidence that ganglioside is an integral component of the thyrotropin receptor.
 Gangliosides were extracted from purified human and porcine thyrotropin (TSH) receptors (TSH-R) and were detected by probing with an 125I-labeled sialic acid-specific lectin, Limax flavus agglutinin.
 Gangliosides copurified with human and porcine TSH-R migrated between monosialoganglioside GM1 and disialoganglioside GD1a.
 Ceramide glycanase digestion of the purified human TSH-R-associated glycolipid confirmed its ganglioside nature.
 It was resistant to Vibrio cholerae sialidase, which digests all gangliosides except GM1, but was sensitive to Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase, which digests all gangliosides including GM1.
 These findings indicate that the human TSH-R contains ganglioside that belongs to the galactosyl(beta 1----3)-N-acetylgalactosaminyl (beta 1----4)-[N-acetylneuraminyl(alpha 2----3)]galactosyl(beta 1----4) glucosyl(beta 1----1)ceramide (GM1) family.
 Its intimate association with receptor protein implies a key role for ganglioside in the structure and function of the TSH-R.
