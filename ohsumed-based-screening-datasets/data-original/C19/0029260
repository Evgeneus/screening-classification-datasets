Photodynamic therapy for rat pituitary tumor in vitro and in vivo using pheophorbide-a and white light.
 This is the first report on the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for rat pituitary tumor in vivo.
 Rat pituitary tumor (GH3) cells were cultured, GH3 tumor was subcutaneously implanted in nude mice, and pheophorbide-a (Ph-a) and white light were prepared.
 Photocytotoxicity proportional to Ph-a concentration, intensity of irradiation, and incubation time was observed in vitro.
 Despite the delay in the disappearance of Ph-a from the tumor, Ph-a in the pituitary gland rapidly decreased after intravenous administration in vivo.
 Through PDT, the tumor grossly disappeared, the plasma levels of rat growth hormone secreted from the tumor also remarkably decreased, and the development of giantism was inhibited.
 These results indicate that PDT is effective against rat pituitary tumor.
