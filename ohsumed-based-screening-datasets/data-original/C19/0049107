Effect of aldose reductase inhibition on resistance to ischemic conduction block in diabetic subjects.
 OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of aldose reductase inhibition with ponalrestat on resistance to ischemic conduction block (RICB) in diabetic subjects.
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Twenty-one healthy diabetic subjects without neuropathy were studied.
 Subjects were randomized to take either a double-blind trial of 600 mg ponalrestat or placebo once daily for 6 wk.
 The median nerve action potential (MNAP) and conduction velocity (NCV), before and after 20 min of forearm ischemia, were measured at the start and finish of the study.
 Results: RICB (MNAP remaining after ischemia) decreased from 39.5 to 29.4% in the ponalrestat-treated group (P less than 0.05) and increased from 48.1 +/- 10.2 to 49.5 +/- 6.5% in the placebo-treated group.
 MNAP and NCV were unchanged in both groups.
 CONCLUSIONS: Aldose reductase inhibition with ponalrestat partly reverses RICB in diabetes, perhaps by improving nerve hypoxia or reducing nerve energy substrates.
