Renal disease in noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 Diabetic nephropathy now accounts for approximately one-third of all patients who develop end-stage renal disease.
 The estimated cost to supply renal replacement therapy for this population now exceeds $750 million.
 The relatively recent realization that half of these individuals suffer from noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus has sparked increased interest in attempts to understand the pathologic processes involved and how they may be similar or different from those alterations seen in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.
 Basic and clinical investigation continues in an attempt to solve the puzzle of pathogenesis, as well as answer questions about the clinical usefulness of microalbuminuria and the appropriate management of hypertension in this population.
