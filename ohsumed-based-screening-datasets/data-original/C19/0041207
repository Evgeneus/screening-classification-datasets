Maternal hemodynamics in pregnancies complicated by hyperthyroidism.
 The hemodynamics of six pregnant women with hyperthyroidism were studied before and after therapy.
 Cardiac output was measured by Doppler technique, and blood pressure by automated cuff.
 When compared with values in euthyroid pregnant women, blood pressure (83.6 mmHg, P less than .001), heart rate (89.2 beats per minute, P less than .001), cardiac output (11.2 L/minute, P less than .001), and stroke volume (123 mL, P less than .001) were significantly elevated.
 Total peripheral resistance was significantly reduced (609 dyne.second.cm-5, P less than .001).
 Despite normalization of thyroid indices after therapy, cardiac output remained markedly elevated (9.7 L/minute, P less than .001) and vascular resistance remained reduced (708 dyne.second.cm-5, P = .01).
 Although the hemodynamics of pregnant thyrotoxic women normalize with therapy, they remain significantly hyperdynamic.
