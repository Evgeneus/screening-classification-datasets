Effects of glycemic control on red cell deformability determined by using the cell transit time analyzer.
 There is considerable evidence that blood viscosity is greater than normal in diabetes, and decreased red blood cell deformability has been suggested as the cause.
 However, viscosity can be influenced by changes in the properties of blood proteins in addition to red cells.
 Direct interpretation of red cell filtrometry data in terms of deformability has been complicated by the interfering effect of white cells and platelets and clogging of micropores.
 We have thus used the cell transit time analyzer, a new filtrometric procedure that eliminates these complications and produces an individual red cell micropore transit time profile, to reassess diabetic red cell deformability.
 Samples from 26 patients with diabetes and an equal number of subjects without diabetes who served as controls were assayed by the cell transit time analyzer at 2 and at 4 cm hydrostatic pressure.
 Samples from patients with diabetes and controls were sex and age matched for daily runs.
 At 2 cm H2O, red blood cell transit time for the patients with diabetes was 2.73 +/- 0.05 milliseconds as compared with 2.67 +/- 0.05 milliseconds for controls (p not significant).
 The ratio of transit time for patients with diabetes to that of controls (Td/Tnd) was 1.03 +/- 0.01 (p less than 0.05, Wilcoxon) at 2 cm H2O and 1.02 +/- 0.01 (p not significant) at 4 cm H2O.
