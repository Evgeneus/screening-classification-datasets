Islet allografts in the cryptorchid testes of spontaneously diabetic BB/Wor dp rats: response to glucose, glipizide, and arginine.
 The aim of this study was to examine insulin and glucagon secretory patterns in successfully transplanted spontaneously diabetic BB/Wor dp rats.
 Diabetic, BB/Wor dp rats received abdominal, intratesticular islet grafts of MHC-compatible BB/Wor dr donor rats without immunosuppression.
 After a period of 74 +/- 15 days of normoglycemia, they were given the following challenges: 1) glucose, by mouth, 2) a single oral dose of glipizide, with glucose, and 3) arginine, by iv infusion.
 The pertinent results included the mean fasting plasma glucose levels of control, Sprague-Dawley (C), of transplanted BB/Wor dp (T), and nontransplanted, insulin treated, diabetic BB/Wor dp (D), and they were, respectively, 97 +/- 4 mg/dl, 110 +/- 3 mg/dl, and 350 +/- 40 mg/dl.
 Fasting plasma insulin levels in C and T rats were 21.9 +/- 3 microU/ml, and 20.4 +/- 2 microU/ml, respectively.
 Fasting plasma glucagon levels in C, T, and D, were 37.8 +/- 5.7 pg/ml, 43.4 +/- 4.6 pg/ml, and 47.4 +/- 4.9 pg/ml, respectively.
 During oral glucose tolerance test, the pattern of insulin secretion in the C and T rats was identical with a peak attained at 15 min.
 Glucose caused a 70% suppression of plasma glucagon levels in C rats (P less than 0.01); T rats suppressed 14%, but this was not statistically significant; D rats failed to suppress.
 Glipizide plus glucose caused an improved glucose tolerance in T rats without significantly affecting insulin levels.
 In the same rats, glipizide resulted in a significant suppression of glucagon compared with levels in the presence of glucose alone.
 Arginine caused a minimal release of insulin in T rats and a major glucagon secretory response in D rats.
 Pancreatic glucagon content was significantly (P less than 0.03) lower in C and T, compared with D rats.
 Furthermore, the transplanted testes of T contained substantial amounts of glucagon.
 In summary, these data suggest that grafted testes in spontaneously diabetic BB/Wor dp rats contain both beta and alpha-cells and that these cells have the capacity to respond to specific secretagogues independently.
