Observations on the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome: a report of three cases.
 Nelson's syndrome is generally regarded as an unusual sequela of primary bilateral adrenalectomy when performed for Cushing's disease.
 It is classically defined by cutaneous hyperpigmentation, considerably elevated adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, and an enlarged sella turcica.
 In this report, we present three cases initially treated by transsphenoidal sellar exploration for Cushing's disease.
 In two of these cases, remission of hypercortisolism did not occur after the initial pituitary exploration.
 A microadenomectomy was performed in one case and, in the other, no microadenoma was found.
 In both, Nelson's syndrome occurred after adrenalectomy.
 A second transsphenoidal operation and radiotherapy were required to control tumor growth.
 In another case, transsphenoidal adenomectomy of an ACTH-secreting tumor initially led to a remission of hypercortisolism for 4 years, but recurrent Cushing's disease necessitated adrenalectomy, and again Nelson's syndrome occurred.
 The documentation of a pre-existing ACTH-secreting basophilic pituitary microadenoma before adrenalectomy, as seen in two of our cases, has not been previously reported, and these observations of "non-classical" courses have major implications for the pathophysiology of Nelson's syndrome.
