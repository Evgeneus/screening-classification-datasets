Invasive polymycotic pneumonia in an uncontrolled diabetic.
 We describe the clinical course of a patient with invasive polymycotic pneumonia due to Rhizopus arrhizus and Candida albicans.
 Both organisms were recovered from antemortem sputum cultures, and their clinical significance was confirmed by histologic examination of the lungs at autopsy.
 Circumstances leading to polymycotic infection are discussed, with special attention given to polymycotic infections involving Zygomycetes.
