Juxta-articular calcifications in secondary hyperparathyroidism: resorption after parathyroidectomy.
 Soft-tissue calcification in chronic renal failure has been described, but little is understood about its pathogenesis or progression.
 Our patient's case is a dramatic example of complete resorption of soft-tissue juxta-articular calcification in secondary hyperparathyroidism after removal of parathyroid gland tissue.
 This resolution is most likely due to normalization of the calcium-phosphate ion product.
