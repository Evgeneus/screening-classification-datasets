Nonpalpable breast lesions: stereotactic automated large-core biopsies.
 One hundred two patients with mammographically suspicious, nonpalpable lesions underwent stereotactic breast biopsy with a biopsy gun and an automated 14-gauge cutting needle.
 After biopsy, a localization wire was placed and surgical biopsy performed.
 There was agreement of the histologic results from the gun biopsy and the surgical biopsy specimens in 98 cases (96%), including 22 of 23 carcinomas (96%) (kappa = 0.936).
 The gun biopsy yielded findings that led to the correct diagnosis in two cases involving lesions that were missed at surgical biopsy; two lesions found at surgery were missed at gun biopsy.
 The results of this study suggest that the use of 14-gauge needles improves agreement between surgical and needle core biopsy findings and that stereotactic biopsy with an automated needle and gun can be an acceptable alternative to surgical biopsy in women with mammographically suspicious breast lesions.
