Bile acids in human plasma interfere with cholecystokinin bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini.
 A bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini was used to measure fasting plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations in 105 patients with various kinds of gastrointestinal diseases, 17 patients with diabetes mellitus, and 6 healthy volunteers.
 High plasma CCK bioactivities were observed in patients with obstructive jaundice, choledocolithiasis, and primary biliary cirrhosis.
 Twenty-three samples with high CCK bioactivities were assayed by the same bioassay after the addition of a specific CCK antagonist and by a CCK radioimmunoassay in order to determine whether the high CCK-like bioactivity was due to circulating CCK or other factors.
 High CCK bioactivities were partially inhibited by the specific CCK antagonist, CR-1409, but the activities were not totally abolished.
 The residual bioactivities (not inhibited by CR-1409) correlated with plasma bile acid concentrations.
 The inhibitable CCK bioactivities correlated with plasma CCK levels obtained by radioimmunoassay.
 Although the bioassay using dispersed pancreatic acini has several advantages for measuring plasma CCK, this method overestimates CCK bioactivities in patients with high plasma bile acid concentrations.
