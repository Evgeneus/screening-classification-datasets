Central changes in hypothyroid myopathy: a case report.
 A muscle biopsy from a patient with hypothyroid myopathy showed striking central changes.
 "Cores" were seen in most type 1 fibers with oxidative enzyme preparations.
 Electron microscopy of these areas revealed Z disc streaming, myofilament disruption, and absent mitochondria.
 The myopathy rapidly improved with thyroxine treatment.
 This biopsy is of interest, as numerous "cores" have not previously been reported in hypothyroid myopathy.
