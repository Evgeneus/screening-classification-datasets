Diabetes mellitus--a newly described risk factor for infection from Salmonella enteritidis.
 Infections due to Salmonella serotype enteritidis have increased markedly in the northeastern United States.
 Due to the potential severity of these infections, host risk factors for infection were determined in the largest nosocomial S.
 enteritidis outbreak to have occurred in the United States.
 In a case-control study, patients in a New York City hospital who developed infection after exposure to an S.
 enteritidis-contaminated meal were more likely to be medication-dependent diabetics than were those who did not develop infection (17/75 vs.
 7/80, Mantel-Haenszel adjusted odds ratio = 3.1, 95% confidence interval = 1.1, 8.6).
 Proposed mechanisms for diabetes as a risk factor for infection include decreased gastric acidity in diabetic patients and an autonomic neuropathy of the small bowel that reduces intestinal motility and prolongs gastrointestinal transit time.
