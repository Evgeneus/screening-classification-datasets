Disturbance of basal and stimulated serum levels of intact parathyroid hormone in primary hyperparathyroidism.
 In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, measurements were made of basal and stimulated levels of intact parathyroid hormone (PTH).
 The basal PTH values were elevated in all but six of 89 patients and provided clear separation towards normal individuals (n = 75) and patients with hypercalcemia of other origin (n = 34).
 The PTH value correlated with the serum calcium concentration in hyperparathyroidism and with the weight of excised parathyroid adenomas but not with that of chief cell hyperplasias.
 A constant ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid infusion during 60 minutes of induced essentially linear reductions of plasma-ionized calcium concentrations, averaging 0.02 mmol/L/10 minutes, which were associated with swift, curvilinear, elevations of PTH levels that reached a plateau after 10 to 20 minutes.
 The increment in serum PTH level correlated with the basal PTH value both in patients with hyperparathyroidism and controls.
 However, in proportion to the much greater glandular mass in the patients with hyperparathyroidism, the secretion of PTH was relatively reduced.
 The findings support the value of the intact PTH assay in the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia and show that PTH secretion in vivo is extremely sensitive to hypocalcemic stimulation, that the pathological parathyroid tissue in hyperparathyroidism is characterized by a reduction of hormone release per unit weight, and that the hormone secretion in hyperparathyroidism operates closer to its maximal capacity than under normal circumstances.
