Extracapsular cataract surgery with lens implantation in diabetics with and without proliferative retinopathy 
 In a retrospective study we have examined all diabetics (66 operated eyes) and an equal number of non-diabetic matched controls who underwent extracapsular cataract extracation (ECCE) with intraocular lens (IOL) implantation over a two-year period ending in December 1987.
 Of the diabetic patients' 76% eyes improved by at least two lines of Snellen acuity postoperatively.
 Of these patients 68% eyes and of the control eyes 83% achieved an acuity of 6/12 or better.
 In the diabetics the visual outcome depended on the state of the retinopathy and in particular the maculopathy.
 The diabetic group had a greater incidence of postoperative inflammation, but the major complications were related to continuing neovascularisation.
 Early postoperative laser photocoagulation may help to prevent these proliferative complications, and, provided a large, adequate capsulotomy is performed for capsular thickening, the presence of an IOL does not interfere with this photocoagulation.
 We also advise early postoperative assessment, and treatment if necessary, of any maculopathy.
 Diabetic retinopathy should no longer be regarded as a contraindication to intraocular lens insertion.
