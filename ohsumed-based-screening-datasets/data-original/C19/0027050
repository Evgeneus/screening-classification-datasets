Long-term survival rate after vitreous surgery for complications of diabetic retinopathy.
 The survival rate after vitreous surgery for complications of diabetic retinopathy was studied in 552 consecutive patients who underwent operations between 1979 and 1984.
 The 5-year postoperative survival rate was 74.7%.
 Factors associated with a lower survival rate included older age, older age at diagnosis of diabetes, history of renal disease, and a longer duration of diabetes.
 Factors unrelated to survival rate included insulin treatment, sex, and anatomic and visual outcome.
 Improved management of systemic diabetic complications has improved survival rates, a finding reflected in the relatively high rate of long-term survival after diabetic vitrectomy.
