Painful subacute thyroiditis in Hawaii.
 Between 1960 and 1982 we prospectively studied 269 patients with painful subacute thyroiditis to determine the demographic characteristics, seasonality, and natural course of the disease.
 The mean age for all patients was 37.1 years.
 The female:male ratio was 6.7:1.
 At the first visit, disease was bilateral in 69%.
 No epidemic or seasonal pattern was identified.
 The mean duration of thyroid tenderness was 2.2 months and that of palpable thyroid lumps was 2.8 months.
 This time difference, sometimes lasting many months, left a painfree "window" during which the palpable hard residual mass of subacute thyroiditis may be confused with other thyroid problems, especially cancer.
