Spontaneous and corticotropin-releasing factor-induced cytosolic calcium transients in corticotrophs.
 Spontaneous and CRF-stimulated changes in the cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) were studied in two types of corticotrophs: 1) cultured human ACTH-secreting pituitary adenoma cells (hACTH cells), and 2) identified small ovoid corticotrophs cultured from normal rat pituitaries.
 [Ca2+]i was monitored in individual corticotrophs by dual emission microspectrofluorimetry using indo-1 as the intracellular fluorescent Ca2+ probe.
 In hACTH cells, [Ca2+]i measurements were carried out in combination with electrophysiological recordings obtained using whole cell patch-clamp techniques.
 It was shown that a single spontaneous Ca(2+)-dependent action potential led to a marked transient increase in [Ca2+]i in human tumoral corticotrophs.
 Spontaneous fluctuations in [Ca2+]i were also observed in unpatched corticotrophs whether derived from human pituitary tumors or normal rat tissue.
 Based on their striking kinetic features and their sensitivity to external Ca2+, we suggest that these spontaneous [Ca2+]i transients were the consequence of action potential firing.
 Under separate voltage-clamp (patch-clamp) conditions, tumor corticotrophs showed two Ca2+ current components: a low threshold, rapidly inactivating (T-type) current, and a higher threshold, slowly inactivating (L-type) current.
 The dihydropyridine Ca2+ channel blocker PN 200-110 (100 nM) abolished the L-type current without affecting the T-type current, while the inorganic Ca2+ channel blocker Cd2+ (200 microM) suppressed both Ca2+ currents.
 The Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (5 microM) did not affect inward currents in tumor corticotrophs.
 Both L- and T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were involved in controlling [Ca2+]i transients in both tumor and normal corticotrophs, inasmuch as Cd2+ (200 microM) abolished [Ca2+]i) transients, while PN 200-110 (100 nM) greatly diminished, but did not completely abolish, [Ca2+]i transients.
 The latter did not appear to depend on a voltage-dependent Na+ influx, since they were unaffected by tetrodotoxin (5 microM).
 Corticotrophs generate [Ca2+]i transients in response to the hypothalamic secretagogue CRF by acting on their membrane excitability.
 Indeed, we demonstrated in combined fluorescent and electrophysiological experiments that CRF (100 nM) had a coordinate action on human tumoral corticotrophs comprised of a modest depolarization and an increase in the frequency of both action potentials and subsequent [Ca2+]i transients.
 A coincident increase in the peak amplitude of the [Ca2+]i transient and after hyperpolarization was also observed in some CRF-stimulated cells.
 CRF (100 nM) evoked qualitatively similar [Ca2+]i patterns in human tumoral and normal rat corticotrophs not subjected to patch-clamping.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS).
