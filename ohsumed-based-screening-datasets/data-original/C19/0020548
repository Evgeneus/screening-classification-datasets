Red cell Na+/Li+ countertransport in non-insulin-dependent diabetics with diabetic nephropathy.
 Genetic predisposition to essential hypertension, as indicated by increased maximal velocity of Na+/Li+ countertransport in red cells, has been suggested as a marker for the risk of developing diabetic nephropathy.
 To evaluate the validity of this concept in non-insulin-dependent diabetics, we measured the maximal velocity of Na+/Li+ countertransport in red cells in 18 male diabetics suffering from proteinuria due to biopsy proven diabetic glomerulosclerosis (GFR: 51 [range 27 to 146] ml/min/1.73 m2), 17 male diabetics with normoalbuminuria, and in 18 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy control subjects.
 Na+/Li+ countertransport was identical in patients with and without diabetic nephropathy, 0.43 (0.24 to 0.92) versus 0.44 (0.20 to 0.83) mmol/(liter cells x hr), but was elevated compared to control subjects, 0.32 (0.09 to 0.73; P less than 0.05).
 Arterial blood pressure was elevated in patients with nephropathy (162/92 +/- 21/9 mm Hg) compared to normoalbuminuric patients (132/82 +/- 15/7) and control subjects (133/83 +/- 14/7 mm Hg; P less than 0.001).
 Our study does not support the hypothesis that the risk of diabetic nephropathy in non-insulin-dependent diabetes is associated with a genetic predisposition to hypertension.
 Diabetes per se seems to enhance Na+/Li+ countertransport activity.
