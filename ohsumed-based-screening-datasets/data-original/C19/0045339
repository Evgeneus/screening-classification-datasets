Atrial natriuretic peptide infusion in primary aldosteronism. Renal, hemodynamic and hormonal effects.
 We have previously shown that a bolus injection of alpha-human atrial natriuretic peptide (alpha-h-ANP) (100 micrograms) in patients with primary aldosteronism induces a transient decrease of blood pressure and a marked natriuresis, but no changes in plasma aldosterone levels.
 Eight additional cases were studied with a different protocol.
 Alpha-h-ANP was infused at the dose of 50 ng/kg/min over 1 h, after a bolus of 50 micrograms; saline alone was infused as control.
 Blood pressure, heart rate, plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, cortisol, serum and urinary Na and K and urinary volume were measured.
 A slight fall in blood pressure, without heart rate changes, was obtained within the first 5 min; this lasted throughout the infusion and for 1 h afterwards.
 Urinary volume and urinary sodium were significantly higher than controls during the first 2 h, while urinary potassium slightly increased only during the first hour.
 Plasma renin activity remained suppressed.
 Plasma aldosterone levels were similar throughout the infusion.
 Cortisol was not significantly different than placebo except that there was a significant rise after stopping ANP.
 These data confirm the potent natriuretic effect of ANP infusion and the lack of correlation between ANP induced natriuresis and the effect of ANP on aldosterone in patients with primary aldosteronism.
