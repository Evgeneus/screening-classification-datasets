Risk factors for gallstones among Chinese in Taiwan. A community sonographic survey.
 A health survey of adults aged 30 years or more was carried out in southwest Taiwan to determine the prevalence of gallstones and to study risk factors associated with gallstones.
 Blood samples were collected and abdominal sonographic examination and anthropometric measurements were performed on a total of 923 people.
 The 40 gallstone cases detected resulted in a prevalence of 4.3%.
 The risk factors explored included age, sex, hepatitis, obesity, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes mellitus (DM).
 Age and DM were the only significant factors associated with gallstones in our study.
 With a reference group of 30-39-year-olds as a comparison, multiple logistic regression analysis showed a trend effect with odds ratios of 1.73, 3.74, and 6.32 for age groups of 40-49, 50-59, and 60 or above, respectively.
 The odds ratio for DM was as high as 2.59.
 However, sex, body weight index, chronic hepatitis B, and hyperlipidemia were not significantly associated with gallstones.
