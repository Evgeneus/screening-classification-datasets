Nucleolar organizer regions in various human brain tumors.
 Nucleolar organizer regions (NOR's) are loops of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which transcribe to ribosomal ribonucleic acid (RNA) by RNA polymerase I.
 They possess vital significance in the ultimate synthesis of cellular proteins.
 A silver colloid staining technique for demonstration of NOR-associated proteins (Ag-NOR's) was applied to paraffin-embedded sections from 128 varied brain tumors and to chromosomal preparations from cultured brain-tumor cells.
 There was a statistically significant difference in the mean number of Ag-NOR's per nucleus between low-grade tumors (1.98/nucleus) and high-grade tumors (2.95/nucleus).
 It is suggested that the mean number of Ag-NOR's may represent the proliferative potential of brain tumors.
 Furthermore, high-grade tumors usually showed relatively large Ag-NOR's in a scattered distribution.
 In chromosomal preparations, the cultured cells displayed five to 12 Ag-NOR's on acrocentric chromosomes.
 Five of eight cell lines examined demonstrated ectopic Ag-NOR's.
 This simple staining technique can be easily applied to routinely processed paraffin-embedded sections and will become a useful tool for quick estimation of the proliferative potential of human brain tumors.
