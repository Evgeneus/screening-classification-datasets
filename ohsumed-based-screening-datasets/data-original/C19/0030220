Combined pancreas-kidney transplantation: preliminary results and metabolic effects.
 Vascularized pancreas transplantation (PT) results in a self-regulating endogenous source of insulin.
 In the last 18 months, we have performed combined pancreas-kidney transplantation in 25 type I diabetics with nephropathy.
 The mean age of the recipient group was 35 yr (range 24-51) with a mean duration of diabetes of 22 yr (range 13-41).
 All patients received quadruple immunosuppression with OKT3 induction.
 All patients remained normoglycemic and insulin independent with a mean glycosylated hemoglobin level of 6.0 +/- 1.1% and a mean serum creatinine of 1.7 +/- 0.5 mg/dl.
 Metabolic control and hormonal profiles were assessed by intravenous glucose challenge followed by arginine stimulation.
 Metabolic effects of PT included fasting hyperinsulinemia and hyperglucagonemia with exaggerated insulin and glucagon responses to glucose and arginine, respectively.
 Patient and graft survival is 100% after a mean follow-up interval of 8 months.
 Conclusion: combined pancreas-kidney transplantation is a valid treatment option for diabetic nephropathy, and results in near-complete normalization of glucose metabolism.
