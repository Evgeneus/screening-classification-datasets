Adrenal dysfunction in patients with renal amyloid.
 Amyloidosis is a multi-system disease.
 Renal involvement often leads to end-stage renal failure, which carries a poor prognosis.
 This paper reports the adrenal status of 22 patients with renal amyloid who were considered for or who had been commenced on renal replacement therapy.
 Twelve patients were considered or found to have AA amyloid and the remaining 10 had AL amyloid.
 Of 16 patients tested, seven demonstrated an abnormal response to a synacthen test.
 Four patients died at Addisonian crisis and hypo-adrenalism probably contributed to the deaths of a further two patients.
 Amyloid deposition was found in the adrenal glands in seven patients who died of systemic amyloidosis and renal failure.
 It is recommended that all patients with renal amyloid should have an assessment of adrenal function performed and if abnormal replacement steroid therapy should be commenced.
