Human plasma growth hormone (GH)-binding proteins are regulated by GH and testosterone.
 Possible regulation of GH-binding proteins (GH-BPs) in human plasma was examined.
 Eight children with isolated GH deficiency had a very low level of plasma GH-binding activity (10.2 +/- 1.1% of radioactivity).
 Under GH treatment the hormone binding to the high affinity BP (peak II-BP) increased in every patient to reach the mean value of 18.5 +/- 1.4%.
 In one patient, Scatchard plot analysis indicated that this increase was related to a higher binding capacity without any significant change in the binding affinity.
 A positive correlation existed between the GH-binding activity and insulin-like growth factor-I plasma levels.
 In nine boys with pubertal delay, the GH-specific binding to peak II-BP was normal (30.6 +/- 3.7% of radioactivity); it decreased significantly after testosterone treatment.
 In four boys with precocious puberty, the specific GH binding to peak II-BP was low (16.6 +/- 1.1%).
 It increased significantly to 21.6 +/- 1.1% of radioactivity after treatment with a LHRH analog.
 A negative correlation existed between plasma testosterone levels and GH binding to peak II-BP in boys presenting pubertal delay or precocious puberty.
 The high affinity GH-BP is regulated, and among the factors that play a role in this regulation, GH and testosterone have opposite effects.
