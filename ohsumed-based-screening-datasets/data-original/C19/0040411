Pituitary adenoma: correlation of half-dose gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging with surgical findings in 26 patients.
 Sellar magnetic resonance imaging studies obtained with half doses of gadopentetate dimeglumine (0.05 mmol/kg) were prospectively interpreted and retrospectively rated in 26 patients who subsequently underwent transsphenoidal sellar surgery for suspected pituitary adenoma.
 Studies included a sagittal scout view followed by a non-contrast-material-enhanced, an immediate postcontrast, and a delayed postcontrast T1-weighted image (obtained at 1.0 or 1.5 T).
 Ten of 11 confirmed microadenomas were identified prospectively; all were identifiable in retrospect.
 Macroadenomas (12 cases) were well demonstrated.
 The high signal intensity of the posterior pituitary and of intrasellar hemorrhage was obscured on postcontrast studies.
 Delayed images proved unnecessary.
 This prospective evaluation suggests that a half-dose study is comparable to retrospective studies in which full-dose techniques were used for detection of micro- and macroadenomas.
 Imaging times are reasonably short, and cost of contrast material is potentially reduced.
 Confirmation with larger studies is required, and careful endocrinologic and clinical follow-up of nonsurgical patients is necessary.
