Changes in blood pressure, plasma triglyceride and aldosterone concentration, and red cell cation concentration in patients with hyperinsulinemia.
 Blood pressure, plasma concentration of triglyceride, aldosterone, renin activity (PRA), and atrial naturietic peptide (ANP), and red blood cell, urine, and plasma sodium and potassium concentration were determined in 24 healthy individuals divided into two groups defined as being either hyperinsulinemic or normoinsulinemic.
 The results demonstrated that the hyperinsulinemic group had significantly higher values for both systolic (P less than .01) and diastolic (P less than .05) blood pressure.
 In addition, plasma concentrations of triglyceride (P less than .02), aldosterone (P less than .05) and potassium (P less than .05) were higher in hyperinsulinemic individuals as compared to those who were normoinsulinemic.
 Furthermore, red cell potassium was lower (P less than .01) and red cell sodium higher (P less than .01) in the hyperinsulinemic group.
 Finally, the magnitude of hyperinsulinemia correlated directly with systolic (r = 0.50, P less than .01) and diastolic (r = 0.44, P less than .05) blood pressure, concentration of plasma triglyceride (r = 0.55, P less than .01) and aldosterone (r = 0.46, p less than .05), and erythrocyte sodium concentration (r = 0.57, p less than .01).
 In contrast, plasma insulin response was negatively correlated with erythrocyte potassium concentration (r = 0.40, P less than 0.05).
 These observations provide further support for the view that hyperinsulinemia, presumably secondary to resistance to insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, is associated with a cluster of variables that may play important roles in the etiology and clinical course of hypertension.
