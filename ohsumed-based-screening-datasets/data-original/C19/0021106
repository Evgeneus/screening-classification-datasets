Evaluation of the fine needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative selection of cold thyroid nodules.
 From 1980 to 1988 the authors examined by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) 4609 patients with solitary thyroid nodules or multinodular goiters.
 A total of 5605 "cold" thyroid nodules were evaluated and classified, on the basis of the cytologic findings, as malignant, follicular lesions (probably malignant and probably benign) and benign.
 Then the authors compared the preoperative cytologic findings with the postoperative histologic results in 827 nodules from patients who underwent surgery.
 In the 805 thyroid nodules in which an adequate cytologic specimen was obtained, false-negative results were 2.3% and false-positive findings were 1.1% By comparing cytologic and histologic diagnoses, preoperative FNAB resulted in the ability to accurately assess the risk of cancer in a thyroid nodule; since 250 nodules were identified as malignant, the risk of a "cold" thyroid nodule being cancer was 4.46% in this series.
