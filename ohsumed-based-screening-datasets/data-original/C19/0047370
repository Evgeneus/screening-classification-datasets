NIH conference. Diagnosis and management of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: consensus development conference statement.
 Endocrinologists, surgeons, radiologists, epidemiologists, and primary health care providers convened to address both indications for surgery in asymptomatic patients with hyperparathyroidism as well as how patients who do not have surgery should be monitored and managed to minimize the risk for complications.
 The National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Panel concluded that a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is established by showing persistent hypercalcemia and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentration; that the current and acceptable treatment for hyperparathyroidism is surgery; that the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism in an asymptomatic patient does not in all cases mandate referral for surgery; that conscientious surveillance may be justified in patients whose calcium levels are only mildly elevated and whose renal and bone status are close to normal; and that preoperative localization in patients without previous neck operation is rarely indicated and has not proved to be cost effective.
