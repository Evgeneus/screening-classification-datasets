Expression of the human papillomavirus E7 oncogene during cell transformation is sufficient to induce susceptibility to lysis by activated macrophages.
 Human papillomaviruses (HPV), and in particular HPV type 16, are etiologic agents in the development of cervical cancer, which is the second most common form of cancer in women worldwide.
 Mammalian cells are susceptible to transformation in vitro by the E6 and E7 oncogenes derived from the HPV-16 genome.
 NIH-3T3 cells transfected with the HPV-16 E7 oncogene were found to exhibit cytolytic susceptibility to murine-activated macrophages.
 In comparison, E6 oncogene-expressing cells were not susceptible to lysis by activated macrophages.
 The E7 oncoprotein is multifunctional, being capable of complexing with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene (anti-oncogene) product, stimulating DNA synthesis, and causing cell transformation in vitro.
 Macrophage killing assays performed on cell lines expressing E7 mutants revealed that the ability to complex the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product and stimulate DNA synthesis did not induce susceptibility to activated macrophages, whereas the ability of E7 to cause transformation was required to induce susceptibility to activated macrophages.
 These data suggest that cell transformation is a more important prerequisite for inducing susceptibility to activated macrophages than is the loss of tumor suppressor gene function.
 This study also provides an initial link between HPV-16 oncogene expression and the ability of activated macrophages to selectively recognize and destroy HPV-16-associated neoplastic cells.
