Regional changes in hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size in rats with aortocaval fistulas. 1. Developing and established hypertrophy.
 The effects of a large arteriovenous fistula on left and right ventricular hemodynamics and cardiac myocyte size were examined in adult rats at 1 week and 1 month after surgery.
 Cardiac output, left ventricular function, and right ventricular function were evaluated before obtaining isolated myocytes for cell size measurements.
 Average heart weight increased 35% at 1 week and 86% at 1 month in rats with fistulas.
 In general, myocyte hypertrophy was due to a proportional increase in length and width (length/width ratio remained constant).
 This change was more evident in the large hearts from rats with 1-month fistulas.
 At both the 1-week and 1-month intervals, the hypertrophic response of right ventricular myocytes was slightly greater than that observed in the left ventricle or interventricular septum.
 Left ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were significantly reduced at 1 week but returned to normal after 1 month of overloading.
 Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure was increased approximately fivefold and twofold at 1 week and 1 month, respectively.
 Right ventricular systolic pressure and dP/dtmax were increased at both intervals examined.
 We conclude that severe volume overloading from a large aortocaval fistula in the rat is characterized by 1) depressed left ventricular function at 1 week followed by a large compensatory hypertrophy and near normal function at 1 month, 2) right ventricular pressure overload, and 3) changes in myocyte shape that resemble normal physiological growth.
