Prostaglandin F2 alpha inhibits the ammoniagenic response to acute acidosis in LLC-PK1 cells.
 A kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1, which does not synthesize prostaglandins, provides an ideal in vitro model system to investigate the effect of prostaglandins in the regulation of renal ammoniagenesis.
 Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated significant increases in glutamine-dependent ammonia and alanine production by rocked cultures of LLC-PK1 cells subjected to either acute metabolic or respiratory acidosis.
 In the study presented here, experiments were conducted to investigate the role of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF2 alpha) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in the response of ammonia metabolism to acute metabolic acidosis by LLC-PK1 cells.
 A low dose of PGF2 alpha (0.1 ng/mL) dramatically inhibited the stimulatory effect of a low pH (pH 6.8) on ammonia production.
 In contrast, the inhibition of cytosolically generated alanine was less dramatic and averaged only 20% of the effect on ammonia production.
 Furthermore, PGF2 alpha increased cellular alpha-ketoglutarate concentration, suggesting an increase in intramitochondrial pH.
 Thus, the cellular mechanism of PGF2 alpha action appears to involve either interference with the cytosolic pH signal or its translation to the intramitochondrial compartment.
 The inhibitory response of PGF2 alpha on pH-stimulated ammoniagenesis was progressively lost at higher concentrations.
 Both low-dose (0.1 ng/mL) and high-dose (10 ng/mL) PGF2 alpha had no significant effect on the basal rates of ammonia and alanine production at pH 7.4.
 PGE2, on the other hand, did not exhibit any significant response on ammonia or alanine production at either pH 6.8 or 7.4 when given in a wide range of doses.
