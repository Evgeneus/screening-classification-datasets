The use of L-dopa and carbidopa in metastatic malignant melanoma.
 A combination of L-dopa and carbidopa was given orally to 17 patients with metastatic melanoma.
 Maximum tolerated oral doses were given, up to 4 grams daily.
 No response was seen in 15 patients evaluable for response.
 Toxicity was considerable, with seven of 17 patients (41%) stopping treatment because of unacceptable gastrointestinal toxicity or postural hypotension.
 Contrary to previous anecdotal reports, there was no evidence that L-dopa/carbidopa treatment resulted in accelerated progression of metastatic melanoma.
 Orally administered L-dopa/carbidopa is ineffective as therapy for advanced melanoma when maximum tolerated doses are used.
