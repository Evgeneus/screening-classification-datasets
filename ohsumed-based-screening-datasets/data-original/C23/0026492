Complications of transurethral electro-incision of posterior urethral valves.
 The development of dense urethral strictures following transurethral resection of posterior urethral valves is a well known complication, especially in the neonate.
 In 85 boys with posterior urethral valves no strictures were found during follow-up.
 Urinary incontinence associated with transurethral incision occurred in 3 patients and a small urethral diverticulum was found in 1.
 The complication rate associated with the transurethral incision itself was 5%.
 Our technique for transurethral incision of posterior urethral valves is described.
