Carcinoma of the rectum: a 10-year experience.
 A consecutive series of 303 patients with carcinoma of the rectum and distal sigmoid colon treated by a single surgeon over a 10-year period are reported.
 Of these, 202 underwent an anterior resection, 85 an abdominoperineal excision of the rectum and 16 a coloanal anastomosis.
 Surgery was considered palliative in 52 patients undergoing anterior resection and 24 undergoing abdominoperineal resection.
 The 30-day hospital mortality rate was six patients (3 per cent) for anterior resection and two patients (2 per cent) for abdominoperineal resection.
 Peroperative anastomotic testing demonstrated leakage in five stapled anastomoses; these were rectified and no clinical sequelae occurred.
 Two patients (1 per cent) developed a clinical anastomotic leak, one of which proved fatal; in each case the intraoperative test was negative.
 The overall 5-year survival rate was 64 per cent after anterior resection and 52 per cent after abdominoperineal resection; the median follow-up was 64 months.
 The incidence of local pelvic recurrence was 6.4 per cent after anterior resection and 14 per cent after abdominoperineal (not significant).
 These results confirm the success of sphincter-saving anterior resection combined with total mesorectal excision, routine full mobilization of the splenic flexure and cancercidal lavage of the distal rectum in the treatment of low rectal carcinomas; morbidity, local recurrence and survival are not compromised.
