Effects of radiation on fixation of non-cemented porous-coated implants in a canine model.
 A non-weight-bearing porous-coated rod was implanted bilaterally in the proximal part of the humerus in thirty-five adult male mongrel dogs.
 In all of the animals, one limb was treated with radiation and the opposite limb served as the control.
 In twenty-one animals, the dose was 1000 centigrays (rads) and in fourteen, it was 500 centigrays.
 The strength of fixation and the volume fraction of ingrowth of bone were determined two, four, and eight weeks after the operation in the group that received 1000 centigrays and two and four weeks after the operation in the group that received 500 centigrays.
 Treatment with 500 centigrays had no significant effect on the strength of fixation or the amount of ingrowth of bone.
 In contrast, at two weeks, treatment with 1000 centigrays had reduced the strength of fixation to 50 per cent of the control value (p less than 0.01), although, at four and eight weeks, the strength of fixation was not significantly different than that in the control limb.
 The amount of ingrowth of bone in the irradiated limb was significantly reduced at two weeks (30 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.01), four weeks (70 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05), and eight weeks (56 per cent of the control value) (p less than 0.05).
