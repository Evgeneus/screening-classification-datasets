Twenty-four-hour activity of felodipine extended release in chronic stable angina pectoris.
 To investigate the antiischemic efficacy and duration of action of the dihydropyridine calcium antagonist felodipine, 15 patients with stable exertional angina were enrolled in a double-blind, crossover study comparing 2 doses (5 and 10 mg) of felodipine extended release (ER) and placebo given once daily for 1 week.
 Bicycle exercise tests were repeated at the end of each treatment period 4 and 24 hours after dosing.
 Four hours after dosing with both felodipine doses, only 5 patients discontinued the exercise test because of greater than 2 mm of ST-segment depression, whereas 10 continued until exhaustion (p less than 0.01 vs placebo).
 Compared with placebo, total exercise time was increased by 19% (p less than 0.001), with no difference between doses.
 After 24 hours, exercise duration was prolonged up to physical exhaustion in 6 patients taking felodipine 10 mg (p less than 0.05 vs both placebo and felodipine 5 mg); moreover, 11 patients taking 10 mg and 5 taking 5 mg increased time to 1 mm of ST depression greater than or equal to 15% compared with exercise time during the placebo test.
 Mean time to 1 mm of ST depression at 24 hours was increased by 8% with 5 mg and by 18% with 10 mg (p less than 0.001 vs placebo; p less than 0.01 between doses).
 Total exercise time at 24 hours was increased with both doses (p less than 0.001), with greater efficacy with the 10-mg dose (p less than 0.05 vs 5 mg).
