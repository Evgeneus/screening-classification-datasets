The treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis with cartilage removal alone.
 Fifty-eight patients with chondrodermatitis nodularis on the antihelix in 24 ears (16 women and eight men) and the helix in 40 ears (six women and 34 men) were studied.
 Twelve ears responded to intralesional steroid therapy.
 Under local anesthetic, 46 operations were performed to remove cartilage without skin excision.
 On the helix, a longitudinal incision was made; on the antihelix, a flap was raised and the underlying cartilage was excised, taking care to leave no rough cartilage edges.
 Follow-up (mean, 16 months; range, 4.5 to 34 months) showed that 10 of 17 antihelix lesions and 24 of 29 helix lesions healed completely with excellent cosmetic results.
 Recurrences, requiring further treatment, occurred at cartilage-excision margins in seven ears, and further cartilage excision alone was successful in four ears.
 This study demonstrates that only cartilage needs to be removed in the surgical treatment of chondrodermatitis nodularis.
