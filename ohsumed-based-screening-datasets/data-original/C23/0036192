Laser laparoscopic vagotomy and pyloromyotomy.
 We performed bilateral truncal vagotomy and gastric drainage procedure using standard laparoscopic instruments in five mongrel dogs.
 The procedure consisted of a transthoracic thoracoscopic bilateral truncal vagotomy and transperitoneal laparoscopic pyloromyotomy.
 A contact Nd:YAG laser fiber was used.
 There was no mortality, minimal morbidity, and post-operative gastric emptying was satisfactory.
 Pathologic studies indicated vagotomy was complete.
 We believe that this may be the initial step in the development of a simple, safe, and effective endoscopic procedure for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease.
