Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision: the patient's perspective.
 Facial reanimation after acoustic neuroma excision is currently accomplished using a variety of surgical techniques.
 A multi-institutional survey of patient perceptions of facial reanimation success was accomplished by mailing a questionnaire to 809 randomly selected members of the Acoustic Neuroma Association.
 Four hundred sixty patients who underwent 296 reanimation procedures responded.
 Facial to hypoglossal nerve anastomosis, tarsorrhaphy, and upper eyelid implants were most frequently performed.
 The patient's estimations of initial deficit, spontaneous recovery, and overall satisfaction with the reanimation procedures are discussed.
