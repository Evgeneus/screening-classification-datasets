Systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoma: association with antiphospholipid syndrome.
 A woman with a history of polyarthralgias appeared to develop systemic lupus erythematosus and lymphoma simultaneously.
 The diagnosis of the concurrent lymphoma was made on biopsy of a left axillary lymph node.
 Generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and pruritus had given rise to suspicion of an underlying lymphoma.
 The lymphoma responded well to chemotherapy.
 Her condition was further complicated by an arterial occlusion involving the right 2nd toe which was eventually amputated, transient ischemic attacks (amaurosis fugax), livedo reticularis and thrombocytopenia which were accompanied by elevations of IgM anticardiolipin antibodies and a biological false test for syphilis.
 The lupus anticoagulant test was not performed as she was given anticoagulation therapy.
