Endoscopic removal of inflammatory fibroid polyps of the stomach.
 Three cases of gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp removed by endoscopic polypectomy are reported.
 All lesions were located in the gastric antrum or prepyloric region, and their depth was restricted to the submucosa.
 The correct diagnosis was obtained, and the digestive symptoms disappeared after polypectomy.
 In contrast to observations in previous reports, we believe these lesions are suitable for removal by endoscopic means, provided they are small in size and strictly submucosal in location.
