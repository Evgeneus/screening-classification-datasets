Role of laparoscopy in the evaluation of patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the role of laparoscopy in patients with suspected hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and a normal computerized tomograph (CT).
 Twenty-five consecutive patients with a normal liver and no peritoneal lesions on CT were evaluated.
 Patients with a documented primary neoplasm or a positive ascitic fluid cytology were excluded.
 At laparoscopy, malignancy was documented by biopsy in 12 patients for an incidence of 48%.
 Of the patients with exudative ascites, 75% had peritoneal metastases.
 In addition seven patients had benign liver disease documented by laparoscopic biopsy.
 Liver enzymes were not helpful in distinguishing benign and malignant disease in this group of patients.
 This study indicates that a negative CT does not exclude liver or peritoneal malignancy.
 Laparoscopy has a significant yield in patients with a negative CT suspected of having hepatic or peritoneal malignancy and is the procedure of choice in evaluating these patients.
