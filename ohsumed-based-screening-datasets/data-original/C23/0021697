New insights into the causes of cancer.
 Recent advances in molecular biologic analysis have led to major new insights concerning the genetic mechanisms underlying the development of cancer.
 This article examines the current state of our understanding of the genetic basis underlying the possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis and metastasis.
 The nature of the genetic lesions found in some cancer-causing genes, cancer-inhibiting genes, growth factor genes, and metastasis genes is discussed, as is the impact that these may have on clinical oncology.
