Patient activity, sports participation, and impact loading on the durability of cemented total hip replacements.
 Patients with either cemented surface replacements or cemented stemmed hip prostheses and who regularly participate in sporting activities or heavy labor after total joint arthroplasty are at twice the long-term risk of requiring revision surgery for loosening as patients who are less active.
 For patients with surface replacement total hip arthroplasty (THA), the adverse effects of activity are greatest in patients with preoperative diagnoses other than osteoarthritis, and were seen by the sixth year postsurgery.
 For patients with conventional stemmed prostheses, the effects of patient activity are not seen until about ten years postsurgery.
 For resurfacing THA for osteoarthritis, the long-term of loosening is primarily in patients who participate in high impact activities.
