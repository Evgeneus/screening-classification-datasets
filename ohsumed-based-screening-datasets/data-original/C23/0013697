Delayed rupture of a pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk: treatment with therapeutic embolization.
 Fourteen days after removal of an internal jugular catheter inserted prior to renal transplantation, a patient presented with brisk arterial hemorrhage from the insertion site.
 The hemorrhage, caused by a ruptured pseudoaneurysm of the costocervical trunk, was controlled by transcatheter embolization with gelatin particles.
 One year later the patient reported no problems related to the pseudoaneurysm or its management.
