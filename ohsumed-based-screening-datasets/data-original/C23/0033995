Paralysis of the trapezius: a case report.
 A patient was referred to physical therapy for exercises to the right shoulder secondary to a peripheral nerve injury involving the spinal accessory nerve.
 A treatment program was designed to accommodate for lack of upward scapula rotation, which is necessary for elevation of the upper extremity above shoulder level.
 During the course of two and a half years of care, a variety of associated problems were encountered.
 There was no apparent nerve regeneration, and the patient was left with limited mobility of the affected upper extremity.
