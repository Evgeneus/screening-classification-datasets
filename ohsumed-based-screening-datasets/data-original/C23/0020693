Postoperative cerebrospinal fluid leakage after lumbar spine operations. Conservative treatment.
 Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage from a postoperative wound after lumbar spine operation is an uncommon complication.
 It may result from excessive traction of the nerve roots, direct trauma, or laceration at the time of operation, causing the dura to be inadvertently opened.
 Other reasons for this complication are postlaminectomy residual bone spikes, traumatic myelography puncture, and improper suture of dura defects.
 Eight patients who had postoperative CSF leakage as the only complication after lumbosacral spine operations were examined.
 They were all treated conservatively with bed rest in the Trendelenburg position, antibiotic coverage, watertight skin suturing, and daily subcutaneous punctures.
 No patient was operated on for the same type of complication.
