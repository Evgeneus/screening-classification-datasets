Case report: hepatic hydrothorax without ascites.
 Pleural effusion due to hepatic cirrhosis and ascites is well known.
 We describe three patients with right-sided hepatic hydrothorax in the absence of ascites.
 The formation of pleural fluid in these patients is probably a result of fluid movement from peritoneal to pleural space across diaphragmatic defects before ascites can form.
 The differential diagnosis of a right-sided transudative pleural effusion in a patient with chronic liver disease with or without ascites includes congestive left ventricular failure and nephrotic syndrome.
 These diseases are usually ruled out with standard clinical tests.
 Patients with hepatic hydrothorax should be treated with fluid restriction and diuretics.
 Patients with severe symptoms due to refractory hepatic hydrothorax might benefit from pleural sclerosis and surgical closure of diaphragmatic defects.
