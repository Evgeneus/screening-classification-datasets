Pulmonary resection combined with cardiac operations.
 Surgical management of patients with concomitant critical cardiac disease and resectable lung lesions is controversial.
 During a 7-year period (1982 to 1988), 21 patients underwent combined cardiac and pulmonary operations.
 Patients had cardiac symptoms only; the lung lesions were found on preoperative chest roentgenograms.
 The pathological diagnosis was established in only 2 of the patients before operation.
 All underwent concurrent pulmonary resection during cardiac operations requiring extracorporeal circulation.
 The pulmonary operations included 17 wedge resections and four lobectomies.
 The final diagnoses in 8 patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer included epidermoid carcinoma (4), adenocarcinoma (3), and bronchoalveolar carcinoma (1).
 Postoperatively, 1 patient required a permanent pacemaker and 1 patient died.
 The actuarial survival at 5 years for all patients who underwent combined procedures was 95%.
 The 5-year survival for the 8 patients with lung cancer was 88% compared with 100% for those with benign pulmonary pathology (p = 0.172).
 This experience suggests that combining pulmonary resection with cardiac operations is safe and offers a favorable prognosis to a select group of patients.
