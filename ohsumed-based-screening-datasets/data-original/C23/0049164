Influence of changes in arterial carbon dioxide tension on the electroencephalogram and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials during alfentanil/nitrous oxide anesthesia.
 The effects of variation of arterial CO2 tension (PaCO2) on the electroencephalogram (EEG) and posterior tibial nerve somatosensory cortical evoked potentials (PTN-SCEP) during opioid/N2O anesthesia have not been well documented.
 We studied the effects of hypocapnia (PaCO2 approximately 23 mmHg) and hypercapnia (PaCO2 approximately 50 mmHg) during steady-state alfentanil/N2O anesthesia in 16 patients.
 EEG and PTN-SCEP were recorded continuously, while PaCO2 was altered in 15-min intervals by varying the inspired CO2 concentration.
 Hypocapnia caused significant increases in power in the delta, theta, and beta bands (P less than 0.01), with the greatest increase observed in the alpha band.
 Relative power increased in the alpha band but remained unchanged in the delta, theta, and beta bands.
 Median frequency and 95% spectral edge frequency were unaltered during hypocapnia.
 In contrast, hypercapnia caused a significant decrease of power in the alpha and beta bands, whereas delta and theta power remained unchanged.
 This was reflected in a significant decrease of the 95% spectral edge frequency, from 8.9 (6.7-11.6) to 7.0 (5.6-8.6) Hz.
 All EEG parameters returned to normal upon restoration of normocapnia.
 There was a significant negative correlation between power in the alpha band and end-tidal CO2 in all patients (r = 0.47 to -0.89).
 PTN-SCEP latencies and amplitudes were not significantly different from control values during hypocapnia and hypercapnia.
 It is concluded that variations in PaCO2 within the limits 20-50 mmHg produce substantial changes in the EEG power spectrum, especially in the alpha band (8-12 Hz), but do not alter PTN-SCEP.
