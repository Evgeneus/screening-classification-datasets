Acute pain relief.
 Pain is a multidimensional psychophysiologic phenomenon.
 Systematic multidimensional assessment is an essential first component of an effective plan to relieve the pain.
 Nurses are key to effective pain management because of the close, 24-hour-a-day relationship with the hospitalized patient.
 It is the nurse who is most critical to the adequate assessment of pain, to the implementation of the treatment plan, and to the evaluation of efficacy.
 Nurses should continue to develop a better knowledge base about pain and pain therapies and assessment skills, be assertive in obtaining effective treatment for their patients, and perceive themselves as responsible for pain relief.
