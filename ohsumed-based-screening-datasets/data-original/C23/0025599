The treatment of ankle valgus by surface epiphysiodesis.
 Progressive ankle valgus in childhood requiring surgical correction is usually because of paralytic disease or conditions that produce a short distal fibula such as multiple exostoses or both.
 Surface epiphysiodesis of the distal medial tibial physis was used to correct valgus deformity in ten ankles in seven patients.
 This procedure has been found to be a simple and effective method of treatment.
 Measurement of the degree of valgus and calculation of the remaining growth of the distal tibial physis are recommended to determine whether this procedure will be effective.
 It is most often indicated in the presence of moderate valgus in children aged 11 to 14 years.
