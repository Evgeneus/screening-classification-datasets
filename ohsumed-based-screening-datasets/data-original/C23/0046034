Long-term patient-controlled analgesia in children.
 Three children who received patient-controlled analgesia for periods of up to 41 days are described.
 In each case patient-controlled analgesia allowed pain control to be achieved in difficult situations.
 No patient developed tolerance or clinical signs of dependence.
 This use of long-term patient-controlled analgesia warrants further evaluation.
