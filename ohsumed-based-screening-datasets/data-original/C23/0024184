Disseminated zygomycosis associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 We describe a 36-year-old patient who had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and died of disseminated zygomycosis.
 There was rapid progression of his SLE, leading to suspicion of superimposed infectious disease, but the actual cause of his multiorgan failure was not recognized until after death.
 The manner in which systemic fungal infection may mimic SLE is discussed.
