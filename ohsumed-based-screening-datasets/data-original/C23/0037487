Discontinuation of lithium treatment in remitted bipolar patients: relationship between clinical outcome and changes in sleep-wake cycles.
 In this preliminary report, we describe four patients in whom long-term lithium therapy was discontinued, combined with actigraphic monitoring to assess changes in motor activity and the sleep-wake cycle.
 Two patients experienced rapid relapse of manic symptomatology, while two remained stable throughout a 1-year follow-up.
 Actigraphic monitoring revealed disintegration of the sleep-wake cycle and increased motor activity in the relapsed patients only.
 It is suggested that actigraphic recordings can be used to monitor lithium discontinuation.
