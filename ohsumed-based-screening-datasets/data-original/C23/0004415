Results of coronary surgery after failed elective coronary angioplasty in patients with prior coronary surgery 
 The results of coronary artery bypass surgery after failed elective coronary angioplasty in patients who have undergone prior coronary surgery are unknown.
 Coronary angioplasty may be performed to relieve angina after surgery either to the native coronary vessels or to grafts.
 Failure of attempted coronary angioplasty may mandate repeat coronary surgery, often in the setting of acute ischemia.
 From 1980 to 1989, 1,263 patients with prior coronary bypass surgery underwent angioplasty; of these patients, 46 (3.6%) underwent reoperation for failed angioplasty during the same hospital stay.
 Of the 46 patients who underwent reoperation, 33 had and 13 did not have acute ischemia.
 In the group with ischemia, 3 patients (9.1%) died and 14 (42.4%) died or had a Q wave myocardial infarction in the hospital compared with no deaths (p = NS) and no deaths or Q wave myocardial infarction (p = 0.005) in the group without ischemia.
 At 3 years, the actuarial survival rate was 88 +/- 6% in the group with ischemia, whereas there were no deaths in the group without ischemia (p = NS), and freedom from death or myocardial infarction was 51 +/- 10% in the group with ischemia, versus no events in the group without ischemia (p = 0.006).
 In most patients with prior coronary bypass surgery, coronary angioplasty was performed without the need for repeat coronary bypass surgery.
 Should coronary angioplasty fail, reoperation in patients without acute ischemia can be performed with overall patient survival comparable to that of elective reoperative coronary bypass without coronary angioplasty.
