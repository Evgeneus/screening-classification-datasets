Management of low-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumors.
 The clinical course of 48 patients with low-risk metastatic gestational trophoblastic tumors (GTTs) treated with primary single-agent chemotherapy was reviewed.
 All patients achieved sustained remission, although 25 (51%) required a second single-agent regimen, and 7 (14%) needed combination chemotherapy to achieve it.
 An average of 3.4 courses of chemotherapy were necessary to achieve remission, and 6 patients (12%) underwent resection of resistant tumor foci.
 Primary single-agent chemotherapy is a reasonable treatment option in patients with low-risk metastatic GTT.
