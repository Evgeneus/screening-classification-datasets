Lymphocytic hypophysitis with involvement of the cavernous sinus and hypothalamus.
 Two cases of lymphocytic hypophysitis are reported, in which hypothalamic involvement causing diabetes insipidus was a prominent clinical feature.
 In one case, a man had clinical and radiological evidence of the involvement of the cavernous sinus.
 This represents the second reported case of a man with lymphocytic hypophysitis.
 A transsphenoidal biopsy established the diagnosis in both cases.
 Neither the involvement of the cavernous sinus nor permanent diabetes insipidus has been reported previously.
 A review of the literature is provided.
