A comparison of sucralfate with placebo in the treatment of esophageal ulcers following therapeutic endoscopic sclerotherapy of esophageal varices--a prospective controlled randomized trial.
 In 1984 Roark published the first report of a sucralfate treatment of esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy.
 Because this was an uncontrolled trial we planned a prospective double-blind placebo-controlled study with 60 patients.
 After therapeutic paravariceal injection-sclerotherapy of esophageal varices, patients were randomly treated with sucralfate suspension or placebo.
 Time of treatment was limited to a maximum of 3 weeks and the dosage of sucralfate was 1 g q.i.d.
 (Ulcogant-Suspension).
 Healing was assessed by endoscopy at weekly intervals.
 Fifty-three patients (25 sucralfate, 28 placebo) were evaluable according to the protocol.
 No patient left the study because of side effects.
 At the start of the trial, the patients in the sucralfate group showed a larger ulcer area than the placebo group.
 There was a tendency to faster healing in the sucralfate group, especially in patients with deeper ulcerations.
 However, there was no significant difference in global healing between both treatment groups after 3 weeks.
 Sucralfate suspension may be of value in accelerating the healing process in esophageal ulcers after sclerotherapy, especially in patients with deep ulcers.
 These results should be confirmed in further trials, in which patients should be stratified with respect to their ulcer volume and severity of liver disease.
