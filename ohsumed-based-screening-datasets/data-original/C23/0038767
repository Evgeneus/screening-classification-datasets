Bio-medicus ventricular assist device for salvage of cardiac surgical patients 
 Over a 5-year period, 41 (1%) of 4,193 patients undergoing cardiac operations underwent intraoperative or early postoperative insertion of a Bio-Medicus ventricular assist device when it became apparent that the patient could not otherwise survive.
 Fourteen patients were in cardiogenic shock and 7 were in cardiac arrest at the time of initiation of their primary cardiac surgical procedure, and in no instance was the device planned as a bridge to cardiac transplantation.
 Bleeding, sepsis, and thromboembolism were frequent postoperative complications.
 Central nervous system deficits were observed in 16 patients during their postoperative course.
 Eight patients (19.5%) were long-term survivors.
 Of the preoperative risk factors evaluated only age was significantly associated with survival, with 7 (33%) of the 21 younger (39 to 63 years) patients surviving.
 Blood product usage and hospital cost were analyzed in an attempt to assess cost/effectiveness of use of this device for attempted salvage of such desperately ill patients.
