Synthesis of platelet activating factor by ocular tissue from inflamed eyes.
 Platelet activating factors (PAFs) are a family of ether lipids with properties that suggest a major role in inflammation.
 We have previously implicated PAFs in ocular inflammation based on the inhibition of several rabbit models of iritis with a specific PAF receptor antagonist.
 We have tested ocular tissues for the ability to synthesize PAF.
 Iris, ciliary body, cornea, and/or retina were carefully dissected from New Zealand white rabbits, and tissue from four eyes was pooled.
 Tissues were stimulated with calcium ionophore (10 mumol/L), and supernatants were extracted with chloroform-methanol.
 Platelet-aggregating activity was found in the chloroform phase in 2 of 9, 1 of 8, 0 of 9, and 3 of 9 studies involving iris, retina, ciliary body, or cornea, respectively.
 Twenty-four hours after the intravitreal injection of 125 ng of endotoxin, aggregating activity was consistently detectable from supernatants of stimulated iris and ciliary body, occasionally present from stimulated retina but not detectable from cornea.
 The shape of the aggregation curve resembled that produced by 0.5 to 2.0 ng of authentic PAF.
 Moreover, the aggregation could be completely inhibited by a PAF receptor antagonist and the aggregating activity chromatographed identically on high-performance liquid chromatography to a PAF standard.
 These studies indicate that PAF-like activity could be detected from several ocular tissues subsequent to inflammation.
 Iris, ciliary body, retina, vascular endothelium, and/or leukocytes could each contribute to the presence of this inflammatory mediator.
