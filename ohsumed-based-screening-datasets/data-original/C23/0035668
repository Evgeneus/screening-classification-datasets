Bowel obstruction: evaluation with CT 
 Eighty-four computed tomographic (CT) scans from patients referred for bowel obstruction between January 2, 1988, and December 31, 1989, were retrospectively evaluated.
 A pair of radiologists without knowledge of patient histories determined the presence or absence of bowel obstruction.
 Sixty-four patients ultimately proved to have intestinal obstruction, and 20 did not.
 Diagnosis was established by means of surgery (n = 39), barium studies (n = 17), and clinical course (n = 28).
 Causes of obstruction included adhesions (n = 37), metastases (n = 6), primary tumor (n = 7), Crohn disease (n = 4), hernia (n = 3), hematoma (n = 2), colonic diverticulitis (n = 2), and other (n = 3).
 In addition, 83 CT examinations in patients with no history or indication of intestinal obstruction were simultaneously reviewed.
 The overall sensitivity was 94%, specificity was 96%, and accuracy was 95%.
 The cause of obstruction was correctly predicted in 47 of 64 cases (73%).
 Intestinal obstruction was not diagnosed in any of the 83 control patients.
 CT is most useful in patients with a history of abdominal malignancy and in patients who have not been operated on and who have signs of infection, bowel infarction, or a palpable abdominal mass.
