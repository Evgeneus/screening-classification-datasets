Identification of viruses in a study of acute respiratory tract infection in children from Uruguay.
 For the purpose of identifying viral agents associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) in children less than 5 years old, a longitudinal community study was undertaken in Montevideo, Uruguay, from May 1985 to December 1987.
 This report includes results obtained by cell culture and immunofluorescence techniques for detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza 1 and 3 viruses, and adenovirus.
 Two populations were studied: children visited at home by pediatricians (group 1) and children with an ARI episode who attended an outpatient clinic (group 2).
 Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained at the time of an ARI episode: 858 from group 1 and 488 from group 2.
 Viruses were identified in 15.3% of group 1 specimens and in 17.6% of group 2 specimens.
 RSV was the most frequently recovered agent, accounting for 67.9% and 58.1%, respectively, of all viruses detected.
 The sensitivity and specificity of RSV isolation by cell culture are compared with detection by indirect immunofluorescence.
