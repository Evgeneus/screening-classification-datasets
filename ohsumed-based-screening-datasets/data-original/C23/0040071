Microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm. Patterns of vascular compression in unsuccessfully operated patients.
 To determine the causative factors of unsuccessful microvascular decompression for hemifacial spasm, the follow-up results in 53 patients were assessed retrospectively.
 The mean follow-up period was 36 months.
 There were 32 patients who had compression of the seventh cranial nerve ventrocaudally by an anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA) or a posterior inferior cerebellar artery.
 Of these 32 patients, 30 (94%) had excellent postoperative results.
 Of 14 patients with more severe compression by the vertebral artery, nine (64%) had excellent results, three (21%) had good results, and two (14%) had poor results; in this group, three patients with excellent results experienced transient spasm recurrence.
 There were seven patients in whom the meatal branch of the AICA coursed between the seventh and eighth cranial nerves and compressed the dorsal aspect of the seventh nerve; this was usually associated with another artery compressing the ventral aspect of the nerve ("sandwich-type" compression).
 Of these seven patients, five (71%) had poor results including operative failure in one and recurrence of spasm in four.
 The authors conclude that the clinical outcome was closely related to the patterns of vascular compression.
