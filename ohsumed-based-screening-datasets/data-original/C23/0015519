Cranial base hemorrhage. A technique for controlling the uncontrollable.
 In the management of trauma, control of life-threatening hemorrhage must be accomplished expeditiously if morbidity is to be decreased and mortality prevented.
 Hemorrhage from the inaccessible cranial base, especially when transected vessel stumps are not available for direct control, can be the most demanding, life-threatening, surgical emergency.
 We present our experience in utilizing an autologous bone grafting technique to successfully control severe hemorrhage from the base of the skull.
 In our review of the literature to date, we have been unable to ascertain whether this modality has been previously used.
