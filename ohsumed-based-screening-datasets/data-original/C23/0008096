Open reduction and fixation of proximal humeral fractures and fracture-dislocations.
 Open reduction and internal fixation was employed in the treatment of 25 severely displaced fractures and fracture-dislocations of the proximal humerus.
 Our aims were accurate reduction and stable fixation to allow early mobilisation and to achieve full functional recovery.
 In 15 fractures an AO T-plate was used and in 10 a bent semitubular plate was employed as a blade plate.
 Excellent or satisfactory results were obtained in all six patients with two-part fractures involving the surgical neck; in four of the five patients with three-part fractures involving the surgical neck and tuberosities; in nine of the 11 patients with fracture-dislocation; and in two of the three patients with split fractures of the humeral head.
 Overall results were good or satisfactory in 21 of the 25 cases.
 Unsatisfactory results were associated with rotator cuff damage.
