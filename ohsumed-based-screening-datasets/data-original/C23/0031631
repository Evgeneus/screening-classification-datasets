Microscopic hematuria and calculus-related ureteral obstruction.
 The evaluation of patients with ureteral calculi in the emergency department has historically included urinalysis (UA) and intravenous pyelograms (IVP).
 This retrospective study was done to determine if a statistically significant relationship existed between the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction, proven by IVP, and the presence or absence of microscopic hematuria.
 Urine red blood cells were recorded as less than 3 rbc/hpf (negative) or greater than or equal to 3 rbc/hpf (positive).
 IVPs were recorded as nonsevere or severe.
 IVP criteria were based on the presence or absence of extravasation, greater than 2-hour ureteral filling times, and a numerical scoring system of 1 to 4 for ureteral or calyceal dilatation and nephrogenic effect.
 Eighty-nine men (72%) had non-severe obstructions and 34 (28%) had severe obstructions.
 Twenty-five women (68%) had nonsevere obstructions and 12 (32%) had severe obstructions.
 Of the 28 patients with normal UAs, 11 had severe ureteral obstructions and 17 had nonsevere ureteral obstructions.
 There were no statistically significant differences between the presence or absence of significant microscopic hematuria and the presence or absence of severe ureteral obstruction.
 Microscopic hematuria is neither sensitive nor specific in determining the degree of calculus-related ureteral obstruction.
