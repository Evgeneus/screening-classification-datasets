9p monosomy in a patient with Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome.
 Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS) is a genetic disorder characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit disorder.
 Family studies support the presence of an autosomal dominant gene; however, to date, an assignment for the GTS locus has not been made.
 We present the case of a boy with GTS and a deletion of the terminal portion of the short arm of chromosome 9, del(9)(qter----p2304:).
