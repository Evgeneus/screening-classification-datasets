Pathogenetic mechanism of stroke in non-valvular atrial fibrillation: follow-up of stroke patients with and without atrial fibrillation.
 Stroke patients with brain infarction and non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF, n = 88) or sinus rhythm (SR, n = 188), treated at a population-based stroke unit, were studied for 5 years.
 Within 1 month, 13% of NVAF and 2% of SR patients (P less than 0.01) had either a stroke recurrence or systemic embolism.
 After 5 years, the corresponding figures were 26 and 25%, respectively.
 The 1-month and 5-year mortality values were 35 and 78% in the NVAF group vs.
 7 and 52% in the SR group (P less than 0.01).
 Age, ischaemic heart disease and function group on arrival at the hospital were independent risk factors for death.
 The main cause of death was ischaemic heart disease in the NVAF group, and complications to the initial stroke or a stroke recurrence in the SR group.
 Thus a higher risk of death, stroke recurrence and peripheral embolism was evident only during the first month after stroke.
