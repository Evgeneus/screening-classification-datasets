Orbital rim and malar advancement for unilateral coronal synostosis in the older pediatric age group.
 The authors describe a technique for lateral orbital rim and malar advancement in patients in the older pediatric age group.
 The technique makes use of a strip craniotomy containing the supraorbital margin, greater sphenoid wing, and temporal bone, with en bloc inclusion of the lateral orbital rim, zygoma, and malar prominence.
 The method allows a contoured yet stable construction secured in a tongue-in-groove fashion with plate-and-screw fixation.
 It creates a symmetrical reconstruction of both frontal and lateral orbital aspects in the untreated or inadequately treated older plagiocephalic child with orbital dystopia.
 The accompanying malar recession is likewise corrected.
