Postoperative sore throat: topical hydrocortisone 
 Forty patients undergoing tracheal intubation and controlled ventilation of the lungs for elective surgical procedures were studied.
 They were allocated randomly into one of two groups.
 The tracheal tubes used for group A patients were lubricated before insertion with water-soluble 1% hydrocortisone cream.
 Those for group B patients were lubricated with KY jelly.
 The incidence of postoperative sore throat was found to be significantly greater in group A.
 Topical 1% hydrocortisone cream is therefore ineffective in the prevention of postoperative sore throat.
