Hormonal inhibition of the endometrium for resectoscopic endometrial ablation.
 Attempts at inhibiting the thickness and vascularity of the endometrium in preparation for endometrial ablation by using different types of hormones have been reported.
 To evaluate the effects of two different progestins, danazol, and leuprolide acetate on the endometrium, compared with the features of early proliferative endometrium, histologic studies were done for at least five patients treated with each hormone who then underwent resectoscopic endometrial ablation for treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding.
 Significant and at times dramatic differences among the treatment groups were found, with progestin-prepared endometrium being the least successful and leuprolide-prepared endometrium the most successful.
 In addition, the prolonged suppression provided for a period of time after the procedure by depot leuprolide is likely to help inhibit endometrial regeneration and provide even better long-term success of the procedure.
