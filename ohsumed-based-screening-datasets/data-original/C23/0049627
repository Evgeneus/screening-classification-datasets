Transformation suppressor activity of a Jun transcription factor lacking its activation domain.
 The oncoprotein c-Jun is thought to be a mediator of ras transformation as both its synthesis and activity as a transcription factor are stimulated by ras expression.
 But c-Jun co-operates with ras in transformation assays, suggesting that they act along different pathways (reviewed in ref.
 4).
 Here we show by means of a dominant-negative mutated transcription factor that c-Jun potentially in conjunction with other factors that interact with it is necessary for transformation by ras.
 The mutant Jun lacks an activation domain and blocks stimulation of transcription by several oncoproteins, including Ras, v-Src, polyoma middle T, c-Jun and c-Fos, as well as by the tumour promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA).
 The inhibition is specific for motifs that bind Jun: activation of an NF-kappa B/Rel motif is not affected.
 This Jun mutant acts as an anti-oncogene in ras-transformed cells, generating non-transformed revertants that have acquired anchorage and density-dependent growth, as well as reduced tumorigenicity in vivo.
 Mutants of other transcription factors designed to inhibit transformation will enable us to study their role in signal transduction.
