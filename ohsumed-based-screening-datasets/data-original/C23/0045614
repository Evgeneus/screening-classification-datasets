Bilateral spontaneous perilymph fistulae: a diagnostic and management dilemma.
 In this article, we present a case of bilateral perilymph fistulae.
 This entity is rare and always presents a diagnostic problem.
 Bilateral perilymph fistulae are more common in children and should be suspected when bilateral ear symptoms and congenital temporal bone radiographic anomalies are present.
 Previous trauma or barotrauma may be absent.
 When a patient manifests bilateral ear symptoms and a fistula has been identified and repaired in one ear, a second fistula should be suspected in the contralateral ear, especially if the fistula test is positive.
