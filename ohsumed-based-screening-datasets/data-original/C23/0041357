Macroscopic vasovasostomy re-examined.
 Results of 273 consecutive macroscopic vasovasostomy procedures performed at a single institution over a nine-year period between 1978 and 1987 were reviewed.
 When patients operated on less than five years after vasectomy were compared with those in whom more than five years had elapsed since vasectomy, significant declines in technical success rates as measured by return of sperm to the ejaculate (93% vs.
 74%, p less than 0.004), biologic recovery as measured by mean sperm counts (55 million vs.
 35 million) and mean progressive sperm motility (30% vs.
 13%), and clinical success as measured by pregnancy rates (52% vs.
 30%, p less than 0.02), were observed.
 Examination of complications of vasovasostomy showed a 7.7 percent overall complication rate and a 1.5 percent incidence of major complications.
