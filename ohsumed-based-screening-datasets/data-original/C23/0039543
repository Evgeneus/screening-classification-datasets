Mechanical complications associated with mentor inflatable penile prosthesis.
 The Mentor inflatable penile prosthesis was developed in an attempt to decrease the mechanical failure rate of the various prostheses' components.
 We herein report on the reliability of the device in 46 men implanted with the Mentor device from December 1982 to June 1987.
 Prior to manufacturer device modification in 1985, mechanical failure mainly attributable to input tubing cracks occurred in 10 of 30 implantations.
 Since device improvement in April 1985, the mechanical failure rate has decreased to 4 percent.
 The Mentor inflatable penile prosthesis has been a mechanically reliable device since design improvement in 1985.
