Pregnancy associated with Gorlin's syndrome.
 A pregnant woman with Gorlin's syndrome presented for the removal of malignant ovarian tumours.
 The main problem encountered by the anaesthetists was an unexpected increase in arterial blood pressure.
 This was most probably associated with surgical manipulation of the ovaries with an increase in prorenin/renin production.
