Popliteal aneurysm with spontaneous arteriovenous fistula.
 This report documents a rare manifestation of aneurysmal disease of the popliteal artery.
 We describe a popliteal aneurysm presenting with acute venous hypertension due to a spontaneously occurring arteriovenous fistula.
 The fistula was defunctionalized by treating the aneurysm with a standard technique of exclusion and bypass with resolution of the symptoms of venous hypertension and maintenance of normal distal perfusion.
