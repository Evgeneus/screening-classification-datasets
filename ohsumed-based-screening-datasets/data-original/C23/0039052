Cinematics and sticking of heart valves in pulsatile flow test.
 The aim of the project was to develop laboratory test devices for studies of the cinematics and sticking behaviour of technical valve protheses.
 The second step includes testing technical valves of different types and sizes under static and dynamic conditions.
 A force-deflection balance was developed in order to load valve rims by static radial forces until sticking or loss of a disc (sticking- and clamping-mould point) with computer-controlled force deflection curves.
 A second deflection device was developed and used for prosthetic valves in the aortic position of a pulsatile mock circulation loop with simultaneous video-cinematography.
 The stiffness of technical valve rims varied between 0.20 (St.
 Jude) and about 1.0 N/micron (metal rim valves).
 The stiffness decreased significantly with increasing valve size.
 Sticking under pulsatile flow conditions was in good agreement with the static deflection measurements.
 Hence, valve sticking with increasing danger of thrombus formation is more likely with a less stiff valve rim.
 In the case of forces acting perpendicularly to the pendulum axis, the clamping mould-point of the valve can be reached, followed by disc dislodgement.
