Comorbidities and perioperative complications among patients with surgically treated benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 We address the question of whether or not age and comorbidity are related to intra- and postoperative complications after a transurethral resection.
 The data are derived from a retrospective, population-based study conducted in Hagen, Germany, which included all patients with an initial prostatectomy for benign prostatic hyperplasia (N = 621) during the five-year period 1984-1988.
 Seventy-seven percent of the patients had at least one of the following preoperative risk factors: heart disease, hypertension, smoking, chronic obstructive lung disease, and diabetes.
 There was no intraoperative death.
 The risk of intraoperative circulatory complications was found to be related to age only for patients without a history of heart diseases or hypertension.
 The incidence of major complications was 3.1 percent and was significantly higher in the oldest age group.
 Three patients (0.54%) died postoperatively in the hospital.
 Infections were the most frequent postoperative complications.
 The relationship of age and overall postoperative complications was not statistically significant either for patients with (p = 0.121) or without any comorbidity (p = 0.651).
 Based on this study it seems reasonable to conclude that age is not a clinically relevant risk factor for perioperative complications in patients who have a transurethral resection for benign prostatic hyperplasia.
