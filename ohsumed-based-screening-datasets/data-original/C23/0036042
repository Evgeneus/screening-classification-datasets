Deep vein thrombosis: effect of graduated compression stockings on distension of the deep veins of the calf.
 The mechanisms by which graduated compression stockings prevent deep vein thrombosis are not completely understood.
 Recent work has suggested that venous distension plays a role in initiating the process.
 Our previous work has shown that the deep veins of the lower limb distend in patients undergoing surgical procedures.
 We have investigated 40 patients receiving surgical treatment on the abdomen or neck.
 A medial gastrocnemius vein was studied using ultrasound imaging during the operations.
 In half the patients a graduated compression anti-embolism stocking was applied to the limb under study at the start of the operation, immediately after initial measurements of vein diameter.
 The median vein diameter in both groups was the same at the start of the operative procedures (control, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.3 mm; stocking, 2.6 mm, interquartile range 2.1-3.7 mm).
 After application of a stocking the median diameter in this group fell to 1.6 mm (interquartile range 1.3-2.8 mm) and then decreased slightly at the end of the operation.
 In the control group the vein diameter increased to 2.9 mm (interquartile range 2.3-4.0 mm) during the operative procedure.
