Acoustic neuroma (schwannoma) surgery 1978-1990.
 A series of 151 patients with 154 acoustic schwannomas have been operated upon in Manchester Royal Infirmary by a joint Otological and Neurosurgical team, employing either the translabyrinthine or the suboccipital approach.
 The perioperative mortality rate was 3 per cent.
 Anatomical preservation of the facial nerve was achieved in 89 per cent of tumour removals and a good to normal functional result in 79 per cent of cases.
 Attempts at hearing preservation have been unsuccessful, largely because of the small number of patients in the series in whom useful hearing was present preoperatively.
 Complications included major brain stem ischaemia (1.2 per cent), CSF fistula (5 per cent) and facial dysaesthesia (7 per cent).
 The incidence of mortality and morbidity is directly related to tumour size and to the experience of the surgeons.
 A number of patients experienced an unusual type of post-operative dreamlike state which appeared to be a form of hypnagogic hallucination, and the possible neurophysiological mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is discussed.
 The continuing failure to attain the ideal of early diagnosis is lamented, and the importance of a flexible bidisciplinary surgical approach emphasized.
