Performance of age-matched controls on a battery of visuo-spatial neglect tests.
 Examination of 47 independent elderly subjects, matched with a population of patients with acute stroke, found that 55% made at least one omission on a battery of neglect tests.
 Up to 43% made omissions on any one test.
 Increasing age and other evidence of cognitive impairment were associated with impaired performance on the battery.
 Omissions were attributed to an age-related decline in visuo-spatial function.
 Cut-off points are provided to distinguish between such age-related impairment and visuospatial neglect.
 The importance of age-matched control studies in developing tests of cognitive impairment in stroke research is highlighted.
