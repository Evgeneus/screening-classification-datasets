Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide and gastrin in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and insulinoma.
 Somatostatin, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and gastrin were measured in the stomach of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes, insulinoma-bearing rats and their respective controls.
 Rats injected with streptozotocin exhibited hyperphagia, insulinopenia and severe hyperglycemia.
 Stomach weights, and the concentrations and total amounts of GRP and gastrin in the stomach, were similar to nondiabetic control rats.
 The concentration of somatostatin in the stomach of diabetic rats was 25% greater, but the total stomach content of somatostatin was similar to that of control rats.
 Insulinoma-bearing rats exhibited hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia.
 Concentrations of GRP and gastrin in the stomach were 72% and 19% lower, respectively, than in control rats.
 Despite 45% greater stomach weight, the total stomach content of GRP was 61% lower.
 Stomach concentrations of somatostatin, and total stomach contents of somatostatin and gastrin, were similar in insulinoma-bearing and control rats.
 The results demonstrate abnormalities in the stomach concentrations of regulatory peptides in rats with diabetes and insulinoma.
 These abnormalities are not attributable to changes in food intake alone, suggesting specific effects of these metabolic diseases on gastric regulatory peptides and gastric function.
