Use of a computerized closed-loop sodium nitroprusside titration system for antihypertensive treatment after open heart surgery.
 This study evaluates the clinical applicability of administering sodium nitroprusside by a closed-loop titration system compared with a manually adjusted system.
 The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was registered every 10 and 30 sec during the first 150 min after open heart surgery in 20 patients (group 1: computer regulation) and in ten patients (group 2: manual regulation).
 The results (16,343 and 2,912 data points in groups 1 and 2, respectively), were then analyzed in four time frames and five pressure ranges to indicate clinical efficacy.
 Sixty percent of the measured MAP in both groups was within the desired +/- 10% during the first 10 min.
 Thereafter until the end of observation, the MAP was maintained within +/- 10% of the desired set-point 90% of the time in group 1 vs.
 60% of the time in group 2.
 One percent and 11% of data points were +/- 20% from the set-point in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p less than .05, chi-square test).
 The computer-assisted therapy provided better control of MAP, was safe to use, and helped to reduce nursing demands.
