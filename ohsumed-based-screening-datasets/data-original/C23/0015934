Pseudo-abscess of the psoas bursa in failed double-cup arthroplasty of the hip.
 Seven psoas bursae filled with purulent fluid and inspissated debris were revealed at revision operations for failed resurfacing hip arthroplasties, an incidence of 5.8% in such revisions.
 Histological and microbiological investigations demonstrated that the psoas bursa collections resulted from the tissue response to polyethylene wear debris.
 None was due to infection.
