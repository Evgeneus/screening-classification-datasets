Salvage from cardiogenic shock by atherectomy after failed emergency coronary artery angioplasty.
 In this case report of a patient undergoing angioplasty for cardiogenic shock during acute myocardial infarction, recurrent occlusion resulted in recurrence of shock.
 Atherectomy reestablished lasting patency and reversed the patient's hemodynamic collapse.
 Atherectomy deserves further investigation as a means to salvage vessel patency during unsuccessful coronary angioplasty.
