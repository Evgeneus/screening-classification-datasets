Basophil-bound and serum immunoglobulin E directed against Helicobacter pylori in patients with chronic gastritis.
 The immunoglobulin (Ig) E immune response in patients with Helicobacter pylori-associated chronic gastritis has been evaluated.
 Of 26 patients with H.
 pylori infection, 22 (84%) tested positive for basophil-bound specific IgE (determined by the histamine release test) and 18 (69%) for serum specific IgE (determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay).
 In contrast, only 1 of 17 persons in whom the bacterium was not detected presented cell-bound and serum specific IgE.
 In the 4 histamine release test--positive but enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay--negative patients, removal of antibody from the basophil surface by acid elution showed that histamine release occurred through an IgE-dependent mechanism.
 When normal basophils, passively sensitized with serum from IgE-positive patients, were exposed to the H.
 pylori antigen, a significant release was observed, confirming the class specificity of the response.
 Inhibition experiments with bacteria other than H.
 pylori showed that the IgE antibody was specifically directed against this organism.
 The percentage of antigen-induced histamine release did not correlate with serum specific IgE level.
 However, the response of basophils to antigenic challenge was proportional to IgE-dependent cellular releasability.
 This finding suggests that target cell sensitivity may be the most important factor in determining the entity of biological response to the antigenic challenge.
 The ability of H.
 pylori to induce a specific IgE immune response could answer key questions regarding the mechanisms inducing gastric inflammation.
