Cytogenetic analysis of sperm from a man heterozygous for a pericentric inversion, inv (3) (p25q21).
 Human sperm chromosomes were studied in a man heterozygous for a pericentric inversion of chromosome 3(p25q21).
 The pronuclear chromosomes were analyzed after in vitro penetration of golden hamster eggs.
 A total of 144 sperm were examined: 69.2% were chromosomally balanced and 30.8% were recombinant.
 Of the balanced complements, the proportion with a normal chromosome 3 (37.6%) was approximately equal to the proportion with an inverted 3 (31.6%).
 Of the recombinant complements, the proportion of sperm with a duplication q/deletion p (17.3%) was approximately equal to the reciprocal event of duplication p/deletion q (13.5%).
 The recombinant chromosome 3 with a duplication q and deletion p has been observed in several abnormal children, but the duplication p/deletion q has never been reported.
 My results demonstrate that both recombinant chromosomes are produced as expected from an unequal number of crossovers within an inversion loop.
 In all likelihood the duplication p/deletion q chromosome is an early embryonic lethal because of the amount of genetic material deleted.
 The proportions of X-bearing (48.9%) and Y-bearing sperm (51.1%) were not significantly different from the expected 1:1 ratio.
 There was no evidence for an interchromosomal effect.
 Of the three inversions studied by human sperm chromosome analysis, recombinant chromosomes have been observed only in this case.
