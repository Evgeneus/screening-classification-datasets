Simultaneous ipsilateral vasal and epididymal reconstruction.
 Injuries to the spermatic cords, sustained during childhood inguinal hernioplasty, caused unilateral testicular atrophy, multiple bilateral excurrent duct obstruction and aspermia.
 Simultaneous unilateral vasal reconstruction and vaso-epididymostomy resulted in satisfactory semen parameters.
 It is expected that vasal integrity will be maintained after multiple reconstructive procedures at different locations if further injury to the vascular supply of the excurrent duct is avoided.
