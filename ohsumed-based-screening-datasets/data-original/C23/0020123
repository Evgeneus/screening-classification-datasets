Extramedullary hematopoiesis in the liver in sudden infant death syndrome.
 Liver extramedullary hematopoiesis was examined in 54 victims of sudden infant death syndrome and in 21 infants who died of other causes in an attempt to confirm Naeye's findings of increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in cases of sudden infant death syndrome.
 Our data showed greater extramedullary hematopoiesis in victims of sudden infant death syndrome (F = 23.52), supporting Naeye's hypothesis that victims of sudden infant death syndrome have suffered a subtle, chronic hypoxemic condition before death.
