Laparotomy closure reinforced with buried polyglyconate retention sutures.
 A method of laparotomy closure using continuous no.
 0 polyglycolic acid suture for accurate fascial approximation and buried retention sutures of no.
 1 polyglyconate for prolonged wound strength is described.
 Both security and anatomical precision in fascial closure are achieved without the use of nonabsorbable suture material.
 This method of laparotomy closure is suitable for patients at high risk for fascial dehiscence.
