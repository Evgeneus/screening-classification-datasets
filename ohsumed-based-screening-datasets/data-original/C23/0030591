Histological grading of squamous cell carcinoma of the penis: a new scoring system.
 A system of histological grading based on retrospective analysis of 239 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis is presented.
 A new scoring system with 4 histological grades was used.
 The results of this study confirm previous reports that penile cancer is usually a highly (50%) or moderately (29%) differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.
 Poorly differentiated carcinomas and cancers of other types are very rare.
 The new grading system was found to be practical and a correlation between histological grade, clinical findings and prognosis was established.
 Patients with grade 1 tumours had an exceptionally favourable prognosis, with more than 80% being long-term survivors; for these patients, treatment with delayed side effects should be avoided and new forms of treatment should be explored.
