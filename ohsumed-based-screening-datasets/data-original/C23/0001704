Prolapse of a neovagina created by self-dilatation.
 In patients with congenital absence of the vagina, a neovagina may be created by either operative or nonoperative techniques.
 A 25-year-old patient with a neovagina created by self-dilatation developed complete prolapse of the neovagina with an enterocele.
 A transabdominal sacral colpopexy successfully suspended the vaginal vault and allowed the patient to resume sexual function.
