Aggressive oral refeeding in hospitalized patients.
 Malnutrition is an important clinical condition leading to increased morbidity and mortality.
 This report describes an aggressive oral refeeding program of high-caloric foods, which was instituted in severely anorectic patients because of their refusal to eat meals or supplements.
 After ascertaining a patient's favorite sweet, hospital personnel and family collaborated in providing the food.
 Frequently, sweets were the patient's only intake for weeks.
 We saw a gradual return of appetite, inclusion of other foods in the diet, and overall clinical improvement in comorbid conditions.
 These cases suggest that aggressive oral refeeding with high-caloric foods is an underutilized therapy for multiply impaired elderly patients.
