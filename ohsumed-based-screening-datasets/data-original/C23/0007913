Permanent venous access via subcutaneous infusion port in severe asthma.
 A subcutaneous infusion port was implanted in a 34-year-old patient with frequent and severe asthma attacks to ensure prompt and reliable venous access.
 Difficulties with peripheral venous access were possible cofactors necessitating mechanical ventilation on two occasions before this implantation.
 The method described is simple and seems useful for asthmatics in need of frequent parenteral medication.
