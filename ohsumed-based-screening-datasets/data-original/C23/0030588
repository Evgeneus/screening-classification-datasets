Fractures of the penis: therapeutic approach and long-term results.
 Injury to the external male genitalia is considered, with attention focused on accidental fracture of the corpora cavernosa (by coitus or masturbation).
 Such injuries are often complicated by urethral lesions.
 We present 13 patients with either simple or complicated fracture of the penis, all of whom were operated on between 2 h and 8 days following injury, with excellent functional results.
 The need for immediate surgery is emphasised, in order to avoid erectile failure and curvature, which are typical complications of conservative treatment.
 Surgery consists of complete evacuation of haematoma, curettage and repair of the albuginea.
 If the fracture is associated with urethral disruption, the latter is also repaired.
