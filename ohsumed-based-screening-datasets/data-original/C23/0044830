Neuropsychologic test performance in amateur boxers.
 Cognitive functions of 23 amateur boxers were assessed immediately before and after an amateur boxing event.
 A range of cognitive measures were employed including tasks of verbal, figural, and incidental memory, motor functions, attention and concentration, and information processing speed.
 Compared to their prefight performance, boxers demonstrated impairments in verbal and incidental memory, but enhanced executive and motor functions postfight.
 There were no observed differences between winners and losers on any of the measures.
 The results are compared to other studies that have shown only minor changes in cognitive functions in amateur boxers compared to controls.
