The stomach in liver cirrhosis. Endoscopic, morphological, and clinical correlations.
 The stomachs of cirrhotic patients are frequently subject to a number of alterations, detectable by endoscopy, the presence of which indicates a disturbance in the mucosa.
 Several investigators believe that portal hypertension plays an etiopathogenetic role.
 Three groups of subjects were studied prospectively: 83 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension, 53 cirrhotic patients without portal hypertension, and 135 control subjects.
 Snake skin, scarlatina rash, and petechia were the most frequent endoscopic findings in the cirrhotic patients with portal hypertension (P less than 0.001); these findings were also most frequently present in association with each other in this group.
 There was no correlation between the endoscopic findings, the clinical gravity of liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh grade), and the gravity of esophageal varices (Beppu score).
 There were no characteristic inflammatory findings in the gastric mucosa.
 Hypergastrinemia was often observed in cirrhotic patients with and without angiodysplasias.
