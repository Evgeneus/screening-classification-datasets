Anaesthetic problems in ex situ resection of the liver.
 Ex-situ resection of the liver is a new surgical technique for treatment of liver tumours not amenable to conventional surgery.
 This paper describes the cardiovascular and metabolic changes that occurred in nine consecutive such patients.
 No severe haemodynamic or pulmonary complications occurred.
 Specific problems were encountered during the prolonged anhepatic period, which lasted an average of 5.96 (SD 1.46) hours.
 Significant metabolic and coagulation disorders occurred 2 to 3 hours after hepatectomy because of complete loss of hepatic function.
 The predominant findings during the anhepatic period were hypoglycaemia and severe metabolic acidosis, mainly from increased levels of lactic acid.
 Exogenous administration of dextrose 5% at an average rate of 188 ml/hour was necessary to maintain normoglycaemia, while correction of metabolic acidosis required 403 (SD 159.79) mmol of sodium bicarbonate, supplemented by hyperventilation.
 Tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane was used when sodium overload was thought to be a problem.
 There was a marked decrease of Factor V and fibrinogen, a moderate thrombocytopenia and fibrinolysis.
 The severity of these alterations was dependent on the duration of the anhepatic period and the primary function of the re-implanted liver.
