Postblepharoplasty ectropion. Prevention and management.
 Lower-eyelid malposition is one of the more serious complications encountered following lower-lid blepharoplasty, ranging in severity from mild lower-lid retraction to frank ectropion with marked lower-lid eversion.
 We define a grading system for postblepharoplasty lid malposition based on the severity of lower-lid retraction.
 In a critical review of 111 patients who underwent lower-lid blepharoplasty between January 1985 and January 1990, 15% were thought to have some degree of lower-lid retraction.
 Presence of lid laxity preoperatively and increasing amounts of skin excision at surgery were significant factors in the development of malposition.
 Placement of orbicularis suspension sutures tended to decrease the incidence of lid retraction.
 No patients had frank ectropion; however, three patients with grade 2 or 3 malposition required a secondary surgical procedure for correction.
 All three patients had resolution of their symptoms and good cosmetic results using standard treatment methods.
 A literature review and discussion of the causes, sequelae, and management of post-operative ectropion is presented as a reminder to surgeons performing blepharoplasty.
 Avoidance of this entity by appropriate preoperative assessment is emphasized, along with conservative operative technique.
 These factors combined are essential for the successful outcome of lower-lid blepharoplasty.
