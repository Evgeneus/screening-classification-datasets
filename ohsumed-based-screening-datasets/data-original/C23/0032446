Occupational urticaria from welding polyurethane.
 An urticarial reaction associated with high fever developed in a welder on four occasions while he was welding steel profiles filled with polyurethane.
 The fumes emitted during pyrolysis of polyurethane and inhaled by the patient probably caused the urticarial reaction.
 Provocation tests with two pyrolysis products, 4,4-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 4,4-diaminophenylmethane, were negative.
 This case demonstrates the difficulty in detecting the cause of urticaria induced by airborne chemicals.
