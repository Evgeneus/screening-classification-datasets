Acute gall bladder perforation--a dilemma in early diagnosis.
 Gall bladder perforation is a rare complication of cholecystitis.
 A definitive diagnosis is uncommon before surgery and the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition are high.
 We report six patients with gall bladder perforation to show the difficulty of making an early diagnosis.
 The history and the clinical findings of these patients are reviewed to highlight diagnostic pitfalls.
