Bleeding patterns during continuous combined estrogen-progestogen therapy.
 Bleeding and climacteric symptoms were recorded in two groups of postmenopausal women receiving either continuous combined estradiol and norethisterone acetate or estradiol and cyproterone acetate.
 Out of a sample of 99 postmenopausal women aged 45 to 54 years, 86 completed a 2-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
 Comparison of the bleeding patterns in the two groups revealed a statistically significant difference: More women in the estradiol-cyproterone acetate group experienced bleeding and for a longer duration.
 Thirteen women in the estradiol-norethisterone acetate group were amenorrheic, compared with two in the other group.
 The Kupperman index score in both groups declined to about 30% to 40% of initial values (p less than 0.001).
 The hot flushes in both treatment groups decreased to a highly significant degree (p less than 0.001), to a value below 20% of baseline values.
 We conclude that a continuous combination of estrogen and progestogen can produce amenorrhea and symptomatic relief.
 However, the progestogen components seem to differ in their ability to control bleeding.
