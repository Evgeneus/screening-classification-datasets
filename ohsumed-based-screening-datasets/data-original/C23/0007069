The management of primary fallopian tube carcinoma.
 The outcome of 30 patients with primary fallopian tube carcinoma is described.
 Treatment varied over the 22 year period of accrual and included combinations of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
 There was an apparent increase in stage at treatment with time which was probably related to more precise staging at laparotomy and the greater use of computerized tomography.
 The median survival for all patients was 28 months and the 5-year survival was 18%.
 Ten patients received postoperative chemotherapy for residual disease with an overall response rate of 80% and median progression-free and overall survival times of 14 and 21 months respectively.
 The pattern of relapse was similar to that seen in ovarian carcinoma, with all but one patient having the pelvis or abdomen as the main site of recurrence.
 Primary fallopian tube carcinoma has a response to treatment and a tumour biology similar to that of ovarian carcinoma.
 It is recommended that the management of this uncommon malignancy should continue to be along the lines of ovarian carcinoma, with initial treatment by cytoreductive surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy for residual disease.
