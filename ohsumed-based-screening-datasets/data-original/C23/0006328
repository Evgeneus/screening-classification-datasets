Computerized tomography in acute gastrointestinal disorders.
 In recent years, computerized tomography (CT) has become one of the most important imaging modalities in evaluation of patients with acute gastrointestinal disorders.
 Its role, diagnostic accuracy, indications, and limitations in some of the most commonly encountered acute abdominal conditions are succinctly presented and reviewed.
 CT should not be used indiscriminantly, but is best considered a valuable primary or complimentary diagnostic tool in critically ill patients.
 Its selective use in a variety of emergency abdominal diseases will significantly improve accuracy of clinical diagnoses, leading to a prompt and adequate medical or surgical management.
