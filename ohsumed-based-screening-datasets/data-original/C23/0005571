Retinal sensitivity in acute hypoglycemia.
 We measured retinal threshold sensitivity via automated computerized static perimetry in predetermined meridians in euglycemic diabetic subjects and in the same subjects during insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
 During periods of reduced blood glucose levels, decreased retinal sensitivity, most marked in temporal meridians, was observed.
