Carcinoid tumors: the relationship between clinical presentation and the extent of disease.
 In this study the relationship between the initial clinical presentation and the extent of tumor progression was determined in a group of 31 patients with carcinoid tumors.
 The proportion of patients with symptomatic tumors was similar to those patients with carcinoid tumors that were incidentally found (55% versus 45%; SE = 0.089).
 Symptoms were caused by metastatic tumor in nine (30%) of the patients and by local effects of the primary tumor in eight (26%) of the patients.
 The patients with symptoms had a significantly increased frequency of metastatic disease, even when the symptoms were due to the primary tumor, compared to patients with no symptoms (76% versus 7%; p less than 0.001).
 Tumor size was related to the presence of symptoms and metastases.
 Symptoms were most common when the size of the primary tumor was greater than 1.0 cm (p less than 0.005), although the rate of metastases increased when primary tumors were 2.0 cm and larger (p less than 0.01).
 These results indicate that the presence of symptoms or a primary tumor 2.0 cm or larger are associated with an increased risk of metastatic disease in patients with carcinoid tumors.
 These patients should be treated with wide resection of the primary tumor and its lymphatic drainage.
