Isolated incisional metastases after intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate therapy for ovarian carcinoma.
 Two women developed apparently isolated recurrences of ovarian carcinoma involving prior incisions after receiving intraperitoneal radioactive chromic phosphate (P-32) adjuvant therapy for early epithelial ovarian carcinoma.
 Both are alive without evidence of disease at second-look laparotomy after surgical resection of the abdominal wall metastases and cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy.
 Mechanisms of cutaneous and incisional implantation metastases are discussed.
 Adjuvant therapy with intraperitoneal P-32 is unable to provide systemic therapy for occult metastatic disease.
 The favorable outcome in these cases probably reflects limited tumor burden at the time of recurrence and stands in stark contrast to other cases of soft tissue recurrences of ovarian carcinoma reported previously.
