Reversible myopathy due to labetalol.
 A severe, generalized myopathy developed in 2 children treated with labetalol.
 An 11-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy demonstrated proximal weakness and markedly elevated creatine kinase levels during labetalol therapy.
 Clinical improvement began immediately when labetalol administration was halted; muscle strength was normal within 2 months.
 Muscle biopsies were consistent with rhabdomyolysis.
