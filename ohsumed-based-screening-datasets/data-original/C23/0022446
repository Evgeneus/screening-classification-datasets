Control of hypertensive emergencies 
 Although uncommon, hypertensive emergencies require prompt recognition and treatment to reduce very high morbidity and mortality rates.
 Admission to an intensive care unit for treatment and monitoring is essential for optimal care.
 A Swan-Ganz catheter is often helpful in management.
 Intravenous nitroprusside sodium (Nipride, Nitropress) is probably the drug of choice for hypertensive emergencies other than those due to eclampsia or pheochromocytoma.
