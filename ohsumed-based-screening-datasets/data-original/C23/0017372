Snow skiing for the physically disabled.
 The sport of snow skiing by the physically disabled, which originated in Europe in 1935 and first received attention in the United States in the 1940s, is reviewed in terms of opportunities available, instructions, adaptive equipment necessary, and benefits provided.
 Persons with a wide variety of disabilities (such as cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, hemiplegia, amputation, blindness, spina bifida, and muscular dystrophy) can participate.
 Accordingly, a wide range of adaptive equipment is available--including outrigger skis, flip-skis, canting wedges, ski bras, "toe spreaders," sit-skis, and mono-skis--to allow safe enjoyment of the sport.
 Programs for instruction of the disabled skier are increasing in number and popularity, and numerous opportunities are available to enter competitive events sponsored by National Handicapped Sports.
 Both the participants and the instructors relate the numerous physical and psychologic benefits that can be derived from skiing; the sport provides an almost universal enjoyment of the sense of freedom and independence.
 Snow skiing is an enjoyable, beneficial, outdoor cold-weather activity that the disabled population can safely learn with proper instruction.
