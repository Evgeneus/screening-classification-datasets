Spinal cord stimulation in 60 cases of intractable pain.
 Sixty patients with spinal cord stimulators implanted for intractable pain lasting up to 50 years were followed for up to nine years.
 Forty seven per cent derived significant benefit, 23% modest benefit, 20% experienced no effect and 6.7% were made worse.
 Two were made worse after initial benefit.
 Complications, indications and factors relevant to the mode of action are discussed.
