Myocardial oedema and ventricular function after cardioplegia with added mannitol.
 Myocardial oedema may contribute to the impaired myocardial performance which commonly follows open heart surgery with cardioplegia-induced cardiac arrest.
 The rate of oedema formation during crystalloid cardioplegia and the relation of this to changes in ventricular compliance and ventricular function following reperfusion were studied using an isolated rabbit heart preparation.
 Myocardial tissue water content increased during cardioplegic arrest and the water content prior to reperfusion demonstrated an inverse correlation with ventricular function after reperfusion.
 In further studies the effect of adding mannitol to a standard crystalloid cardioplegic solution was investigated.
 The preparations were divided into two groups: nine were administered a standard cardioplegic solution (Plegisol*) (control group) and a further eight were administered the same solution mixed with mannitol to adjust the osmotic pressure to 360 mOsmol.L-3 (mannitol group).
 The mannitol group demonstrated less increase in RV water content and superior LV dP/dtmax following reperfusion.
 It is concluded that mannitol enhances protection of the myocardium during cardioplegic cardiac arrest.
