Adult lipophagic atrophic panniculitis.
 We report two patients with chronic, recurrent, nodular panniculitis lesions that later developed areas of lipoatrophy.
 Histologically, there was a consistent lobular lipophagic replacement of fat cells with lipophagic giant cells.
 The clinical appearance was that of tender, erythematous, superficial or subcutaneous, symmetrical nodules and plaques of 1-2 weeks' duration.
 The lesions could occur with episodes of fever.
 One patient had hepatomegaly and the other had an increased sedimentation rate and leucocytosis.
 The histology and the clinical pattern of the panniculitus syndrome resembled those of lipophagic lipoatrophy of childhood.
 This is a panniculitis of unknown cause in which the principal inflammatory cell response in the subcutaneous tissue is the macrophage.
