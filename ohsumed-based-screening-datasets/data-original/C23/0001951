Recurrent anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel.
 Recurrent anterior dislocation of the ulnar nerve at the cubital tunnel is reported in two patients.
 This was due to traumatic attenuation of the flexor carpi ulnaris retinaculum.
 The mechanism of injury in both patients was a fall with the shoulder abducted and the elbow acutely flexed.
 Both patients had relief of their neurologic symptoms following anterior submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve.
