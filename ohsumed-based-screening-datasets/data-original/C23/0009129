Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass after failed femoropopliteal reconstructions.
 Deep femoral to anterior tibial artery bypass is a reconstructive technique occasionally applicable when more conventional attempts at revascularization of the distal portion of the leg have failed.
 Three such patients, in whom the anterior tibial was the only distal patent branch of the popliteal artery, had severe symptoms of arterial insufficiency.
 Deep femoral to anterior tibial bypass was done using autogenous The distal portion of the deep femoral artery was exposed through an anteromedial distal thigh approach.
 The three patients have been followed up for a mean of 20.3 months, and each maintains graft patency and marked symptomatic improvement.
