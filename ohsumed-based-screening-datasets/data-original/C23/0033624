Urinary tract malformations in identical twins.
 We describe 3 sets of twins with discordance for urological malformations.
 Zygosity was documented by HLA and blood group typing.
 It is suggested that evaluation of the identical twin of an affected patient should include the entire urinary tract because of the potential for different lesions.
