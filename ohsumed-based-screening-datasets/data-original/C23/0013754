Acute lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients with diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
 This study focused on 401 children less than 5 years old who were hospitalized with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI) and diarrhea in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and who were investigated for the presence of both bacterial and viral respiratory tract pathogens as well as for selected diarrheal pathogens.
 The most common manifestations of ALRI were pneumonia (374 cases), bronchiolitis (12 cases), and tracheobronchitis (11 cases).
 The majority (77%) of the illnesses were in children less than 2 years of age, and 88% of the children were malnourished.
 A respiratory tract pathogen was identified in 30% of the patients, and a diarrheal pathogen was identified in 34%.
 The overall case-fatality rate in children with ALRI and diarrhea was 8%.
 The case-fatality rate was 14% in children with bacterial pneumonia and diarrhea, 3% in those with viral pneumonia and diarrhea, and 14% in malnourished children with shigellosis and ALRI.
 The most common respiratory tract pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, influenza viruses, and Haemophilus influenzae type b.
