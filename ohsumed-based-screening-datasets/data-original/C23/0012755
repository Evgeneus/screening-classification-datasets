Locked intramedullary nailing of femoral shaft fractures.
 One hundred twenty-three femoral shaft fractures were treated with Grosse-Kempf slotted, locked nails and followed for a median 20 (range, 12-60) months.
 There were eight intraoperative and 11 postoperative complications, among them two superficial and two deep infections.
 Most of the intraoperative complications and some postoperatively lost reductions could have been prevented by a better operative technique and judgment of stability.
 Seventy-eight results were graded as excellent, 24 as good, 19 as fair, and two as poor (one 9-cm shortening and one 40 degrees external malrotation).
 All fractures united without further procedures during the first year.
