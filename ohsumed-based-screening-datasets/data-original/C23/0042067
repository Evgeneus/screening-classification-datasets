I-TevI, the endonuclease encoded by the mobile td intron, recognizes binding and cleavage domains on its DNA target.
 Mobility of the phage T4 td intron depends on activity of an intron-encoded endonuclease (I-TevI), which cleaves a homologous intronless (delta In) target gene.
 The double-strand break initiates a recombination event that leads to intron transfer.
 We found previously that I-TevI cleaves td delta In target DNA 23-26 nucleotides upstream of the intron insertion site.
 DNase I-footprinting experiments and gel-shift assays indicate that I-TevI makes primary contacts around the intron insertion site.
 A synthetic DNA duplex spanning the insertion site but lacking the cleavage site was shown to bind I-TevI specifically, and when cloned, to direct cleavage into vector sequences.
 The behavior of the cloned duplex and that of deletion and insertion mutants support a primary role for sequences surrounding the insertion site in directing I-TevI binding, conferring cleavage ability, and determining cleavage polarity.
 On the other hand, sequences around the cleavage site were shown to influence cleavage efficiency and cut-site selection.
 The role of cleavage-site sequences in determining cleavage distance argues against a strict "ruler" mechanism for cleavage by I-TevI.
 The complex nature of the homing site recognized by this unusual type of endonuclease is considered in the context of intron spread.
