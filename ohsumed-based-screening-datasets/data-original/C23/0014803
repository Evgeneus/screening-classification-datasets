Total unilateral lung gangrene in Hodgkin's disease: treatment by thoracostomy.
 Total gangrene of the left lung developed in a 30-year-old male patient with a pulmonary recurrence of Hodgkin's disease after mediastinal irradiation and chemotherapy.
 Clinically, tension pyopneumothorax and severe septic shock were present.
 Surgical repair was done by thoracostomy, resecting three ribs.
 A 2 x 0.5-cm hole in the necrotic wall of the left main bronchus was covered with an intercostal muscle bundle.
 The necrotic pleural surfaces were treated openly by daily change of dressings.
 The patient recovered satisfactorily and underwent four further courses of chemotherapy without any complications.
