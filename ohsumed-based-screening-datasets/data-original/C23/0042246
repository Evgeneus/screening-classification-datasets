Symptomatic retinoschisis-detachment involving the macula.
 We treated three patients (four eyes) in whom posteriorly situated retinoschisis-detachments became symptomatic because of elevation of a limited area of full-thickness retina at the macula adjacent to these lesions.
 Laser photocoagulation alone was successful in achieving long-term macular reattachment in one eye but failed in both eyes of a bilaterally affected patient.
 In this patient, retinal cryopexy, external drainage of subretinal and retinoschisis cavity fluid, and intravitreal air injection attained long-term macular reattachment and retinoschisis cavity collapse in both eyes.
 In the third patient, cryopexy, drainage of subretinal and retinoschisis cavity fluid, and scleral buckling failed to reattach the retina.
 Subsequent laser photocoagulation induced reabsorption of subretinal fluid but without retinoschisis cavity collapse.
 Alternative management strategies for these unusual cases include retinal cryopexy alone and vitrectomy techniques.
