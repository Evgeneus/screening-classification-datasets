Primary sarcomas of the major salivary glands.
 Sarcomas arising in the major salivary glands are rare.
 This article presents the clinicopathologic features of 11 patients with primary sarcomas of the parotid gland (eight men and three women aged 7 to 75 years; mean age, 42 years).
 The 11 sarcomas were histologically typified as follows: three malignant fibrous histiocytomas and two each of neurosarcomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, fibrosarcomas, and osteosarcomas.
 Four patients experienced disease recurrences, and seven patients developed metastases.
 Seven patients died of their sarcomas, with a mean survival time of 30 months.
 Four patients were alive from 5 to 12 years (one each with angiomatoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and neurosarcoma).
 Prognosis correlated with size of the neoplasm, type of sarcoma, and histologic grade.
 In this respect, salivary gland sarcomas behaved in identical fashion to their soft-tissue counterparts.
