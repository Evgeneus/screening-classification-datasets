Effect of exposure of miners to aluminium powder.
 'McIntyre Powder' (finely ground aluminium and aluminium oxide) was used as a prophylactic agent against silicotic lung disease between 1944 and 1979 in mines in northern Ontario.
 To find out whether the practice produced neurotoxic effects a morbidity prevalence study was conducted between 1988 and 1989.
 There were no significant differences between exposed and non-exposed miners in reported diagnoses of neurological disorder; however, exposed miners performed less well than did unexposed workers on cognitive state examinations; also, the proportion of men with scores in the impaired range was greater in the exposed than non-exposed group.
 Likelihood of scores in the impaired range increased with duration of exposure.
 The findings are consistent with putative neurotoxicity of chronic aluminium exposure.
