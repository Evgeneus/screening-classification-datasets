Repair of a cerebrospinal fluid perilymph fistula primarily through the middle ear and secondarily by occluding the cochlear aqueduct.
 A 35-year-old man had a 5-year history of fluctuating hearing loss in his only hearing ear.
 History and diagnostic tests indicated a perilymph fistula, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by exploration.
 Primary and secondary repairs temporarily ameliorated symptoms.
 A spinal fluid to middle ear fluid pathway was identified by radioactive tracer.
 A patent cochlear aqueduct indicated on computed tomography scan was found and repaired through a posterior cranial fossa approach.
 Hearing was preserved, remaining relatively stable during the 2-year follow-up period.
