Arthrodesis with dual plates after failed total knee arthroplasty.
 Eleven patients were treated by arthrodesis with dual compression plates after failed total knee arthroplasty.
 All patients had a solid fusion, at an average of 5.6 months after the operation.
 The complications included one femoral stress fracture and one persistent infection, both of which were treated successfully.
 Fixation with dual compression plates is a useful technique for the salvage of a failed total knee arthroplasty, even when the patient has an infection.
 Staggering of the plates may help to prevent late stress fractures.
