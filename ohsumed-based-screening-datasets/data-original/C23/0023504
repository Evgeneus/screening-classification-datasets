Cervical spine stabilization. A three-dimensional, biomechanical evaluation of rotational stability, strength, and failure mechanisms.
 The three-dimensional rotational biomechanical properties of several different types of posterior stabilizing procedures are reported.
 A severe ligamentous and bony injury was simulated with three vertebral body human cervical spine segments.
 Good stabilization was noted for all of the repairs in flexion loading.
 Without polymethylmethacrylate supplementation, none of the repairs was stable in extension.
 All of the repairs provided reasonable stabilization for lateral bending except for the posterior wiring without methacrylate, and all but the posterior wiring and facet fusion provided reasonable stabilization against axial rotation loading.
 The supplementation of all of these repairs with polymethylmethacrylate added considerably to the stability of all the constraints.
 These findings may be useful in clinical decision-making for determining the kind of repairs and postoperative brace protection to use.
