Duplex sonography in splenomegaly.
 The aetiology of splenomegaly is seldom clear from either clinical or imaging assessment of the spleen.
 In the majority of cases sonographic assessment of the spleen produces a homogeneous enlargement of variable echodensity, but with very poor correlation with pathology.
 A study has been undertaken to assess the Doppler characteristics of the splenic artery in splenomegaly, excluding cases of portal hypertension in an attempt to provide further diagnostic information.
 Duplex assessment of 18 normal subjects and 10 patients with splenomegaly due to five different causes was undertaken.
 Analysis of waveform, peak frequency and pulsatility index were compared and failed to demonstrate any significant change.
 In the normal subject there is a broad systolic spectrum related to the tortuosity of the splenic artery, with persistence of forward flow throughout diastole, a reflection of the low peripheral resistance of the spleen.
 In splenomegaly the broad systolic spectrum is unchanged, since vessel tortuosity persists.
 Pathological and physiological assessment of the spleen in splenomegaly shows that a low resistance circulation persists, explaining maintenance of the diastolic flow pattern in splenomegaly.
 Increased blood flow to the spleen in splenomegaly occurs either as a result of an increase in vessel diameter or an increase in flow velocity, or a variable combination of the two which does not seem to be governed by specific pathology.
 An increase in peak frequency in some cases reflected some increase in flow velocity but provided no useful correlation.
 Analysis of the pulsatility index supported the above findings without adding further information.
