Diagnosis and treatment of oral candidosis.
 Oral candidosis is a common opportunistic infection that manifests in a variety of forms.
 It is also recognized as one of the earliest manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 Although a number of antifungal agents are available for the treatment of this condition, a newly introduced triazole group of drugs appears to be highly effective in treating oral candidosis.
 This article reviews the clinical presentation and management of oral candidosis, particularly with reference to the latter group of drugs and HIV-induced disease.
