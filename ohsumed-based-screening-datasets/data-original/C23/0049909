Oncocytic metaplasia of the pharynx.
 Oncocytic metaplasia of the pharynx has been infrequently described, with only two previous cases in the literature.
 With the advent of panendoscopy during the last decade, however, a better understanding of this histopathologic diagnosis is desirable.
 Thirty-three cases are reviewed, with thirty occurring in the nasopharynx.
 This was most commonly discovered as an unrelated finding during endoscopic evaluation of a head and neck mass or malignancy in twenty-two patients, either histologically after random biopsy or after biopsy of small but visible lesions.
 An additional eight cases manifested otitis media or eustachian tube dysfunction.
 The histology, terminology, and benign clinical nature of these lesions are discussed.
