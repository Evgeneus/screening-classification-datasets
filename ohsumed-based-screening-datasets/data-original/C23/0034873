Recovery of costal and crural diaphragmatic contractility from partial paralysis.
 Since the two muscles (costal and crural) that constitute the diaphragm are separate and histologically different, their individual recovery pattern from neuromuscular blockade also may be different.
 Therefore, we studied the recovery of force and shortening in the in vivo diaphragm from atracurium-induced neuromuscular blockade in seven pentobarbital anesthetized dogs to assess segmental differences.
 Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi), shortening of costal and crural segments, integrated electromyogram (EMG), and tidal volume (VT) were measured during spontaneous breathing.
 After atracurium had reduced VT to 30% of control, breathing parameters were followed until recovered to 90% of control values.
 In addition, force-frequency curves generated by supramaximal tetanic stimuli of the phrenic nerve were measured.
 Recovery times for tidal Pdi, tidal EMG, tidal shortening, low-frequency shortening, and twitch Pdi were twice as fast as for VT (40 +/- 4 min), reflecting a slower rate of recovery of accessory inspiratory muscles.
 High-frequency recovery was typically slower than that of VT.
 During tidal breathing and tetanic stimulation, costal and crural shortening recovered simultaneously.
 On the other hand, comparison between costal and crural by analysis of pressure-shortening relationships showed a segmental difference (crural shortened 30% more than costal at the same Pdi), which implied reduced afterload on the crural segment.
 However, since shortening and pressure were linearly related during paralysis and recovery, measurements of Pdi alone can accurately reflect changes in contractile mass when heterogeneity and afterload are controlled.
