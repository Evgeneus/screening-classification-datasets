Quantitative analysis of inflammatory cell influx, procollagen type I synthesis, and collagen cross-linking in incisional wounds: influence of PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 therapy.
 Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB homodimer) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) are potent wound-healing hormones that accelerate incisional repair.
 To identify more precisely and quantitatively the stage(s) of wound healing influenced by growth-factor therapy, we investigated the three sequential tissue repair processes--inflammatory cell influx, intracellular procollagen type I (PC-I) synthesis, and collagen cross-linking--in recombinant growth factor--treated wounds.
 Using newly developed automated, quantitative image-analysis techniques, we observed that PDGF-BB markedly augmented the directed migration of macrophages into wounds during the first week after wounding and triggered and earlier and more sustained influx of PC-I--containing fibroblasts into the wound when compared with results in TGF-beta 1-treated or control wounds (p = 0.015 at day 2; p = 0.007 at day 21).
 In contrast, automated image analysis revealed TGF-beta 1-treated wound fibroblasts had a nearly twofold increase in intracellular levels of PC-I protein when compared with PDGF-BB-treated or control wound fibroblasts (p = 0.004 at day 4).
 However, the influence of TGF-beta 1 was transient, and the longer duration of PDGF-BB activity suggested a later influence, perhaps on the collagen remodeling phase, which is ultimately required for increased wound strength.
 To address this possibility, collagen cross-linking in growth factor-treated wounds was inhibited by beta-aminoproprionitrile (BAPN) treatment, and wound breaking strength was analyzed.
 Both PDGF-BB and TGF-beta 1 continued to enhance repair in BAPN-treated rats, indicating that they do not function primarily at the level of collagen cross-linking.
 Thus, PDGF-BB appears to enhance the inflammatory phase of wound healing to indirectly trigger PC-I synthesis, whereas TGF-beta 1 quantitatively enhances PC-I synthesis directly, accounting for their differing duration of activities within healing wounds.
