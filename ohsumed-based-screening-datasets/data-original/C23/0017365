Changes in anxiety among abstinent male alcoholics.
 Symptoms of anxiety are prevalent features of alcoholics seeking treatment.
 In the present study levels of state anxiety among male primary alcoholics (with no preexisting major psychiatric disorders) were examined 3 times per week during inpatient treatment for alcoholism and again at 3 months following treatment.
 The 171 male alcoholics also completed the trait scale of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory upon admission to an inpatient program and at 3 months following treatment.
 Results indicate that recently detoxified males experience multiple anxiety symptoms, with 40% reporting significantly elevated levels of state anxiety at admission (greater than or equal to 75th percentile).
 By the second week of treatment state anxiety scores typically returned to the normal range although symptoms continued to decrease significantly with each week of continued abstinence.
 Elevated levels of anxiety symptoms were more common among primary alcoholics with a history of panic episodes or generalized anxiety disorder symptoms.
 While abstainers and relapsers did not differ in level of anxiety observed during treatment, the relapsers report significantly higher state and trait anxiety scores at follow-up.
