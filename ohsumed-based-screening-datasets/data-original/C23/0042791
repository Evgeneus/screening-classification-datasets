Stereotactic radiosurgery for arteriovenous malformations of the brain.
 Stereotactic radiosurgery successfully obliterates carefully selected arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) of the brain.
 In an initial 3-year experience using the 201-source cobalt-60 gamma knife at the University of Pittsburgh, 227 patients with AVM's were treated.
 Symptoms at presentation included prior hemorrhage in 143 patients (63%), headache in 104 (46%), and seizures in 70 (31%).
 Neurological deficits were present in 102 patients (45%).
 Prior surgical resection (resulting in subtotal removal) had been performed in 36 patients (16%).
 In 47 selected patients (21%), embolization procedures were performed in an attempt to reduce the AVM size prior to radiosurgery.
 The lesions were classified according to the Spetzler grading system: 64 (28%) were Grade VI (inoperable), 22 (10%) were Grade IV, 90 (40%) were Grade III, 43 (19%) were Grade II, and eight (4%) were Grade I.
 With the aid of computer imaging-integrated isodose plans for single-treatment irradiation, total coverage of the AVM nidus was possible in 216 patients (95%).
 The location and volume of the AVM were the most important factors for the selection of radiation dose.
 Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging was performed at 6-month intervals in 161 patients.
 Seventeen patients who had MR evidence of complete obliteration underwent angiography within 3 months of imaging: in 14 (82%) complete obliteration was confirmation being 4 months (mean 17 months) after radiosurgery.
 The 2-year obliteration rates according to volume were: all eight (100%) AVM's less than 1 cu cm; 22 (85%) of 26 AVM's of 1 to 4 cu cm; and seven (58%) of 12 AVM's greater than 4 cu cm.
 Magnetic resonance imaging revealed postirradiation changes in 38 (24%) of 161 patients at a mean interval of 10.2 months after radiosurgery; only 10 (26%) of those 38 patients were symptomatic.
 In the entire series, two patients developed permanent new neurological deficits believed to be treatment-related.
 Two patients died of repeat hemorrhage at 6 and 23 months after treatment during the latency interval prior to obliteration.
 Stereotactic radiosurgery is an important method to obliterate AVM's, especially those previously considered inoperable.
 Success and complication risks are related to the AVM location and the volume treated.
