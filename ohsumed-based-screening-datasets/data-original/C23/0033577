The assessment of visuo-spatial neglect after acute stroke.
 Forty four consecutive patients with acute hemispheric stroke and forty seven elderly controls with no neurological disease were assessed for visuo-spatial neglect, using a modified neglect test battery.
 Neglect was found to be equally common in patients with right hemisphere and left hemisphere stroke three days after stroke (72% versus 62%).
 It was more severe in those with a right hemisphere stroke and resolved more frequently in those with a left hemisphere stroke.
 The battery was validated against an occupational therapist's assessment of neglect on self-care tasks.
 The inter-observer reliability was good and it was possible to monitor changes over time with the battery.
