Maxillofacial considerations in orthotopic liver transplantation.
 Orthotopic liver transplantation is now a widely used treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease.
 Lifelong pharmacologic immunosuppression renders these patients susceptible to many infections.
 The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for treating the patient with end-stage liver disease, both before and after transplantation.
 In addition, we shall discuss some of the medical implications associated with end-stage liver disease and their clinical presentations and appropriate presurgical management.
 Adverse side effects of long-term immunosuppression and their effect on the oral and maxillofacial region shall also be discussed.
 Last, a brief discussion of FK506, the latest immunosuppressant, will be presented together with the implications of its use on our surgical treatment of these patients.
