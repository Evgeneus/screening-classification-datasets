Tuberculous psoas muscle abscess following chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 A 34-year-old man with human immunodeficiency virus infection and disseminated Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium intracellulare infection developed a right psoas muscle abscess due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
 The abscess occurred 18 months after completion of a 12-month course of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid that was given because of a positive reaction with purified protein derivative of tuberculin.
 The adjacent vertebrae did not appear to be involved.
 The abscess was drained with a percutaneously inserted catheter, and he received standard antituberculous chemotherapy.
 Three weeks into therapy, a second drainage with a catheter was required.
 The isolation of two mycobacteria in this patient and the apparent failure of chemoprophylaxis with isoniazid are noted.
