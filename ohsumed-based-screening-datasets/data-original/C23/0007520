Pathogenesis and treatment of intra-abdominal infection.
 Intra-abdominal infection is considered potentially life-threatening.
 Such infection is frequently secondary to perforated viscera, trauma or inflammatory disease.
 Simple abscesses may be drained percutaneously with roentgenologic guidance; complex abscesses often require open surgical drainage.
 Secondary peritonitis is usually polymicrobial; broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy effective against aerobic and anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, as well as gram-positive organisms, is essential.
 Newer antibiotics, administered either singly or in combination, have been used successfully to treat intra-abdominal infection while avoiding the toxicity of aminoglycosides.
