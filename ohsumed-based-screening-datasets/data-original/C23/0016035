Hair transplantation (a new method for recipient site suturing): the upper dermal running stitch.
 Recipient hair transplant plugs may heal into place with palpable, and unfortunately, visible borders.
 This appearance, called "cobblestoning," is reminiscent of the bumps in a cobblestone street.
 The author presents a new, rapid method of suturing transplanted plugs that greatly reduces cobblestoning, virtually eliminates traumatic plug loss, and facilitates row-by-row hair transplantation.
 Additionally, postoperative bandaging is not necessary, shower cleansing may commence within hours, and postoperative activity may be unlimited.
