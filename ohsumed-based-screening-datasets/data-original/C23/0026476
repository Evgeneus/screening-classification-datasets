Misdiagnosed papillary renal adenocarcinoma.
 We present 3 patients with papillary renal adenocarcinoma who were initially misdiagnosed owing to unusual clinical presentation.
 We suggest that if these presentations are borne in mind, pre-operative detection of this uncommon condition should be possible more often than is now the case.
