Preperitoneal herniorrhaphy for the acutely incarcerated groin hernia.
 Elective preperitoneal or posterior repair for recurrent groin hernias and primary femoral hernias has been shown to be a technically advantageous approach.
 In addition to the ease of inguinal floor and femoral canal assessment, scar tissue from prior anterior herniorrhaphy can be avoided.
 The emergency management of the acutely incarcerated or strangulated hernia of the groin using this approach has not been addressed.
 During a 30-month period, all patients with a diagnosis of acute incarceration of a groin hernia (n = 28) were surgically managed using either the anterior approach (AA) (n = 14) or the preperitoneal approach (PA) (n = 14).
 Two patients with strangulated intestine in the AA group required an additional midline incision for bowel evaluation and resection.
 Intestinal evaluation was easily accomplished through the same incision in four patients in the PA group.
 The preperitoneal approach also allowed proximal control of incarcerated or strangulated viscera, thus avoiding excessive manipulation of gangrenous or necrotic intestine, potential spillage of infected contents into the peritoneal cavity, and entry of bacteria, toxins, potassium, and the metabolic waste products of anaerobic metabolism into the systemic circulation during hernia reduction.
 There have been no recurrences in either group, and minor complications, such as wound infection and cellulitis, in the two groups are not statistically different.
