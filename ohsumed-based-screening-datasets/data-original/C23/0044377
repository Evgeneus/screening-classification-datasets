Cerebral haemorrhage in a French prospective population study.
 The incidence of cerebral haemorrhage was studied from a population-based stroke registry.
 The incidence was 12.3 per 100,000 per year in women and 13.9 per 100,000 per year in men, with a peak in the eighth decade and a male preponderance.
 Haemorrhages were deep seated and mostly due to hypertension.
 Recognised clinical characteristics of haemorrhage are acute onset, convulsion, vomiting, and disturbed consciousness.
 This study showed that cerebral haemorrhage may present with pure motor deficit or transient deficit preceding the stroke.
 The mortality was 51% in the first month, and 61% by two years.
