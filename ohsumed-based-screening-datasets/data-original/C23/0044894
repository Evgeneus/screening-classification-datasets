Early postoperative sternal approximation after ITA harvesting: computed tomographic evaluation.
 Between November 1989 and February 1990, 66 randomized sternotomized patients underwent aortocoronary bypass and were subjected to a sternal scanner in the early postoperative period.
 Each examination included a manubrial and a sternal body print.
 At each level, we studied the occurrence of spacing or misalignment of the sternal layers.
 The 66 patients were subdivided into four groups according to the type of conduit harvested (single left internal thoracic artery or saphenous vein) and the type of material used for the sternal closure (steel wires or nylon yarns).
 In all cases, adequate early sternal approximation, which is represented by a good alignment as well as by an excellent contact of the sternal layers, was infrequently demonstrated.
 Moreover, the two abnormalities most often observed were manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment.
 The sternal closure technique and internal thoracic artery harvesting had no significant effect on the sternal approximation.
 To minimize manubrial spacing and sternal body misalignment, we propose that the surgeon should apply three threads through the manubrium, withdraw the shoulder roll beforehand, elevate both of the patient's shoulders, and maintain the two xyphoid layers in the same plane and in fairly close contact during the tightening of the wires.
