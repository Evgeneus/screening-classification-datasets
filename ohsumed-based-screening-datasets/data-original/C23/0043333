Use of the Souter-Strathclyde total elbow prosthesis in patients who have rheumatoid arthritis.
 Thirty-three patients had thirty-four consecutive primary arthroplasties, with use of the Souter-Strathclyde cemented unconstrained prosthesis, for severe rheumatoid arthritis of the elbow.
 The minimum duration of follow-up for inclusion in the study was two years.
 Three patients died.
 Four arthroplasties were revised: three, because of irreducible dislocation immediately after the operation and one, because of loosening without infection.
 One prosthesis was removed because of a late deep infection.
 In most of the remaining twenty-five patients (twenty-six arthroplasties), who had an average duration of follow-up of four years (range, two to eight years), pain was markedly less or had resolved completely, and the function of the elbow was greatly improved.
