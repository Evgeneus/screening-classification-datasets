Complications of the Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion: case report of late development of malignancy.
 We report on 3 patients with bladder exstrophy followed for more than 15 years after having undergone Heitz-Boyer urinary diversion.
 One patient had adenocarcinoma at the ureterocolonic anastomoses 16 years after diversion.
 To our knowledge this is the first reported case of a malignancy developing after a Heitz-Boyer procedure.
 The other 2 patients had significant problems with urinary incontinence and recurrent urinary tract infections.
 Initial success with this form of urinary diversion can be followed by significant long-term complications.
