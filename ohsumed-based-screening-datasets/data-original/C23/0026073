Experience with the first 250 endometrial resections for menorrhagia [published erratum appears in Lancet 1991 Jan 1;337(8753):1362] 
 234 patients with menorrhagia were treated hysteroscopically by transcervical resection of the endometrium (TCRE) instead of hysterectomy.
 250 procedures were performed under general anaesthesia (63%) or under sedation plus local anaesthesia (38%).
 The endometrium was excised either totally (91%) or partially (9%) in all but one case, and 56 (22%) of the patients underwent simultaneous resection of submucous fibroids.
 Surgical time (range 10-100 min) varied with the gynaecologist's experience.
 479 ml was the average volume of uterine irrigant absorbed by the patient.
 Blood loss was usually slight.
 Operative complications were uncommon, but 4 (2%) women sustained a uterine perforation (without serious sequelae), 7 (3%) absorbed more than 2 litres of fluid, and 1 required tamponade to control postoperative bleeding.
 Hospital stay was short and full recovery usual by 1-2 weeks.
 Menstrual symptoms improved in over 90% of the patients throughout the follow-up of up to 2 1/2 years; 27-42% of the women became amenorrhoeic at some time after total TCRE.
 Results were best in women greater than 35 years of age, but was not influenced by the presence of fibroids or pretreatment dysmenorrhoea.
 10 (4%) women later underwent hysterectomy.
 Hysteroscopy 3 and 12 months after surgery revealed a small, fibrotic uterine cavity in the majority.
