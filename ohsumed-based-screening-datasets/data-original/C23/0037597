Measurement of sound.
 The measurement of sound involves the analysis of frequency, intensity, and temporal dimensions of acoustic signals.
 Each dimension of sound can be related directly to clinically observed phenomena.
 Frequency information, measured in Hz, can be extracted from pure-tone and complex stimuli.
 Intensity represents the physical energy of a signal and is described by using the decibel scale--a logarithmic scale of ratios.
 Temporal characteristics of sound include duration, phase, and repetition rate.
 In the analysis of human hearing sensitivity, the middle ear system and its impedance characteristics also must be considered.
 In this article, we have reviewed some major principles of sound and have presented a series of practical clinical applications.
 Such principles as these help to predict and explain frequency of laryngeal tones, middle ear mechanics, ear canal resonance, real-ear measurements of hearing aids, the Articulation Index, hearing loss, understanding of speech in quiet and in noise, and the relation between hearing and speech.
