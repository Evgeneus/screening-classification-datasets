Exacerbation of bacterial toxicity to infant ferrets by influenza virus: possible role in sudden infant death syndrome [published erratum appears in J Infect Dis 1991 Jul;164(1):232]
 Of several toxins examined, only staphylococcal alpha and gamma toxin, endotoxin, and diphtheria toxins were lethal for 5-day-old ferrets.
 Their toxicities were enhanced in animals infected at 1 day old with influenza virus, from 3-fold with staphylococcal gamma toxin through 14-fold for staphylococcal alpha toxin, 84-fold for endotoxin, and 219-fold for diphtheria toxin.
 No increased viral replication occurred in any tissue; thus the effects of the toxins were exacerbated by the infection, not vice versa.
 Neonates died suddenly without clinical symptoms as in human babies dying from the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
 Pathologic examination showed inflammation in the upper respiratory tract, lung edema and collapse, and early bronchopneumonia in the toxin- and influenza virus-treated animals but not in those treated with toxin or virus alone.
 Thus, bacterial toxins could play a role in SIDS, this being more likely with a concomitant influenza virus infection.
