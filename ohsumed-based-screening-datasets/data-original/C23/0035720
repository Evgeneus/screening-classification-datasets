Malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites: transjugular insertion of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis.
 Although the transjugular approach has long been used to provide safe access to the liver, it has not been used for placement of stents in biliary obstruction.
 The recent development of an expandable metallic endoprosthesis now makes this method more feasible.
 The case of a patient with malignant biliary obstruction complicated by ascites is presented herein.
 Palliation was achieved with an expandable biliary endoprosthesis placed by the transjugular-hepatic vein approach.
