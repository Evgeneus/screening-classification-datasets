Effects of aerobic exercise training on symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse.
 The effects of a 12-week aerobic exercise training protocol on 32 symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse were studied.
 Subjects were randomly assigned to control or exercise groups.
 Exercise subjects completed a 12-week (3 times per week) exercise training program based on guidelines established by the American Heart Association for phase II cardiac rehabilitation programs; control group subjects maintained normal activities.
 Before and after training, subjects underwent maximal multistage treadmill testing, and measurements were obtained for plasma catecholamine levels at rest and during peak exercise; they completed the State Trait Anxiety Inventory and General Well-Being Schedule.
 Weekly symptom frequency of chest pain, arm pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, mood swings, dizziness and syncope were monitored for the 12-week period.
 Data were analyzed using multivariate analysis of variance, multivariate analysis of covariance, and analysis of covariance with repeated measures.
 Compared with control subjects, the exercise group showed a significant (p less than 0.05) decrease in State Trait Anxiety Inventory scores, an increase in General Well-Being scores, an increase in functional capacity and a decline in the frequency of chest pain, fatigue, dizziness and mood swings.
 No statistically significant differences were noted in catecholamine levels at rest or during peak exercise.
 These findings support the use of aerobic exercise in the management of symptomatic women with mitral valve prolapse.
