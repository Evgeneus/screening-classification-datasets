Continuing care for cancer pain relief with oral morphine solution. One-year experience in a regional cancer center.
 This report is a prospective study of 223 patients with intractable cancer pain who were offered continuing care during the year 1988 at the Pain Relief Unit, Kidwai Memorial Institute of Oncology, Bangalore, India, with a minimum follow-up of 4 months and a maximum follow-up of 16 months.
 A high percentage of pain relief was attained within a mean duration of 4 days, which on follow-up was maintained at a steady level in most patients (91.1%).
 Oral morphine could not be continued in three patients because of vomiting.
 The main side effects noticed were nausea and vomiting, itching, and constipation.
 At any time during the first 140 days, only 30% of patients had side effects and appropriate medication successfully managed these side effects.
 During the rest of the study period, the side effects were minimal.
 Oral morphine used with proper adjuncts offers the best pain palliation in most patients, with minimal side effects.
