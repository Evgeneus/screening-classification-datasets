Diagnostic imaging in puerperal febrile morbidity.
 This retrospective study was conducted to assess the value of imaging in patients with refractory puerperal febrile morbidity.
 During a 36-month period, 31 patients were referred for ultrasound and/or computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging because of postpartum fever unresponsive to broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy of at least 72 hours' duration.
 Hematomas were identified in 11 women.
 Abscesses were diagnosed in seven patients, ovarian venous thrombosis in two, vesicouterine fistula in one, small-bowel obstruction in one, and a subcutaneous seroma in one.
 Twenty-one women had endomyometritis, 13 of whom also had other extrauterine abnormalities (abscess in six, hematoma in four, and ovarian venous thrombosis, vesicouterine fistula, and small-bowel obstruction in one each).
 Retained placental tissue was found in two women with endomyometritis.
 Only two subjects had negative imaging studies.
 In most patients, imaging led to definitive diagnosis and specific therapeutic measures resulting in resolution of the febrile morbidity.
 Our experience suggests that these imaging techniques may be helpful in evaluating puerperal fever.
