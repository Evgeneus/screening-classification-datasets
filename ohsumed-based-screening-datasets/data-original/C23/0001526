Surgical therapy of the eyelids in patients with facial paralysis.
 Patients with facial paralysis have a degree of lagophthalmos and paralytic ectropion.
 We present our experience in the surgical management of 25 consecutive patients treated for these problems.
 Paralytic lagophthalmos was corrected using gold weights inserted into the upper eyelid.
 The advantages and disadvantages of this surgical technique are reviewed.
 Medial canthoplasty and lateral canthoplasty were performed to rectify paralytic ectropion.
 Ancillary procedures included browpexy, upper-lid blepharoplasty, and temporalis sling.
 The results were excellent in 23 of 25 patients and good in the remaining two.
 After a minimum of 6 months' follow-up, there were no complications.
 The authors believe that the above procedures will yield consistently excellent cosmetic and functional results in patients with paralysis of the eyelids.
