Comparison of muscle sympathetic responses to hemorrhage and lower body negative pressure in humans.
 We compared changes in muscle sympathetic nerve activity (SNA) during graded lower body negative pressure (LBNP) and 450 ml of hemorrhage in nine healthy volunteers.
 During LBNP, central venous pressure (CVP) decreased from 6.1 +/- 0.4 to 4.5 +/- 0.5 (LBNP -5 mmHg), 3.4 +/- 0.6 (LBNP -10 mmHg), and 2.3 +/- 0.6 mmHg (LBNP -15 mmHg), and there were progressive increases in SNA at each level of LBNP.
 The slope relating percent change in SNA to change in CVP during LBNP (mean +/- SE) was 27 +/- 11%/mmHg.
 Hemorrhage of 450 ml at a mean rate of 71 +/- 5 ml/min decreased CVP from 6.1 +/- 0.5 to 3.7 +/- 0.5 mmHg and increased SNA by 47 +/- 11%.
 The increase in SNA during hemorrhage was not significantly different from the increase in SNA predicted by the slope relating percent change in SNA to change in CVP during LBNP.
 These data show that nonhypotensive hemorrhage causes sympathoexcitation and that sympathetic responses to LBNP and nonhypotensive hemorrhage are similar in humans.
