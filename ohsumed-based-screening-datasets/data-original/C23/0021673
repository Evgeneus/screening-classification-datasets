Prediction of cognitive change as a function of preoperative ability status among temporal lobectomy patients seen at 6-month follow-up.
 The relationship between preoperative ability levels and postoperative changes in cognitive function was examined among 23 left (LTL) and 19 right (RTL) temporal lobectomy patients using a battery of memory, language, and visuospatial tasks administered approximately 3 months before surgery and at 6 months follow-up.
 Higher preoperative performances on the memory and language measures were associated with larger decrements in postsurgical scores among the LTL patients.
 The RTL group showed no consistent relationship between preoperative ability levels and subsequent postsurgical cognitive changes.
 Based on the present data, we constructed base-rate tables for the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised indicating the likelihood of measurable gains or losses in memory as a function of presurgical ability level for patients undergoing LTL.
 While tentative, these data provide a useful and practical guide for counseling prospective epilepsy patients of the attendant cognitive risks of LTL.
