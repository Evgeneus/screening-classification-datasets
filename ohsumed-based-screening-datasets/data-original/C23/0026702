Simultaneous potentiation and fatigue in quadriceps after a 60-second maximal voluntary isometric contraction.
 Potential mechanisms of fatigue (metabolic factors) and potentiation (phosphate incorporation by myosin phosphorylatable light chains) were investigated during recovery from a 60-s maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) in the quadriceps muscle of 12 subjects.
 On separate days before and for 2 h after the 60-s MVC, either a 1-s MVC or electrically stimulated contractions were used as indexes to test muscle performance.
 Torque at the end of the 60-s MVC was 57% of the initial level, whereas torques from a 1-s MVC and 50-Hz stimulation were most depressed in the immediate recovery period.
 At this time, muscle biopsy analyses revealed significant decreases in ATP and phosphocreatine and a 19-fold increase in muscle lactate.
 Conversely, isometric twitch torque and torque from a 10-Hz stimulus were the least depressed of six contractile indexes and demonstrated potentiation of 25 and 34%, respectively, by 4 min of recovery (P less than 0.05).
 At this time, muscle lactate concentration was still 16 times greater than at rest.
 An increased phosphate content of the myosin phosphorylatable light chains (P less than 0.05) was also evident both immediately and 4 min after the 60-s MVC.
 We conclude that the 60-s MVC produced marked force decreases likely due to metabolic displacement, while the limited decline in the twitch and 10-Hz torques and their significant potentiation suggested that myosin phosphorylation may provide a mechanism to enhance contractile force under conditions of submaximal activation during fatigue.
