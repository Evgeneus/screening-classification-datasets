Extended duration of herpes simplex virus DNA in genital lesions detected by the polymerase chain reaction.
 To evaluate the utility of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for documenting herpes simplex virus (HSV) in persons with reactivated genital lesions viral isolation was compared with a recently developed PCR method.
 Three women experiencing four episodes of recurrent genital herpes were followed for 10 days per episode with daily examination and duplicate swabs of the lesions, one for HSV culture and one for PCR.
 HSV type 2 was cultured from three of four episodes and the mean duration of viral isolation from recurrent genital lesions was 2.6 days.
 PCR detected HSV DNA from lesion swabs during all four episodes, and HSV DNA was positive for an average of 6.8 days.
 HSV DNA was demonstrated in ulcerative lesions on 15 of 17 days versus 3 of 17 days by viral isolation (P less than .01).
 HSV PCR became negative when the lesions reepithelialized.
 These data suggest that PCR is a more sensitive measure of HSV infection than routine viral culture and that PCR detects the presence of HSV at times when culture is negative.
