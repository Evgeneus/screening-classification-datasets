Possible role of leukotrienes in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori.
 This study was done to evaluate the role of leukotrienes (LTs) in gastritis associated with Campylobacter pylori.
 Biopsy specimens of gastric mucosa were obtained endoscopically from 18 patients with nonulcer dyspepsia for bacteriological and histological examination and extraction of LTs.
 There was correlation between the LTB4 level in the mucosa and the degree of gastritis evaluated histologically.
 The level was higher when infiltration of neutrophils in the gastric mucosa was more extensive.
 The LTB4 level in mucosa infected with C.
 pylori was higher than that in noninfected mucosa.
 These findings suggest that endogenous LTs may be related to the pathogenesis of gastritis associated with C.
 pylori.
