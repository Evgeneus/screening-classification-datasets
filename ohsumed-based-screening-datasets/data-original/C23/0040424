Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome: findings on chest radiographs in 18 patients.
 Findings on chest radiographs of 18 patients with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome were compared and correlated with peak eosinophil counts.
 Nine patients had normal chest radiographs.
 Of the nine patients with abnormal chest radiographs, three had fine, irregular linear opacities in the lungs (the opacities were most noticeable at the bases); three had similar irregular linear opacities and pleural effusions; and three had pleural effusions and confluent opacities.
 One patient demonstrated an enlarged heart; no pulmonary edema was seen in this patient or in any others.
 Although the mean recorded eosinophil cell counts were higher in those patients with abnormal chest radiographs (6,340 vs 5,454/mm3 [6.3 vs 5.4 x 10(9)/L]), the difference was not statistically significant.
