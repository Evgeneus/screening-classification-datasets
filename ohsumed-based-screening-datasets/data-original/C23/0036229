Failure of centralization of the fibula for congenital longitudinal deficiency of the tibia.
 Between 1962 and 1983, fourteen patients (twenty knees) had centralization of the fibula for congenital longitudinal deficiency: tibial, complete.
 Eleven of the twenty index procedures were performed on patients who were one year old or less.
 A progressive flexion deformity of the knee developed after all twenty index procedures.
 Twenty-six secondary procedures were needed, including disarticulation at the knee, posterior release, extension osteotomy, femorofibular arthrodesis, and biceps-to-quadriceps transfer, and one patient had a second attempt at centralization of the fibula.
 The duration of follow-up after the initial centralization of the fibula ranged from four years to twenty-two years and seven months (average, twelve years and four months).
 Seven patients (eight limbs) in whom the index procedure resulted in failure had a satisfactory result after disarticulation at the knee.
 The patients who did not have secondary disarticulation at the knee are also considered to have had a failed index procedure because they had a flexion deformity at the latest follow-up.
 Attempts to reconstruct the knee joint by centralization of the fibula are not warranted for patients who have congenital longitudinal deficiency: tibial, complete.
 Early disarticulation at the knee and fitting with a prosthesis, with close follow-up, is the treatment of choice.
