The biomechanical effects of deep tissue support as related to brow and facelift procedures.
 The adverse effects of increased tension across a healing wound are well known.
 However, the effect of closing a wound in layers in order to decrease tension on the epidermis has been a source of controversy.
 It is hypothesized that deep tissue support decreases skin tension upon wound closure.
 In order to clarify this issue, a two-part study was designed to address the immediate effects of deep tissue support in vitro using fresh-frozen cadavers and in vivo on patients undergoing scheduled surgery.
 Closing skin tension was measured at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed with and without galeal closure and superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) procedures, respectively.
 Deep tissue support was found to significantly (p less than 0.05) decrease skin tension at the time of skin closure at standard reference points in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures performed on fresh-frozen cadavers.
 Similar significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in closing skin tension also were found in vivo in patients undergoing similar surgical procedures.
 Stress relaxation was not found to play a significant role in contributing to this immediate decrease in closing skin tension.
 It would appear, therefore, that deep tissue support, in the form of galeal closure and an SMAS procedure in coronal brow lift and rhytidectomy procedures, respectively, provides increased viscoelastic support, producing immediate significant decreases in closing skin tension in these procedures.
 The beneficial effects on wound healing, scar formation, tension-related trophic skin changes, and possible improved long-term results are discussed.
