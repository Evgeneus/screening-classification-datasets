Does age affect outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation? 
 We examined the relation between age and outcomes in patients treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Seattle, Wash.
 Considering all out-of-hospital cardiac arrests treated by paramedics over a recent 5-year period, 386 (27%) of 1405 consecutive patients aged 70 years or older were resuscitated and admitted to a hospital vs 474 (29%) of 1624 younger patients; 140 elderly patients (10%) were discharged alive vs 223 younger patients (14%).
 Of the 140 elderly patients, 112 went home and 28 went to a nursing home.
 Considering only patients whose initial rhythms were ventricular fibrillation, the percent of patients discharged alive was substantially higher: 120 (24%) of 493 for elderly patients and 194 (30%) of 639 for younger patients.
 Elderly patients can benefit from attempted resuscitation from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
