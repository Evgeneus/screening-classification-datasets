Repetitive intraoperative mapping and cryotherapy improve the results of endocardial resection for ventricular tachycardia.
 Patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia or a history of a sudden cardiac death episode and ventricular tachycardia inducible in the electrophysiology laboratory have a high incidence of recurrence and a high mortality despite medical therapy.
 Map-guided endocardial resection has improved treatment results, but is associated with a 10-30% failure rate.
 In our initial experience with endocardial resection (Group I) we incurred a 30% treatment failure rate.
 In the present study we have found the addition of sequential intraoperative mapping and routine use of cryotherapy (Group II) improved our results of ventricular tachycardia control without significant additional morbidity or mortality.
