Human atherosclerotic coronary artery xenografts: a model for investigation of transluminal recanalization.
 A model for testing transluminal recanalization techniques was developed.
 Fragments of human atherosclerotic coronary arteries were transplanted into carotid arteries of dogs and evaluated by angiographic, angioscopic, and histologic study within a three-month period.
 An inflammatory response was most intense within the first week.
 By two weeks no inflammation was noted.
 Total occlusion (n = 13) and stenosis (n = 11) of the carotid arteries were achieved without complications.
 The model is easy to produce within a short period and the arterial occlusion resembles human vascular disease.
 This model has been used to evaluate laser recanalization of vascular obstructions.
