A successful treatment of an intrarenal arteriovenous fistula by percutaneous embolization.
 A 37-year-old woman patient, known to have poorly controlled arterial hypertension that was diagnosed following a cerebrovascular accident at the age of 15 years, was referred to our outpatient clinic for investigation in 1987.
 An intrarenal arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by selective renal angiography.
 Embolization of the fistula was performed using four 15-mm/5-cm coils, which induced thrombosis and obstructed the fistula.
 The vascularization of the affected kidney improved immediately.
 During the following 4 months, the antihypertensive treatment was stopped gradually, and the patient remained normotensive.
 This is an unusual case of a large intrarenal arteriovenous fistula, whose etiology was not clear, that was successfully treated by percutaneous embolization.
