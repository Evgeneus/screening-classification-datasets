CO2 laser for suppurative hidradenitis of the vulva.
 Chronic suppurative hidradenitis is a disease of the apocrine glands occurring predominantly in the axillae of the anogenital region.
 Treatment, to date, has been frustrating.
 Prolonged antibiotic therapy and multiple incisions and drainage have been the usual form of therapy, but those surgical procedures leave patients with ugly scars; retracted, hypertrophic skin edges; and pitted, indurated and disfiguring abscesses.
 The only successful treatment to date has been wide excision of the entire apocrine gland-bearing tissues, such as radical vulvectomy, which often necessitates grafts to cover the surgically exposed areas.
 That has left patients with unsatisfactorily functioning vaginas and a mutilated appearance.
 Recently we instituted the use of the CO2 laser to treat these patients with the goal of eradicating the suppurative sinus tracts and the infected apocrine glands without removing large volumes of adjacent, unaffected tissue.
 Over the past eight years we treated 11 patients who had extensive, chronic hidradenitis of the anogenital area with the CO2 laser.
 The use of laser therapy for these patients has produced effective and less-mutilating results.
 Such treatment has been a successful option for treating this debilitating disease.
