Deletion of chromosome 4: 46,XY, del(4) (q31.3) after gamete intrafallopian transfer and in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer.
 It seems that assisted reproduction technology does not increase the rate of chromosome abnormalities, and up to now, a few cases have been reported.
 The case we describe here is the first one of monosomy 4q31 in a full-term liveborn after a combined GIFT-IVF procedure.
 Once more, this case raises the question of whether pregnancies resulting from IVF should be monitored for chromosome abnormalities or not.
