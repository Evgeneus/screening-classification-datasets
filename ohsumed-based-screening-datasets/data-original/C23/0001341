Urinary tract infection in women. Current role of single-dose therapy.
 Administration of a single dose of an antimicrobial agent is acceptable therapy for women with uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections.
 There is adequate information in the literature to support the clinical use of single-dose therapy, although there is still a need for further, well-designed, sufficiently large studies that compare single-dose therapy to abbreviated-course (3-day) and traditional (7- to 14-day) therapy.
