Depression and chronic fatigue in the patient with chronic pain.
 Chronic benign pain is commonly associated with chronic fatigue and depression.
 Depression and chronic fatigue syndrome are also associated with each other and often include pain.
 Psychologic factors are prominent in these conditions, and they may share neurobiologic factors as well.
 Management requires separately addressing each component of patients' distress and usually includes physical rehabilitation, education, administration of nonhabituating medications and often counseling.
 Depression may be a favorable prognostic sign, as it suggests a treatable condition and provides incentive for recovery.
