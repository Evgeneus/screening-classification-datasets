Investigation of early surface delamination observed in retrieved heat-pressed tibial inserts.
 The objective was to examine possible reasons for delamination observed in tibial inserts of the porous-coated anatomic (PCA) knee replacement.
 To date, 33 PCA inserts have been forwarded to the authors' labs.
 Of these 33, 52% showed severe delamination within four years of implantation.
 Visual, structural, and mechanical analyses were conducted and data compared on the heat-pressed PCA type and the common machined inserts.
 Twenty inserts of the two different types were examined.
 Visual data using polarized light microscopy showed the presence of a surface layer separated from the middle region of the heat-pressed inserts by a line of demarcation 250-580 microns beneath the articulating surface.
 This anomaly was not observed in machined inserts.
 Structural analysis showed the new heat-pressed inserts had increased crystallinity in the surface layer when compared to new machined inserts.
 The retrieved heat-pressed inserts showed increased crystallinity in the surface and middle regions.
 There was a slight increase in surface crystallinity in the retrieved machined inserts.
 Microhardness data showed that there was an increased hardness associated with the crystallinity seen on the heat-pressed inserts.
 Orthopedic surgeons should be aware of early delamination and surface failure in heat-pressed inserts.
