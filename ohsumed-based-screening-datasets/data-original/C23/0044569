Experimental treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion.
 The role of laser energy in the treatment of thrombotic vascular occlusion was evaluated in two sets of experiments.
 First, 10 polytetrafluoroethylene grafts were used to replace segments of the superficial femoral arteries in dogs and were thrombosed by distal ligation.
 Occlusion was maintained for one hour, or for 7, 14, 21, and 28 days in each of two grafts.
 Patency was restored in all 10 grafts without perforation or anastomotic disruption using a 2 mm hot tip probe powered by an Argon laser.
 However, increased organization of thrombus related to the duration of occlusion lead to decreased laser channel diameters, and 75% of the 28 day thrombus remained in the graft after recanalization.
 The second experiments tested the added benefit of thrombolytic infusion following laser recanalization.
 Bilateral external iliac artery thrombosis was induced in dogs by operative vessel isolation, de-endothelialization, and thrombin injection.
 At 7 days the efficacy of laser-assisted thrombolysis (LAT) versus enzymatic thrombolysis (ET) alone was compared.
 Eight vessels underwent ET by urokinase (4000 I.U./min.); 14 vessels were laser recanalized prior to thrombolytic infusion.
 LAT was performed from a carotid artery approach in 8 vessels (antegrade) and from a femoral artery in 6 vessels (retrograde).
 In contrast to studies using the hot tip alone, both ET and LAT accomplished complete thrombus removal.
 However, LAT lead to significant iliac arterial flow in 9 +/- 8 min.
 (antegrade) and 25 +/- 8 min.
 (retrograde) while ET required 109 +/- 47 min (p less than 0.01).
