Pediatric HIV disease. The newest chronic illness of childhood.
 HIV disease has emerged as a major chronic illness of childhood.
 Children with HIV infection and children with other chronic health impairments have much in common, including the need for comprehensive, multidisciplinary, coordinated care that includes special attention to the psychosocial effects on the child and family.
 However, because the mother and often the father and siblings share this lethal viral infection, the impact of HIV disease upon the family surpasses that of virtually all other chronic conditions.
 This is compounded by the association of the disease with drug use, its preponderance among the most disenfranchised populations in the United States, and the persistent public fear and discrimination surrounding AIDS.
 We have made substantial progress already in the medical management of this infection, and while we await the development of more effective therapies, we already have the tools and knowledge in hand to help these families.
