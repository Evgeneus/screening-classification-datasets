Intraovarian abscess treated with laparoscopic aspiration and povidone-iodine lavage. A case report.
 Intraovarian abscess is an unusual form of pelvic inflammatory disease usually managed with laparotomy.
 A patient with prolonged morbidity from an intraovarian abscess following pelvic inflammatory disease associated with an intrauterine contraceptive device was managed with laparoscopically guided needle aspiration of the abscess and povidone-iodine lavage.
 Laparoscopy should play a greater role in the management of pelvic inflammatory disease.
