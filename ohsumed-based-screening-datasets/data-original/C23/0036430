N-myc genomic content and DNA ploidy in stage IVS neuroblastoma.
 DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content were analyzed in a series of stage IVS neuroblastomas by flow cytometry and Southern blot hybridization, respectively.
 Of the 12 stage IVS neuroblastomas studied, nine were aneuploid (DNA index [DI] greater than 1), two were diploid (DI = 1), and one was not assessable for DNA content due to insufficient tumor material.
 N-myc gene amplification was present in two of 12 tumors.
 None of the aneuploid tumors exhibited N-myc amplification.
 Among the aneuploid neuroblastomas, the DIs were between 1.27 and 1.60, ie, in the near-triploid range.
 The follow-up from diagnosis ranged from 1 to 41 months (mean, 20 months).
 The nine neuroblastomas with near-triploid DNA content were free of disease at the end of the follow-up period.
 In contrast, a rapid and fatal tumor progression was observed for the three neuroblastomas with N-myc amplification and/or diploidy.
 Although involving only a limited series, these results strongly suggest that the combined analysis of DNA ploidy and N-myc genomic content could predict clinical outcome in stage IVS neuroblastoma and should help to identify patients for whom a more aggressive therapy is required.
