Coronary restenosis: what have we learned from angiography?
 Coronary restenosis remains a major problem for interventional cardiology not only by virtue of its frequency, but also because of the current inability to prevent it.
 Symptomatic status and non-invasive evaluation have been used to study restenosis, but both lack specificity and sensitivity, particularly in patients with multivessel disease.
 Angiography remains the reference standard.
 Several arbitrary definitions have been used, some related to visual estimates of coronary stenosis and others to quantitative angiographic techniques.
 In another approach, linear modeling is used to assess minimal luminal diameter of lesions on restudy.
 Although angiographic studies have been essential in the study of restenosis, questions concerning the underlying mechanism and pathophysiology remain.
 The development of animal models that closely resemble human restenosis should allow evaluation of pathophysiologic mechanisms and development of new strategies to prevent the problem.
