Management of radionecrosis of the vulva and distal vagina.
 Twelve patients were seen between January 1983 and June 1989 with the clinical diagnosis of radionecrosis of the vulva or distal vagina.
 Seven patients received radiation for vulvar cancer, three for distal vaginal cancer, and two for recurrent endometrial cancer.
 No patient healed spontaneously and the mean delay in surgical therapy was 8.5 months.
 The radionecrotic site was treated with local therapy, radical local excision (with or without colostomy), or exenteration.
 The operative defect was closed primarily in three patients and covered with local flaps or myocutaneous flaps in seven patients.
 The two patients with local care still have radionecrotic ulcers.
 One of three patients who were closed primarily continues to have an ulcer.
 All other patients have healed satisfactorily except one who died after two attempts to correct the problem.
 Radionecrosis of the vulva and distal vagina should generally be treated surgically.
