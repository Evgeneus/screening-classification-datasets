Single center experience of the effect of delayed function on outcome in retransplant recipients of cadaveric renal allografts.
 The incidence of DRF in the regraft study group was most commonly seen in patients with a historic high level of HLA sensitization.
 Primary NF was an immune mediated event seen in 63% of third regrafts.
 Delayed use of CyA with ALG induction coverage provides good graft survival with either double or triple maintenance therapy.
 Stricter patient selection for third transplants and aggressive clinical monitoring of the regrafted patient has provided a 1-year actuarial graft survival result of 88% at our transplant center.
