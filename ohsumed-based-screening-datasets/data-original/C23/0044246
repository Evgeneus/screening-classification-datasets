Total hip replacement for juvenile chronic arthritis.
 We review the results of 96 primary total hip replacements in 54 patients with juvenile chronic arthritis at five years or longer after surgery.
 The mean age at operation was 16.7 years (range 11.25 to 26.6); the follow-up period averaged 11.5 years.
 The clinical results in terms of pain, range of movement, mobility and function are presented.
 A revision procedure was required in 24 hips (25%) in 18 patients at an average of 9.5 years after the primary operation.
 A further 17 hips had radiographic signs of loosening.
 The factors thought to contribute to this relatively high failure rate in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis are discussed.
