Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy in the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia.
 A group of 54 patients with acute or chronic limb ischaemia were initially treated with low dose intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy using streptokinase (10,000 units h-1) or plasminogen activator (0.5 mg h-1).
 Complete thrombolysis was obtained in 90 per cent of patients with symptoms of less than 1 week duration, and in 50 per cent with symptoms of greater than 1 week (P less than 0.05).
 Successful lysis in 36 patients was followed by successful bypass surgery in seven, percutaneous angioplasty in 13, no further treatment in 13, repeat thrombolysis in two and amputation in one.
 Failed therapy was associated with major amputation in 40 per cent.
 One patient died of haemorrhage and another of stroke as a direct result of thrombolytic treatment.
 The most common complication was haematoma at the site of cannulation of the vessel.
 Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy can be very useful for the management of acute and chronic limb ischaemia, but complications do occur and patients should be carefully selected.
