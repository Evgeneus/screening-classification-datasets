Annular atrophic lichen planus.
 We describe a case of generalized, asymptomatic, chronic annular lichen planus.
 The centers of the large annular lesions were atrophic and had lost their elasticity.
 Histologic examination revealed an absence of elastic fiber in the center.
 Electron microscopy revealed fragmented elastic fibers.
 Examination of early lesions showed that elastolysis had already begun in the heavy cellular infiltration.
 We conclude that the annular configuration resulted from the elastolytic activity of the inflammatory cells with the formation of foci of localized acquired cutis laxa.
