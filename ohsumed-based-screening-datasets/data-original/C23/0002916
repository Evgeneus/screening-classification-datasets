Perforated duodenal ulcer: an unusual complication of gastroenteritis.
 A 7 year old boy was admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis, which was complicated by an acute perforated duodenal ulcer.
 After oversewing of the perforation he made an uncomplicated recovery.
 Peptic ulceration is under-diagnosed in childhood and this leads to delay in diagnosis and appropriate management.
 Ulceration is associated with severe illness and viral infections, but perforation is rare.
