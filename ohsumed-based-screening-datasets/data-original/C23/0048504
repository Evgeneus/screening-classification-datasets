In vitro perfused-superfused cat carotid body for physiological and pharmacological studies.
 An in vitro perfused carotid body preparation was developed to study its chemosensory responses to physiological and pharmacological stimuli.
 The carotid bifurcation with the carotid body was vascularly isolated and excised from pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized cats.
 The CB was perfused in a chamber by gravity (80 Torr) with modified Tyrode's solution (N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid-NaOH at pH 7.40) equilibrated at a given Po2 and superfused with the same medium at (Po2 of 20 Torr).
 The temperature was maintained at 35.5 +/- 0.5 degrees C.
 The frequency of chemosensory discharges (CD) was recorded from the whole carotid sinus nerve (n = 24), and the responses were tested by repeated interruptions of perfusate flow (SF), perfusion with hypoxic medium, and injections of nicotine and cyanide (0.1 nmol to 1 mumol) and hypercapnic medium.
 During hyperoxic perfusion, SF resulted in a sigmoidal increase in CD, reaching a maximum that was 23.6 +/- 4.4-fold greater than the basal activity.
 Restoration of flow returned CD promptly to basal values.
 After normoxic perfusion, SF led to a similar maximal activity more rapidly, but the duration was shorter.
 Reduction of the perfusate PO2 (Po2 from 450 Torr to 150, 30, and less than 10 Torr) caused a nonlinear increase in CD.
 CO2 stimuli (PCo2 38-110 Torr) resulted in a linear increase in CD.
 Nicotine or cyanide increased CD in a dose-dependent manner.
 The preparation retained its initial responsiveness for 2-3 h, making extensive experimental studies feasible.
