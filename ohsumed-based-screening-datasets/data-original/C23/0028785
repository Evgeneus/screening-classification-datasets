One-stage hypospadias repair: experience of 367 cases.
 Over a 6 1/2-year period we performed 374 primary hypospadias repairs, all but 7 as single-stage procedures.
 We usually employed the MAGPI, tubed preputial island flap and Mathieu reconstructions.
 Complications were comparatively few, with an overall incidence of 5% fistulae, 3% anastomotic strictures and 7% meatal retraction or stenosis.
 The cosmetic results were superior to those of staged procedures in that it was almost always possible to obtain a glanular meatus which was both terminal and realistic.
