The use of masseter electromyography with electroneurography in the evaluation of facial paralysis.
 In the evaluation of facial paralysis, electroneurography provides a quantitative assessment of the degree of degeneration.
 Near the endpoint of degeneration, the facial musculature compound action potential may be contaminated by masseter artifact resulting from supramaximal stimulation.
 We propose the use of both masseter electromyography and electroneurography in the evaluation of advanced degeneration to better define the current level for supramaximal stimulation, to eliminate masseter artifact, and to more accurately assess the degree of facial nerve degeneration.
