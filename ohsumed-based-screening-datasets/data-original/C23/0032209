Is pulsed Doppler velocimetry useful in the management of multiple-gestation pregnancies?
 Few studies have addressed the significance of umbilical artery pulsed Doppler velocimetry in multiple gestation.
 Level II ultrasonography and pulsed Doppler studies were performed in 94 twin pairs and seven sets of triplets, which yielded data on 207 fetuses.
 A systolic/diastolic ratio was calculated for each fetus; abnormal pulsed Doppler velocimetry showed high correlation with adverse pregnancy events.
 Those with abnormal Doppler findings tended to be born 3 to 4 weeks earlier and to exhibit a greater number of stillbirths and structural malformations, as well as greater morbidity, when compared with fetuses without abnormal Doppler results.
 Fifteen of 17 infants with abnormal antenatal waveforms suffered serious morbidity.
 Seven were small for gestational age, and two were borderline for small for gestational age.
 An additional five infants with abnormal waveforms were appropriate for gestational age but were either recipient or donor in the twin transfusion syndrome.
 Eleven fetuses with this syndrome are described.
 Donor twins tended to be severely small for gestational age, with 7 of the 11 infants showing elevated systolic/diastolic ratios.
 Amniotic fluid volume tended to be diminished in the donor's sac but normal or increased in the recipient's sac.
 The observations in the study correlate with suspected physiologic changes of this syndrome.
 Because present findings suggest that fetuses with abnormal velocimetry suffer increased morbidity and mortality, a more rational method of management that uses Doppler data is suggested for multiple gestations.
