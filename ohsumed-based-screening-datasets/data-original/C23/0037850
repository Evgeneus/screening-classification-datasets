The use of immobilized protamine in removing heparin and preventing protamine-induced complications during extracorporeal blood circulation.
 Heparin, currently used in extracorporeal blood circulation procedures, may lead to hemorrhagic complications.
 Protamine, used for reversal of heparin-induced anticoagulation at the end of such procedures, can cause adverse hemodynamic responses.
 To prevent both types of complications, we have developed a reactor device containing immobilized protamine (i.e., a protamine bio-reactor) that can be placed at the distal end of the circuit, thus providing simultaneous extracorporeal heparin removal and protamine treatment.
 In preliminary in vivo studies involving dogs at a blood flow of 100 ml/min, the bio-reactor removed about 50% of the administered dose of heparin (i.e., 100 units/kg) in 10 min.
 While rapid injection of protamine in dogs anticoagulated with heparin produced a transient and significant (P less than 0.005) decreases in systemic arterial blood pressure (-39.5 +/- 9.2 mmHg), cardiac output (-1.59 +/- 0.23 L/min), and mixed venous oxygen saturation (-7.5 +/- 1.3%) and increases in pulmonary artery systolic (+12.7 +/- 4.4 mmHg) and diastolic pressures (+10.0 +/- 3.6 mmHg), the use of the protamine bio-reactor did not elicit any statistically significant change in any of the variables measured.
 Hemolysis was not significant, as reflected by a statistically insignificant change of the animals' red blood cell counts, hematocrits, and total hemoglobin values.
 In addition, hemolytic complement was found to be reduced only by 10% in animals with the protamine bio-reactor, whereas it was reduced rapidly by 20% in animals receiving intravenous protamine administration and progressively by 20% in control animals with a sham reactor that contained no protamine.
 Furthermore, the use of the protamine bio-reactor also significantly reduced the protamine-induced transient thrombocytopenic and granulocytopenic responses.
 The white blood cell counts and platelet counts decreased to 87.7 +/- 7.5 and 83.3 +/- 5.0% of baseline, respectively, in dogs with the protamine bio-reactor compared to 35.5 +/- 14.3 and 32.1 +/- 8.1% of baseline in dogs receiving intravenous protamine.
 The protamine bio-reactor may provide a unique means to simultaneously control both heparin- and protamine-induced complications.
