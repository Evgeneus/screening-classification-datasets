An unusual complication of cardiac transplantation--infected aortic pseudoaneurysm.
 Infections after cardiac transplantation are a frequent cause of early morbidity and mortality.
 An unusual site for such a complication is at the aortic anastomotic suture line.
 We report a case of an infected aortic pseudoaneurysm, seen as recurrent septicemia, during the first 6 months after cardiac transplantation.
