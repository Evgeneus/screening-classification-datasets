A prosthesis augmentation device for the prevention of recurrent hip dislocation. A preliminary report.
 At present, revision is the only standard option for cases of recurrent hip prosthesis dislocation.
 A device is described that contains the head of the femoral component, preventing dislocation, while only slightly restricting external rotation of the affected leg.
 The device can be inserted through a small incision, minimizing operation time.
 This device differs from others, e.g., the reversed acetabular cup, by being predrilled (with drill guide supplied), modular in design, and tailored to the dimensions of the cup site.
