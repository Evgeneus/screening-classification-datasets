Alveolitis correlates with clinical pulmonary involvement in primary Sjogren's syndrome.
 Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 23 patients with primary Sjogren's syndrome (1Ss) and ten healthy controls to evaluate alveolitis and correlate it with pulmonary and systemic manifestations.
 Patients with 1Ss had higher BAL total cell count (9.2 +/- 6.7 millions/ml vs 6.1 +/- 2.9 millions/ml) and higher percentage of lymphocytes 23.3 +/- 15.6 percent vs 6.5 +/- 2.9 percent, p less than 0.001) than controls.
 Twelve patients (group A) constituted the "high alveolitis" group (lymphocytes greater than 15.2 percent) and ten (group B) constituted the "low alveolitis" group (lymphocytes less than 15.2 percent).
 Group A had more frequent cough (6/12 vs 2/10, p = 0.07), dyspnea (4/12 vs 1/10), and roentgenologic evidence of interstitial lung disease (5/12 vs 0/10, p less than 0.05).
 They also had lower total lung capacity (85.6 +/- 14.2 percent pred vs 105.8 +/- 23.3 percent pred, p less than 0.05) and Dco (87.7 +/- 20.6 percent pred vs 103.6 +/- 21.0 percent pred).
 All patients with +3 or +4 grading or lymphocytic infiltrates in lip biopsy specimen belonged in group A (5/12).
 Finally, T-helper/T-suppressor ratio was lower in group A than in group B.
 The intensity of alveolitis was not correlated with clinical or serologic manifestations of systemic disease.
