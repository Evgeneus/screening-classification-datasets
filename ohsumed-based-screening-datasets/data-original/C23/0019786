Gastric infarction.
 We have described a patient with an acute condition of the abdomen who had infarction of the stomach and the small intestine due to atheromatous thrombus of celiac and superior mesenteric arteries.
 We believe this unusual simultaneous occurrence of gastric and small intestinal infarction is coincidental.
 The outcome of gastric infarction is frequently fatal.
