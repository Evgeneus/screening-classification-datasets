The role of platelet activating factor and its antagonists in shock, sepsis and multiple organ failure.
 PAF has been implicated as a mediator of shock, sepsis and MOF.
 The results of experimental data demonstrate that PAF induces changes characteristic of endotoxemia and sepsis, including systemic hypotension and diffuse microvascular leakage.
 These effects are prevented by PAF antagonists.
 PAF induces many of the characteristic changes of MOF, including functional impairment in the lung, kidney, gastrointestinal tract and heart.
 PAF antagonists will inhibit these adverse effects.
 PAF antagonists are now being manufactured by a number of pharmaceutical companies studying the beneficial effects of PAF antagonists in human disease.
 Data from these studies promise valuable information with significant clinical relevance to the practicing surgeon.
