Stiffman syndrome: a rare paraneoplastic disorder?
 An unusual case of the stiffman syndrome, associated with an oat cell carcinoma of the bronchus, is reported.
 Pathological examination showed that it was due to an encephalomyelitis similar to that seen in paraneoplastic disorders.
 This suggests that atypical cases of the stiffman syndrome may occasionally be paraneoplastic.
