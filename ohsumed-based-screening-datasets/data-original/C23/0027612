Hypoxaemia during anaesthesia--an observer study.
 We have investigated 296 inpatients in a single-blind observer study to determine the incidence, degree and duration of hypoxaemia during anaesthesia.
 The clinical recognition of hypoxaemia, period of time until recognition and risk factors were studied.
 Oxygen saturation (Spo2) was monitored continuously with a pulse oximeter (Ohmeda, model 3700).
 One or more episodes of mild hypoxaemia (Spo2 86-90%) were recorded in 53% of patients.
 Severe hypoxaemia with Spo2 values less than 81% were recorded in 20% of patients.
 The mild hypoxaemic episodes lasted up to 34.6 min (mean 2.3 min) and 70% were not detected by the anaesthetist.
 In the remaining 30% of episodes, the anaesthetist diagnosed the complication with a mean time delay of 70 s.
 After intervention a mean time delay of 57 s was recorded until Spo2 exceeded 90%.
 Utilizing a stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, we found that risk factors associated with a greater incidence of hypoxaemia were patient age (P less than 0.005) and anaesthetic technique (P less than 0.00001).
 We conclude that hypoxaemic episodes in our operating rooms are common during anaesthesia and suggest preoxygenation in all patients in addition to administration of supplementary oxygen during arousal from anaesthesia and during transfer to the recovery room.
