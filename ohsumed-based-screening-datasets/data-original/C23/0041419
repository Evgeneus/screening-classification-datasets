Transmural distribution of myocardial edema by NMR relaxometry following myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.
 To determine the distribution and extent of myocardial edema resulting from ischemia and reperfusion, seven open-chest dogs underwent occlusion of the left circumflex coronary artery for 2 hours (group I), and 10 underwent occlusion for 2 hours and reperfusion for 2 hours (group II).
 Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (T1 and T2 relaxation times) and percent water content were determined to quantitate the amount of edema.
 There was a transmural increase of the T1 relaxation time of the central ischemic zone in groups I and II, although this increase was significantly greater in group II in both the subendocardium (group I = 707.8 +/- 12.5 msec, group II = 813.2 +/- 36.2 msec; p less than 0.01) and subepicardium (group I = 641.7 +/- 20.5 msec, group II = 760.5 +/- 34.7 msec; p less than 0.01).
 These increases were also observed in the T2 weighted relaxation time in the subendocardium (group I = 54.7 +/- 0.8 msec, group II = 78.7 +/- 6.3 msec; p less than 0.005) and subepicardium (group I = 54.0 +/- 1.4 msec, group II = 73.1 +/- 4.0 msec; p less than 0.001).
 Transmural differences were evident between the myocardial layers with increased T1 relaxation times (p less than 0.01) in the subendocardium in both groups.
 Similar increases were noted in the percent water content of the myocardium.
 Thus T1 and T2 relaxation times lengthened with an increase in myocardial water content following occlusion, and these relaxation times were augmented by reperfusion.
 We conclude that ischemia-induced edema occurs in a transmural distribution from subendocardium to subepicardium following occlusion, and this edema is further enhanced by reperfusion.
