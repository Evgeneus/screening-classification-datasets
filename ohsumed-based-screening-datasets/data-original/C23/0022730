Long-term results following surgical management of aortic graft infection.
 Between January 1970 and June 1988, a total of 45 patients with aortic prosthetic graft infection underwent removal of the infected aortic prosthesis.
 In addition, 36 of these patients also underwent revascularization via an extra-anatomic bypass.
 We analyzed the early and long-term results with respect to survival, limb salvage, freedom from infection, and extra-anatomic graft patency.
 The 30-day mortality was 24% (11/45), and the amputation rate was 11% (8/73).
 During a mean follow-up of 36 months (range, 2 to 144 months), 80% (24/30) of the patients remained free of infection and are considered cured.
 Infection in the extra-anatomic bypass graft was the most common cause of recurrent sepsis and the leading cause of late amputations (four of seven).
 By life-table methods, 1-year survival was 63% and 5-year survival was 49%.
 Limb salvage rates at 1 and 5 years were 79% and 66%, respectively.
 The primary patency rate of extra-anatomic bypass was 43% at 3 years, with the secondary patency rate improved to 65%.
 These early and late results are in marked contrast to the natural history of untreated aortic graft infection.
 Nonetheless, a perioperative mortality rate of 24%, a 5-year limb loss rate of 33%, and 3-year graft thrombosis rate of 35% are testimony to the serious nature of aortic graft infection and the need to develop better methods to prevent this complication.
