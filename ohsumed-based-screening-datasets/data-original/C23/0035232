A simple method for biliary-enteric anastomosis and chronic bile diversion in the rat.
 A simple method of biliary-enteric anastomosis, without the use of surgical microscopy, is described.
 There were no signs of cholestasis after 3 mo of follow-up.
 A modified procedure using a silicone elastomer catheter as a stent for the biliary-enteric anastomosis resulted in biliary obstruction within 3 wk after surgery.
 Our experimental bile duct implantation technique is a simple and useful experimental method for the investigation of chronic biliary diversion and biliary physiology.
 Additionally, it can be performed safely and easily in a rodent model without sophisticated microscopic techniques.
