Study of the seminal vesicles in acute epididymitis.
 Although it has been suggested that seminal vesiculitis is present in patients with epididymitis, it has not been proven.
 We performed rectal ultrasound assessment of the seminal vesicles in 18 consecutive patients with epididymitis.
 The seminal vesicles on the same side as the epididymitis was significantly enlarged in 75% of cases; 92% of these enlarged vesicles returned to normal size in 12 weeks.
 A persistently enlarged seminal vesicle was associated with unresolved epididymitis, and further bacteriological studies in these cases demonstrated continued Chlamydia infection in some patients over 35 years of age.
