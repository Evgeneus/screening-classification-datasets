Comparison of oral iodine-131-cellulose and indium-111-DTPA as tracers for colon transit scintigraphy: analysis by colon activity profiles.
 In 11 normal subjects and 11 patients with a clinical diagnosis of constipation, oral 131I-cellulose and 111In-DTPA were compared simultaneously as tracers for radionuclide colon transit scintigraphy.
 Visual assessment of the images revealed no differences between tracers.
 Quantitation was performed using total and segmental percent retention and the derived value of clearance half-time.
 In addition, profiles of the activity distribution along the length of the colon were generated and the mean position of the activity in the colon calculated.
 For all indices, the results were similar in both normal subjects and constipated patients when comparing tracers, although marked differences were present between normal subjects and constipated patients for each tracer.
 Indium-111-DTPA was easy to administer and dosimetry was more acceptable than for 131I-cellulose, especially in constipated patients.
 It is concluded that 111In-DTPA is the preferred tracer for oral colon transit scintigraphy.
