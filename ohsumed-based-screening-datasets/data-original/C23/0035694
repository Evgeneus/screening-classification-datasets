Impassable ureteral strictures: management with percutaneous ureteroneocystostomy.
 Sixteen of 227 patients referred for percutaneous placement of a ureteral stent had impassable stenoses.
 Stenoses were benign (n = 8) or attributed to malignant retroperitoneal neoplasm (n = 8).
 Electrocautery was used to create a neotract between the stenosed ureter and the bladder or ileal loop.
 A double-J stent was placed after dilation of the tract by use of angioplasty.
 Neotracts were established and stents were placed in all patients.
 Complications (digestive tract fistulas) developed in two patients.
 This technique is safe if the electrode is placed close to the bladder or ileal loop.
 The procedure can be used as an alternative to surgery or permanent nephrostomy or in initial treatment of benign anastomotic stenosis.
