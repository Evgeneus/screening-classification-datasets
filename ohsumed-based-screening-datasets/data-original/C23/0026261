Essential fatty acid deficiency associated with the use of a medium-chain-triglyceride infant formula in pediatric hepatobiliary disease.
 Serum phospholipid fatty acid patterns were determined by gas chromatography in four infants with hepatobiliary disease receiving a formula with a high content of medium-chain-triglyceride (MCT) oil.
 All four infants demonstrated signs of essential fatty acid deficiency, characterized by decreased arachidonic acid and increased palmitoleic and oleic acids.
 All had substantial concentrations of the pathologic triene 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid.
 Three of four had decreased linoleic acid concentrations and abnormal ratios of triene to tetraene (5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid: arachidonic acid), greater than 0.38.
 One patient may have experienced growth failure due to abnormal essential fatty acid status.
 Infants with the potential for fat malabsorption should only receive MCT-oil feedings with well above the generally recommended requirements for linoleic acid (3% of total caloric intake).
