Cystic fibrosis mutations in North American populations of French ancestry: analysis of Quebec French-Canadian and Louisiana Acadian families.
 A 3-bp deletion (delta F508) in the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene is the mutation on the majority of CF chromosomes.
 We studied 112 CF families from North American populations of French ancestry: French-Canadian families referred from hospitals in three cities in Quebec and from the Saguenay-Lac St.
 Jean region of northeastern Quebec and Acadian families living in Louisiana.
 delta F508 was present on 71%, 55%, and 70% of the CF chromosomes from the major-urban Quebec, Saguenay-Lac St.
 Jean, and Louisiana Acadian families, respectively.
 A weighted estimate of the proportion of delta F508 in the French-Canadian patient population of Quebec was 70%.
 We found that 95% of the CF chromosomes with delta F508 had D7S23 haplotype B, the most frequent haplotype on CF chromosomes.
 In the Saguenay-Lac St.
 Jean families, 86% of the CF chromosomes without delta F508 had the B haplotype, compared with 31% for the major-urban Quebec and Louisiana Acadian families.
 The incidence of CF in the Saguenay-Lac St.
 Jean population was 1/895 live-born infants.
