Phantom-related phenomena after rectal amputation: prevalence and clinical characteristics.
 Phantom sensations are well known and almost inevitable sequels to limb amputation, whereas similar phenomena are only rarely described after rectum amputation (phantom rectum).
 Our study attempted to assess the frequency and character of phantom rectum.
 All surviving patients (n = 22), who had undergone abdominoperineal surgical resection of the rectum in the period 1980-1986 at our clinic, were interviewed by a standard questionnaire and underwent a physical examination.
 Sixty-eight per cent of the patients experienced a sensation of a missing rectum (phantom rectum), and in 27% of these or 18% of all patients this sensation was painful (phantom pain).
 The most common symptoms were sensations of flatus and/or faeces in a normal rectum, phantom flatus or phantom faeces.
 The phantom pains were described as either pricking and shooting or like haemorrhoids or hard stools that would rupture the rectum.
 Neither age, sex, preoperative pain, the Duke classification of the tumour nor the healing of the perineal wound seemed related to the likelihood of phantom rectum.
 The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying phantom-related phenomena following amputation have not yet been elucidated.
 This study describes a relatively unknown phantom-related clinical entity after amputation and may thus contribute to the understanding of this phenomenon.
