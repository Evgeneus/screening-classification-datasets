The trauma triage rule: a new, resource-based approach to the prehospital identification of major trauma victims.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To develop a new trauma decision rule.
 DESIGN: Retrospective clinical review.
 SETTING: Level I trauma center.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 1,004 injured adults.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A new trauma decision rule was derived from 1,004 injured adult patients using a new operational definition of major trauma.
 The rule, termed the Trauma Triage Rule, defines a major trauma victim as any injured adult patient whose systolic blood pressure is less than 85 mm Hg; whose motor component of the Glasgow Coma Score is less than 5; or who has sustained penetrating trauma of the head, neck, or trunk.
 Using the operational definition of major trauma, the rule had a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 92% when tested on the 1,004-patient cohort.
 CONCLUSION: The Trauma Triage Rule may significantly reduce overtriage while only minimally increasing undertriage.
 This approach must be validated prospectively before it can be used in the prehospital setting.
