Deformity correction and long-term survival in an infant with iniencephaly. Case report.
 The authors describe the case of a male infant who was diagnosed prenatally as having iniencephaly.
 Since birth, the child has grown, thrived, and undergone two successful operations to correct his cervical deformity.
 This case demonstrates that the iniencephaly defect is not uniformly fatal and that neurosurgical intervention may offer significant improvement in the cervical deformity.
