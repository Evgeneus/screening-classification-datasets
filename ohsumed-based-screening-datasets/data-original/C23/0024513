Autosomal dominant deletions of the mitochondrial genome in a case of progressive encephalomyopathy.
 Multiple deletions of the mitochondrial genome were found in a family in which the proband had ataxia and ketoacidotic comas.
 A progressive multiorgan involvement appeared in the course of the disease, and histopathological investigation demonstrated mitochondrial myopathy features with ragged red fibers.
 A defect of oxidative phosphorylation was found in both skeletal muscle and lymphocytes.
 It is surprising that various mtDNA deletions were detected both in the proband and in his healthy mother and maternal aunt but not in the rest of the maternal progeny.
 All the deletions were located between Cox II and cytochrome b genes, and short (4-5 bp) repeated sequences were consistently present at the boundaries of the rearrangements in different tissues.
 Therefore, the deletions appear not to be transmitted per se but to be inherited in a Mendelian manner, being possibly dominant.
 Both the Mendelian inheritance of the trait and the variety of the deletions in carriers suggest that a nuclearly encoded factor(s) might be involved in the triggering of the deletions.
 However, the presence of the rearrangements in healthy individuals raises the question of whether mtDNA deletions actually cause the clinical expression of the disease.
