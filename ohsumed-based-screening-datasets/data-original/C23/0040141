Survival of DNA HLA-DR typed and matched cadaver kidney transplants. The Collaborative Transplant Study.
 The clinical value of serological HLA matching for cadaver kidney transplantation remains uncertain because the success rate for HLA-matched cadaver transplants is lower than that of HLA-matched sibling grafts.
 Up to 25% of serological HLA-DR typings may be incorrect when compared with a more accurate DNA-RFLP method, and we have now examined whether incorrect HLA-DR typings account for the lower than expected success rates of HLA-matched cadaver transplants.
 58 transplant centres took part in this study and DNA was extracted from over 4000 samples of frozen tissue at the study centre.
 8 laboratories then completed blind RFLP typing for HLA-DR.
 Serological typing data were reported by individual transplant laboratories.
 29 of 107 transplants (27%) that were reported as HLA A, B, DR compatible and 76 of 273 (28%) transplants that were reported as HLA B, DR compatible according to serological typing were found to be HLA-DR mismatched by DNA typing.
 The one-year transplant success rate for DNA-matched HLA, A, B, DR grafts was 87% compared with 69% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.02); the corresponding success rate for DNA-matched HLA B, DR grafts was 85% compared with 72% for mismatched grafts (p less than 0.01).
 Many transplants that were previously thought to be HLA matched are mismatched, and this finding may account for previously unexplained graft failures.
