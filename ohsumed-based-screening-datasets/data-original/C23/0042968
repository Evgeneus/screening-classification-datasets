Pelvic abscesses: CT-guided transrectal drainage.
 Percutaneous drainage of pelvic abscesses has been performed by using a number of approaches, including transabdominal, transgluteal, and transrectal.
 The authors present a technique for the drainage of pelvic abscesses by a transrectal route with use of computed tomographic (CT) guidance.
 Equipment for the technique included a plastic introducer tube, standard needle, angiographic guide wire, and pigtail catheters.
 The pelvic abscesses of 10 patients (six after appendectomy, three after colon resection, one secondary to diverticulitis) were successfully drained by using the new technique.
 No complications or recurrences were experienced.
 After initial catheter placement, patients were treated with use of gravity drainage and appropriate antibiotics.
 Success of drainage was determined with sequential CT scans.
 Compared with the transgluteal approach, the transrectal approach offered increased patient comfort and minimal risk of potential complications such as injury to the sciatic nerve or tracking of the abscess.
 Use of the plastic introducer tube promoted operator safety by protecting the guiding finger.
 On the basis of this initial series, CT-guided transrectal drainage appears to be an effective and well-tolerated method for the drainage of pelvic abscesses.
