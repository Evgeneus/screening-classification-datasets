Effects of spinal kappa-opioid receptor agonists on the responsiveness of nociceptive superficial dorsal horn neurons.
 Spinal cord application of the kappa-opioid receptor agonists dynorphin (50 nmol) or (1S,2S)U-50,488H (0.19-1.9 mumol) produced changes in the excitability of some superficial dorsal horn nociceptive neurons.
 One-third of the cells exhibited expansion of their receptive fields as defined using mechanical stimuli following a spinal kappa agonist (dynorphin or U-50,488H); receptive field expansions were of the same order as those observed immediately after a conditioning electrical stimulus applied to a peripheral nerve.
 In addition, spinal U-50,488H produced changes in mechanical and thermal thresholds of the majority of superficial dorsal horn neurons.
 These changes were dose-dependent.
 Facilitation of responses occurred at lower doses and inhibition occurred primarily at higher doses, but these effects were not reversed by subsequent administration of naloxone.
 The data are consistent with the hypothesis that one action of increases in spinal dynorphin levels due to peripheral inflammation, tissue injury or nerve damage, is to contribute to enhanced neuronal excitability in superficial dorsal horn neurons.
