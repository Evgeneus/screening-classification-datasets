Shock wave-induced pancreatic trauma.
 A case is described of the appearance of a pancreatic or peripancreatic lesion after left renal calculus fragmentation by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL).
 Its anatomical location and subsequent disappearance suggest it was related to trauma caused by the shock waves.
 The brief literature on pancreatic injury after ESWL is reviewed, and the role of the patient's underlying liver disease in the genesis of this complication is discussed.
