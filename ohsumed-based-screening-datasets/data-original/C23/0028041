Double anal canal: complication of rectal fecalith.
 Fecaliths and stercoraceous ulcerations are well-known complications of chronic constipation.
 The authors present the case of a double anal canal in an elderly man.
 This anorectal fistula (complex anal fistula) developed as a complication of an impacted rectal fecalith with resultant stercoraceous ulceration.
 Eventually, a persistent epithelialized canal developed and was demonstrated at double-contrast barium enema examination.
 The patient remained continent at all times.
