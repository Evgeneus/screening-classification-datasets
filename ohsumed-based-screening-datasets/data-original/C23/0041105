Lower urinary tract reconstruction following cystectomy: experience and results in 126 patients using the Kock ileal reservoir with bilateral ureteroileal urethrostomy.
 Between May 1986 and February 1990, 126 consecutive men underwent lower urinary tract reconstruction by means of bilateral ureteroileal urethrostomy using a Kock ileal reservoir.
 The early complication rate was 11.1%.
 Late complications requiring rehospitalization or reoperation have been surprisingly few: 1 for prolapse of the afferent antirefluxing nipple valve, 1 for calculi and 4 for artificial urinary sphincter placement due to unsatisfactory continence.
 Good continence has been achieved in 94% of the patients during the day and in 84% at night.
 Tumor recurred in the pelvis in 5 patients, with 4 requiring cutaneous urinary diversion.
 All patients had progression or died of metastatic disease.
 Our experience has yielded extraordinary results in terms of patient acceptance with few late complications or need for reoperation.
