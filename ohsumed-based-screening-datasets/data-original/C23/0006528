Prevalence of chronic bronchitis among US Hispanics from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1982-84.
 In the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (HHANES), Puerto Ricans had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of self-reported chronic bronchitis (2.9 percent, 95% CI = 2.2, 3.6) than Mexican Americans (1.7 percent, 95% CI = 1.3, 2.1) or Cubans (1.7 percent, 95% CI = 0.9, 2.5).
 The prevalence of chronic bronchitis was at least 2 times higher in smokers as compared to nonsmokers among Puerto Ricans and Cubans, but not for Mexican Americans.
