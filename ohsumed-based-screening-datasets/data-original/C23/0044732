Breast reconstruction utilizing subcutaneous tissue expansion followed by polyurethane-covered silicone implants: a 6-year experience.
 Reconstruction of the breast after modified radical mastectomy can be safely and adequately performed in the subcutaneous plane.
 Placement of a subcutaneous tissue expander (as either an immediate or a delayed procedure), rapid expansion over a 3- to 4-month period, capsulotomy, and placement of a polyurethane-coated implant have led to satisfactory results over a 6-year period.
 Breast reconstruction methods are well documented; however, the utilization of expanded subcutaneous chest wall skin has not been reported heretofore.
