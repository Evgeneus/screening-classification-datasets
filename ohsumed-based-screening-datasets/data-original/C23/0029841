Relationships between block-of-twitch and train-of-four fade in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation.
 The relationships between the block-of-twitch and train-of-four fade in the presence of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (d-tubocurarine, vecuronium and pancuronium) were examined in vitro by measuring the contractile tension from mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparations.
 The slope of the block/fade relationship differed between onset of and recovery from neuromuscular block following single doses of d-tubocurarine, vecuronium or pancuronium.
 Decreasing the dose of d-tubocurarine or using a divided dose technique to accelerate onset (i.e., priming) increased the amount of fade for a given amount of block.
 In addition, the block/fade relationships for cumulative dosing and sequential dilution were the same when measurements were made at steady-state for several doses.
 It is concluded that the block/fade relationship in the mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation is variable, and is related to the time course of the neuromuscular block.
 In addition, the block/fade relationships for d-tubocurarine, vecuronium and pancuronium did not differ when determined at steady-state.
