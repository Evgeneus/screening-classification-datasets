Sexual asphyxia in siblings.
 We present an accidental autoerotic asphyxiation of a 24-year-old man.
 Further investigation revealed that 18 years earlier, his brother, then 13, had been found dead, hanging in the family bathroom.
 Although that death had been ruled a suicide, reevaluation of the death scene indicates that this was also an autoerotic asphyxiation.
 This is the first reported case of sexual asphyxia involving siblings.
