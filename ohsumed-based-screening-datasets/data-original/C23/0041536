Enterobius egg granuloma of the vulva and peritoneum: review of the literature.
 Two cases of Enterobius granuloma containing eggs only are reported.
 The first case involved the vulva, where no such granuloma has been reported previously.
 The coexistence of peritoneal granuloma and rectal adenocarcinoma in the second case suggests the possibility of direct penetration of the damaged colonic wall by the parasite, as emphasized by several previous reports of neoplastic involvement and perforation of the intestinal wall in cases of ectopic infections.
 The diagnostic criteria of Enterobius eggs granuloma, which might be a diagnostic dilemma for pathologists who are not familiar with such criteria, are described herein.
