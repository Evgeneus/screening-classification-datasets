Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of proximal subclavian artery stenosis after left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery bypass surgery.
 A patient is described who underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, through a brachial approach, of a high grade stenosis at the proximal portion of the left subclavian artery 1.5 years after coronary artery bypass grafting including left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery anastomosis.
 Symptoms of class IV angina, vertebrobasilar insufficiency and occupational arm claudication that developed after bypass surgery were promptly relieved after balloon dilation.
 Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery can be performed safely and provides an alternative to carotid-subclavian or axillary-axillary bypass surgery for treatment of internal mammary artery graft malfunction.
