High-attenuation mediastinal masses on unenhanced CT.
 On unenhanced CT scans, a variety of mediastinal masses contain areas with attenuation values higher than the attenuation value of the chest wall musculature.
 The increased attenuation may be diffuse or focal and may be a result of calcium deposition, high iodine content, or areas of acute hemorrhage.
 This report illustrates the gamut of high-attenuation mediastinal masses seen on unenhanced CT.
 Masses that are of high attenuation only on IV contrast-enhanced images (e.g., aberrant vessels) are not included.
