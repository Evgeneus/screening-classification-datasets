Frequency of adverse systemic reactions after fluorescein angiography. Results of a prospective study.
 Intravenous fluorescein angiography is a commonly performed and extraordinarily valuable diagnostic procedure.
 The frequency of adverse reactions after angiography has varied considerably in previous reports.
 In a prospective study of 2789 angiographic procedures in 2025 patients, the authors found that the percentage of adverse reactions depended strongly on the patient's angiographic history.
 Overall, adverse reactions followed 4.8% of the angiographic procedures.
 These reactions included nausea (2.9%), vomiting (1.2%), flushing/itching/hives (0.5%), and other reactions (dyspnea, syncope, excessive sneezing) (0.2%).
 No cases of anaphylaxis, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or seizures occurred.
 The percentage of reactions was 1.8% for patients who had had previous angiography without ever having had an adverse reaction.
 In contrast, the percentage of reactions was 48.6% for patients who had had an adverse reaction to angiography previously.
