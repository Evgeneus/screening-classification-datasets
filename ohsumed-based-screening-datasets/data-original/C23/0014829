Is thioridazine retinopathy progressive? Relationship of pigmentary changes to visual function.
 Thioridazine toxicity has been described as a 'progressive chorioretinopathy', but this designation can be misleading.
 During the first year after thioridazine exposure retinal pigmentation evolves from a granular to a patchy or nummular appearance.
 However, visual function and the electroretinogram typically improve during this period.
 Some cases may show chorioretinal atrophy and functional loss many years later, but there is little evidence for ongoing drug-related progression.
 Late atrophy may represent degeneration of cells that were injured subclinically at the time of initial drug exposure.
 Although thioridazine toxicity produces an evolving pigmentary disturbance, functional changes must be monitored independently of fundus appearance.
