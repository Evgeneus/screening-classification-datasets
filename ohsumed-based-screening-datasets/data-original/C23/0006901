Aortobronchial fistula after an aortic operation.
 A 71-year-old man with a postoperative aortobronchial fistula was successfully treated.
 The fistula occurred between the left lower lobe and the descending thoracic aorta, to which a distal anastomosis of a temporary bypass graft had been placed during thoracic aortic aneurysmectomy 3 years before.
 For saving patients with this complication, early surgical treatment during episodes of intermittent hemoptysis is important.
 The use of an omentum pedicle flap for the isolation of the suture line is a important adjunct.
