Spontaneous rupture of hepatocellular carcinoma: a review of 172 Japanese cases.
 The spontaneous rupture of a primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 10% mortality of HCC patients in Japan.
 Because this problem occurs much less frequently in western countries, it is often difficult for clinicians practicing in such countries to decide upon the best course of action during the crisis accompanying the spontaneous rupture of a HCC.
 In an effort to advance the general knowledge of this disease and clarify a selection for its treatment, we review 172 cases of spontaneous rupture of a HCC reported in the Japanese literature.
 The chief complaint of the patients was sudden epigastralgia or right hypochondriac pain.
 Abdominal paracentesis was positive in 86% of the patients.
 Liver failure was the cause of death in 42% of the patients.
 Therefore, it is important to evaluate liver reserve quickly.
 In addition, emergency hemostatic procedures must be implemented to avoid hemorrhagic shock.
 Although two-stage hepatectomy was performed in only 12% of the cases, these had the highest survival rates.
 Consequently, this is the procedure of choice for the treatment of spontaneous rupture of a HCC.
