Fatal and other major complications of endoscopic sinus surgery.
 Endoscopic sinus surgery has become an acceptable technique for the treatment of chronic sinus disease.
 This report analyzes five complications which came to my attention.
 Two cases were orbital:1 bilateral blindness due to damage of the optic nerves, and 1 damage of medial rectus muscle.
 The other 3 cases were intracranial:two cribriform plate damage with frontal lobe injury and hematoma, and 1 damage of the anterior cerebral artery, resulting in death.
 This rather novel technique, especially when used by less-experienced surgeons, has major complications similar to what has been reported with the traditional intranasal sphenoethmoidectomy.
 Knowledge of anatomy, good training, and meticulous surgical technique are very important.
 Endoscopic sinus surgery in patients with extensive pathology should be used with caution, especially if general anesthesia is selected or if excessive bleeding occurs.
 It would be beneficial to otolaryngologists to have previous experience in the traditional technique before adopting endoscopic sinus surgery to their armamentarium.
 Even then, major complications may occur in the hands of very experienced surgeons.
 Early recognition and proper management of these complications are of utmost importance in order to minimize disability or prevent death.
