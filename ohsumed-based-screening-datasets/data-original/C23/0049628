Epileptic palatal myoclonus.
 Palatal myoclonus (PM) is usually caused by lesions of the brainstem.
 We report a case of PM of focal cortical origin in a patient with epilepsia partialis continua.
 The PM sometimes occurred in isolation, and at other times was accompanied by unilateral face, neck, and arm twitching.
 This was documented by both EEG and SPECT.
