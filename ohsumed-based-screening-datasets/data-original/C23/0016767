Ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The Emory University experience.
 The ileal pouch-anal anastomosis has become a practical alternative to proctocolectomy for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and polyposis coli.
 To evaluate its success, the Emory University Affiliated Hospital experience from February 1984 to March 1989 was retrospectively reviewed.
 There were a total of 50 patients identified; 84 per cent had ulcerative colitis, and 16 per cent had polyposis coli (familial polyposis and Gardner's syndrome).
 The majority of these patients underwent a two-stage operation, but one-third required a three-stage procedure due to difficulty in mucosal proctectomy or toxic megacolon.
 J-pouch construction was performed in 72 per cent of patients, S-pouch construction in 14 per cent, straight ileo-anal anastomosis in 8 per cent, and lateral isoperistaltic ileo-anal anastomosis in 6 per cent.
 Of the 50 patients, 36 (72%) have had closure of the temporary ileostomy.
 Fourteen patients have not had ileostomy closure due to change in diagnosis to Crohn's disease, operative complications, or ileostomy closure pending.
 The combined operative morbidity per patient for the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and the closure of the ileostomy was 32 per cent.
 This included bowel obstruction, 16 per cent; pelvic abscess, 6 per cent; and ileo-anal separation, 4 per cent.
 Follow-up on patients with ileostomy closure ranged from 6 months to 4 years (mean, 1.3 years).
 Stool frequency was 5.9 stools per 24 hours at 6 months and improved with time.
 During the follow-up period, all patients were eventually completely continent of stool during the day, and most became completely continent of stool at night.
