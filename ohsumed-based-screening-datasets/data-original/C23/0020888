Prehospital care: the future of emergency medical services.
 Most prehospital interventions, both pharmacologic and procedural, have been accepted without clear demonstrations of their abilities to impact patient outcomes or without clear indications that withholding or delaying the intervention pending arrival at a definitive emergency department will adversely affect the patient.
 Interventions that have the benefit of supportive research have been applied equally to urban and nonurban emergency medical services environments.
 In selecting interventions, inadequate consideration has been given to the differences in emergency medical services personnel training, frequencies of their exposure to patients, frequencies of skill use, and availabilities of effective continuing education programs in the urban and nonurban environments.
 These issues are discussed, and the necessary focus of the future of emergency medical services in urban, suburban, and rural environments is predicted.
