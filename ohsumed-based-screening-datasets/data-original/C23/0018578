Neuropsychological performance in patients with mild multiple sclerosis.
 Although changes in cognitive function in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) have been reported, these changes have been traditionally associated with the later stages of the disease.
 In the current study, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery was administered to MS patients (N = 86) in whom the disease progression was relatively mild and in remission and a demographically well-matched control group (N = 46).
 Besides the expected differences in tests of motor function, the two groups also differed on a number of cognitive tests with no motor demands.
 The two cognitive functions that appear impaired were learning and memory.
 Given that similar deficits have been found in MS patients with more severe symptoms, it is argued that changes in cognitive function can occur in the mild stages of the disease.
