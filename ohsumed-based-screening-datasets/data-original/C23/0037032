Biliary pancreatitis. Operative outcome with a selective approach.
 To evaluate the efficacy of a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis, we reviewed the outcomes in 276 consecutive patients undergoing operations for this diagnosis during a 7-year period.
 Initial conservative therapy resulted in elective operations in 63% and urgent operations in 37%.
 Only 10 patients (3.6%) required primary pancreatic operations, 50% of them as emergencies.
 The proportion of common duct surgical explorations fell from 70% of those operated immediately after hospital admission to 20% by the third hospital day.
 Overall mortality was 1.8% but was increased to 30% in patients having an initial pancreatic operation.
 We conclude that a selective approach to biliary pancreatitis allows the operation to be performed electively in most patients and is associated with a low mortality and an acceptable length of stay.
 Most common duct stones pass spontaneously permitting cholecystectomy alone.
