Spinal leptomeningeal metastasis from cerebral glioblastoma. Appearance on magnetic resonance imaging.
 A case of circumferential leptomeningeal metastasis to the spinal cord from an intracranial glioblastoma multiforme (spinal meningeal gliomatosis) is presented.
 The clinical, radiographic, and pathological features are described.
 Spinal magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid accurately demonstrated the spread of disease when compared with autopsy findings.
 The value of spinal magnetic resonance imaging in patients with symptoms attributable to cerebrospinal fluid metastases is discussed.
