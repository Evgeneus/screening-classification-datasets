Endourological treatment of ureteroenteric anastomotic strictures: long-term followup.
 In 1987 we reported our initial experience with an endosurgical incisional approach to ureteroenteric anastomotic strictures (that is endoureterotomy).
 We have extended that initial report to encompass 15 patients with 19 ureteroenteric strictures followed for an average of 2.5 years.
 In all cases an endosurgical approach was well tolerated, blood loss was less than 50 cc and hospital stay averaged 3.5 days.
 A 16 to 22F external stent was left in place for 4 to 6 weeks postoperatively in 14 strictures.
 A permanent external 12F catheter was left in 5 strictures due to the presence of metastatic disease (4) and a complete dense stricture (1).
 The only major complication was a ureteroenteric fistula that healed over a ureteral stent without any open surgical intervention.
 Among 14 ureteroenteric strictures in which the stent was removed, the ureteroenteric area has remained patent in 8 (57%) with an average followup of 28.6 months (range 9 to 57 months).
 Failures were associated with metastatic disease in 2 cases, generalized debility in 2 and unexplained in 2.
 In this series an endosurgical approach to ureteroenteric strictures provided long-term satisfactory management of the problem in the majority of patients with benign and malignant disease.
 By current standards, only 1 patient (7%) would have been considered a candidate for open surgical repair.
