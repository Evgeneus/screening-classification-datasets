The effect of diazepam enema on the rectal mucosa of rats.
 The use of undiluted intravenous diazepam solution administered as an enema has been recommended for the acute management of seizures when intravenous access cannot be obtained.
 It is well absorbed, rapidly effective, and generally accepted as being safe when used in this manner.
 The effect of intravenous diazepam solution on the rectal mucosa has not been studied.
 This study demonstrates that there are no acute changes in the rectal mucosa of adult rats after administration of 10 to 20 times the recommended human dose.
