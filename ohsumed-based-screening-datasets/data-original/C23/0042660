Hypoxia-mediated in vivo release of dopamine in nucleus tractus solitarii of rabbits.
 A wide variety of neuroactive substances have been suggested to be involved in the respiratory depression observed in response to severe hypoxia.
 By use of the technique of microdialysis, the release of dopamine (DA) was measured in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxic provocations (6% O2 in N2) in the adult pentobarbital-anesthetized rabbit.
 DA release was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection.
 Such hypoxic provocations caused pronounced phase of depression in the phrenic nerve activity and enhanced release of DA.
 After bilateral carotid sinus nerve denervation, acute severe hypoxia did not give rise to enhanced release of DA or to phrenic nerve depression.
 Mild hypoxic (9% or 12% O2 in N2) or hypercapnic (6% CO2) stimuli resulted in an increased phrenic nerve activity without any concomitant changes in DA release.
 Decerebration at the midcollicular level in rabbits prevented an enhanced release of DA in the nucleus tractus solitarii during severe hypoxia.
 The results suggest that 1) DA is involved in the central ventilatory response to severe hypoxia, 2) not only the initial excitatory but also the second depressive phase in response to severe hypoxia is mediated partially by the peripheral chemoreceptors, and 3) the depressive phase is dependent on intact connections from suprapontine structures.
