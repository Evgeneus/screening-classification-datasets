Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A new look at regression of gastrinomas.
 Of 44 patients with the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome treated at our institution, nine appeared to have undergone "regression" of their gastrinomas.
 Six of the nine patients had sporadic gastrinomas and became permanently eugastrinemic following excision of nodal metastases and total gastrectomy (n = 4), antrectomy (n = 1), or pancreatoduodenectomy (n = 1) (mean survival, 13 years).
 The other three patients had Zollinger-Ellison syndrome as part of the multiple endocrine adenopathy type 1 syndrome and became temporarily eugastrinemic after total gastrectomy (mean survival, 11 years).
 Occult submucosal duodenal-wall microgastrinomas (mean size, 3.0 mm) were found to have been serendipitously excised in four patients.
 Long-term follow-up of these nine patients, as well as of six other patients described in the literature, demonstrates that excision of occult duodenal-wall gastrinomas provides a plausible explanation for the phenomenon of apparent regression of primary gastrinomas and the eugastrinemia that may follow total gastrectomy.
