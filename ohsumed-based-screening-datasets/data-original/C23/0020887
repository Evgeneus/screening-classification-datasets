Spontaneous rupture of the spleen in initial presentation of Hodgkin's disease.
 A 46-year-old man presented with a four-week history of fevers, occasional chills, and a two-week history of sweats and poor appetite.
 He also complained of progressive weakness and lethargy.
 After initial evaluation, while awaiting further consultation, the patient developed rapidly progressing abdominal pain and light-headedness.
 He was moved immediately into the emergency treatment area.
 He was noted to have an acute abdomen and was taken to surgery.
 An enlarged Hodgkin's-infiltrated spleen with an actively bleeding hematoma was removed.
 The patient denied any history of trauma.
