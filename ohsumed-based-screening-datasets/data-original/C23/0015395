Severe anaphylactoid reaction to hydroxyethyl starch.
 A case is presented of a severe anaphylactoid reaction to hydroxyethyl starch solution that occurred peri-operatively and required extended intensive management of the resultant bronchospasm and hypotension.
 Subsequent intradermal injection of hetastarch produced a delayed positive response, suggestive of a complement-mediated mechanism.
