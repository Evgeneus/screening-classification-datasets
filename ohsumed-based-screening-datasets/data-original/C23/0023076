Diaphragmatic force and substrate response to resistive loaded breathing in the piglet.
 Inspiratory resistive loaded (IRL) breathing results in hypoventilation and diaphragmatic fatigue in the piglet.
 We studied the effects of 6 h of IRL on ten 1-mo-old piglets.
 The load was adjusted to increase spontaneously generated transdiaphragmatic pressure five to six times baseline.
 Six 1-mo-old piglets acted as controls and were identically instrumented but were not subjected to IRL.
 Measurements of ventilation, blood gases and pH, diaphragmatic electromyogram, force-frequency curve, blood flow, and end-expiratory lung volume were obtained hourly.
 Diaphragmatic muscle samples were obtained after 6 h for determination of ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate, and glycogen levels.
 No changes occurred in the control animals.
 IRL resulted in a significant decrease in ventilation, an increase in diaphragmatic EMG, onset of abdominal expiratory muscle activity, and a fall in end-expiratory lung volume by 1 h.
 The force-frequency curve adjusted for lung volume change fell by 20% at all frequencies of stimulation at 1 h and by 40% at 6 h.
 Blood flow to the costal and crural diaphragm increased by 51 and 141%, respectively.
 No differences were noted in ATP, phosphocreatine, lactate, or glycogen between control and IRL animals.
 It is concluded that submaximal spontaneous contractions of the piglet diaphragm over a 6-h period cause a substantial decrease in its maximal force-generating capacity that is not related to substrate depletion.
