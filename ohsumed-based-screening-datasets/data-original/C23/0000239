Klinefelter's syndrome with anomalous origin of left main coronary artery 
 Klinefelter's syndrome is a rare entity.
 Even rarer is an anomalous origin of the Left Main Coronary Artery.
 For both conditions to occur in the same patient is hence exceedingly rare.
 Reported here is a never previously reported case of a coronary congenital anomaly in a patient with Klinefelter's syndrome together with the proper angiographic approach.
