Hypoxic exposure and activation of the afterdischarge mechanism in conscious humans.
 After voluntary hyperventilation, normal humans do not develop a significant ventilatory depression despite low arterial CO2 tension, a phenomenon attributed to activation of a brain stem mechanism referred to as the "afterdischarge." Afterdischarge is one of the factors that promote ventilatory stability.
 It is not known whether physiological stimuli, such as hypoxia, are able to activate the afterdischarge in humans.
 To test this, breath-by-breath ventilation (VI) was measured in nine young adults during and immediately after a brief period (35-51 s) of acute hypoxia (end-tidal O2 tension 55 Torr).
 Hypoxia was terminated by switching to 100% O2 (end-tidal O2 tension of first posthypoxic breath greater than 100 Torr).
 Brief hypoxia increased VI and decreased end-tidal CO2 tension.
 In all subjects, termination of hypoxia was followed by a gradual ventilatory decay; hyperoxic VI remained higher than the normoxic baseline for several breaths and, despite the negative chemical stimulus of hyperoxia and hypocapnia, reached a new steady state without an apparent undershoot.
 We conclude that brief hypoxia is able to activate the afterdischarge mechanism in conscious humans.
 This contrasts sharply with the ventilatory undershoot that follows relief of sustained hypoxia, thereby suggesting that sustained hypoxia inactivates the afterdischarge mechanism.
 The present findings are of relevance to the pathogenesis of periodic breathing in a hypoxic environment.
 Furthermore, brief exposure to hypoxia might be useful for evaluation of the role of afterdischarge in other disorders associated with unstable breathing.
