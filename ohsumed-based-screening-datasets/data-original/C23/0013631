Progression from lymphoid hyperplasia to high-grade malignant lymphoma in mice transgenic for the t(14; 18).
 Follicular lymphoma, the most common human lymphoma, characteristically has a t(14; 18) interchromosomal translocation.
 It is typically an indolent disease comprised of small resting B cells, but frequently develops into a high-grade lymphoma.
 The t(14; 18) translocates the Bcl-2 gene, generating a deregulated Bcl-2-immunoglobulin fusion gene.
 Bcl-2 is a novel inner mitochondrial membrane protein that extends the survival of certain cells by blocking programmed cell death.
 To determine the oncogenic potential of the t(14; 18) translocation, we produced transgenic mice bearing a Bcl-2-immunoglobulin minigene that structurally mimicked the t(14; 18).
 An indolent follicular hyperplasia in these transgenic mice progressed to a malignant diffuse large-cell lymphoma.
 The long latency, progression from polyclonal to monoclonal disease, and histological conversion, are all suggestive of secondary changes.
 Half of the immunoblastic high-grade lymphomas had a rearranged c-myc gene.
 Our transgenic mice provide an animal model for tumour progression in t(14; 18) lymphoma and show that prolonged B-cell life increases tumour incidence.
