Massive hemorrhage from a ruptured enteric varices of an augmented bladder.
 Intestinal varices are uncommon and usually occur secondary to portal hypertension.
 We report a case of variceal rupture in the intestinal segment of an augmentation colocystoplasty.
 The patient presented in shock from exsanguinating hemorrhage per urethram, and diagnosis was established at laparotomy.
 Although the bleeding was controlled with excision of the involved intestinal segment, the patient died of multiple organ failure.
 The diagnosis and treatment of this rare but fatal condition are discussed.
