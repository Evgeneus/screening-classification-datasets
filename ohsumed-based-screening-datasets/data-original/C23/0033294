Effect of sequential early burn wound excision and closure on postburn oxygen consumption.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the effect of early excision and closure of burns on postburn hypermetabolism, measured as oxygen consumption (VO2).
 METHODS: Twelve patients with deep burns of 30% to 50% of total body surface underwent sequential excisions and wound coverage, beginning 1 to 3 days after burn.
 The majority of the deep burn was removed by day 7, but with the addition of a donor site area of 20% to 25% of total body surface.
 RESULTS: No decrease in VO2 was noted in relation to the percent removal of burn tissue.
 In addition, a transient further increase in VO2 was noted early after excision, especially with surgical procedures performed after 5 days.
 This response could not be attributed to wound manipulation-induced bacteremias.
 CONCLUSION: We conclude that early surgical excision and closure of burns in excess of 30% to 50% of total body surface do not decrease postburn hypermetabolism in proportion to the area closed.
 It is possible that remaining open wounds in the form of donor sites and nonexcised burn are sufficient to perpetuate the hypermetabolic process, once established.
