A follow-up study of occupational skin disease in Western Australia.
 From a total of 993 previously reported cases of occupational skin disease (OSD), 954 (96%) were contacted and 711 (75%) examined.
 The review time (i.e., period from original diagnosis of OSD until review) varied from a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of over 8 years.
 Over 60% of cases were reviewed more than 2 years after the original diagnosis was made.
 More than 50% were still suffering from OSD or consequences related thereto.
 Clearance was less likely in those who remained in their original, or similar, occupational environment.
 However, of those who changed their job due to OSD, many suffered aggravation of the dermatitis from factors in the new work environment.
 Over 10% of cases had evolved into a persistent postoccupational dermatitis without obvious cause.
 This condition is responsible for considerable impairment and is of medicolegal importance due to confusion as to its relationship to the original occupational factors.
