Intravitreal suture: a complication of pterygium surgery.
 Among the complications associated with pterygium surgery, scleral perforation is mentioned in cases where subconjunctival tissue must be separated from the sclera.
 We present a case in which such a perforation and consequent suturing resulted in an intravitreous migration of a suture.
 We believe this is the first report of such a complication following pterygium surgery.
