Impact of intraoperative echocardiography on surgical management of congenital heart disease.
 Intraoperative echocardiography was performed by epicardial, 2-dimensional, low- and high-pulsed repetition frequency, continuous-wave Doppler and color flow mapping in 50 patients.
 Forty studies were performed before and 44 studies after cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Studies before cardiopulmonary bypass agreed with preoperative evaluation.
 After cardiopulmonary bypass, studies revealed that 11 of 25 patients who underwent repair of ventricular septal defects had residual ventricular septal defects, and 1 of 25 patients who underwent atrial septal repair had 1 residual atrial communication.
 One patient with a "Swiss cheese" ventricular septum underwent repeat cardiopulmonary bypass to close residual ventricular septal defects.
 The patient with a residual atrial communication required immediate reoperation because of a right to left shunt after a modified Fontan procedure.
 Eight of 10 remaining residual ventricular septal defects spontaneously closed 1 to 41 days after operation.
 Assessment of postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative valvular regurgitation in 21 valves revealed good correlation (p less than 0.01).
 However, 1 patient required reoperation for mitral valve replacement on the sixth postoperative day.
 The correlation was fair between postcardiopulmonary bypass and postoperative residual stenotic pressure gradients in 12 surgically repaired stenotic lesions.
 This study shows that little additional information is added to a comprehensive preoperative evaluation by precardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography.
 Postcardiopulmonary bypass intraoperative echocardiography is useful in identifying residual shunts.
 Assessment of stenotic gradients and valvular regurgitation must be interpreted in light of a changing hemodynamic state.
