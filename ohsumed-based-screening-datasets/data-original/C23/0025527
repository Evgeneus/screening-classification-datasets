Cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma: a clinicopathological review of 14 cases with reference to antidesmin staining and nuclear DNA patterns studied by flow cytometry.
 Among 14 patients (11 female and three male) with cutaneous and subcutaneous leiomyosarcomas, metastatic spread occurred in six of the 13 patients with adequate follow-up.
 The tumours were classified with regard to tumour grade, number of mitotic figures per 10 high-power fields, reactivity to antidesmin antibodies, and DNA pattern as assessed by flow cytometry.
 Antidesmin antibody staining was present in only six cases and seemed to be less common in the higher-grade tumours.
 The DNA pattern was aneuploid in five cases and non-classifiable in one case; all of these cases had metastatic spread.
 None of the eight remaining diploid cases had metastatic spread.
 DNA content was a strong predictor of metastatic potential.
