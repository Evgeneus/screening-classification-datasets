Conjunctival cysts in anophthalmic orbits.
 Five out of 149 patients (3%) who received an intraorbital implant to prevent or treat the disfiguring symptoms associated with the postenucleation socket syndrome developed intraorbital conjunctival cysts.
 All five patients had received a secondary implant two 14 months previously.
 After excision of the cysts four patients required additional surgery for lack of conjunctiva and/or recurrent cyst formation.
 The clinical findings, mechanism of development, and management of this rare but serious complication of socket surgery are described.
