Alterations in influence of granuloma-derived cytokines on fibrogenesis in the course of murine Schistosoma mansoni infection.
 Schistosomiasis is the main cause of hepatic fibrosis worldwide, yet its pathogenesis remains unknown.
 We previously reported that conditioned medium from cultures of hepatic egg granulomas (isolated from mice acutely infected with Schistosoma mansoni) can stimulate fibroblast proliferation and matrix production in vitro.
 We have proposed that initiation of hepatic fibrosis in this infection might be under the control of granuloma-derived cytokines.
 We now report that conditioned medium from cultures of schistosomal egg granulomas isolated from liver of chronically infected mice has reduced fibrogenic activity compared with medium from cultures of granulomas obtained from more acutely infected mice.
 In related studies, we adoptively transferred splenocytes from infected mice and examined the fibrogenic activity in culture supernatants of hepatic egg granulomas isolated from the recipients.
 Those prepared from recipients of splenocytes from chronically infected mice contained substantially less fibrogenic activity than did those from recipients of splenocytes of acutely infected mice.
 These findings suggest that the fibrogenic influence of schistosomal egg granuloma products decreases during the course of chronic murine S.
 mansoni infection.
 Furthermore, our preliminary findings suggest that immunoregulatory cells may be responsible for the down-regulation of this influence.
 Previous observations indicating that in murine schistosomiasis hepatic collagen and hyaluronate synthesis and deposition are elevated in acute but not chronic infection might be explained on the basis of our observations.
