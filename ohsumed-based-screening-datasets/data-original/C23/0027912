Prospective cohort study of prone sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome.
 Studies of the link between prone sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome have been criticised on grounds of recall bias and for not taking into account possible confounding effects.
 To avoid recall bias and to allow measurement of important biological factors a prospective cohort study of the cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is being conducted.
 The infants included are those at high risk of the syndrome as assessed by a perinatal score.
 Of the 3110 members of the cohort born between January, 1988, and end of March, 1990, 23 infants later died of SIDS.
 Sleep position information was available for 15 of these.
 Matched analysis to control for the confounding effects of infant birthweight and maternal age indicated that prone sleeping position was associated with an increased risk of SIDS (OR 4.47 95% Cl [1.30-15.43]).
 The findings are strengthened by the results of a concurrent retrospective case-control study of 42 SIDS cases in which the prone position was also associated with an increased risk of SIDS (unadjusted OR 3.45 [1.59-7.49]).
