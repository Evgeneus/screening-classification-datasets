Arthropathy of the ankle in hemophilia.
 Seventy-five patients who had hemophilia were followed clinically and roentgenographically to assess the prevalence of hemarthrosis and the prevalence and severity of arthropathy of the ankle.
 The mean age of the patients at the time of follow-up was twenty-two years and seven months.
 The patients were divided into four age-groups: less than ten years (eleven patients), ten to nineteen years (twenty-one patients), twenty to thirty years (twenty-four patients), and more than thirty years (nineteen patients).
 Intra-articular bleeding occurred more frequently in the joints of the lower extremities than in the joints of the upper extremities.
 During the second decade of life, hemarthroses occurred more often in the ankle than in the knee.
 A history of recurrent bleeding into the ankle joint, chronic synovitis, and overgrowth of the medial portion of the distal tibial epiphysis was associated with an early onset of arthropathy.
 In older patients, compression arthrodesis of the ankle joint was helpful in eliminating pain, recurrent bleeding, and equinus deformity.
