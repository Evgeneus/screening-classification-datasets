Where there is no anaesthetist....
 In an unselected series of 254 operations representing a wide range of surgical, obstetric and gynaecological procedures carried out on the small Pacific island of Tuvalu, the majority (85 per cent) involved the lower half of the body.
 In all cases but one anaesthesia was administered by a non-specialist.
 In operations below the level of the diaphragm epidural anaesthesia was usually used with a success rate of 96 per cent.
 In the upper half of the body ketamine was used where local or regional block was insufficient.
 Only one operation was performed under general inhalation anaesthesia.
 The overall postoperative mortality rate was 0.4 per cent and the morbidity rate was 13 per cent.
 Only two minor complications were attributed to the anaesthetic method used.
 In situations where anaesthetists are not available, epidural and ketamine anaesthesia in the hands of non-specialists are safe and practical options to general inhalation anaesthesia and are appropriate for most surgical procedures.
