Late potentials in progressive muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne type.
 This study describes the late potentials (LPs) obtained by signal-averaged electrocardiography (SAECG) in 66 patients with Duchenne's progressive muscular dystrophy (DMD).
 It also assesses the possible relationships between LPs and the severity of DMD, and the findings of two-dimensional echocardiography, as well as ventricular arrhythmias examined with the Holter system.
 SAECGs were performed with a Marquette MAC-1 unit.
 Based on Swinyard-Deaver's system of stages, ranging from the mildest, S1, to the most severe, S8, one patient each could be assigned to S2 and S4, 6 to S5, 20 to S6, 21 to S7, and 17 to S8.
 LPs were observed in 21 of the 66 patients (32%), including 3 of the 20 assigned to S6 (15%), 10 of the 21 in S7 (48%), and 8 of the 17 in S8 (47%).
 The total wall motion index evaluated by the method of Hegar was significantly greater in the patients with LPs (8.4 +/- 4.4) than in those without LPs (5.8 +/- 3.1) (p less than 0.05).
 The incidence of LPs was found to be higher in the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) type (8 of 12;67%) than in the normal type (9 of 41;22%) (p less than 0.01).
 The incidence of ventricular premature complexes (VPCs) was significantly higher in patients with LPs (13 of 21;62%) than in those without LPs (13 of 45;29%) (p less than 0.05).
 No sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) was observed, although nonsustained VT was noted in three patients with LPs.
 The LPs in patients with DMD were thus associated with left ventricular dysfunction, and the presence of LPs might be correlated with the extent of myocardial derangement in DMD.
