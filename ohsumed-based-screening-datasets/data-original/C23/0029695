Prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism in surgical patients.
 Venous thromboembolic disease is a common, potentially life-threatening, but preventable complication of surgery.
 Venographic studies have shown a high incidence of deep vein thrombosis in patients who do not receive prophylaxis.
 The long-term sequelae of deep vein thrombosis in these patients can be disabling, but the exact prevalence of post-thrombotic complications has not been well documented.
 Fatal pulmonary embolism has been reported in 0.5% to 1% of patients after major abdominal surgery and in 2% to 6% after total hip replacement.
 Several methods of prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism have demonstrated efficacy, but a surprising number of patients still do not receive prophylaxis.
 A medical record review in 16 hospitals recently disclosed that only 32% of high-risk patients received prophylaxis, with a range from 9% in a community hospital to 56% in a major teaching hospital.
 The possible reasons for this comparatively low rate of utilization are discussed.
 Current issues and future trends in the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism are briefly summarized.
