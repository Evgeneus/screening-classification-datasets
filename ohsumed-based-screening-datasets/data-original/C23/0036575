Quality assurance for patients with head injuries admitted to a regional trauma unit.
 The efficacy of trauma systems in reducing preventable deaths has been established but the methods of auditing care are still evolving.
 Various "audit filters" to identify which patients' charts should be reviewed have been proposed.
 An analysis of all patients admitted to the Regional Trauma Unit (RTU) over a 19-month period was conducted.
 Of 729 patients, 135 were identified as having suffered a traumatic intracranial hemorrhage (TICH).
 On review, neither delay in transfer from the emergency room to the operating room nor increasing time from the incident to the operating room correlated with increasing mortality.
 In contrast to delay, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score on admission correlated well with outcome.
 The charts of patients with anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score were reviewed, and two possibly preventable deaths were identified.
 There were 48 patients with TICH who had no operations but there were no deaths attributable to a missed operation.
 There were 76 patients for whom the GCS score at the referring hospital and the GCS score on admission to the RTU were available.
 Seven of 19 patients who worsened on transfer declined because of significant pulmonary injuries.
 Anomalous outcomes based on admission GCS score and declining GCS scores are recommended as quality assurance filters.
