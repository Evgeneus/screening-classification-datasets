Solitary expression of CD7 among T-cell antigens in acute myeloid leukemia: identification of a group of patients with similar T-cell receptor beta and delta rearrangements and course of disease suggestive of poor prognosis.
 In a series of 100 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients defined by cytochemistry and immunophenotyping, 20 expressed T-lymphocyte associated antigens on the surface of their blasts.
 While 15 expressed two or more T-cell antigens, five were found to express only CD7.
 All patients belonged to the French-American-British type M4, and four were under the age of 40.
 Despite intensive chemotherapy, four never obtained a complete remission and the fifth died of relapse after an allogenic bone marrow transplantation.
 While 12 randomly selected T-cell antigen negative AML patients showed only few rearrangements in Ig- or T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, such genetic alterations were demonstrated in four of five patients for the TCR delta gene and in all patients for the TCR beta gene.
 Interestingly, DNA fragments of similar size were demonstrated in three of five patients for both the beta and delta genes.
 These data suggest that the solitary presence of CD7 among T-cell antigens in otherwise clearcut AML cases identifies a group of patients with similarities in antigen receptor gene configuration as well as outcome.
