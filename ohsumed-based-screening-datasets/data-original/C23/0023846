Ocular manifestations of onchocerciasis in a rain forest area of west Africa.
 The epidemiology and natural history of onchocerciasis and its ocular complications in rain forest areas are poorly understood.
 The present study was conducted on a rubber plantation in a hyperendemic area in the rain forest of Liberia, West Africa, where 800 persons were examined.
 The prevalence of infection was 84% overall 29% had intraocular microfilariae, and 2.4% were blind in one or both eyes.
 Onchocerciasis was the cause of all binocular blindness and one-third of all visual impairment.
 Over half of the visual impairment caused by onchocerciasis was due to posterior segment diseases.
 Chorioretinal changes were present in 75% of people, and included intraretinal pigment clumping in 52% and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in 32%.
 Atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium was associated with increasing age and severity of infection.
 Intraretinal pigment was strongly associated with anterior uveitis.
 There was a strong correlation between uveitis and the inflammatory chorioretinal sequelae: retinitis, intraretinal pigment, subretinal fibrosis, and optic neuropathy.
 These findings indicate that considerable visual impairment associated with rain forest onchocerciasis is common and is due largely to chorioretinal disease.
