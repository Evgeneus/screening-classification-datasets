Submucous resection of the nasal septum as an outpatient procedure.
 We report our experience of submucous resection of the nasal septum under local anaesthesia as an outpatient procedure.
 We have audited 50 consecutive cases and compared the results with a similar group of patients in whom the operation was carried out in the usual way under general anaesthesia.
 We have found the procedure to be safe, effective and economically advantageous.
