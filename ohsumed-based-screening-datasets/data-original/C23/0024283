Pathophysiology of sciatica.
 The exact pathophysiologic mechanisms behind sciatica are incompletely known; however, compression of spinal nerve roots is known to be correlated to both pain and neural dysfunction in a segmental distribution of that specific nerve root.
 Compression per se may impair the transport of nutrients to the nerve tissue in such a way that affects the nerve root function.
 There also might be a local affect on nerve roots or root sleeves by substances leaking from the degenerated intervertebral discs.
