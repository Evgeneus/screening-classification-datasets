Severe tricuspid regurgitation after mitral valve repair: diagnosis by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography.
 Transesophageal echocardiography facilitates the evaluation of valvular repair in the operating room.
 The functional valvular morphology and degree of valvular regurgitation can be assessed before and after repair.
 This technique can also identify unsuspected findings--in this case, severe tricuspid regurgitation complicating cardiopulmonary bypass.
 We report a previously undescribed cause of traumatic tricuspid regurgitation.
