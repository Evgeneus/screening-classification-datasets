Monitoring, reentry, and relapse prevention for chemically dependent health care professionals.
 Monitoring and reentry programs for chemically dependent health care professionals are increasingly being recognized as important components of recovery efforts targeted at this population.
 Such monitoring and preventive programs should incorporate certain eligibility requirements, patient-monitoring program contracts, recovery maintenance activities and adjuncts, work-site assessments and reentry recommendations, random body fluid analysis, relapse management, and clear explanations of financial responsibility.
 Monitoring and reentry programs need to be fully integrated within the spectrum of resources available to health care professionals.
