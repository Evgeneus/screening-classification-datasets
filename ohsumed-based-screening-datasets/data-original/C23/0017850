Coronary artery fistula formation secondary to permanent pacemaker placement.
 We present the findings in two patients who apparently developed a coronary artery fistula as a complication of an endocardial pacing electrode.
 This complication may actually be occurring more frequently than recognized because the patient may be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic and therefore not undergo a coronary angiogram.
 Awareness of this potentially serious complication is important and stresses the need for proper electrode placement without excess pressure on the tip.
