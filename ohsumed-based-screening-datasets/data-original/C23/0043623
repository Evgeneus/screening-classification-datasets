Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants do not change the prevalence of necrosis and regeneration in mdx skeletal muscles.
 Therapeutic doses of methylprednisolone, azathioprine, cyclosporin A, and cyclophosphamide administered to mdx mice between 15 and 45 days of age failed to significantly influence the time course and prevalence of necrosis and regeneration or serum creatine kinase activity.
 This finding contrasts with previously reported findings of beneficial effects of glucocorticoids in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
 This may indicate that, mechanisms upon which beneficial effects of glucocorticoids depend in DMD, do not operate (sufficiently) in mdx mice.
