Storage of saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol-suspended red cells in a new plastic container: polyvinylchloride plasticized with butyryl-n-trihexyl-citrate.
 Blood collection and component preparation have been performed in integrally connected multiple plastic containers made with a new plastic.
 This polyvinylchloride (PVC) container plasticized with butyryl-n-trihexyl-citrate (BTHC) is a new material for blood storage; it contains no di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP).
 After removal of plasma and buffy coat, the red cells were suspended in saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol (SAGM) medium.
 After 42-day refrigerator storage, the total adenine nucleotide concentration remained the same as the initial concentration in the red cells, whereas ATP levels had decreased to 61 percent of the initial value.
 The 2,3 DPG concentration was 62 percent of normal on Day 7 and 21 percent on Day 14.
 Glucose consumption, lactate production, potassium leakage from red cells, and pH levels were similar to those found after storage in DEHP-plasticized containers under the same conditions.
 After 42 days, hemolysis levels were 0.56 +/- 0.21 percent and 0.42 +/- 0.17 percent in two series of units mixed weekly and 0.70 +/- 0.27 percent in units stored unmixed.
 Although even higher levels of hemolysis were observed in the units stored unmixed and used for 24-hour posttransfusion survival, the autologous red cell recovery results were excellent (83.2 +/- 5.1%, n = 8).
 BTHC-plasticized PVC is found to be a suitable material for 42-day storage of red cells in SAGM solution.
