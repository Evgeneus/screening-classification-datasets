The significance of antibody to hepatitis C virus in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
 We assessed the prevalence and clinical significance of antibodies to hepatitis C virus among a cohort of 148 patients with chronic hepatitis B virus infection.
 Sixteen patients (11%) had anti-hepatitis C virus detectable by enzyme-linked immunoassay.
 The results from eight of these patients were positive by recombinant immunoblot assay.
 The results of recombinant immunoblot assay testing were not consistent; therefore the analysis of the patients' data was based on anti-hepatitis C virus enzyme-linked immunoassay results.
 Patients with chronic hepatitis B with anti-hepatitis C virus were more likely to be cirrhotic (44% vs.
 21%) and to have decompensated liver disease (24% vs.
 6%).
 Hepatitis B virus replication appeared to be suppressed in patients with both infections as measured by hepatitis B virus-associated DNA polymerase activity (mean = 2,055 vs.
 2,555 cpm).
 Human immunodeficiency virus infection was more common in the anti-hepatitis C virus positive group (36% vs.
 11%).
 Thus hepatitis C virus appears to suppress hepatitis B virus replication and to cause more severe liver disease in patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.
