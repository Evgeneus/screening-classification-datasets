Recent trends in cesarean section use in California.
 Cesarean section use in the United States has increased to 24.7% of deliveries in 1988 and is the most common hospital surgical procedure.
 California cesarean section rates were examined to measure recent trends in obstetric practices and to project future patterns of cesarean section use.
 Using discharge abstracts from 1983 to 1987 California hospital deliveries, total cesarean section rates were found to increase from nearly 22% in 1983 to 25% in 1987, an increase of 15%.
 Using a series of least-squares regression models, time trends in the distribution of indications associated with cesarean section among all deliveries and indication-specific cesarean section rates were evaluated.
 Increases in the number of women with previous cesarean section and fetal distress contributed to rising cesarean section rates.
 In addition, indication-specific cesarean section rates increased for breech presentation and dystocia.
 These trends were counterbalanced, in part, by declining rates of repeat cesarean sections.
 Trends noted for July 1985 through 1987 did not differ substantially from those observed for January 1983 to June 1985, suggesting that recent policy attempts to alter cesarean section use have not had a measurable effect on existing trends.
 Projections suggest that California cesarean section rates will rise to a level of 34% by the year 2000.
