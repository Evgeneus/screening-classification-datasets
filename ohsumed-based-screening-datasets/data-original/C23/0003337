Malignant left-sided large bowel obstruction managed by subtotal/total colectomy.
 Of 60 patients presenting with acute obstructing carcinoma of the left colon, 49 underwent immediate resection either by radical subtotal/total colectomy (31 patients, group I) or by radical segmental resection (18 patients, group II) of whom three had immediate anastomosis after on-table bowel irrigation and 15 had a planned staged procedure.
 The operative mortality rate was 3 per cent in group I and 11 per cent in group II (not a statistically significant difference).
 However, substantial differences were found for major morbidity (6 versus 44 per cent in groups I and II respectively; P less than 0.01) and mean length of hospital stay (17 days in group I versus 35 days in group II; P less than 0.05).
 All three patients who had on-table lavage developed anastomotic leaks which necessitated a second operation to form a stoma.
 Six patients (19 per cent) in group I required antidiarrhoeal medication in the immediate postoperative period.
 However, subsequent improvement in stool frequency was noted in all patients.
 It is concluded that subtotal/total colectomy is an acceptable means of managing patients with obstructing carcinoma of the left colon in that it is associated with a low morbidity and mortality rate and good functional results.
