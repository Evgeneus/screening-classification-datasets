Inflammatory edema induced by interactions between IL-1 and the neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide.
 The neuropeptide calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is a potent vasodilator with a long duration of action.
 CGRP is widely distributed and is present in perivascular nerves of tissues that include skin and the synovium.
 In this study we have investigated the possibility that CGRP can modulate the inflammatory actions of the cytokine IL-1 by using an inflammatory model in rabbit skin.
 The intradermal injection of IL-1 (1.4 x 10(-14) mol/site) alone stimulated little edema formation.
 However, when IL-1 was injected with CGRP (10(-11) mol/site), a highly significant edema was observed, and neutrophil accumulation induced by IL-1 was potentiated.
 These results suggest that the action of IL-1 as a potent mediator of increased microvascular permeability is only observed when skin blood flow is increased in this model.
 This was confirmed by experiments in which PGE2 (3 x 10(-9) mol/site) at a dose with a similar duration of vasodilator action as CGRP (10(-11) mol/site) also potentiated edema induced by IL-1.
 Further experiments investigated the mechanism by which IL-1 increased microvascular permeability.
 Edema induced by IL-1 was dependent on de novo protein synthesis and the presence of circulating neutrophils.
 However, selective platelet-activating factor and histamine H1 antagonists had no inhibitory effect on this response.
 Thus it appears that when a microvascular bed is dilated by the long-lasting vasodilator CGRP, edema induced by IL-1 is clearly observed.
 These results highlight a potentially important synergistic interaction between cytokines and neuropeptides in inflammation.
