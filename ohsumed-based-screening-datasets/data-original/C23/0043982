Lung function in school-age children who had mild lower respiratory illnesses in early childhood.
 We examined the relationship between patterns of mild lower respiratory illness (LRI) experienced in early childhood and lung function in 89 boys and 70 girls 6 to 18 yr of age.
 The children's histories of outpatient visits for wheezing and nonwheezing LRI during the first 6 yr of life had been documented by physicians in a single pediatric practice.
 Most children were reported by their parents to have been free of recurrent respiratory symptoms during the 2 yr prior to lung function testing.
 In sex-specific analyses, average lung function assessed by spirometry was similar in children who had made zero or one physician visit for wheezing LRI during the preschool years.
 Boys who had experienced two or more episodes of wheezing LRI during the preschool years had lower average FEV1, FEV1/FVC, FEF25-75, Vmax50, and Vmax75 than did boys who had zero or one preschool wheezing illness.
 The association between recurrent preschool wheezing LRI and later lung function remained after exclusion of data from seven boys who were reported to have wheezed in the 2 yr prior to study.
 Girls who had experienced two or more preschool wheezing LRI had lower average FEF25-75 and Vmax50 than girls with a history of zero or one such illness, but differences were not statistically significant.
 Recurrent nonwheezing LRI during the preschool years was not significantly associated with subsequent lung function in either sex, regardless of preschool wheezing LRI history.
 Detailed information concerning early childhood LRI experience is valuable in epidemiologic studies of factors influencing lung function in children.
