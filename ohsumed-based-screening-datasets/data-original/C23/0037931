Motor variables correlated with the hand-to-mouth maneuver in stroke patients.
 This study investigated the relationship between each of three independent variables and the completion of the hand-to-mouth maneuver in 23 hemiparetic stroke patients.
 The independent variables were elbow-extensor muscle tone (graded using the Modified Ashworth Scale); active elbow-flexion range-of-motion deficit measured without the influence of gravity; and elbow-flexion strength measured without the influence of gravity with a hand-held dynamometer.
 The hand-to-mouth maneuver was graded according to the degree of completion using a three-level ordinal scale.
 Spearman (rs) correlations demonstrated a significant relationship between the extent of completion of the hand-to-mouth maneuver and both the active elbow-flexion-range deficit (rs = -.853) and the elbow-flexor muscle force (rs = .829).
 The correlation of the maneuver with elbow-extensor muscle tone (rs = -.063) was not significant, but the relationship may have been influenced by the fact that only a minority of subjects had elevated tone, and that elevation was minimal.
 The result suggest that both active-movement deficits and muscle strength may be important to upper extremity function.
