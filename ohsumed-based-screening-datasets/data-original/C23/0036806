Microangiopathy of the brain, retina, and ear: improvement without immunosuppressive therapy.
 We describe a pregnant young woman with branch retinal arteriolar occlusions, encephalopathy, and hearing loss in whom we demonstrated a patent foramen ovale.
 She improved while receiving anticoagulants and no immunosuppressive therapy.
 The microangiopathic syndrome of retinopathy, encephalopathy, and deafness may be due to a disturbance of coagulation and/or microembolism.
