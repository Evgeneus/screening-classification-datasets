Ocular defects in infants of extremely low birth weight and low gestational age.
 The eyes of 49 babies who weighed less than 1,000 g at birth or who were born at or before 28 weeks gestation were examined at the age of 4 years.
 Twenty-one children were normal.
 The remaining 29 children (59%) had ocular abnormalities which ranged from mild amblyopia to blindness from retinopathy of prematurity.
 The need to examine children at risk is stressed.
