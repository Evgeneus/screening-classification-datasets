Surgical and prosthesis-related complications using the Groningen button voice prosthesis.
 Prosthesis-assisted tracheoesophageal speech has advanced speech rehabilitation appreciably.
 However, the surgical technique and the use of a prosthesis may give rise to complications.
 In a retrospective study on 132 consecutive patients rehabilitated with a Groningen button voice prosthesis, the complications were assessed, the average follow-up being 21 months.
 Surgical complications were not observed.
 Prosthesis-related complications, which were encountered in 28%, were all of a minor nature and mainly consisted of granulation formation and hypertrophic scarring; these appeared to be easily treatable.
 The complications found were few and insignificant in comparison with reports in the literature.
 This may be attributed to the uncomplicated surgical procedure for the insertion of the Groningen button.
 Moreover, the prosthesis is self-retaining and requires hardly any care from the patient.
 Permanent removal of the prosthesis usually requires surgical closure, which is a simple procedure performed under local anaesthesia.
