Laser angioplasty: results of a prospective, multicenter study at 3-year follow-up.
 A prospective multicenter trial was initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of laser angioplasty.
 Laser recanalization was performed in 338 patients with arteriosclerotic femoropopliteal artery occlusions (average length, 8.5 cm).
 Neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet lasers were used in combination with sapphire probe catheters.
 The initial recanalization rate was 85%.
 Complications were observed in 14% of the patients.
 Emergency surgery was required in 1.5%.
 The cumulative long-term patency rate of the successfully recanalized arteries was 80%, 70%, 62%, and 57% at 6 months, 1 year, and 2 and 3 years, respectively.
 The patency rates were not affected by the length of the occlusion and the long-term medication (platelet inhibition vs anticoagulation), but patients with a normal runoff had significantly better patency rates than those with reduced runoff (63% vs 52%, P less than .01).
 The study has shown that laser-assisted angioplasty is safe and at least as effective as conventional angioplasty.
