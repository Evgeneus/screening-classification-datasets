Down syndrome due to de novo Robertsonian translocation t(14q;21q): DNA polymorphism analysis suggests that the origin of the extra 21q is maternal.
 Down syndrome is rarely due to a de novo Robertsonian translocation t(14q;21q).
 DNA polymorphisms in eight families with Down syndrome due to de novo t(14q;21q) demonstrated maternal origin of the extra chromosome 21q in all cases.
 In seven nonmosaic cases the DNA markers showed crossing-over between two maternal chromosomes 21, and in one mosaic case no crossing-over was observed (this case was probably due to an early postzygotic nondisjunction).
 In the majority of cases (five of six informative families) the proximal marker D21S120 was reduced to homozygosity in the offspring with trisomy 21.
 The data can be best explained by chromatid translocation in meiosis I and by normal crossover and segregation in meiosis I and meiosis II.
