Delayed facial nerve palsy after temporal lobectomy for epilepsy: report of four cases and discussion of possible mechanisms.
 Four cases of idiopathic peripheral facial nerve palsy were documented after 110 consecutive resections of the temporal lobe for intractable epilepsy.
 In 3 of the 4 cases, the palsy was ipsilateral to the side of the temporal lobectomy.
 The onset of facial weakness was delayed 7 to 13 days after surgery (mean, 9.7 days).
 One patient underwent facial electroneurography, which documented 17% of normal facial motor function at the height of his weakness and the absence of the acoustic stapedius reflex.
 All patients were treated with prednisone (60-80 mg per day by mouth for 10-14 days, tapering off throughout the subsequent week).
 Facial function recovered fully in all patients within 6 to 8 weeks.
 Possible mechanisms are discussed, including heat and/or mechanical trauma to the facial nerve near the geniculate ganglion during resection of mesial temporal lobe structures.
