New surgical approach to complicated gastroesophageal reflux disease: transthoracic parietal cell vagotomy.
 Surgical treatment of peptic stricture of the esophagus associated with columnar (Barrett) metaplasia can be a difficult problem.
 Collis-Nissen fundoplication restores an intraabdominal antireflux barrier for most cases of peptic stricture; however, 20% of patients may have persistence of pathological acid reflux.
 By reducing acidity of postoperative reflux, parietal cell vagotomy may complement nonresectional surgical results for Barrett stricture.
