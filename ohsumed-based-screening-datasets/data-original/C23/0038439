Comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment of chronic pain: a follow-up study of treated and non-treated groups.
 There are relatively few outcome studies of multidisciplinary chronic pain programs which have utilized no-treatment comparison groups.
 The present study compared a group of chronic pain patients (N = 42) treated in a comprehensive multidisciplinary pain program with a group of patients (N = 15) who were evaluated but not treated.
 Comparisons were made at evaluation and at a follow-up period averaging 11 months later.
 From evaluation to discharge, the treated group showed significant increases in physical functioning.
 From evaluation to long-term follow-up, both the treated and non-treated groups showed significant decreases in self-report pain ratings and interference with activities ratings.
 However, only the treated group showed a significant decrease in addictive medication use and increase in work functioning.
 The return-to-work rate for the treated group was 48% with an additional 28% of the patients being returned to vocational rehabilitation.
 None of the non-treated group returned to work or vocational rehabilitation.
 Results are discussed in terms of their support for the conclusion that comprehensive multidisciplinary pain programs produce marked subjective and functional changes.
