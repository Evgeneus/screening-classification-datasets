Catheter-less suprapubic cystolithotomy in children.
 Bladder stones in children are common in developing countries and the procedure of choice for their removal is suprapubic cystolithotomy.
 It is standard practice to drain the bladder for a few days post-operatively to prevent urinary leakage.
 We have observed that, if the bladder is closed meticulously in 2 layers, bladder drainage by means of a catheter is not required.
 We have analysed 86 children treated by suprapubic cystolithotomy without a catheter.
 Size of the stones and intra-operative findings were noted and it was found that 85% of the patients had an excellent result; 10% had a satisfactory result and 4.7% were unsatisfactory.
 The advantages of the procedure and selection of the patients are discussed.
