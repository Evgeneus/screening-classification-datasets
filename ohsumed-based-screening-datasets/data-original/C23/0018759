Posttraumatic cortical blindness: are we missing the diagnosis in children?
 A potential etiology of anxiety and agitation in the posthead trauma patient is cortical blindness.
 Cortical blindness can be seen after both mild and severe head trauma.
 Early recognition and understanding of this syndrome can lead to a decreased anxiety level, not only for the patient, but for the parents as well.
 Two cases of posttraumatic cortical blindness are presented.
 The signs and symptoms of cortical blindness, its presentation, diagnosis, and outcome are discussed.
 The available literature is reviewed and discussed.
