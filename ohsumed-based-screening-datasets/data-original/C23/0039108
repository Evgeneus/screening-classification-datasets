Descending thoracic aortofemoral bypass as an alternative for aortoiliac revascularization.
 We performed descending thoracic aorta to femoral bypass in six selected patients over the past four years.
 An alternative inflow source was selected because the standard transabdominal approach was contraindicated or considered hazardous.
 The inflow consisted of a single Dacron tube from the descending thoracic aorta to the left groin, and a femorofemoral bypass to the right groin.
 There was no operative mortality or major morbidity related to the surgical procedure.
 After an average follow-up of 17.1 months (range 6 to 23 months), all thoracofemoral grafts remained patent.
 One patient had repeated occlusions of the femorofemoral graft related to right lower extremity outflow disease, while the remaining five crossover grafts are patent.
 One patient died 22 months postoperatively from a myocardial infarct, with a patent bypass.
 Although this series represents a small group of patients, we feel that descending thoracic aortofemoral bypass offers excellent inflow and reliable patency, and is a good alternative when reoperation on the abdominal aorta is undesirable.
 This procedure may also be considered for conversion of an axillofemoral bypass that has failed repeatedly.
