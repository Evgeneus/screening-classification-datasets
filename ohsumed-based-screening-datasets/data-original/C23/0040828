Dose-dependent inhibition of stretch-induced arrhythmias by gadolinium in isolated canine ventricles. Evidence for a unique mode of antiarrhythmic action.
 Transient diastolic dilatation of the isolated canine left ventricle predictably elicits arrhythmias.
 To test the hypothesis that such arrhythmias may be mediated by sarcolemmal stretch-activated channels, we attempted to inhibit stretch-induced arrhythmias with gadolinium (Gd3+), a potent stretch-activated channel blocker.
 In experiments with six isolated canine hearts, left ventricular volume was increased for 50 msec during early diastole and then returned to initial volume by a computerized servopump.
 The stretch volume was adjusted to yield a probability of eliciting a stretch-induced arrhythmia of 95 +/- 2% before treatment with Gd3+.
 When Gd3+ (1-10 microM) was administered, dose-dependent suppression of stretch-induced arrhythmias was observed.
 The probability of a stretch-induced arrhythmia was reduced to 13 +/- 10% (p less than 0.05) with 10 microM Gd3+.
 Washout of Gd3+ completely reversed this effect.
 Since Gd3+ is known to be a calcium channel antagonist, we compared the effect of Gd3+ on stretch-induced arrhythmias with that of verapamil and nifedipine.
 These calcium channel blockers produced no demonstrable inhibition of stretch-induced arrhythmias when administered at concentrations (1 microM) that substantially depressed left ventricular pressure development.
 Thus, our results indirectly implicate stretch-activated channels in the genesis of stretch-induced arrhythmias and provide preliminary evidence for a potential new mode of antiarrhythmic drug action--blockade of stretch-activated channels.
