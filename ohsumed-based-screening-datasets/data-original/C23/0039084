Time course of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction after endotoxin infusion in unanesthetized sheep.
 Endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] has been reported to reduce hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and thus increases venous admixture.
 The time course of this failure of pulmonary blood flow regulation was investigated in six chronically instrumented unanesthetized sheep after infusion of Escherichia coli LPS (1 microgram/kg).
 The change in left pulmonary arterial blood flow (LPBF, ultrasonic transit time) in response to unilateral lung hypoxia (10 min of N2 alternately to the left and right lungs) was compared before and at various time intervals after the administration of LPS.
 During baseline conditions, LPBF was 33% of total cardiac output and decreased to 15% when the left lung was ventilated with a hypoxic gas mixture.
 One hour after endotoxin infusion, LPBF remained at 33% of total cardiac output yet only decreased to 28% during the hypoxic challenge.
 The response to one-lung hypoxia was still significantly depressed 10 h post-LPS administration.
 It is concluded that hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction is almost completely abolished for a prolonged time period after a small dose of LPS.
