Post-traumatic basal ganglia hemorrhage: analysis of 52 patients with emphasis on the final outcome.
 A series of 52 patients suffering post-traumatic basal ganglia hemorrhage (BGH) after closed head injury is reviewed.
 Post-traumatic BGH was associated with other intracranial lesions in most cases.
 The outcome in this series is rather good, with 53.8% of patients having a functional survival.
 Radiologically, the post-traumatic intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and brainstem hemorrhage usually coexisted with a poor outcome.
 Old age (greater than 60), abnormal pupil reaction, impaired oculocephalic response, and abnormal motor response to pain stimuli are reliable clinical hallmarks for poor prognosis.
