Renal O2 consumption during progressive hemorrhage.
 Most mammalian tissues regulate O2 utilization such that O2 consumption (VO2) is relatively constant at O2 delivery (DO2) higher than a critical value (DO2c).
 We studied the relationship between VO2 and DO2 of kidney and whole body during graded progressive exsanguination.
 The relationship between whole body VO2 and DO2 was biphasic, and whole body VO2 decreased by 5.6 +/- 14.4% (P = NS) from the initial value to the value nearest whole body DO2c.
 Kidney DO2 decreased in direct proportion to whole body DO2 such that the average R2 value describing the linear regression of kidney DO2 vs.
 whole body DO2 was 0.94 +/- 0.02.
 The relationship between kidney, like whole body, VO2 and DO2 appeared biphasic; however, kidney VO2 decreased by 63.3 +/- 10.4% (P less than 0.0001) from the initial value to the value nearest kidney DO2c.
 Renal O2 extraction ratio was relatively constant over a wide range of kidney DO2, whereas whole body O2 extraction ratio increased progressively at all whole body DO2 values as whole body DO2 decreased.
 However, final values of O2 extraction ratio were indistinguishable for whole body (0.86 +/- 0.1) and kidney (0.86 +/- 0.06) (P = NS).
 We conclude that the pattern of kidney and whole body VO2 response to decreasing DO2 differs during hemorrhage, particularly in the range of DO2 normally associated with tissue wellness.
