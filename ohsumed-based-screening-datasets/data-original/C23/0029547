Quantification of ST-segment changes during coronary angioplasty in patients with left bundle branch block.
 Electrocardiographic manifestations of ischemia are difficult to interpret in the presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB).
 Recently developed techniques allow continuous computerized digital analysis of ST segments that can be zeroed to the patient's own baseline electrocardiogram even if that baseline is abnormal conduction.
 With use of this technology, ST-segment changes during balloon coronary occlusion were compared in 10 patients with LBBB versus an age-, sex-, and coronary anatomy-matched population of 20 control subjects with normal baseline conduction.
 ST-segment deviation of greater than or equal to 1 mm from baseline was present in 80% of patients with LBBB and in 75% of control patients (difference not significant).
 There was no significant difference between patients with LBBB versus control patients in maximal ST-segment deviation (2.6 +/- 1.7 vs 2.0 +/- 1.0 mm) or in ST-segment deviation measured after 60 seconds of occlusion (2.4 +/- 1.3 vs 1.8 +/- 1.1 mm).
 ST-segment deviation reached 1 mm more quickly in patients with LBBB (33 +/- 11 seconds) than in control subjects (60 +/- 36 seconds) (p = 0.003).
 It is concluded that ST-segment analysis is feasible in patients with LBBB using digital self-referenced ST analysis and may provide important clinical information regarding the presence of myocardial ischemia.
