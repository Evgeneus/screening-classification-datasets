Minimal role of xanthine oxidase and oxygen free radicals in rat renal tubular reoxygenation injury.
 The role of xanthine oxidase and oxygen free radicals in postischemic reperfusion injury in the rat kidney remains controversial.
 Proximal tubules, the focal segment affected by ischemic renal injury, were isolated in bulk, assayed for xanthine oxidase activity, and subjected to 60 min of anoxia or hypoxia and 60 min of reoxygenation to evaluate the participation of xanthine oxidase and oxygen radicals in proximal tubule reoxygenation injury.
 The total xanthine oxidase in isolated rat proximal tubules was 1.1 mU/mg of protein, approximately 30% to 40% of the activity found in rat intestine and liver.
 Lactate dehydrogenase release, an indicator of irreversible cell damage, increased substantially during anoxia (39.8 +/- 2.3 versus 9.8 +/- 1.8% in controls) with an additional 8 to 12% release during reoxygenation.
 Addition of 0.2 mM allopurinol, a potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, and dimethylthiourea, a hydroxyl radical scavenger, failed to protect against the reoxygenation lactate dehydrogenase release.
 Analysis of xanthine oxidase substrate levels after anoxia and flux rates during reoxygenation indicates that hypoxanthine and xanthine concentrations are in a 15-fold excess over the enzyme Km and 0.3 mU/mg of protein of xanthine oxidase activity exists during reoxygenation.
 Hypoxic tubule suspensions had a minimal lactate dehydrogenase release during hypoxia and failed to demonstrate accelerated injury upon reoxygenation.
 In conclusion, although xanthine oxidase is present and active during reoxygenation in isolated rat proximal tubules, oxygen radicals did not mediate reoxygenation injury.
