CHLVPP chemotherapy with involved-field irradiation for Hodgkin's disease: favorable results with acceptable toxicity.
 Patients with Hodgkin's disease who were previously untreated with chemotherapy received the chlorambucil, vinblastine, procarbazine, and prednisone (CHLVPP) regimen plus limited involved-field radiation therapy for treatment of Hodgkin's disease through the Nebraska Lymphoma Study Group.
 One hundred patients, 87 with newly diagnosed Hodgkin's disease and 13 who relapsed after receiving previous radiation therapy, were treated with this regimen between 1982 and 1989.
 Complete remissions (CRs) were obtained in 88 of 100 patients (88%), and there have been a total of eight relapses.
 The overall 3-year failure-free survival was 76%, with good-prognosis patients (ie, Karnofsky performance status greater than or equal to 80) having a 3-year failure-free survival of 87%.
 Toxicity with this regimen was minimal, with neutropenic fevers reported in 13% of the patient population, moderate alopecia in 5%, and mild to moderate nausea and vomiting in 11% of the patients.
 As primary induction therapy for Hodgkin's disease, CHLVPP is an effective regimen with a high patient acceptance profile.
