Mechanisms of tubulointerstitial fibrosis.
 With regard to tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis we are left with a variety informational gaps regarding nearly all aspects of this clinically important process.
 Table 2 summarizes a generalized version of fibrogenesis based primarily on investigations in other organs.
 Extrapolation of data obtained with other fibrogenic systems is useful, but only in so far as it motivates us to adapt and test many of the experimental principles within in the context of the kidney.
 This begins with a comprehensive examination of the in vivo state, the establishment of adequate animal models, and the dissections of the process in vitro.
 Key areas for the future are the characterization of the signals involved, the cellular responses to these signals, and the variations in interactions produced by differing inciting fibrogenic conditions.
