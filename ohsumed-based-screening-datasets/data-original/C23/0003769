Electrocardiographic J waves after resuscitation from cardiac arrest.
 A patient was monitored prior to, during, and after cardiac arrest with a Holter monitor and an electrocardiograph.
 The arrest occurred without any premonitory signs on the ECG.
 At the onset of the arrest, torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia occurred, which quickly degenerated into ventricular fibrillation.
 After a successful second defibrillation, the patient developed Osborn waves, which subsided within a few minutes.
