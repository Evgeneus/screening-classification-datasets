Surgical outcome in 435 patients who sustained missile head wounds during the Iran-Iraq War.
 Variables important in predicting the final postsurgical outcome of 435 patients who sustained missile head wounds during the Iran-Iraq War were evaluated over a 99-month period.
 The type of projectile, site of injury, and presence or absence of foreign material did not seem to have a significant effect on the final outcome.
 Of the patients with a perforating type of injury, 48.8% had a poor surgical outcome as compared with 19.9% with a penetrating type and 15.6% with a tangential type.
 This difference is statistically significant (chi 2 = 14.7 and 17.1, respectively; p less than 0.001).
 The most important factor in predicting overall outcome was the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score at the time of admission.
 Mortality and morbidity contributing to a poor surgical outcome were noted in only 6% of patients with a GCS score at admission of 13 to 15, in 24.6% of those with a GCS score of 9 to 12, in 57% of those with a GCS score of 6 to 8, and in 65% of those with a GCS score of 3 to 5.
 Of the 71 patients who died, 75% had a score of 3 to 8.
 Perforating projectiles or those traversing two or more dural compartments were statistically significant in contributing to mortality and morbidity (chi 2 = 17.2; p less than 0.001).
 The incidence of focal neurological deficit was 100, 90.6, 88, and 52.2% in patients with GCS scores of 3 to 5, 6 to 8, 9 to 12, and 13 to 15, respectively.
 The two best predictors of mortality in this group of patients were a low GCS score and infection.
