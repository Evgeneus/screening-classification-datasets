Ventricular arrhythmias in children with an apparently normal heart.
 Ventricular ectopy occurs frequently in normal children.
 In the presence of a normal heart, these arrhythmias, including asymptomatic, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, carry a benign prognosis and are not associated with sudden, unexpected death.
 However, complex ventricular arrhythmias frequently indicate the presence of underlying cardiac disease; patients with such arrhythmias must undergo an appropriately thorough evaluation before decisions regarding prognosis and the need for therapy can be made.
