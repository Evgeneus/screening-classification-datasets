Preventing upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients receiving nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs.
 Severe upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding is a serious adverse effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and the elderly are at increased risk of developing this complication.
 Bleeding episodes can be prevented.
 Replacing NSAIDs with acetaminophen may be appropriate when a simple analgesic is needed that eliminates the risk of GI bleeding.
 Using the lowest effective NSAID dose may decrease the incidence and severity of NSAID gastropathy.
 Histamine H2-receptor antagonists, sucralfate, and misoprostol have been studied for the prevention of NSAID gastropathy, but only misoprostol prevents mucosal injury in both the stomach and duodenum.
 Patients who have a history of peptic ulcer disease or gastric bleeding from NSAIDs are candidates for prophylactic measures.
 Although other patients are at risk, no one knows who should receive prophylactic therapy for NSAID gastropathy.
 Future studies should attempt to define patient populations that warrant prophylactic therapy.
