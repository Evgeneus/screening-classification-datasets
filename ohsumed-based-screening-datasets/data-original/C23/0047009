Gold-associated lymphadenopathy in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. Histologic and scanning electron microscopic features.
 The histologic features of adenopathy associated with intramuscular injections of gold sodium thiomalate in a woman with rheumatoid arthritis are presented.
 We believe that the light microscopic features of the above process are sufficiently distinctive that a diagnosis of gold-associated lymphadenopathy could be rendered.
 A review of the literature revealed no descriptions of the light microscopic appearance of gold in lymph nodes.
 In this case, the diagnosis of gold-associated lymphadenopathy was confirmed by scanning electron microscopic studies.
