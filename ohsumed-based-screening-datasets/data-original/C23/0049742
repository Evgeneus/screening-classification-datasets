Lumbar epidural diamorphine following thoracic surgery. A comparison of infusion and bolus administration.
 Twenty-two patients received a single dose of diamorphine 5 mg through a lumbar epidural catheter before thoracic surgery.
 The patients were transferred after surgery to a high dependency unit where they were allocated randomly to receive either an infusion of epidural diamorphine at a rate of 1 mg/hour (group 1) or bolus doses of epidural diamorphine 5 mg on demand (group 2).
 There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in visual analogue pain scores in the first 18 postoperative hours.
 Arterial carbon dioxide tension was elevated in both groups and was consistently higher in group 1 than in group 2, with a statistically significant intergroup difference 12 hours after operation.
 Respiratory rate was not a useful index of respiratory depression.
 The commonest nonrespiratory side effect was urinary retention, but the incidences of this and other minor side effects were similar in the two groups.
