Tolerance of gastric mucosal flap to postoperative irradiation.
 When malignant lesions of the oral cavity, base of tongue, and oropharynx are treated with radical resection, adequate reconstruction is required.
 The free gastric mucosal flap with microvascular transfer is being used with increasing frequency at Washington University Medical Center.
 Because of the advanced nature of the primary lesions, most patients also require postoperative radiation therapy.
 In this paper the tolerance of the gastric mucosal flap to postoperative radiation therapy is reviewed.
 The changes resulting from radiation therapy in the mucosal flap were found to be acceptable, and no major complications were encountered.
