Cloning of a cellular factor, interleukin binding factor, that binds to NFAT-like motifs in the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat.
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) gene expression is regulated by both general transcription factors and factors induced by activation of T lymphocytes such as NF-kappa B and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT).
 Within the HIV long terminal repeat (LTR), two purine-rich domains between nucleotides -283 and -195 have homology to a regulatory region found in the interleukin 2 promoter, which binds NFAT and other cellular factors.
 In the HIV LTR, this region has been demonstrated to have both positive and negative regulatory effects on HIV gene expression.
 In an attempt to clone genes encoding cellular factors that bind to these NFAT-like elements in the HIV LTR, we used lambda gt11 expression cloning with oligonucleotides corresponding to these binding motifs.
 A ubiquitously expressed cDNA encoding a 60-kDa protein, which we termed interleukin binding factor (ILF), binds specifically to these purine-rich motifs in the HIV LTR.
 This factor also binds to similar purine-rich motifs in the interleukin 2 promoter, through with lower affinity than to HIV LTR sequences.
 Sequence analysis reveals that the DNA binding domain of ILF has strong homology to the recently described fork head DNA binding domain found in the Drosophila homeotic protein fork head and a family of hepatocyte nuclear factors, HNF-3.
 Other domains found in ILF include a nucleotide binding site, an N-glycosylation motif, a signal for ubiquitin-mediated degradation, and a potential nuclear localization signal.
 These results describe a DNA binding protein that may be involved in both positive and negative regulation of important viral and cellular promoter elements.
