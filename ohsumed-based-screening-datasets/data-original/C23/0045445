Prostacyclin production by blood-contacting surfaces of endothelialized vascular prostheses.
 This study examines prostacyclin production by blood-contacting surfaces within woven vascular prostheses of polydioxanone (PDS), polyglactin 910 (PG910), or Dacron interposed into rabbit infrarenal aortas.
 Grafts and normal aortic segments were explanted after 1, 3, and 6 months for pulsatile perfusion with Medium-199 for 60 minutes.
 Aliquots were removed serially for 6-keto-PGF1 alpha assay.
 After 30 minutes sodium arachidonate (10 micrograms/ml) was added.
 Specimens were studied by light microscopy, SEM and TEM.
 Patency in all three groups exceeded 90%.
 All three showed re-endothelialization at one month.
 Normal aorta produced low basal 6-keto-PGF1 alpha with a marked evanescent post arachidonate increase.
 Dacron did not differ from normal aorta.
 PG910 and PDS both produced significantly less 6-keto-PGF1 alpha post arachidonate at one month but both increased to normal by three months.
