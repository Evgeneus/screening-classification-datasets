Results of surgical treatment for hyperparathyroidism associated with renal disease.
 Recently, the role and timing of surgery for treating secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) have been questioned.
 In order to delineate the indications for surgery in these patients, a retrospective analysis of 53 consecutive patients treated with parathyroidectomy was conducted.
 Subtotal thyroidectomy was done in 37 of 45 patients undergoing their initial operations for HPT.
 Eight additional patients were referred after failed operations.
 Of 33 patients with preoperative bone pain, 70% improved.
 Joint pain improved in 87% of 30 patients, pruritus improved in 81% of 27 patients, and preoperative malaise improved in 73% of 33 patients after parathyroidectomy.
 Abdominal pain and irritated eyes were unlikely to improve.
 The best predictors of a successful outcome were a markedly elevated preoperative immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (mid-region) level and an elevated alkaline phosphatase level.
 There were no perioperative deaths.
 One patient (1.6%) had a recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, and one patient required reoperation for a neck hematoma.
 No patient had permanent hypoparathyroidism, but transient hypocalcemia (less than 7 mg/dL) occurred in 22%.
 Postoperative hypocalcemia correlated with elevated preoperative alkaline phosphatase levels (r2 = 0.247).
