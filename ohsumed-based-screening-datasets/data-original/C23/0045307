Evaluation of combined systemic aspirin and cromolyn sodium in intractable vernal catarrh.
 The steroids in vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) are not always effective and may result in glaucoma.
 Cromolyn sodium inhibits degranulation from mast cells, thus preventing release of prostaglandins and the mediators of inflammation when used topically.
 Aspirin, which blocks the production of inflammation-producing prostaglandins in mast cells released in VKC, especially prostaglandin D2, was used orally in 11 patients with intractable VKC of mixed type with limbal predominance.
 The chi 2 test of combined therapy showed a significant improvement in itching, lacrimation, and limbal edema (P less than .005) and improved photophobia, palpebral lesions, and corneal staining (P less than .02) at six weeks.
