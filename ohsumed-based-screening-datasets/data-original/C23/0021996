Italian experience of voice restoration after laryngectomy with tracheoesophageal puncture.
 This report concerns 102 cases of tracheoesophageal puncture performed as a means of secondary voice restoration after total laryngectomy, in 70 patients proving unable to learn esophageal speech and as a treatment of choice in a further 32 cases.
 Complications arose in 21 cases but were generally minor and could be overcome.
 Results were favorable in 45 of 70 and 29 of 32 cases, respectively.
 The method was considered effective, particularly when supported by the patient's determination to learn a verbal communication method.
