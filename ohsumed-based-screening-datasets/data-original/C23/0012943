Captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice.
 I have reported a case of captopril-induced cholestatic jaundice.
 This drug is being used with increasing frequency, so it is important that physicians recognize this adverse effect.
 Captopril-induced jaundice resolves after cessation of captopril therapy.
