Presynaptic regulation of cardiac sympathetic function in hypoxic guinea pigs.
 In the normal heart, presynaptic cholinergic muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic mechanisms modify the fractional rate constant for norepinephrine (NE) synthesis (kNE), an index of sympathetic neural function.
 To evaluate presynaptic regulation of kNE, conscious guinea pigs subjected to normoxia and then hypoxia (n = 7-8 in each group) were pretreated with 1) vehicle; 2) a cholinergic muscarinic antagonist, methyl atropine; 3) an alpha 2-antagonist, yohimbine; or 4) a combination of the two.
 An increase of kNE was determined from incorporation of radiolabeled tyrosine into NE in a control period (arterial PO2 130 +/- 1.7 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr) and during a hypoxic state (PO2 49.6 +/- 1.0 Torr, PCO2 36 +/- 0.5 Torr).
 Hypoxia activated kNE in the atrioventricular node and right ventricular moderator band in vehicle-treated animals (P less than 0.05).
 Sympathetic activation was more general, however, because alpha 2-presynaptic influence acted to limit kNE in all tissues tested (P less than 0.05) except muscle, spleen, and posterior left ventricle.
 Cholinergic muscarinic presynaptic restraint on kNE was detected during hypoxia only in the left atrial appendage and lung (P less than 0.05).
 These data indicate that hypoxia increases kNE in the heart, but restraint by cholinergic muscarinic and alpha 2-adrenergic presynaptic mechanisms limits increases in neurotransmitter synthesis and noradrenergic activation regionally.
