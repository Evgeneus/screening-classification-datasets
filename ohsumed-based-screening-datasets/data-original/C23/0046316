Ventilatory responses to chemoreceptor stimulation after hypoxic acclimatization in awake goats.
 Our objective was to test the hypothesis that exposure to prolonged hypoxia results in altered responsiveness to chemoreceptor stimulation.
 Acclimatization to hypoxia occurs rapidly in the awake goat relative to other species.
 We tested the sensitivity of the central and peripheral chemoreceptors to chemical stimuli before and after 4 h of either isocapnic or poikilocapnic hypoxia (arterial PO2 40 Torr).
 We confirmed that arterial PCO2 decreased progressively, reaching a stable value after 4 h of hypoxic exposure (poikilocapnic group).
 In the isocapnic group, inspired minute ventilation increased over the same time course.
 Thus, acclimatization occurred in both groups.
 In goats, isocapnic hypoxia did not result in hyperventilation on return to normoxia, whereas poikilocapnic hypoxia did cause hyperventilation, indicating a different mechanism for acclimatization and the persistent hyperventilation on return to normoxia.
 Goats exposed to isocapnic hypoxia exhibited an increased slope of the CO2 response curve.
 Goats exposed to poikilocapnic hypoxia had no increase in slope but did exhibit a parallel leftward shift of the CO2 response curve.
 Neither group exhibited a significant change in response to bolus NaCN injections or dopamine infusions after prolonged hypoxia.
 However, both groups demonstrated a similar significant increase in the ventilatory response to subsequent acute exposure to isocapnic hypoxia.
 The increase in hypoxic ventilatory sensitivity, which was not dependent on the modality of hypoxic exposure (isocapnic vs.
 poikilocapnic), reinforces the key role of the carotid chemoreceptors in ventilatory acclimatization to hypoxia.
