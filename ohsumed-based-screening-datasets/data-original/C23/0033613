Hemorrhagic shock and bacterial translocation in a swine model.
 Bacterial translocation is proposed as an explanation for sepsis associated with hemorrhagic shock.
 This study attempted to document these events in a large animal model.
 Male swine were randomly assigned to control (n = 10) or experimental (n = 10) groups.
 Animals were anaesthetized, and the bladder, portal vein, and a mesenteric lymphatic vessel cannulated.
 Experimental animals were bled 40% of blood volume.
 Over the next six hours maintenance fluids were given, and cultures of portal blood and mesenteric lymph taken.
 Before the swine were killed, cultures were taken from portal and systemic blood, mesenteric lymph, and lymph nodes, and a portion of terminal ileum was resected for histologic study.
 Experimental animals experienced significant shock as demonstrated by changes in hemodynamic and biochemical variables.
 Cultures and histologic examination of the terminal ileum showed no significant difference between control and experimental animals.
 In an unresuscitated swine model, significant bacterial translocation was not demonstrated within six hours of hemorrhagic shock.
