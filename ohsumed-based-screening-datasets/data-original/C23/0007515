The hazards of surgical glove dusting powders.
 Surgical contaminants of many kinds, including glove powder, constitute a source of formation of granulomas.
 This is particularly well-documented in the peritoneal cavity ("starch peritonitis"), but has been documented in most anatomic sites.
 The production of starch-free gloves should remove this hazard, but the surgeon should remain aware that most particulate substances introduced into the body inevitably set up an inflammatory response.
