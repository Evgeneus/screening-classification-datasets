Growth of tracheal anastomoses: advantage of absorbable interrupted sutures [published erratum appears in Ann Thorac Surg 1991 Jul;52(1):176]
 Growth of the trachea after complete transection and anastomosis was studied in four groups of 1-month-old New Zealand white rabbits.
 The trachea was transected at the fifth cartilaginous ring and then anastomosed with continuous 6-0 polypropylene (Prolene) (group 1), interrupted 6-0 polypropylene (group 2), continuous 6-0 polydioxanone (PDS) (group 3), or interrupted 6-0 PDS (group 4).
 The animals were followed up for 90 to 103 days (mean follow-up, 95 days).
 At the time the animals were killed, body weight had increased 125% (1.2 to 2.7 +/- 0.18 kg).
 Growth of the trachea was assessed at the time of death.
 Results from this study suggest that growth of a tracheal anastomosis is retarded in a growing animal model.
 The degree of resultant stenosis was significantly less when an absorbable suture material (PDS) and an interrupted suturing technique were used.
