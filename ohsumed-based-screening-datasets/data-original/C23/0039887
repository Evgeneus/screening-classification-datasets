Stress erosive gastritis.
 Bleeding from stress erosive gastritis continues to be a potential problem in critically ill and injured patients, but fortunately its incidence has decreased dramatically over the last decade.
 The explanation for this circumstance is probably multifactorial, but clearly relates to our increased knowledge of its pathophysiology.
 This understanding has led to the routine use of measures to reduce intragastric acidity (luminal acid being a prerequisite for stress ulcer to occur), coupled with improved techniques for the treatment of shock and the accompanying gastric mucosal hypoperfusion (another prerequisite for the formation of stress ulcers).
 A number of measures have been used to lower intragastric acidity with H2 receptor blockers emerging as the agents of choice to accomplish this goal.
 In the unlikely event that bleeding occurs despite these prophylactic measures, aggressive medical management will result in cessation of hemorrhage in over 80% of patients.
 In those few individuals requiring surgery to control bleeding, no operation has emerged as the recognized procedure of choice.
 Thus, we believe that a conservative operative approach is indicated in this setting and recommend vagotomy and pyloroplasty with oversewing of the bleeding erosions as appropriate therapy for most patients requiring surgical intervention.
