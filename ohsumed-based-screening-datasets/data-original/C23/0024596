The alkalinisation of bupivacaine for intercostal nerve blockade [published erratum appears in Anaesthesia 1991 Aug;46(8):707]
 A double-blind randomised study was performed to investigate the effect of pH adjustment of bupivacaine, with adrenaline 1:200,000, on the duration of block and pain relief after intercostal nerve blockade following thoracotomy.
 One group (n = 10) received bupivacaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 (pH = 4.1) and the other (n = 10) received alkalinised bupivacaine with adrenaline 1:200,000 (pH = 6.9).
 There was no significant difference in block duration (mean 23.9 and 26.4 hours respectively) visual analogue pain scores or morphine usage.
 Patients were more likely to have a block during the first 12 hours if they received alkalinised bupivacaine (p less than 0.01, Chi-squared test).
 A progressive regression of block, not previously described, was observed, explicable by means of spread of local anaesthesia to adjacent intercostal nerves.
 Alkalinisation of bupivacaine with adrenaline for intercostal nerve blockade has little clinical benefit.
