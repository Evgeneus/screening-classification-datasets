Adrenal suppression and growth retardation after injection of periocular capillary hemangioma with corticosteroids.
 Adrenal suppression and/or growth retardation were noted in two patients after injection of periocular capillary hemangiomas with corticosteroids.
 Parents should be warned of these two potential complications of intralesional corticosteroid therapy.
 Baseline and posttreatment adrenal function should be monitored.
 If iatrogenic adrenal suppression occurs, supplemental systemic corticosteroids may be necessary in situations involving systemic stress such as infection or surgery.
