Adult tonsillectomy.
 One hundred consecutive adult patients having tonsillectomy were carefully analysed with regard to preoperative history, operative findings and pathology.
 Follow-up was made at 1 and 3-year intervals, with particular reference to the patient's view of the outcome.
 Results of operation were compared with the clinical course of 100 age and sex-matched controls who had been on the waiting list for tonsillectomy for 2 or more years.
 These results are presented and a case is made for tonsillectomy in young adults as a valid and cost-effective procedure.
