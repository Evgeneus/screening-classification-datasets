Antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antigens: serologic marker for Sweet's syndrome.
 Seven patients with a clinical and histologic diagnosis of Sweet's syndrome were tested for the presence of circulating antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies.
 Six of the seven patients had detectable antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies at a serum dilution of at least 1:20.
 Antibodies to neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were not found in serum from patients with a range of cutaneous diseases, some known to cause clinical or histologic confusion with Sweet's syndrome.
 The detection of circulating antibodies to the neutrophil cytoplasm may be of possible diagnostic value in Sweet's syndrome.
