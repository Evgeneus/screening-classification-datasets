Urinary tract dilatation in pregnancy.
 Right-sided ureteral and renal pelvis dilatation was observed during routine uterine ultrasonographic examination at 30 weeks' gestation.
 This continued to progress with the renal pelvis measuring 8.9 cm in diameter at 35 weeks, leading to early delivery.
 Renal function remained normal and these changes resolved completely after delivery.
