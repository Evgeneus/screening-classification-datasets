Effect of direct intracoronary administration of methylergonovine in patients with and without variant angina.
 The effects of intracoronary administration of methylergonovine were studied in 21 patients with variant angina and 22 patients with atypical chest pain and in others without angina pectoris (control group).
 Methylergonovine was administered continuously at a rate of 10 micrograms/min up to 50 micrograms.
 In all patients with variant angina, coronary spasm was provoked at a mean dose of 28 +/- 13 micrograms (mean +/- SD).
 In the control group neither ischemic ST change nor localized spasm occurred.
 The basal tone of the right coronary artery was significantly lower than that of the left coronary artery.
 The percentage of vasoconstriction of the right coronary artery was significantly higher than that of the left coronary artery.
 These results suggest that spasm provocation tests, which use an intracoronary injection of a relatively low dose of methylergonovine, have a high sensitivity in variant angina and the vasoreactivity of the right coronary artery may be greater than that of the other coronary arteries.
