Quantification of vascular stenosis with color Doppler flow imaging: in vitro investigations.
 The accuracy of quantifying the degree of vascular stenosis with color Doppler flow imaging (7.5-MHz, linear array system) was determined in an experimental study carried out on six concentric and five eccentric model stenoses (cross-sectional area reduction, 13.4%-93.8%).
 The measurements were made with use of pulsatile flow at four different flow rates (70.8-339.0 mL/min).
 The degree of stenosis was calculated from the ratio of prestenotic to intrastenotic flow velocity.
 The most exact measurement of the degree of stenosis could be achieved with Doppler spectral analysis by determining the maximum peak systolic velocity (r = .994, y = 0.98x - 3.2).
 With the velocity values derived only from the color-coded image, it was also possible to find the most exact degree of stenosis (r = .995, y = 0.99x - 2.9).
 For quantification of stenosis, pre- and intrastenotic Doppler spectral analysis is no longer necessary if the stenosis can be imaged sufficiently with color Doppler.
