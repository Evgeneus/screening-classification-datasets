Neonatal hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia associated with cytomegalovirus infection in twins.
 Prenatally acquired cytomegalovirus infection in twins was temporally associated with a discordant development of neonatal hepatitis and extrahepatic biliary atresia.
 This case presents evidence suggesting an association between perinatal cytomegalovirus infection and selected extrahepatic biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis.
 Congenital cytomegalovirus infections and cytomegalovirus hepatitis are also discussed.
