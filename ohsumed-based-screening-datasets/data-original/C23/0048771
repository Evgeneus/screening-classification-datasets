Status epilepticus in benign rolandic epilepsy manifesting as anterior operculum syndrome.
 We report the fourth case of partial status epilepticus (SE) in benign epilepsy of childhood with rolandic spikes (BECRS).
 The child suffered long-lasting attacks involving the mouth and pharynx, clinically manifest as speech arrest, sialorrhea, and drooling.
 Both clinical and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were compatible with the diagnosis of BECRS.
 Only during SE was the clinical picture similar to that observed in the operculum or Foix-Chavany-Marie syndrome.
 SE remission was obtained with the usual antiepileptic drug therapy (diazepam, clobazam, valproate).
 EEG records showed additional patterns of continuous spike-waves during slow sleep and specific inhibition and blocking of interictal centrotemporal spikes by mouth and/or tongue voluntary movements.
