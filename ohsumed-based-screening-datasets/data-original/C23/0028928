Effect of hemoglobin concentration on maximal O2 uptake in canine gastrocnemius muscle in situ.
 O2 delivery to maximally working muscle was decreased by altering hemoglobin (Hb) concentration and arterial PO2 (PaO2) to investigate whether the reductions in maximal O2 uptake (VO2max) that occur with lowered [Hb] are in part related to changes in the effective muscle O2 diffusing capacity (DmO2).
 Two sets of experiments were conducted.
 In the initial set (n = 8), three levels of Hb [5.8 +/- 0.3, 9.4 +/- 0.1, and 14.4 +/- 0.6 (SE) g/100 ml] in the blood were used in random order to pump perfuse, at equal muscle blood flows and PaO2, maximally working isolated dog gastrocnemius muscle.
 VO2max declined with decreasing [Hb], but the relationship between VO2max and both the effluent venous PO2 (PvO2) and the calculated mean capillary PO2 (PcO2) was not linear through the origin and, therefore, not compatible with a single value of DmO2 (as calculated by Bohr integration using a model based on Fick's law of diffusion).
 To clarify these results, a second set of experiments (n = 6) was conducted in which two levels of Hb (14.0 +/- 0.6 and 6.9 +/- 0.6 g/100 ml) were each combined with two levels of oxygenation (PaO2 79 +/- 8 and 29 +/- 2 Torr) and applied in random sequence to again pump perfuse maximally working dog gastrocnemius muscle at constant blood flow.
 In these experiments, the relationship between VO2max and both PvO2 and calculated PcO2 for each [Hb] was consistent with a constant estimate of DmO2 as PaO2 was reduced, but the calculated DmO2 for the lower [Hb] was 33% less than that at the higher [Hb] (P less than 0.05).
