Chronic hyperglycemia increases the density of glucose transporters in human erythrocyte membranes.
 We investigated the effect of chronic hyperglycemia on glucose transporters in erythrocytes of subjects with and without diabetes mellitus.
 We found a 22% increase in D-glucose-displaceable cytochalasin-B binding in erythrocyte membranes of diabetic subjects over those of controls (311 +/- 13 vs.
 254 +/- 8 pmol/mg protein; P less than 0.001).
 This increased binding was due to a higher density of binding sites without a significant change in binding affinity.
 Cytochalasin-B binding to erythrocyte membrane correlated positively with both erythrocyte glycohemoglobin and serum glucose levels, but not with plasma C-peptide levels.
 The data are compatible with up-regulation of glucose transporters in the erythrocytes of subjects with chronic hyperglycemia.
 We suspect that this is brought about by increased synthesis and membrane incorporation of the glucose transporter during erythropoiesis.
