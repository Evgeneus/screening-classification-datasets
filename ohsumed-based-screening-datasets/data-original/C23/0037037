Management of infected aortoiliac aneurysms.
 A 30-year retrospective review identified 13 patients treated for infected aneurysms of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries, for an overall incidence of 0.65%.
 A constellation of clinical findings led to the correct preoperative diagnosis in 11 (85%) of 13 patients.
 Treatment methods included resection and in situ replacement grafting in seven patients, resection and extra-anatomic bypass in five patients, and resection-ligation in one patient.
 Four (31%) of 13 patients died within 30 days of operation, three of whom died of rupture.
 Overall, good results were achieved in five patients (38%), while poor results were noted in the remaining eight patients (62%).
 The determinants of outcome were aneurysm location or rupture, the presence of established infection, and the virulence of the infecting organism.
 In 10 (77%) of the 13 aneurysms, Salmonella species, Bacteroides fragilis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa accounted for all deaths, ruptures, and suprarenal aneurysm infections.
 These data suggest that patients with primary infections of the abdominal aorta or iliac arteries continue to present with advanced infections or aneurysm rupture that result in a high mortality.
