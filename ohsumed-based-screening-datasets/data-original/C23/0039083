Is fiber mitochondrial volume density a good indicator of muscle fatigability to isometric exercise?
 The relationship between the ratio of interfibrillar mitochondrial volume density (Vvmit) to myofibrillar volume density (Vvmyo) and isometric fatigue characteristics of the human triceps surae was determined in six bodybuilders, six endurance athletes, and six active controls before and after 16 wk of isometric training at 30 or 100% maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) in six sedentary subjects in a unilateral exercise model.
 Time to fatigue at 30% MVC was significantly less in sedentary subjects before training than in the other subject groups, but it was similar to the other groups posttraining.
 Stereological analyses of type I fibers indicated that Vvmit/Vvmyo was less in bodybuilders than in other subjects.
 Training at 30% MVC increased type I fiber Vvmit/Vvmyo of the soleus by 11% but did not affect the gastrocnemii.
 Training at 100% MVC did not alter Vvmit/Vvmyo in any muscle, nor was this ratio changed in type II fibers by either training program.
 Despite the morphological differences, both training protocols increased relative endurance, although greater fatigue resistance was seen after training at 30% MVC.
 Correlation analyses indicated that isometric endurance and improvements in muscle endurance by isometric exercise were not dependent on increasing interfibrillar Vvmit or Vvmit/Vvmyo in either fiber type.
