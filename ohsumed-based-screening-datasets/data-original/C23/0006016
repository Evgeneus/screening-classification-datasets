Arteriovenous malformation of the tongue.
 Polyvinyl alcohol particles used to embolize an arteriovenous malformation of the tongue were only temporarily successful.
 Additional embolization therapy was necessary and was complicated by ischemic ulcers of the tongue.
 We conclude that embolization therapy can be used, but the efficacy of this therapy in the longer term remains to be determined.
