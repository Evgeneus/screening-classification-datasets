Diagnostic accuracy of temporomandibular joint lower-compartment arthroscopy using an ultrathin arthroscope: a postmortem study.
 Arthroscopy was performed on the lower temporomandibular (TMJ) joint compartment of 30 fresh cadavers using a newly developed ultrathin arthroscope.
 Comparison of arthroscopic and dissection findings showed a diagnostic accuracy of 57%.
 There were both false-positive and false-negative arthroscopic diagnosis.
 The majority of the false diagnosis occurred in the lateral part of the joint.
 Iatrogenic damage to the disc occurred in one joint.
 The study suggests that arthroscopy of the lower joint space of the TMJ can be done with a diagnostic accuracy similar to what has been described for the upper joint space.
 There appears to be no major risks of iatrogenic damage to the joint structures using an ultrathin arthroscope.
