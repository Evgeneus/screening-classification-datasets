Pulmonary arterial and venous constriction during hypoxia in 3- to 5-wk-old and adult ferrets.
 We have determined the sites of hypoxic vasoconstriction in ferret lungs.
 Lungs of five 3- to 5-wk-old and five adult ferrets were isolated and perfused with blood.
 Blood flow was adjusted initially to keep pulmonary arterial pressure at 20 cmH2O and left atrial and airway pressures at 6 and 8 cmH2O, respectively (zone 3).
 Once adjusted, flow was kept constant throughout the experiment.
 In each lung, pressures were measured in subpleural 20- to 50-microns-diam arterioles and venules with the micropipette servo-nulling method during normoxia (PO2 approximately 100 Torr) and hypoxia (PO2 less than 50 Torr).
 In normoxic adult ferret lungs, approximately 40% of total vascular resistance was in arteries, approximately 40% was in microvessels, and approximately 20% was in veins.
 With hypoxia, the total arteriovenous pressure drop increased by 68%.
 Arterial and venous pressure drops increased by 92 and 132%, respectively, with no change in microvascular pressure drop.
 In 3- to 5-wk-old ferret lungs, the vascular pressure profile during normoxia and the response to hypoxia were similar to those in adult lungs.
 We conclude that, in ferret lungs, arterial and venous resistances increase equally during hypoxia, resulting in increased microvascular pressures for fluid filtration.
