The role of infections in the rheumatic diseases: molecular mimicry between bacterial and human stress proteins?
 Infections can cause or exacerbate the rheumatic diseases in several ways, including immune cross-reactivity between bacterial heat shock proteins and similar proteins in normal human tissues.
 This may lead to autoimmunity in rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus.
 In addition, increased activation of the gene regulating the synthesis of a heat shock protein has been found in scleroderma fibroblasts.
 As an infection-induced model for other rheumatic diseases, rheumatic fever (RF), with its well-established link to prior group A streptococcal infection, will be revisited.
 The lessons learned from RF and other rheumatic diseases directly linked to infection will be applied to ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and polymyositis, for which a mounting body of circumstantial evidence suggests a probable infectious cause.
 The interplay of genetic susceptibility and infection with particular organisms and the implications of this new information for present and future therapy of the rheumatic diseases will also be presented.
