Pulmonary vascular reactivity in Fischer rats.
 We previously reported that Fischer (F) rat lungs developed more extensive injury when challenged with oxidants than age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat lungs.
 We now describe a reduced pulmonary vascular response to alveolar hypoxia and angiotensin II (ANG II) in F compared with SD rats.
 The comparative studies were performed with isolated lungs perfused with salt solution or blood, catheter-implanted awake rats, and isolated main pulmonary arterial rings.
 Isolated lungs from F rats perfused with either blood or salt solution had reduced vasoconstriction in comparison with lungs from SD rats when exposed to alveolar hypoxia or challenged with ANG II.
 Instrumented awake F rats had a smaller mean increase in total pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) than SD rats (35 vs.
 94 mmHg.min.l-1, P less than 0.05) when challenged with 8% oxygen.
 The contractile response of isolated pulmonary artery but not thoracic aortic rings to KCl and ANG II was reduced in F compared with SD rats.
 In addition, F rats exposed to 4 wk of hypobaric hypoxia developed less pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy (when corrected for the hematocrit) than SD rats.
 We conclude that the oxidant stress-sensitive inbred F rat strain is characterized by a lung vascular bed that is relatively unresponsive to vasoconstricting stimuli.
 The mechanism underlying this genetic difference in lung vascular control remains to be defined.
