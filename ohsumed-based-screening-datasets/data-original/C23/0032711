Magnetic resonance imaging of temporomandibular joint after surgical treatment of internal derangement.
 Sagittal and coronal surface coil magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 21 patients who about 2 years earlier had surgery for temporomandibular joint internal derangement.
 Surgical procedure included disk repositioning (23 joints) and diskectomy (seven joints).
 At the time of reimaging, 20 joints showed recurrence of pain and 10 joints were asymptomatic.
 Extensive fibrous tissue was seen in the joint space and in the joint capsule in 13 of the 20 painful joints, whereas minimal fibrous tissue in the lateral capsule wall was seen in 3 of the 10 nonpainful joints.
 Fibrous tissue was surgically confirmed in 10 of the painful joints.
 Disk displacement was seen in 11 of the 23 joints that had surgical disk repositioning.
 Disk displacement was seen in both painful (9/17) and nonpainful joints (2/6).
 It was concluded that magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method for postoperative imaging of the temporomandibular joint and that attention should be directed to the presence or absence and extension of the fibrous tissue in the joint space and in the joint capsule.
