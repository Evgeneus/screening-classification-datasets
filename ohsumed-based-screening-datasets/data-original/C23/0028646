Acute venous thrombosis. Therapeutic choices for superficial and deep veins.
 Superficial thrombophlebitis is common in varicose veins or veins that have undergone trauma from catheters or intravenous medications.
 Pain and tenderness, warmth, and erythema are diagnostic features.
 A compression bandage and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent are often all that is required for treatment.
 Deep vein thrombosis occurs in veins beneath the deep fascia of the leg or in the pelvis or abdomen.
 It is often asymptomatic but must be treated to prevent pulmonary embolization and postthrombotic syndrome.
 Standard therapy is administration of heparin sodium for 5 days, followed by tapering and discontinuation.
 Warfarin sodium (Coumadin, Panwarfin, Sofarin) is sometimes given simultaneously.
 Longer courses of anti-coagulation therapy are necessary in patients with an ongoing risk of recurrence.
