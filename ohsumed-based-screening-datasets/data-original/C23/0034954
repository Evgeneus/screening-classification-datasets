Modifications of the nasal cycle in patients with hypothalamic disorders: Kallmann's syndrome.
 The nasal cycle is a phenomenon characterized by cyclic changes in the airflow resistance of each nasal fossa from congestion or constriction of the nasal erectile tissue.
 This phenomenon is caused by alterations in the influence exerted by the autonomic nervous system and is believed to be regulated by a hypothalamic center.
 In order to verify this hypothesis on the hypothalamic regulation of the nasal cycle, the authors studied a group of subjects with Kallmann's syndrome.
 This disorder is characterized by coexisting hypothalamic hypogonadism and hyposmia or anosmia due to hypothalamic and olfactory center hypoplasia.
 An anomalous nasal cycle was found in all the subjects with Kallmann's syndrome.
 This disorder might be related to hypothalamus atrophy.
