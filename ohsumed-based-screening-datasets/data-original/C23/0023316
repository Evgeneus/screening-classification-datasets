Association of p60c-src with polyoma virus middle-T antigen abrogating mitosis-specific activation.
 Polyoma middle-T antigen is required for tumorigenesis in animals and for viral transformation of a variety of cells in culture (reviewed in ref.
 1).
 Middle-T associates with and thereby activates p60c-src, a cellular tyrosine kinase homologous to the oncogene product of Rous sarcoma virus.
 Activation of p60c-src by middle-T is accompanied both by dephosphorylation of tyrosine 527, a site which negatively regulates src kinase src kinase activity (reviewed in refs 4-6) and by autophosphorylation on tyrosine 416 (refs 7-10).
 Phosphoprotein p60c-src is subject to cell cycle-specific regulation.
 It is most active during mitosis and repressed in interphase.
 Here we report that mitotic p60c-src is dephosphorylated at tyrosine 527.
 We also show that in cells expressing middle-T, src kinase activity is high both in mitosis and during interphase.
 An oncogenic mutant src protein, p60c-src(527F), where tyrosine 527 is substituted by phenylalanine, is also highly active in all phases of the cell cycle.
