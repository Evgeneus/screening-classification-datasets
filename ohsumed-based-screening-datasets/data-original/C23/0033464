Internal mammary artery subclavian vein fistula following internal jugular vein catheterization. A case report and review of the literature.
 We have recently treated a patient with an arteriovenous fistula that developed after a right internal jugular vein catheterization.
 The patient was found to have a pulsatile hematoma and a bruit five days after removal of a temporary pacemaker catheter.
 Digital subtraction arteriography documented a fistula between the right internal mammary artery and subclavian vein.
 The fistula was surgically repaired via the cervical route.
 To our knowledge, an arteriovenous fistula between the internal mammary artery and subclavian vein has not been previously described as a complication of a percutaneous internal jugular vein catheterization.
