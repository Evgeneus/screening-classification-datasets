Radiographic fallopian tube recanalization: absorbed ovarian radiation dose.
 Absorbed radiation dose to the ovaries during radiographic fallopian tube recanalization was estimated in 29 patients with use of thermoluminescent dosimeters placed in the vaginal fornix.
 With an average fluoroscopic time of 8.5 minutes +/- 5.5 and an average of 14 +/- 5 105-mm spot radiographs obtained, the average absorbed dose to the ovaries was 8.5 mGy +/- 5.6 (0.85 rad +/- 0.56).
 Technical guidelines for keeping patient radiation exposure to a minimum during this new interventional procedure are suggested.
