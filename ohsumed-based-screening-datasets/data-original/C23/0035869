Internal mammary artery to lung parenchyma fistula after aortocoronary bypass grafting.
 Two unusual cases of internal mammary artery fistulization to lung parenchyma after coronary revascularization are reported.
 They were incidentally discovered during coronary angiography, and one of them was successfully closed with a percutaneous transvenous coil-spring occluder.
 The cause is thought to be the direct contact between the dissected mammary artery pedicle and the lung parenchyma.
