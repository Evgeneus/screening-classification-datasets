Clinical significance of pericardial rub with regional ventricular dilatation.
 To elucidate the clinical characteristics associated with regional ventricular dilatation in the early phase of myocardial infarction (MI), 228 patients with acute Q-wave anterior MI were studied.
 Forty-nine patients (21 percent) had echocardiographically demonstrated regional ventricular dilatation (an abnormal bulge in the left ventricular contour during both systole and diastole) on the third hospital day.
 Careful auscultation revealed that a pericardial rub was present in 49 patients (21 patients with and 28 patients without regional ventricular dilatation) during the first three days after hospital admission.
 Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the relative importance of pericardial rub with six other clinical variables related to regional ventricular dilatation.
 Pericardial rub and cardiac output were the significant factors related to the presence of regional ventricular dilatation.
 Thus, a pericardial rub, in concert with impaired left ventricular function, is a physical sign associated with regional ventricular dilatation, and anatomically transmural infarction is the possible factor explaining their association.
