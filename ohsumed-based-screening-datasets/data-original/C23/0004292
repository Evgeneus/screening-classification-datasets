Gastrointestinal side-effects of octreotide during long-term treatment of acromegaly.
 Gastrointestinal side-effects of prolonged therapy (greater than 2 yr) with the long-acting somatostatin analog octreotide were studied in 10 acromegalic patients.
 After 2 yr of therapy, 6 of 10 patients had newly developed gallstones, complicated by cholangitis and jaundice in 1.
 Serum vitamin B-12 concentrations declined in all 10 patients [from 380 +/- 32 to 172 +/- 21 pmol/L (mean +/- SE); P = 0.023] and became abnormally low in 4.
 Gastric biopsy specimens, obtained during gastroscopy (9 patients), showed moderate to severe active gastritis, with damage to the superficial and deeper layers of the mucosa in 9 of 9 and focal atrophy in 7 of 9 patients.
 Campylobacter pylori was found in the antral mucosa in 8 of 9 patients.
 Although information is lacking on similar studies in untreated acromegalic patients, we suggest that patients receiving chronic octreotide therapy be closely monitored for these and possible other side-effects related to gastrointestinal actions of octreotide.
