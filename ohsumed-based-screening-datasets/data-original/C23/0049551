Treatment of compound fractures.
 Management of compound fractures remains a challenge to the surgeon.
 Methods to decrease patient morbidity include early fracture stabilization and sequential debridement.
 External fixation remains the standard; however, early internal fixation in low-grade injuries may be an acceptable option.
 Early soft tissue coverage is critical.
 The use of prophylactic parenteral antibiotics has decreased the incidence of acute infection and chronic osteomyelitis.
 Supplemental use of local antibiotic polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) beads appears to further diminish the morbidity in high-grade open fractures.
