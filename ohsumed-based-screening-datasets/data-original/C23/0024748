Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: the Dundee technique 
 A total of 61 patients was subjected to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
 The procedure was completed in 60 cases and converted to open operation in one (2 per cent).
 The morbidity rate was low (total 7 per cent, major 2 per cent, blood transfusion rate 5 per cent).
 The median duration of the laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiography was 135 min (range 65-270 min).
 The operation took less time to complete in patients with functioning gallbladders than in those with non-functioning fibrotic organs (median 120 versus 175 min).
 The majority of patients required opiate analgesia despite infiltration of the stab wounds with bupivacaine.
 The mean (s.d.) hospital stay was 2.9 (1.5) days.
 The median time to resume work or full activity after discharge was 11 days.
