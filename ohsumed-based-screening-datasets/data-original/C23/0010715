Sustained increased cerebral blood flow with prophylactic hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution ("triple-H" therapy) after subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 Delayed cerebral ischemia is the major cause of death and disability in patients who initially survive an aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
 In the present study, a protocol for prophylactic hypertensive hypervolemic hemodilution ("triple-H" therapy) was utilized in the treatment of SAH, and the response of cerebral blood flow (CBF) was evaluated.
 Serial CBF measurements, f1 and CBF15, were performed using the xenon-133 inhalation technique to maximize therapy.
 Surgery within 24 hours of subarachnoid hemorrhage was preferred.
 In 43 patients with SAH, mean hemoglobin and hematocrit were lowered 3.0 +/- 0.3 g/dL and 8.9 +/- 0.5%, respectively, over the first 24 hours.
 Mean f1 and mean CBF15 over the same period increased 34.2 +/- 5.8% and 21.2 +/- 3.6%, respectively.
 The maximum mean increase in CBF was 47.2 +/- 4.7% for f1 and 30.1 +/- 3.2% for CBF15.
 Cerebral blood flow remained elevated during the 21 days after SAH, irrespective of neurological grade on admission, age, sex, or angiographic arterial narrowing.
 This is the first report of a consistent method for establishing sustained improvement in CBF after SAH.
 All patients managed in total compliance with the protocol remained neurologically stable or improved.
 Two patients developed delayed ischemia and infarction because of the inability to sustain protocol requirements.
 Thirty-six of the 43 patients (84%) were discharged capable of an independent lifestyle.
 Triple-H therapy is a safe and effective modality for elevating and sustaining CBF after SAH.
 In combination with early aneurysm surgery, it can minimize delayed cerebral ischemia and lead to an improved overall outcome.
