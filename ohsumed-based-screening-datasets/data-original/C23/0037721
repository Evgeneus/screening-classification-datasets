Initial clinical experience with a 48 by 48 element biplane transesophageal probe.
 Recent technologic advances in ultrasound have resulted in the capability of transesophageal echocardiographic imaging in both transverse and longitudinal planes.
 Previous biplane probes suffered from inferior images because of reduced scan elements.
 We evaluated the utility of a prototype 48 X 48 element biplane transesophageal probe in 23 consecutive patients.
 Examinations were well tolerated with no side effects.
 In comparison to the single transverse plane, imaging with the longitudinal plane gave superior information on prosthetic valve pathology, atrial septal abnormalities, and pathoanatomy of the ascending aorta and mitral valve.
 Complementary information was provided by the longitudinal plane in patients with endocarditis and vegetations and in mitral protheses.
 Images obtained with this 48 X 48 element biplane probe along with color and spectral Doppler information were not perceptibly inferior to those obtained by single-plane probes.
 In conclusion, biplane transesophageal echocardiography with a 48 X 48 element probe indicates a great potential for enhanced three-dimensional understanding of cardiac pathology and diagnostic yield in specific pathologies.
