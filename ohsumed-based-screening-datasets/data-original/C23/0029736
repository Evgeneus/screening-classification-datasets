The acute and chronic effects of G-lasing on femoral vein grafts in dogs.
 Each year, 5% of all coronary artery bypass operations are repeat procedures, and 15%-30% of coronary artery vein grafts occlude within the first eighteen months postoperatively.
 To evaluate the macroscopic and histologic effects of G-lasing on vein grafts and their patency, femoral veins were used to bypass bilaterally induced stenoses of femoral arteries in 10 dogs.
 The left vein grafts were G-lased with a 1.5 mm, hot-tipped argon laser at 5 watts for ninety seconds, while the right grafts were used as the controls.
 Acutely, each vein graft demonstrated no evidence of charring or perforation.
 The percentage of endothelium present in the G-lased vein grafts was consistently less than 5%, whereas the control vein grafts had an average of 70%.
 After ten weeks, the animals were sacrificed, and the vein grafts were evaluated for histologic changes and patency.
 There were no significant microscopic differences between the G-lased and control vein grafts.
 A statistically significant difference in graft patency was not achieved between G-Lased and control vein grafts at 10 weeks, but only a small number of grafts were studied.
 Further studies will be needed to evaluate the effects of G-lasing on the long-term patency of vein grafts.
