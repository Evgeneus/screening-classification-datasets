Revision total hip arthroplasty for aseptic failure. A review of 276 cases.
 The results of 276 cemented revision total hip arthroplasties performed for aseptic failure between 1977 and 1986 have been reviewed.
 The mean time between revision and review was 75 months (range 30 to 144).
 Of 220 cases available for review, 159 were assessed clinically and radiographically, and 32 by postal questionnaire.
 Eighteen hips required further revision, 12 for loosening, two for sepsis, two for persistent pain, and one each for fracture and recurrent dislocation.
 A further six hips were radiologically and symptomatically loose.
 Pain was mild or absent in 83%.
 Over half were able to walk a mile or more; 70% flexed more than 70 degrees; 15% had a flexion deformity, but in only 7% was this more than 10 degrees.
 The mean Harris hip score was 74.
 Survival at five years was 95% and at 10 years, 77%.
