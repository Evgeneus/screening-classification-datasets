Trunk orientation as the determining factor of the 'contralateral' deficit in the neglect syndrome and as the physical anchor of the internal representation of body orientation in space.
 The present study examines which egocentric coordinate system determines the border between the disturbed 'contralateral' and the normal 'ipsilateral' side in patients with hemineglect.
 Based on the observation of significantly longer reaction times for saccades towards stimuli presented in the left visual field (LVF) in right brain-damaged patients with hemineglect, stimuli were presented randomly to the LVF or RVF and the corresponding saccadic reaction times (SRTs) were compared.
 Beginning with the standard body position generally used for the investigation of neglect patients, where the midlines of head, trunk and visual field are parallel and oriented straight towards the middle of the projection screen, the spatial relation between orientation of head and trunk midlines and location of the target stimuli was systematically varied while holding the retinal projection of the stimuli constant.
 The deficit in SRTs towards the LVF in 4 right brain-damaged patients with left-sided hemineglect could be compensated for by turning the patients' trunk to the left, such that both LVF and RVF-stimuli were projected to the right, ipsilateral side of trunk space.
 The results suggest that the spatial orientation of the trunk midline divides our normal perception of space into an egocentric 'left' and an egocentric 'right' sector and seems to be the decisive factor for determining the neglected 'contralateral' part of space in patients with brain-damage.
 They indicate that the trunk midline constitutes the physical anchor for calculation of the internal egocentric coordinate frame for representing body position with respect to external objects.
 The hypothesis of Ventre et al.
 (1984) that deficient reactions to contralaterally located stimuli in neglect patients could be the result of a displacement of these egocentric coordinates towards the non-neglected, ipsilateral side is discussed.
