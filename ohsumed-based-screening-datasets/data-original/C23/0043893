Stroke prevention in women: role of aspirin versus ticlopidine.
 Stroke is the third leading cause of death in North America.
 Most studies indicate that women are just as likely as men to have an initial stroke but less likely to have a recurrent stroke.
 Aspirin and ticlopidine are two antiplatelet drugs that reduce the risk of recurrent stroke by 25% to 30%.
 In some stroke prevention trials, aspirin has been shown to be more effective for men than for women.
 In contrast, major stroke prevention trials using ticlopidine have demonstrated equal benefit in women and in men.
 The overall incidence of adverse effects seen with ticlopidine is not significantly different from that observed with aspirin.
 There are now two effective agents useful in stroke prevention in both men and women.
