Intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents in relapsing or persistent peritonitis of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 Urokinase or streptokinase was instilled intraperitoneally as an adjunct to the antibiotic therapy in 16 episodes of relapsing or persistent peritonitis in CAPD patients.
 In eight patients the combination of antibiotics and intraperitoneal thrombolytic agents resulted in clearing of the infection with no recurrences.
 The treatment failed in eight other patients, who had their peritoneal catheters removed.
 Six of the last eight patients had either abdominal wall abscesses or persistence of the bacteria on the wall of the peritoneal catheter.
 Elevated post-intraperitoneal instillation peritoneal fluid neutrophil counts and positive post-instillation peritoneal fluid cultures predicted failure of the intraperitoneal instillation of thrombolytic agents in most instances.
 Intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase may help cure approximately 50% of the episodes of relapsing for persistent peritonitis.
 Post-instillation peritoneal fluid cell counts and cultures should be monitored.
 Radiologic investigation for abdominal wall or intraabdominal abscesses is indicated if intraperitoneal instillation of urokinase or streptokinase fails to eradicate peritonitis.
