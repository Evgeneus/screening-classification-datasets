Hiccups (singultus): review and approach to management.
 Hiccups are a common, and fortunately usually transient, benign malady.
 Occasionally, however, hiccups fail to resolve spontaneously, resulting in patient fatigue and incapacitation and the need for the affected individual to seek medical care for resolution of the problem.
 The approach to the management of these patients consists of the identification and treatment of serious underlying causes of the episode as well as therapeutic interventions to achieve hiccup resolution.
