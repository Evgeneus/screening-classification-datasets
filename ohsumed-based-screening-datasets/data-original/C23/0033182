Miller-Dieker syndrome with ring chromosome 17.
 A girl presented at 6 weeks of age with failure to thrive and arching of the back.
 She had various dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly, and developmental delay.
 The electroencephalogram and cranial ultrasound were abnormal, and a computed tomogram showed lissencephaly and apparent agenesis of the corpus callosum.
 Because of frequent aspiration she became oxygen dependent.
 She later developed intractable convulsions and died at the age of 9 months.
