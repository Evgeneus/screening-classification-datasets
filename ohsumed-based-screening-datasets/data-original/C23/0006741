Starch peritonitis. A case report and clinicopathologic review.
 A case of starch peritonitis is presented with a review of the history of this continuing problem.
 The syndrome's presentation, diagnosis, histopathology and treatment are discussed.
 The rarity of starch peritonitis today may be due to more attention to glove washing by surgeons, fewer impurities in the glove powder or lack of recognition of the syndrome.
 In order to prevent a resurgence of the starch peritonitis syndrome we must continue to emphasize the importance of washing gloves, maintain the quality control and purity of the powder used, and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms so that such cases may be managed nonoperatively.
