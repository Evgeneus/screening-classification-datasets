Effects of altered PaO2 and PaCO2 on left ventricular function and coronary hemodynamics in sheep.
 The effects of acute changes in arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tension, produced by altering the inspired gas mixtures while maintaining constant-volume intermittent positive pressure ventilation, on global function, regional left ventricular function, and coronary hemodynamics were studied in eight sheep during halothane anesthesia.
 Hypercapnia (Paco2, 73.5 +/- 2.3 mm Hg, mean +/- SD) increased heart rate, stroke volume, and cardiac output but decreased systolic shortening in the base of the left ventricle.
 Hypocapnia (PaO2, 24 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) decreased cardiac output and coronary flow below levels seen with hypercapnia but not below levels seen with normocapnia.
 Systolic shortening decreased in both apical and basal regions, and left ventricular relaxation was impaired as evidenced by a reduction of the nadir of LV dP/dt.
 Hypoxemia (PaO2, 39 +/- 1.5 mm Hg) elicited a hyperdynamic response of the circulation, increased coronary blood flow, and exhausted the coronary flow reserve.
 Neither changes in PaCO2 nor changes in PaO2 caused postsystolic shortening, although hypercapnia caused nonuniformity of contraction in the left ventricle.
 Thus, marked alterations in oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions do not cause left ventricular dysfunction, even though moderate hypoxia reduces the coronary flow reserve.
