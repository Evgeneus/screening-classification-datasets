Neobladder construction using completely detubularized sigmoid colon after radical cystoprostatectomy.
 To improve the quality of life of the patient we used completely detubularized sigmoid colon for bladder reconstruction along with radical cystoprostatectomy in 6 men with invasive bladder cancer.
 Followup was 8 to 20 months.
 Postoperatively, all of the patients were continent during the day but only 4 (66.7%) were continent at night, although they had to awaken twice to remain dry.
 Neocystourethroscopy in 4 of the 6 patients revealed no tumor and no stricture at the urethrocolonic anastomosis.
 However, a stone in the neobladder was found in 1 patients.
 Urodynamic study of the neobladder showed a low pressure (mean 16.7 cm.
 water) at the filling phase of water cystometry and an adequate maximal urethral closure pressure (mean 52.0 cm.
 water) and functional profile length (mean 3.8 cm.).
 The uroflow rate in all patients was good (1 patient even had a maximal uroflow rate of 31 ml.
 per second).
 There was no reflux in any patient.
 One patient had intestinal obstruction 5 months postoperatively and died 5 months later of widespread metastasis.
 The remaining 5 patients are alive with a satisfactory quality of life.
 In conclusion, use of completely detubularized sigmoid colon may be an ideal operation for neobladder construction after radical cystoprostatectomy.
