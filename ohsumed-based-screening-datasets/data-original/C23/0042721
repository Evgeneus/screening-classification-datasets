Type I human T cell leukemia virus tax protein transforms rat fibroblasts through the cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein/activating transcription factor pathway.
 The Tax oncoprotein of the type I human T cell leukemia virus (HTLV-I) activates transcription of cellular and viral genes through at least two different transcription factor pathways.
 Tax activates transcription of the c-fos proto-oncogene by a mechanism that appears to involve members of the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and activating transcription factor (ATF) family of DNA-binding proteins.
 Tax also induces the nuclear expression of the NF-kappa B family of rel oncogene-related enhancer-binding proteins.
 We have investigated the potential role of these CREB/ATF and NF-kappa B/Rel transcription factors in Tax-mediated transformation by analyzing the oncogenic potential of Tax mutants that functionally segregate these two pathways of transactivation.
 Rat fibroblasts (Rat2) stably expressing either the wild-type Tax protein or a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to induce NF-kappa B/Rel demonstrated marked changes in morphology and growth characteristics including the ability to form tumors in athymic mice.
 In contrast, Rat2 cells stably expressing a Tax mutant selectively deficient in the ability to activate transcription through CREB/ATF demonstrated no detectable changes in morphology or growth characteristics.
 These results suggest that transcriptional activation through the CREB/ATF pathway may play an important role in Tax-mediated cellular transformation.
