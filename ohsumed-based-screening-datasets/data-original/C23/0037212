Surgical repair of rectovaginal fistulas in patients with Crohn's disease: transvaginal approach.
 The surgical management of rectovaginal fistulas complicating Crohn's disease has been associated with unacceptably high failure rates.
 We sought to modify the available surgical techniques to provide a solution to this challenging problem.
 Between December 1983 and January 1990, 14 patients with Crohn's disease underwent repair of a rectovaginal fistula.
 A modified transvaginal approach was employed by the authors.
 A diverting loop ileostomy was performed on all patients, either as the initial step in the staged management of intractable perianal disease or concurrent with the repair of the rectovaginal fistula.
 The fistula was completely eradicated in 13 of the 14 women and did not recur during the mean follow-up period of 55.0 months (range, 3-77 months).
 Intestinal continuity was reestablished in these 13 patients within 6 months after the initial fistula repair.
 One patient with a very low-lying fistula constituted our only failure.
 We have found the transvaginal method preferable to the transanal approach because of the relative ease in raising the vaginal flap as compared with a flap of fibrotic and inflamed anorectal mucosa.
 On the basis of this study, we conclude that a modified transvaginal approach is an effective method for repair of rectovaginal fistulas secondary to Crohn's disease.
