Comparison of insect species associated with decomposing remains recovered inside dwellings and outdoors on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.
 A comparison of insects collected from 35 cases of decomposing remains on the island of Oahu, Hawaiian Islands (14 from indoor situations and 21 from outdoors), yielded a total of 22 species of insects in 3 orders and 12 families.
 Of these, five species were recovered in both indoor and outdoor situations.
 Remains recovered indoors had a greater variety of Diptera larvae associated with them, while remains discovered outdoors had a greater variety of Coleoptera species present.
 Some species of insects were restricted to remains discovered indoors, while others were found only associated with remains in outdoor situations.
 Knowledge of the species of insects associated with different habitats may serve to provide information concerning the history of the remains.
