Small, deep pelvic abscesses: definition and drainage guided with an endovaginal probe.
 Four small, deep pelvic abscesses were easily drained transvaginally by using an endovaginal transducer for guidance, support, and continuous monitoring of catheter placement.
 Collections that could not be drained percutaneously or at surgery were effectively managed with this technique.
 An inexpensive guide (estimated cost, $1.65) facilitated control of the catheter.
 All four abscesses resolved without further intervention.
