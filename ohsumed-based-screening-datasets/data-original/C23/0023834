Events associated with rupture of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation devices.
 Nineteen intra-aortic balloon (IAB) ruptures occurred in sixteen patients during a three-year period.
 Perforation occurred secondary to abrasion with material failure or mishandling of the device during insertion.
 To avoid serious sequelae, it is important to be aware of the possibility of IAB rupture and to remove any defective device immediately upon recognition of an event.
