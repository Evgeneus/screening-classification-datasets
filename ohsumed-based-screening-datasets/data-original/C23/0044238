Measurement of hip prostheses using image analysis. The maxima hip technique.
 A computer-based image analysis system has been developed as a research tool in total hip replacement.
 The system has been programmed to take multiple measurements from coronal plane radiographs.
 Poor quality radiographic images can be enhanced and standardised.
 The measurements which can be obtained include stem subsidence, cup migration, cup wear, and stem loosening.
 Reproducibility and accuracy were +/- 0.01 mm and +/- 0.5 mm respectively.
 The present application is in retrospective research, but prospective monitoring of radiographs is planned.
