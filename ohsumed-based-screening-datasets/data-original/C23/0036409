Tegmental dehiscence and brain herniation into the middle ear cleft.
 The tegmen tympani may occasionally be breached by herniation of the temporal lobe with or without dural cover.
 The clinical presentation may be obvious with CSF otorrhoea but less so with apparent middle ear effusion, CSF rhinnorrhoea, conductive hearing loss, recurrent meningitis or intracranial sepsis.
 Diagnosis requires suspicion of the condition, which may be aided by radiological imaging.
 Surgical repair is to be recommended: various techniques are available but bone enveloped by fascia placed by subtemporal approach is preferred.
 The features of this problem are highlighted by four cases.
