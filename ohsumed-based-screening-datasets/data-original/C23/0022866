Locked intramedullary fixation for metaphyseal malunion and nonunion.
 Locked intramedullary rod fixation, established for metaphyseal fractures, is applicable to reconstructive procedures.
 Fourteen cases of complex nonunion or malunion (five infected) were reviewed retrospectively.
 Thirteen of the 14 fractures united.
 Eleven of 14 required an open procedure for removal of metal, soft-tissue release, bone grafting, osteotomy, or resection of infected bone.
 Infections were controlled by resection, depot antibiotics, and early stabilization.
 Interlocking intramedullary rods are an excellent fixation technique for posttraumatic metaphyseal reconstructive procedures.
