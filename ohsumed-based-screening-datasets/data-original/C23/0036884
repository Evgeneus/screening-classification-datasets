Elective versus emergency cesarean hysterectomy cases in a residency program setting: a review of 129 cases from 1984 to 1988.
 A retrospective study was performed to compare elective versus emergency cesarean hysterectomy in a residency program.
 We noted the following statistically significant differences between emergency and elective cases: (1) Estimated blood loss (mean +/- SD) for emergency and elective cases was significantly different at 1495 +/- 772 and 875 +/- 396 ml (p = 0.001).
 (2) Operative time in emergency cases was significantly longer than in elective cases (105 +/- 38 vs 83 +/- 27 minutes, p = 0.003).
 (3) The incidence of transfusion was 68% in our emergency cases and 14.6% in the elective series (p less than 0.05).
 (4) Febrile morbidity in our series was 40% in emergency cases and 18.3% in elective cases (p less than 0.05).
 Our series was comparable to previous series reported.
 Our experience suggests that cesarean hysterectomy can be performed safely in a residency training program when done as an elective procedure in the well-prepared patient.
