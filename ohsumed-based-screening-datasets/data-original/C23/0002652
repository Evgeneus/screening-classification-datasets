Definitive mandibular replacement using reconstruction plates.
 Mandibular defects following radical cancer surgery continue to provide challenges to head and neck surgeons.
 Twenty-seven patients with advanced oral cancer underwent primary mandibular replacement with metal reconstruction plates without the use of bone.
 Twenty-one patients (78%) had successful reconstruction with primary soft tissue healing.
 Six patients required removal of the plate in the postoperative period.
 Two of these patients had their reconstruction plates replaced as a secondary procedure following soft tissue healing.
 Thus, 23 of 27 patients (85%) had final mandibular reconstruction and were followed for an average of 19 months.
 Functional and cosmetic results were satisfactory.
 For patients with advanced disease, this technique compares favorably with microvascular transfer in terms of operating time and donor defect.
 Despite problems with plate exposure, the initial and overall success rates of 78% and 85%, respectively, make the use of these plates a reasonable choice for immediate reconstructive needs in patients with difficult tumors.
