New method for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures.
 A new technique is described for dealing with late-presenting spontaneous esophageal ruptures.
 This method requires only a short period of general anesthesia to drain the periesophageal abscess by a drainage tube inserted into the abscess cavity from the esophagus with the aid of a gastroscope and fluoroscopy.
 Gastric fluids are diverted from the esophageal rupture with a gastrostomy, and a jejunostomy is used for enteral feeding.
 The esophagus is retained, and closure of the fistula with resumption of normal swallowing is documented with serial sinograms.
