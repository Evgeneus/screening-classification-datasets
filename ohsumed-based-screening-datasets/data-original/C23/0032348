The treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
 While metastatic breast cancer is not curable, it is treatable.
 Its treatment is associated with a relatively high rate of success, and patients are able to maintain a good quality of life for periods ranging from a few months to several years.
 This knowledge should encourage both the patient and the oncologist to maintain treatment as long as potentially effective therapeutic methods are available.
 Progress is ongoing both in the development of new forms of treatment and in new ways of using and combining already existing therapeutic modalities.
 There is still no established "best" or "only" first treatment of metastatic breast cancer.
 When secondary and later treatment is to be undertaken, the task of selecting the most appropriate treatment becomes even more complex.
 It is only through controlled clinical trials that useful therapeutic guidelines will develop.
 Treatment is a joint endeavor involving both the physician and the patient.
 Communication must remain open.
 In the final stages of the illness, treatment should be directed toward the relief of distressing symptoms and anxiety.
