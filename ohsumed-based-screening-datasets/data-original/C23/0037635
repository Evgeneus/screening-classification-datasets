Differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to adipocytes induced by transfection of ras oncogenes.
 Mammalian 3T3-L1 cells differentiate into adipocytes after continuous exposure to pharmacological doses of insulin or physiological doses of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1).
 Expression of transfected ras oncogenes led to differentiation of these cells into adipocytes in the absence of externally added insulin or IGF-I.
 Cells transfected with normal ras genes or the tyrosine kinase trk oncogene did not differentiate.
 Transfection with a dominant inhibitory ras mutant resulted in inhibition of differentiation.
 Exposure of untransfected 3T3-L1 cells to insulin stimulated formation of the active Ras.GTP complex.
 These observations indicate that Ras proteins participate in signal transduction pathways initiated by insulin and IGF-I in these cells.
