Prevalence of angioid streaks and other ocular complications of Paget's disease of bone.
 Seventy randomly selected patients with Paget's disease of bone were examined for ocular complications.
 The prevalence of macular degeneration and cataract was 24.3%.
 Only one patient was found to have angioid streaks.
 Eight patients had peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy.
 These findings suggest that the prevalence of serious ocular complications of Paget's disease is not as high as previously thought.
 The significance of peripapillary chorioretinal atrophy requires further evaluation.
