Exercise-induced ventricular tachycardia in association with a myocardial bridge.
 Sustained ventricular tachycardia induced by exercise is uncommon.
 This is a report of a patient who has a positive exercise test at a high level of exercise.
 The electrocardiogram has classic ischemic ST depressions.
 Following the appearance of these ST depressions, the patient developed ventricular tachycardia at a rapid rate.
 Workup that included an echocardiogram and cardiac catheterization revealed myocardial bridging of the left anterior descending artery as the only structural abnormality.
 Electrophysiologic studies revealed the patient to have ventricular tachycardia only with isoproterenol (Isuprel) infusion.
