Endometriosis associated with massive ascites and absence of pelvic peritoneum.
 Although massive ascites associated with endometriosis has been reported in rare cases, this patient was also noted to have massive destruction of the pelvic peritoneum.
 Failure of medical suppression necessitated total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
 Several months after surgery ascites resolved, possibly with reestablishment of the pelvic peritoneum.
