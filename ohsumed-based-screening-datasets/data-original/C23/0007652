Platysma myocutaneous flap for repair of hypopharyngeal strictures.
 Hypopharyngeal strictures, either isolated or in conjunction with laryngeal and esophageal strictures, can occur following lye ingestion.
 Extensive stricture formation requires reconstruction to create a functional funnel system that empties below the cricoid.
 Esophageal replacement is not a substitute for adequate hypopharyngeal reconstruction.
 The pectoralis major muscle is often inadequate, because it yields too much bulk and often leads to continued aspiration.
 The platysma myocutaneous flap for hypopharyngeal reconstruction has not been previously reported.
 The inferiorly based platysma myocutaneous flap was used in two of our patients with lye burns, and bilateral superiorly based flaps were used in one.
 All are able to eat normally and have no significant stenosis.
 The platysma myocutaneous flap is a relatively simple and reliable alternative that is within the capability of every head and neck surgeon.
