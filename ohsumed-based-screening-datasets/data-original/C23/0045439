Effects of sleep-induced increases in upper airway resistance on ventilation.
 To determine the effects of the sleep-induced increases in upper airway resistance on ventilatory output, we studied five subjects who were habitual snorers but otherwise normal while awake (AW) and during non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep under the following conditions: 1) stage 2, low-resistance sleep (LRS); 2) stage 3-4, high-resistance sleep (HRS) (snoring); 3) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP); 4) CPAP + end-tidal CO2 partial pressure (PETCO2) mode isocapnic to LRS; and 5) CPAP + PETCO2 isocapnic to HRS.
 We measured ventilatory output via pneumotachograph in the nasal mask, PETCO2, esophageal pressure, inspiratory and expiratory resistance (RL,I and RL,E).
 Changes in PETCO2 were confirmed with PCO2 measurements in arterialized venous blood in all conditions in one subject.
 During wakefulness, pulmonary resistance (RL) remained constant throughout inspiration, whereas in stage 2 and especially in stage 3-4 NREM sleep, RL rose markedly throughout inspiration.
 Expired minute ventilation (VE) decreased by 12% in HRS, and PETCO2 increased in LRS (3.3 Torr) and HRS (4.9 Torr).
 CPAP decreased RL,I to AW levels and increased end-expiratory lung volume 0.25-0.93 liter.
 Tidal volume (VT) and mean inspiratory flow rate (VT/TI) increased significantly with CPAP.
 Inspiratory time (TI) shortened, and PETCO2 decreased 3.6 Torr but remained 1.3 Torr above AW.
 During CPAP (RL,I equal to AW), with PETCO2 returned to the level of LRS, VT/TI and VE were 83 and 52% higher than during LRS alone.
 Also on CPAP, with PETCO2 made equal to HRS, VT, VT/TI, and VE were 67, 112, and 67% higher than during HRS alone.
