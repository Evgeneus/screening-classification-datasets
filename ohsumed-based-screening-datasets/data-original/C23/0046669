Pulmonary vascular reactivity and permeability to alveolar hypoxia in the dog.
 Hemodynamics and vascular permeability were studied during acute alveolar hypoxia in isolated canine lung lobes perfused at constant flow with autogenous blood.
 Hypoxia was induced in the presence (COI + Hypox, n = 6) or absence (Hypox, n = 6) of cyclooxygenase inhibition (COI) with indomethacin or meclofenamate.
 Hypoxic ventilation reduced blood PO2 from 143 to 25-29 Torr without a change in PCO2.
 During hypoxia a capillary filtration coefficient (Kf) was obtained gravimetrically as an index of vascular permeability to water.
 In COI + Hypox, pulmonary arterial pressure (Pa) increased from 11.5 +/- 0.7, post-COI normoxia, to a peak of 22.1 +/- 2.3 during hypoxia (P less than 0.01) without a change in capillary pressure (Pc).
 In contrast, hypoxia changed neither Pa nor Pc in Hypox relative to an untreated normoxic control group (Normox, n = 6, P greater than 0.05).
 Kfs (means +/- SE in ml.min-1.Torr-1.100 g-1) for Normox (0.070 +/- 0.014), Hypox (0.082 +/- 0.024), and COI + Hypox (0.057 +/- 0.017) did not differ from one another (P greater than 0.05).
 Although COI markedly enhanced the pressor response to acute alveolar hypoxia, hypoxia increased neither Pc nor vascular permeability regardless of COI.
