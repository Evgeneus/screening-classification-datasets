Abdominal muscle activity during CO2 rebreathing in sleeping neonates.
 Comparison of the abdominal muscle response to CO2 rebreathing in rapid-eye-movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep was performed in healthy premature infants near full term.
 Eight subjects were studied at a postconceptional age of 40 +/- 1.6 (SD) wk (range 38-43 wk) during spontaneous sleep.
 Sleep stages were defined on the basis of electrophysiological and behavioral criteria, and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activity was recorded by cutaneous electrodes.
 The responses to CO2 were measured by a modified Read rebreathing technique.
 The minute ventilation and diaphragmatic and abdominal muscle electromyographic activities were calculated and plotted against end-tidal CO2 partial pressure.
 Both the ventilatory and diaphragmatic muscle responses to CO2 decreased from NREM to REM sleep (P less than 0.05).
 Abdominal muscles were forcefully recruited in response to CO2 rebreathing during NREM sleep.
 In REM sleep, abdominal muscle response to CO2 was virtually absent or decreased compared with NREM sleep (P less than 0.05).
 We conclude that 1) the abdominal muscles are recruited during NREM sleep in response to CO2 rebreathing in healthy premature infants near full term and 2) the abdominal muscle recruitment is inhibited during REM sleep compared with NREM sleep, and this REM sleep-related inhibition probably contributes to the decrease in the ventilatory response to CO2 rebreathing in REM sleep.
