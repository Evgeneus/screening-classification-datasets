Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity following duodenal ulcer healing with omeprazole, sucralfate, and Maalox.
 Acid secretory responses and parietal cell sensitivity (PCS) have been studied in 21 duodenal ulcer patients before and after successful treatment with omeprazole (n = 7), sucralfate (n = 7), or Maalox (n = 7).
 The second study was carried out 3 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the sucralfate- and Maalox-treated groups and 14 days after documented healing and withdrawal of treatment in the omeprazole-treated patients.
 Acid output (mmol/hour) was measured as basal secretion, and in response to 0.1 microgram/kg/hour pentagastrin (low-dose) and 6.0 micrograms/kg/hour pentagastrin (high-dose) stimulation.
 PCS was calculated as the ratio of low dose:high dose acid output (expressed as a percentage).
 Ulcer healing with sucralfate resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in low-dose acid output from 36.4% (13.2-51.0) (median [range]) to 8.4% (3.2-45.4) mmol/hour and PCS from 69.1% (44.9-91.4) to 22.0% (16.0-85.6), whereas no significant decreases in any of the measured parameters were noted following ulcer healing with Maalox.
 Ulcer healing with omeprazole resulted in significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in basal acid output from 6.3 (1.5-22.9) (median [range]) to 2.2 (0-6.9) mmol/hour, and low-dose acid output from 31.0 (6.0-58.0) to 23.0 (1.4-44.8) mmol/hour.
 These findings suggest that acid secretory responses following ulcer healing vary according to the therapeutic agent used.
