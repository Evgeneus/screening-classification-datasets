Advances in noninvasive detection of CAD.
 Advances in the noninvasive detection of myocardial ischemia are increasing our ability to diagnose coronary artery disease (CAD).
 Tomographic (SPECT) thallium imaging provides better identification of coronary arteries with atherosclerotic narrowing.
 Increased lung thallium uptake and transient ischemic dilatation of the heart are additional markers of severe CAD.
 Late thallium imaging, as well as reinjection imaging, provides more accurate identification of myocardial ischemia.
 Finally, new myocardial ischemia.
 Finally, new myocardial imaging agents, such as technetium Tc 99m sestamibi (Cardiolite), should improve detection of CAD by noninvasive methods.
