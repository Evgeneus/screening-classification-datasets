Multiple coronary artery-left ventricular fistulae: clinical, angiographic, and pathologic findings.
 Multiple fistulae between all 3 major coronary arteries and the left ventricle were found at cardiac catheterization in a 69-year-old woman presenting with typical angina.
 Subsequent necropsy showed abnormal intramyocardial vessels communicating with the left ventricular lumen.
 This is the first report to document clinical, angiographic, and pathologic findings in this anomaly.
