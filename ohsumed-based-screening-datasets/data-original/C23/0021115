Hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome.
 A 66-year-old woman with Pendred's syndrome underwent a partial thyroidectomy when she was 17 years old.
 At the age of 52 years, she had a second thyroid operation because of hyperthyroidism due to a toxic multinodular goiter with a mediastinal extension consisting of several separate nodules.
 Five years later a hyperfunctioning metastatic follicular carcinoma was diagnosed histologically.
 After treatment with radioactive iodine, the patient was well.
 To the authors' knowledge, this is the first description of a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma in Pendred's syndrome and the first report of hyperthyroidism occurring after malignant degeneration of a dyshormonogenetic goiter.
