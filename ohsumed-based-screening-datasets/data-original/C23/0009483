Events following implantation of an intraluminal ringed prosthesis in the ascending, transverse, and descending thoracic aorta.
 From March 1978 through July 1985, 23 patients underwent implantation of 24 intraluminal ringed prostheses (IRP).
 There were 18 men and 5 women, with a mean age of 54.7 years, range 15-74 years.
 Eleven IRP were placed in the ascending aorta, two in the transverse arch, and 11 in the descending aorta.
 Pathology included acute aortic dissection in four patients, chronic dissection in four, and aortic aneurysm in 16.
 There were eight hospital deaths (35%).
 Causes of death included acute cardiac failure in seven patients, and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in one.
 IRP complications requiring revision included right coronary artery occlusion in three of 11 patients (27%) with an IRP in the ascending aorta.
 Graft revision was also required in three of 11 IRP implanted in the descending aorta (27%), due to graft occlusion in one and graft stenosis in two.
 Of the six patients with IRP complications, there were three hospital deaths (50%).
 All 15 hospital survivors were followed for a mean of 68.5 months, range 5-112 months.
 There were four late deaths (26.7%).
 Causes of late death included hemoptysis in one, cardiomyopathy in one, and aortic redissection and rupture in two.
 We conclude that patients undergoing repair of aortic pathology with IRP have an important risk of early phase events, as technical problems can occur due to malposition and slippage of the securing rings.
