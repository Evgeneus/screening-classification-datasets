Real-time digital contrast enhancement and magnification in the assessment of acute elbow injuries.
 The elbow is a common site of injury and missed fractures may lead to disability and litigation.
 An assessment was made of a commercially available desk-top digital contrast enhancement and magnification unit (DETECT system) in a series of 320 patients with an acute elbow injury.
 Five radiologists of varying experience independently viewed elbow radiographs on a conventional light-box, and subsequently using the digitizer, indicating the presence or absence of a fracture.
 The overall results demonstrated no difference in performance when using the unit, though small improvements in the confidence with which a definite diagnosis was made were observed.
 Assessment of soft tissues with the digitizer was less reliable.
