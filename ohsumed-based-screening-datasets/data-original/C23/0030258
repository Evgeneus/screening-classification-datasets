New treatments for Chlamydia trachomatis.
 Standard regimens of tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin, if compiled with, appear to be effective against Chlamydia trachomatis infections under most circumstances.
 However, the organism may sometimes persist despite what would seem to be adequate therapy.
 How often this occurs, to what extent noncompliance is the issue, and the role antibiotic resistance plays remain to be determined.
 Among newer antibiotics, azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of uncomplicated urogenital C.
 trachomatis infections.
 Single-dose therapy with azithromycin may be especially useful in overcoming compliance problems associated with the treatment of sexually transmitted disease.
