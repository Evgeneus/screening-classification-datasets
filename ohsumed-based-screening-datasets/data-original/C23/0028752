Effect of inspired oxygen concentration on the incidence of desaturation in patients undergoing total hip replacement.
 The effect of inspired oxygen concentration on the incidence of desaturation was studied in two groups of patients (n = 32 and 31) during total hip replacement.
 During insertion of acrylic bone cement, those patients receiving an inspired fractional oxygen concentration (FIO2) of 0.5 had less desaturation (3%) than those receiving an FIO2 of 0.33 (34%).
