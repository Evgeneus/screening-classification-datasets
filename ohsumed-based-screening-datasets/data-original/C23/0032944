Occlusive peripheral vascular disease: a multicenter trial of fluorescence-guided, pulsed dye laser-assisted balloon angioplasty.
 Fluorescence-guided, laser-assisted balloon angioplasty was performed in 129 patients with iliac and femoropopliteal artery chronic occlusions (range, 0.5-50.0 cm; mean length, 9.9 cm) after failure of recanalization with standard guide-wire techniques.
 Laser recanalization and short-term angiographic success were achieved in 101 (72%) and 95 (68%) of 140 occlusions, respectively.
 Laser and balloon angioplasty failures were encountered in heavily calcified plaques or after perforations and dissections.
 Complications included perforations (19%), hematomas (5%), thromboses (4%), and distal embolizations (4%).
 Real-time fluorescence spectroscopy identified thrombus, white fibrous plaque, and media but could not avoid perforations in many cases because laser wire advancement outdistanced fluorescence sensing.
 Disruption of tissue by means of pressure transients and/or mechanical advancement occurred in at least 36% of lesions where the laser energy was insufficient (less than 0.4 J/cm) to ablate significant tissue.
 Integration of fluorescence guidance with pulsed dye laser ablation is feasible, but additional refinements are necessary to increase safety and efficacy.
