Relative importance of eight virulence characteristics of pyelonephritogenic Escherichia coli strains assessed by multivariate statistical analysis.
 We have previously reported univariate statistical analysis of the prevalences of putative virulence determinants in Escherichia coli isolated from children and adults with acute pyelonephritis.
 The expression of P-fimbriae, cell surface hydrophobicity, mannose resistant haemagglutination, haemolysin synthesis, cytotoxic necrotizing factor production and aerobactin mediated iron uptake occurred more often in a collection of 115 Escherichia coli strains isolated from children and women with acute non-obstructive pyelonephritis compared to 96 strains isolated from the commensal fecal flora.
 With the aim to study which of these virulence markers were independently associated with strains causing infection we performed a multivariate statistical analysis with the data from these strains.
 The previously proposed virulence factors, expression of type 1 fimbriae and adhesion to HeLa cells were also included in the analysis.
 P-fimbriae, mannose resistant haemagglutination and the production of haemolysin were, in the multivariate analysis, associated with strains isolated from patients with acute pyelonephritis.
