Effects of treadmill exercise to exhaustion on the insulin response to hyperglycemia in untrained men.
 The effects of a single bout of exercise to exhaustion on pancreatic insulin secretion were determined in seven untrained men by use of a 3-h hyperglycemic clamp with plasma glucose maintained at 180 mg/100 ml.
 Clamps were performed either 12 h after an intermittent treadmill run at approximately 77% maximum O2 consumption or without prior exercise.
 Arterialized blood samples for glucose, insulin, and C-peptide determination were obtained from a heated hand vein.
 The peak insulin response during the early phase (0-10 min) of the postexercise clamp was higher (81 +/- 8 vs.
 59 +/- 9 microU/ml; P less than 0.05) than in the nonexercise clamp.
 Incremental areas under the insulin (376 +/- 33 vs.
 245 +/- 51 microU.ml-1.min) and C-peptide (17 +/- 2 vs.
 12 +/- 1 ng.ml-1.min) curves were also greater (P less than 0.05) during the early phase of the postexercise clamp.
 No differences were observed in either insulin concentrations or whole body glucose disposal during the late phase (15-180 min).
 Area under the C-peptide curve was greater during the late phase of the postexercise clamp (650 +/- 53 vs.
 536 +/- 76 ng.ml-1.min, P less than 0.05).
 The exercise bout induced muscle soreness and caused an elevation in plasma creatine kinase activity (142 +/- 32 vs.
 305 +/- 31 IU/l; P less than 0.05) before the postexercise clamp.
 We conclude that in untrained men a bout of running to exhaustion increased pancreatic beta-cell insulin secretion during the early phase of the hyperglycemic clamp.
 Increased insulin secretion during the late phase of the clamp appeared to be compensated by increased insulin clearance.
