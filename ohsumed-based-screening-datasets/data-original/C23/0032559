Body image dissatisfaction in homosexual and heterosexual males.
 A nonclinical sample of 43 homosexual and 32 heterosexual men completed two self-report inventories regarding weight, body satisfaction, eating attitudes, and behaviors.
 Subjects were also asked to select their current and ideal figures, the weight they felt would be most attractive to a potential partner, and the weight to which they would be most attracted in a potential partner from figures representing very thin to very heavy physiques.
 Heterosexual men were significantly heavier than homosexual men and desired a significantly heavier ideal weight.
 Although the current and ideal physiques selected by the homosexual and heterosexual men were almost identical, homosexual men were more likely to desire an underweight ideal.
 A heightened pursuit of thinness may place homosexual men at an increased risk for developing eating disorders.
