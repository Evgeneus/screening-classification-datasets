Nonpalpable invasive breast cancer.
 The use of mammography has resulted in 1464 breast biopsies for nonpalpable abnormalities at the University of Virginia in the 10 years 1980 to 1989.
 Two hundred sixty-four cancerous lesions (18%) were found.
 One hundred seventy-eight of these (67%) were in situ lesions.
 Invasive cancer (86 of 264 lesions or 33%) forms the basis for this report.
 Mammographic findings leading to biopsy were a mass in 61 of 86 cases (71%), microcalcifications in 23 of 86 (27%), or both in 2 of 86 cases.
 Histologic subtypes were infiltrating ductal (63 of 86), infiltrating lobular (14 of 86), and other infiltrating (9 of 86).
 Mastectomy was performed in 71 of 86 lesions (82%), lumpectomy/radiation in 14 of 86 (16%), and lumpectomy alone in 1 of 86 lesions.
 Division of the tumors into size with nodal status revealed 19 of 86 lesions (22%) less than 0.5 cm with 0 of 14 positive nodes.
 Thirty-nine of eighty-six lesions (46%) measured 0.6 to 1.0 cm with 10 (26%) positive nodes.
 Twenty-eight of eighty-six lesions (32%) measured more than 1.0 cm with 8 of 28 (28%) positive nodes.
 Nodal status is unknown for eight patients.
 Overall 18 of 78 lesions (23%) had positive nodes.
 Median follow-up is 44 months.
 Disease-free survival rate is 92% (79 of 86 patients) and overall survival rate is 94% (81 of 86 patients).
 Six of seven recurrences occurred in node-positive patients.
 For those with negative or unknown nodes, the disease-free survival rate is 98% (67 of 68 patients).
 These findings emphasize the benefit of early detection of breast cancer through the use of mammography.
