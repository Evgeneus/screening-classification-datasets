Prevention of anastomosis leakage: an artificial connective tissue.
 Anastomosis leakage still causes considerable morbidity and mortality after digestive tract surgery.
 We report here our experience of the use of reconstituted connective tissue created from elastin, fibronectin and collagen in preventing anastomosis leakage and closing intestinal fistulas.
 In animal studies (56 rats), this connective tissue was used as a patch applied with fibrin sealant to the edges of a 1 cm diameter colonic defect.
 In a clinical evaluation, eight patients had an intestinal fistula closed by a simple sewn suture reinforced by a sealed patch and seven patients had a high risk anastomosis reinforced by a sealed patch, in most cases as an alternative to staged surgery.
 In animal studies, complete reconstitution of the three colonic layers was obtained without retraction and without inflammatory reaction within 40 days, while the patch was slowly resorbed.
 In clinical trials all 15 defects and anastomoses healed without complication.
 Three patients died from other causes and, at autopsy, the patch was found to have remained in place covering the suture line.
 If these results are confirmed by a prospective clinical trial, such biomaterial offers the possibility of reducing the occurrence of anastomosis leakage, especially in high risk circumstances.
