One-stage laryngotracheoplasty.
 This article documents the evolution of our approach to the repair of subglottic stenosis in infants.
 With increasing experience in the management of subglottic stenosis using the anterior cricoid split procedure, we extended our procedure to include older children.
 This then led to the use of the one-stage procedure for repair of severe and mature subglottic stenosis.
 We present the results of surgical repair in 13 patients.
 Extubation was accomplished in 12 of 13 patients using one-stage laryngotracheoplasty.
