Lateral rhachotomy for thoracic spinal lesions.
 Capener's "Lateral Rhachotomy" was modified by additional excision of the pedicle, articular facets, part of the lamina, and a posterior half of the vertebral bodies on one side through a transpleural approach to the thoracic spine, and a retroperitoneal approach to the lumbar spine.
 The aim was to excise a space-occupying lesion, which exists in front of the thoracic or lumbar spinal cord, safely.
 This modification enable the authors to expose more than 50% of the spinal canal, and decompress it from its anterior, lateral, and posterior compressing mass.
 The utmost important point of this procedure is the excision of the lesion under the direct visualization of the dura.
 In ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), the dura is usually indented by the thick bony mass, and the lesion extends over a few segment with adhesion.
 Using "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy," it was possible to explore three or four vertebral levels in continuity through the same skin incision.
 In the present report, the authors described their "Modified Lateral Rhachotomy" procedure, and reviewed the case material.
