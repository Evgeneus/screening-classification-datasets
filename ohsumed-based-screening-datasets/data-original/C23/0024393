Renal transplant pyelocaliectasis: role of duplex Doppler US in evaluation.
 To distinguish the obstructed from the nonobstructed dilated collecting system of transplanted kidneys without interventional diagnostic measures, the authors prospectively evaluated duplex Doppler analysis (determination of resistive index [RI]) in 35 renal transplant patients with pyelocaliectasis.
 Proof of the presence or absence of obstruction was obtained at interventional procedures in 18 patients and at clinical follow-up in 17.
 Thirteen kidneys were obstructed (mean RI, .81 +/- .06), while 22 had nonobstructive dilatation (mean RI, .66 +/- .07).
 The RI difference was statistically significant (P less than or equal to .01).
 Of 21 kidneys with a normal RI, only two had obstruction.
 In both of these, the obstruction was associated with a significant peritransplant collection of fluid due to a ureteral leak.
 In the seven obstructed transplanted kidneys with follow-up, the mean RI was .82 +/- .06 before nephrostomy and .67 +/- .05 after nephrostomy.
 Obstruction was a common cause of an elevated RI (greater than or equal to .75).
 Other causes of transplant dysfunction can be associated with an elevated RI and nonobstructed dilatation.
 More important, a normal RI should strongly argue against obstruction unless a ureteral leak is also present.
