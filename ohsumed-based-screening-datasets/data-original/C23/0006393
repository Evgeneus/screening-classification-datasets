Clinical and manometric aspects of diffuse esophageal spasm in a cohort of subjects evaluated for dysphagia and/or chest pain.
 Manometric criteria for diffuse esophageal spasm have recently been restated.
 In this study, a cohort of 358 subjects was evaluated in a gastrointestinal motility laboratory for dysphagia and/or chest pain.
 Applying the recently proposed criteria of Richter and Castell, 18 subjects (5%) were diagnosed as having DES.
 Dysphagia was the major complaint (89%), while 44% of patients complained of chest pain and 33% of both symptoms.
 All patients shared more than 30% simultaneous contractions after wet swallows interspersed with normal peristaltic sequences.
 Associated manometric findings were repetitive (greater than 3 peaks) contractions (67%), high-amplitude contractions (33%), spontaneous activity (22%), prolonged duration (11%), and lower esophageal sphincter abnormalities (5%).
 Radiology disclosed significant abnormalities in only 27% of DES patients.
