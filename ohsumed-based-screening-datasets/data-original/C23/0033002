External fistulas arising from the digestive tract.
 External abdominal fistulas that arise from the digestive tract are associated with high mortality and prolonged morbidity in terms of infection, malnutrition, and skin excoriation.
 Such external fistulas most commonly follow anastomotic leak after gastrointestinal surgery.
 We identified 58 patients seen over a 5-year period at the University of Louisville Hospitals because of external abdominal fistulas that arose from the stomach (8), duodenum (4), small intestine (26), colon (14), biliary tract (9), and pancreas (7).
 Fifteen patients had multiple fistulas and 32 had high-output fistulas (greater than 200 mL/day).
 Closure was achieved in 48 patients, and eight of the 10 patients whose fistulas remained open died.
 Overall mortality was 19%.
 Principles of management include control of infection, correction of fluid and electrolyte imbalance, nutritional support, proper wound care, and often operative intervention.
 Multiple staged operations over many months were particularly important in managing complex wounds with large abdominal wall defects and multiple fistulas.
 Fistula closure is the ultimate goal, and patience is important to achieve it.
