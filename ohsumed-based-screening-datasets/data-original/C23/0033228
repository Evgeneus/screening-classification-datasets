Malaria in an urban emergency department: epidemiology and diagnostic features of 25 cases.
 This article presents a retrospective study of 25 patients diagnosed with malaria in an urban emergency department (ED) between June 1986 and June 1989.
 The mean annual case rate of malaria in this study group was more than three times the national rate.
 This may be ascribed to the notable ethnic diversity of the population.
 A history of travel to an area endemic for malaria was eventually elicited from all patients.
 The most common chief complaint was fever (56%) followed by abdominal pain (12%).
 Temperatures were elevated in 70% of the patients, with a mean temperature of 102.9 degrees F (39 degrees C).
 Gender was found to play a role in delaying diagnosis, with women accounting for 83% of a group of patients requiring multiple ED visits before diagnosis.
 The authors conclude that malaria must be considered when diagnosing patients in ethnically diverse populations.
 Gender may be associated with a delay in diagnosis.
 A careful travel history and a peripheral smear are aids in rapid diagnosis.
