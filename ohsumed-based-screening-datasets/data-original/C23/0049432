Auditory screening of infants.
 Within the last 20 years, infant hearing screening has progressed from a laudable goal to a state-mandated reality in many areas of the United States.
 The high risk register provides a means by which history and neonatal physical examination can be used to identify the infant at risk for hearing loss.
 Two procedures (crib-O-gram and auditory brainstem-evoked response) have been the most common methods of screening for hearing loss in the newborn or in intensive care nurseries.
 Evoked cochlear emissions reportedly are identifiable in 90 to 100% of normal-hearing infants.
 This observation has lead to the use of evoked otoacoustic emissions as a hearing screening procedure with infants.
