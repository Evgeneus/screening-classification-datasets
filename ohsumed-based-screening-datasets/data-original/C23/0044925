The Damus-Fontan procedure.
 The Damus-Kaye-Stansel operation is a useful technique for the treatment of complex cyanotic congenital heart disease when there is obstruction between the systemic ventricle and the aorta.
 Modifications of the technique include transection of the aorta and the pulmonary artery, anastomosis of the contiguous aortic and pulmonary walls, and connection of the distal aorta to the perimeter of the new bivalved proximal great artery.
 In addition, the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt technique can be used with or without the Fontan procedure.
 Six patients underwent a Damus-Fontan operation, and all survived.
 Two patients underwent the Damus-cavopulmonary shunt (hemi-Fontan) procedure, and 1 survived.
 The postoperative status of the 7 survivors is good to excellent.
 Follow-up ranges from 2 months to 7 1/2 years.
