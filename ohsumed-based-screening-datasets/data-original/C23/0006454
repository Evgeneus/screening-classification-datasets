Adhesion formation after ovarian wound repair in New Zealand white rabbits: a comparison of ovarian microsurgical closure with ovarian nonclosure.
 Thirty female New Zealand white rabbits underwent standard laparotomy.
 Each ovary was bivalved and hemostasis was achieved with bipolar electrocautery.
 One ovary was then randomized to the closure group, whereas the other ovary was placed in the nonclosure group.
 In the closure group, the ovarian capsule was closed with a continuous suture of 8-0 Vicryl absorbable surgical suture material with microsurgical technique.
 In the nonclosure group, the ovaries were left open.
 Three weeks later the animals were killed and the ovarian adhesions were graded with a standardized scale by an observer (A.
 A.
 T.) blinded to the closure status of the animals.
 Five control animals underwent sham operations with minimal adhesion formation.
 Statistical analysis of the study animals by the paired Student t test showed a significantly higher adhesion score on the ovaries that were microsurgically closed compared with the ovaries not closed (p = 0.02).
