FK 506 reverses acute graft-versus-host disease after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in rats.
 Severe graft-versus-host disease was induced by transplantation of ACI rat bone marrow and spleen cells into irradiated Lewis rat recipients.
 Treatment with FK 506 or cyclosporine A (CsA) was started after clinical and histologic evidence of acute GVHD was present.
 A 14-day course of FK 506 at 1.0 mg/kg/day could rescue 100% of the animals suffering from GVHD.
 In contrast only one half of the animals treated with CsA at a high dose of 25 mg/kg/day recovered.
 After cessation of immunosuppressive therapy, FK 506-treated animals displayed a marked prolonged disease-free interval as compared to CsA-treated bone marrow recipients.
 Recurrence of the disease in these animals could be prevented when FK 506 treatment was continued after the induction period with a low maintenance dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day every other day.
