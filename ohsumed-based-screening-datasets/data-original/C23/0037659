Pentoxifylline restores intestinal microvascular blood flow during resuscitated hemorrhagic shock.
 We studied the intestinal microvascular blood flow responses to hemorrhage and resuscitation with pentoxifylline by in vivo video microscopy.
 Male Sprague-Dawley rats were hemorrhaged to 50% of baseline mean arterial pressure for 45 minutes and then blindly randomized to receive pentoxifylline (25 mg/kg bolus + 0.2 mg/kg/minute) or an equivalent volume of saline plus return of shed blood and an additional bled volume of Ringer's lactate solution.
 Hemorrhage caused intestinal microvascular blood flow to decrease to 10% to 15% of baseline values.
 In the control group, resuscitation restored cardiac output and mean arterial pressure to baseline values, but intestinal microvascular blood flow remained at 30% of baseline values.
 In contrast, addition of pentoxifylline to the resuscitation regimen resulted in an immediate hyperemic response with an increase in intestinal microvascular blood flow to significantly greater than baseline values followed by return to baseline.
 Arteriolar dilation was not responsible for the improvement in flow implicating improved flow dynamics between erythrocytes, granulocytes, and vascular endothelia within the microcirculation.
 We conclude that addition of pentoxifylline to resuscitation from hemorrhagic shock restores intestinal microvascular blood flow.
