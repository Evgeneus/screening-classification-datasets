The Sugiura procedure for patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis.
 The Sugiura procedure (SP) was performed upon 27 patients with hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to extrahepatic portal vein thrombosis (EPVT) without associated hepatic disease.
 There were 14 female and 13 male patients.
 The mean age was 28 +/- 14 years.
 The causes of EPVT were protein C deficiency in two; antithrombin III deficiency in one patient, a history of omphalitis in two patients, a history of pancreatitis in one patient and idiopathy in 21 patients.
 The SP was completed in two surgical stages in 14 patients and in one stage in nine.
 There was one operative death.
 One patient had mild postoperative encephalopathy, and two patients rebled at long term follow-up study.
 Actuarial survival rate was 82 per cent at five and ten years.
 It is concluded that the SP is a good alternative for the management of hemorrhagic portal hypertension secondary to EPVT.
