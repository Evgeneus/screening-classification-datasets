Maintenance treatment of duodenal ulceration: ranitidine 300 mg at night is better than 150 mg in cigarette smokers.
 Two hundred patients received either ranitidine 150 mg or 300 mg at night for 18 months to prevent duodenal ulcer relapse.
 Recurrence rates were lower in patients receiving the higher dose of ranitidine (3.1% v 9.7%, p = 0.78; 6.5% v 16.7%, p = 0.037; and 8.9% v 17.0%, p = 0.121 at six, 12, and 18 months respectively).
 In patients receiving ranitidine 150 mg, recurrences were significantly more common in smokers than non-smokers after 12 and 18 months, while in patients receiving ranitidine 300 mg recurrence rates were similar in smokers and non-smokers.
 Ranitidine 300 mg at night abolishes the adverse effect of smoking observed during maintenance treatment with ranitidine 150 mg at night and may therefore be an appropriate maintenance dose for smokers who relapse during standard dose maintenance treatment.
