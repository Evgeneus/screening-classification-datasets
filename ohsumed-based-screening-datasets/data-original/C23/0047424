A case of chronic GM1 gangliosidosis presenting as dystonia: clinical and biochemical studies.
 Clinical and biochemical studies are reported on a 32-year-old man with GM1 gangliosidosis who presented with a slowly progressive dystonia that began when he was aged 7 years and eventually became almost totally incapacitating at the age of 35.
 There was only mild intellectual deterioration, but myoclonus, seizures and macular cherry-red spots were never observed.
 Proton-density and T2-weighted MRI scans showed symmetrical hyperintense lesions of both putamina.
 No increase of GM1 ganglioside was found in plasma or cerebrospinal fluid, and the metabolism of GM1 ganglioside in cultured skin fibroblasts from the patient was also almost normal, although the residual activity of GM1 ganglioside beta-galactosidase activity was only 10% of normal.
 These findings suggest that impaired GM1 ganglioside metabolism is not present systemically as it is in the infantile and juvenile types of the disorder, but is mainly confined to the central nervous system in chronic GM1 gangliosidosis.
