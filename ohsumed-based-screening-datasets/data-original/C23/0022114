Prospective pharmacokinetically based development of effective infusion regimens for ACC-9358, a new antiarrhythmic drug.
 In this study we evaluated the clinical pharmacology of intravenous ACC-9358, a new antiarrhythmic drug derived from a Chinese herbal remedy.
 In a first-study phase, 0.125 to 1.0 mg/kg during 10 minutes was administered to six patients with chronic nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias.
 These data were then used to design 3-hour infusions to maintain stable plasma concentrations: these infusions suppressed arrhythmias by 90% or greater for 2 1/2 hours or more at plasma concentrations of 114 to 1010 ng/ml (mean, 400 +/- 421 ng/ml [SD]), and with QRS interval increases of 2.5% to 8.8% (5.1% +/- 2.9%).
 Mean clearance was 478 +/- 151 ml/min, and elimination half-life was 19.1 +/- 6.1 hours.
 ACC-9358 did not produce adverse effects in this study.
 ACC-9358 shows antiarrhythmic activity in humans at concentrations that prolong QRS only slightly and do not alter rate-corrected QT; further studies in other patient populations, at dosages and plasma concentrations defined here, are required to establish a clinical role for ACC-9358.
 The pharmacokinetically based dose-ranging approach allowed the safe initial evaluation of ACC-9358 in patients.
