Solitary, isolated metastasis from Ewing's sarcoma to the brain: case report.
 We report a case of a 30-year-old woman who developed an intraparenchymal cerebral metastasis from a Ewing's sarcoma of the chest wall diagnosed and treated 3 years earlier and in apparent remission at the time of the neurological presentation (seizures).
 The case was complicated by a spontaneous preoperative intratumoral hemorrhage that occurred the morning of the scheduled surgical resection and caused a left dense hemiparesis.
 The tumor and the hematoma were removed.
 The patient improved after surgical intervention and a postoperative course of cranial irradiation followed by systemic chemotherapy was given.
 Nineteen months after treatment the patient remains disease-free from the clinical and radiological standpoint.
