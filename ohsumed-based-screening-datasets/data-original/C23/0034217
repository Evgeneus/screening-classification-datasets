Effect of caffeine on ibuprofen analgesia in postoperative oral surgery pain.
 Recent studies have demonstrated that caffeine acts as an analgesic adjuvant when combined with acetaminophen, aspirin, or their mixture.
 Our objective was to determine whether similar enhancement of analgesia could be demonstrated when caffeine is combined with ibuprofen.
 On a double-blind basis, a single oral dose of ibuprofen (50, 100, or 200 mg), a combination of ibuprofen, 100 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, a combination of ibuprofen, 200 mg, with caffeine, 100 mg, or placebo was randomly assigned to 298 outpatients with postoperative pain after the surgical removal of impacted third molars.
 With a self-rating record, subjects rated their pain and its relief hourly for 8 hours.
 All active treatments were significantly superior to placebo, and the caffeine effect was significant for every measure of analgesia.
 Relative potency estimates indicated that the combination was 2.4 to 2.8 times as potent as ibuprofen alone.
 The combination also had a more rapid onset and longer duration of analgesic action.
 The analgesic adjuvancy of caffeine clearly extends to combinations with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than acetaminophen or aspirin.
