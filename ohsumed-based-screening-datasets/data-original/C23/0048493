Trial of flecainide acetate in the management of tinnitus.
 A two-phase trial of flecainide acetate in the management of tinnitus has been carried out in 22 patients with severe long-term tinnitus resistant to other treatments.
 Although 5 (23%) patients reported some limited benefit the results are not conclusive but suggest that, for such patients, flecainide deserves a place as a drug worth considering as a last resort, with the prospect of it occasionally giving a worthwhile degree of relief.
