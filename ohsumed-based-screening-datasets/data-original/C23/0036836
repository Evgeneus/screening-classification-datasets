John Caffey Award paper. Avascular necrosis: early MR imaging and histologic findings in a canine model.
 To examine the early MR and histologic changes of avascular necrosis, we surgically devascularized the distal femur of adult beagle dogs and performed short TR/short TE MR imaging and histologic examinations.
 MR showed increasing areas of low signal, and histologic examination showed changes of fat necrosis, inflammatory infiltrate, and fibrocytic and bony repair.
 These processes were divided into four stages.
 Stage 1 is seen in the first days after surgery and consists of homogeneous high signal on MR and only subtle histologic changes of early fat necrosis.
 Stage 2, seen by 7 days after surgery, shows linear low-signal areas within the high-signal marrow on MR and fat necrosis and an inflammatory infiltrate on histologic sections.
 Stage 3, seen by 16 days after surgery, shows patchy low signal occupying more of the marrow on MR with a fibrocytic infiltrate on histologic sections.
 Stage 4, seen by 23 days after surgery, shows a more homogeneous low and intermediate signal on MR and histologic findings of more organized fibrocytes and the onset of new bone formation.
 Using this model, we have proved that MR imaging can show marrow changes as soon as 1 week after the onset of avascular necrosis.
 Whereas MR imaging showed a progression of increasing areas of low signal, the histologic findings seen during this time were diverse, including inflammatory infiltration (a previously unreported finding), fat necrosis, and fibrocytic and osseous repair.
