Cleft palate fistulas: a multivariate statistical analysis of prevalence, etiology, and surgical management.
 A retrospective, multivariate statistical analysis of 129 consecutive nonsyndromic patients undergoing cleft palate repair was performed to document the incidence of postoperative fistulas, to determine their cause, and to review methods of surgical management.
 Nasal-alveolar fistulas and/or anterior palatal fistulas that were intentionally not repaired were excluded from study.
 Cleft palate fistulas (CPFs) occurred in 30 of 129 patients (23 percent), although nearly a half were 1 to 2 mm in size.
 Extent of clefting, as estimated by the Veau classification, was significantly more severe in those patients who developed cleft palate fistula.
 Type of palate closure also influenced the frequency of cleft palate fistula.
 Forty-three percent of patients undergoing Wardill-type closures developed cleft palate fistula versus 10, 22, and 0 percent for Furlow, von Langenbeck, and Dorrance style closures, respectively.
 The fistula rate was similar in patients with (30 percent) and without (25 percent) intravelar veloplasty.
 Age at palate closure did not significantly affect the rate of fistulization; however, the surgeon performing the initial closure did not have an effect.
 Thirty-seven percent of patients developed recurrent cleft palate fistulas following initial fistula repair.
 Recurrence of cleft palate fistulas was not influenced by severity of cleft or type of original palate repair.
 Following end-stage management, a second cleft palate fistula recurrence occurred in 25 percent of patients.
 Continued open discussion of results of cleft palate repair is recommended.
