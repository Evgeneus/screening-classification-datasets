Pain threshold levels and coping strategies among patients who have chest pain and normal coronary arteries.
 Patients with noncardiac chest pain (NCCP) tend to show lower pain threshold levels for esophageal balloon distention than do patients with other painful gastrointestinal disorders and healthy controls.
 The NCCP patients also report greater usage of negative pain-coping strategies, less ability to perform specific behaviors to decrease pain, and higher levels of clinical pain than do other patient and healthy control groups.
 Behavioral treatments produce significant decreases in pain and disruption of daily activities.
 Further effort is needed, however, to develop treatments for NCCP that are based on knowledge of the behavioral manifestations of this disorder and the afferent mechanisms involved in perception of visceral pain.
