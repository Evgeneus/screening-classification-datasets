Characterization of the in vitro maturation of monocytes and the susceptibility to HIV infection.
 The in vitro maturation of peripheral blood monocytes to macrophages can be followed morphologically, and by measurement of cell surface antigens (CD4, HLA-DR, and FcR III) and lysozyme production.
 We used these markers to correlate monocyte maturation with susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 Maturation of peripheral blood monocytes is associated with a decrease in membrane CD4, while HLA-DR and FcR III expression increase along with lysozyme secretion.
 Cells at all stages of maturation were susceptible to HIV infection, even mature macrophages without CD4 detectably by immunofluorescent staining.
 Maximal replication was observed in 7-day-old cells.
