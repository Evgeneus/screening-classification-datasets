Biomechanics of fixation systems to the cervical spine.
 The biomechanical evaluation of a cervical spine implant must include flexural and torsional testing if it is used for stabilizing a traumatic unstable motion segment.
 A cadaveric model is presented that allows flexural and torsional testing of a cervical spine motion segment, measuring the tilting angle, the translation, and the torsional angle.
 After measuring the intact segments, in the first series, a so-called posterior instability was created and stabilized posteriorly with the hook-plate and sublaminar wiring; anteriorly with the H-plate; and with combinations of these implants.
 In a second series, their stabilizing effect after complete discoligamentous instability was tested.
 With isolated posterior instability, it was found that the flexural stability is preserved, whereas torsional stability is markedly reduced.
 In cases of isolated posterior instability, only hook plating alone or its combination with anterior H-plating seemed to bring about a higher torsional stability than the intact specimen.
 In cases of complete discoligamentous instability, only anterior H-plate and posterior hook plate procedures combined or the hook plate alone was able to guarantee both torsional and flexural stability higher than the intact spine.
 Exclusive posterior wiring without postoperative external immobilization in complete discoligamentous instability may result in permanent subluxation of the functional unit.
 Exclusive anterior H-plate fixation in complete discoligamentous instability requires additional external immobilization in the postoperative phase to prevent flexion and torsion.
