Influence of bronchial arterial PO2 on pulmonary vascular resistance.
 In six anesthetized and mechanically ventilated adult sheep, the bronchial artery was perfused with blood from an oxygenator-pump circuit.
 When the lungs were ventilated with 100% O2 and the bronchial O2 tension (PbrO2) was approximately 600 Torr, the mean of the pulmonary vascular resistances (PVR) measured at the beginning (3.32 +/- 0.29 units) and end (3.17 +/- 0.13 units) of the experiment was 3.24 +/- 0.20 units.
 When the PbrO2 was changed to 58 +/- 1 Torr, the PVR (2.99 +/- 0.14 units) did not change significantly.
 However, when the lungs were ventilated with air as PbrO2 was decreased to 91 +/- 4, 77 +/- 3, 56 +/- 2, and 42 +/- 1 Torr, the PVR increased to 3.67 +/- 0.18, 4.03 +/- 0.16, 4.79 +/- 0.19, and 4.71 +/- 0.35 units, respectively.
 However, when the PbrO2 was decreased further to 26 +/- 1 and 13 +/- 1 Torr, the PVR decreased to 3.77 +/- 0.28 and 3.91 +/- 0.30 units, respectively.
 In contrast, the bronchial vascular resistance decreased monotonically as PbrO2 decreased.
 The bronchial circulation supplies vasa vasorum to the walls of all but the smallest pulmonary arteries, and it is therefore suggested that the PO2 of the bronchial circulation is responsible for the bimodal response of the pulmonary vasculature, with stimulation of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction at moderate hypoxemia and of hypoxic pulmonary vasodilation at profound hypoxemia.
 The physiological and pathophysiological significance of the influence of systemic PO2 on pulmonary vascular tone is discussed.
