Lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse in teenage twins. A case report and review of the literature.
 We report the cases of teenage twin girls presenting within months of each other with severe symptoms from lumbosacral disc prolapses, requiring laminectomy in one and chemonucleolysis in the other.
 CT scans showed similarities in spinal configuration, including the presence of disc bulges at the L4-5 level.
 This suggests a strong hereditary factor in prolapse of intervertebral discs, but a review of the literature showed little information on that aspect.
