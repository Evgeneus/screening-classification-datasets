Circadian variation in the frequency of onset of chest pain in acute myocardial infarction.
 The time of onset of chest pain was studied prospectively in 1154 consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit with myocardial infarction during a five year period.
 Statistical analysis confirmed a previous finding in a retrospective study of a bimodal frequency distribution with peaks in the time of onset of chest pain between 2330 and 0030 hours and between 0630 and 0830 hours.
