Multiple organ failure: inflammatory priming and activation sequences promote autologous tissue injury.
 Systemic inflammation promotes multiple organ failure through the induction of diffuse microvascular leak.
 Inflammatory cells such as neutrophils propagate this process.
 Tissue injury by neutrophils may be viewed as a normal process, inflammation, that has become uncontrolled and generalized.
 Multiple inflammatory stimuli synergistically promote neutrophil-mediated tissue injury in priming and activation sequences.
 In some settings, cellular priming is mediated by platelet-activating factor and can be prevented by platelet-activating factor antagonists.
 Inhibiting cellular priming could be efficacious in the therapy of multiple organ failure.
