Factors associated with binocular single vision in microtropia/monofixation syndrome.
 We reviewed the charts of 398 patients with microtropia/monofixation syndrome to determine what factors influence the level of binocularity attained.
 Most patients (82%) exhibited some degree of stereoacuity.
 Patients with a later age at presentation of the initial deviation were more likely to exhibit stereoacuity (p less than 0.001).
 Patients with smaller initial deviations were also more likely to exhibit stereoacuity (p = 0.016), as were those with smaller manifest deviations on final testing (p less than 0.001).
 Patients with amblyopia on final testing were less likely to demonstrate stereoacuity (p = 0.0001).
 Generally, the more intervention required in the form of optical or surgical correction, the poorer the level of binocularity.
