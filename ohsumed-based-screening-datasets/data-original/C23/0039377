Otoplasty: critical review of clinical results.
 Although it is generally believed that otoplasty provides uniformly gratifying results, thorough patient follow-up reviews are quite rare.
 Otoplasty surgery performed on 119 ears was retrospectively reviewed to assess the results of our cartilage-sparing technique.
 This method of otoplasty relies on a conchal set-back and suture transfixation technique to improve the antihelical contour.
 Auricular medialization averaged 10.3 mm.
 Over-correction is required, particularly in the superior pole, as loss of correction with healing was approximately 40% of the initial medialization.
 Revision surgery due to loss of correction was necessary for 6.6% of the ears initially operated on by the senior author.
 Patients who presented following cartilage-cutting procedures tended to have a higher rate of revision and persistent postoperative stigmata.
 Complications in general were few; however, mersilene suture extrusion occurred in 8% of ears.
 Only one of these required revision surgery for associated loss of correction.
 Despite these drawbacks, over 95% of patients achieved satisfactory results using cartilage-sparing otoplasty techniques.
