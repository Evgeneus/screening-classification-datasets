Cecal rupture after continent ileocecal urinary diversion during total pelvic exenteration.
 Continent ureteral diversion at the time of pelvic exenteration avoids an external appliance and allows patients to retain "bladder" reservoir function.
 The technical difficulty of this procedure requires meticulous attention to operative and perioperative care, particularly after pelvic irradiation.
 A patient with recurrent stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix underwent total pelvic exenteration with reconstructive procedures including low rectal anastomosis, neovagina formation, and ileocecal (Indiana) continent diversion.
 Early catheterization of the reservoir began 2 weeks postoperatively.
 One week later cecal rupture occurred, not related to suture line (technical) failure.
 Because of the high wall tension and reduced compliance in the irradiated cecum, we do not recommend catheterization of the urinary reservoir before 4-6 weeks.
 In order for continent diversion to become the standard diversion in exenteration patients, the major complication rate must remain comparable to that of noncontinent diversion.
