Anterior innominate osteotomies for failure or late closure of bladder exstrophy.
 The bony pelvis was analyzed in 12 patients undergoing a further operation after initial bladder closure.
 Of the patients 5 had undergone a prior posterior osteotomy.
 All patients had wide diastasis of the pubis (average 5.5 cm.).
 In 9 of these patients late closure or reclosure of a failed initial bladder repair was done and 3 underwent a repeat bladder neck reconstruction.
 In all patients a new procedure, anterior iliac osteotomy with internal or external fixation, was performed.
 This procedure provides increased mobility of the pubis and increased correction.
 It avoids turning of the patient while under anesthesia for repeat preparation and in most cases postoperative traction is not needed.
 There were no instances of dehiscence, nonunion or infection.
 Three cases of transient femoral palsy were noted.
 All patients had a normal gait 4 months postoperatively.
 The mobility obtained after anterior osteotomy allows for excellent approximation.
 In view of evidence that approximation of the pubis improves closure and eventual continence results, we believe that osteotomies, even when repeated, are useful in revision surgery if there is bony diastasis.
