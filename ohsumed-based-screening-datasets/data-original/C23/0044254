Polyethylene wear from retrieved acetabular cups.
 Laboratory wear testing of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene from 12 Charnley acetabular cups, removed after periods of up to 17.5 years showed that the large patient-to-patient variations in clinical penetration rate cannot be explained by batch-to-batch variation in the wear resistance of the material.
 Nor was there any evidence of a time-dependent degradation in wear resistance of the material.
