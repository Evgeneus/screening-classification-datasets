Scrotal inflammatory disease: color Doppler US findings.
 A study of 45 patients with 51 cases of hemiscrotal inflammatory disease was done to determine the color Doppler ultrasonographic appearance of scrotal inflammatory disorders.
 The diagnosis was ultimately established by means of appropriate response to antibiotic treatment (47 cases) or surgery (four cases).
 In all cases, there was evidence of hyperemia: an increased number and concentration of detectable vessels in the affected portion of the scrotum.
 In 17 cases, the gray scale images were normal, and the only evidence of inflammation was the presence of hypervascularity.
 Abnormally decreased epididymal vascular resistance was detected in 14 cases of epididymitis; abnormally decreased testicular vascular resistance was detected in six cases of orchitis.
 Spontaneous venous flow was present in 18 patients.
 The authors conclude that color Doppler can demonstrate the hyperemic response to scrotal inflammatory disease and that, in the proper clinical setting, it can supplement the gray scale findings and increase diagnostic confidence.
