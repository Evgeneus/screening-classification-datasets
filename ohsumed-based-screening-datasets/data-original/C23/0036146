An approach to pediatric trauma. Unique anatomic and pathophysiologic aspects of the pediatric patient.
 Effective evaluation and management of the pediatric trauma patient is based on knowledge of the unique anatomic and pathophysiologic differences in children.
 An understanding of these differences along with the trauma resuscitation guidelines established by the American College of Surgeons will allow the trauma team to provide systematic and comprehensive resuscitation of the child with multiple injuries.
 Continued research in the field of pediatric trauma resuscitation and the ongoing efforts of the National Pediatric Trauma Registry will continue to advance our understanding and management of injured children.
