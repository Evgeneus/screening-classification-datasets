Doxapram after general anaesthesia. Its role in stopping shivering during recovery.
 A group of patients who developed postoperative shivering after receiving inhalational anaesthesia were assigned, at random, to receive either doxapram or a placebo under double-blind conditions.
 A significantly higher proportion of patients stopped shivering after being given doxapram than after the placebo.
