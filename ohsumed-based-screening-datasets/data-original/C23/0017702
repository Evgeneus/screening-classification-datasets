Intraperitoneal femoral venous catheter insertion with free blood return in presence of tense hemoperitoneum.
 The authors report a case of intraperitoneal insertion of a femoral venous catheter, with blood return, in a patient with hemoperitoneum.
 In such patients, skin puncture at or below the inguinal ligament is important.
 Aspiration of unusually dark blood and medial catheter location should raise the possibility of intraperitoneal catheter placement.
