Stroke rehabilitation: a geropsychological perspective.
 Rehabilitation medicine and geriatric medicine are similar in their concern for functional improvement in the face of chronic medical conditions.
 Although many patients served by rehabilitation medicine fall within the geriatric age range, a knowledge of normal aging does not necessarily inform clinical decision making or research practices in rehabilitation.
 Using stroke as an example of a disorder affecting primarily geriatric patients and requiring the technology of rehabilitation, ways in which age might affect assessment of outcome are examined.
 Three areas dealing with conceptual and methodologic issues--depression, neurochemical interventions, and family--are highlighted.
 The final section outlines recommendations for research on rehabilitation outcome of geriatric stroke patients.
