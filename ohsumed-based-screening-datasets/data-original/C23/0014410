Ankylosing spondylitis with exuberant sclerosis in the sacroiliac joints, symphysis pubis and spine.
 We report the case of a man with ankylosing spondylitis involving the symphysis pubis and some intervertebral discs in addition to the sacroiliac joints.
 The bone adjacent to each inflammatory area showed an unusually exuberant sclerosis.
 In the early phases of evolution the appearance of sacroilitis was indistinguishable from that of osteitis condensans ilii.
