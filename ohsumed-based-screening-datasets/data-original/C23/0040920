Fever: management and self-medication. Results from a Norwegian population study.
 A representative sample of the Norwegian population was interviewed in 1988 as part of a monthly national opinion poll to investigate lay management and self-medication of fever.
 Six hundred and nineteen women and 592 men over the age of 15 were interviewed in their homes.
 Approximately one-fifth reported inappropriate measuring of body temperature.
 A variety of management and self-medication was found.
 In cases of common cold or influenza with fever, 35% would use antipyretics.
 Forty per cent would start to use antipyretics at a temperature below 39.0 degrees C.
 Forty-four per cent did not know any antipyretic brand names at all.
 The results indicate a need for more definite and consistent information to make fever management and self-medication more rational.
 Such information should be discussed and given by general practitioners, nurses at child welfare centers and pharmacists.
