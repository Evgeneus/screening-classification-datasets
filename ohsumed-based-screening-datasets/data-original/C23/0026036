Extra-anatomic bypass of failed traumatic arterial repairs.
 Arterial injuries are best treated by primary repair or anatomically placed interposition grafts.
 Occasionally, these repairs fail due to adverse local factors, such as soft-tissue infection or enteric contamination.
 In these instances, limb salvage may require extra-anatomic arterial reconstruction.
 Between 1979 and 1989, 13 extra-anatomic bypasses were performed in ten male patients following nine failed primary repairs and one ligation of a traumatic arterial injury.
 The sites of arterial injury were: aorta (two), iliac (five), femoral (two), popliteal (one).
 Enteric contamination was present at initial operation in six patients; the remaining four had sustained massive soft-tissue injury.
 Reoperation was required for hemorrhage (seven), pseudoaneurysm (two), and arteriovenous fistula (one).
 All patients had developed local wound problems that militated against another anatomic repair.
 Extra-anatomic bypasses performed were: axillo-femoral (three), femoro-femoral (four), obturator (one), and two extra-anatomic femoral to popliteal saphenous vein grafts routed around an infected field.
 A second extra-anatomic reconstruction was performed for recurrent hemorrhage in three patients, (axillo-femoral--two, obturator--one).
 One patient with a neuropathic extremity and a functioning graft underwent amputation at 2 months following the initial injury.
 Two patients died of systemic sepsis.
 Seven patients (70%) have functional extremities with intact pulses at 2 to 24 months post bypass (mean, 7 months).
 Limb salvage after secondary disruption of secondarily infected arterial repairs can be achieved by appropriate extra-anatomic arterial reconstruction.
 In such cases, limb loss is due to soft-tissue sepsis or neuro-skeletal injuries and not vascular insufficiency.
