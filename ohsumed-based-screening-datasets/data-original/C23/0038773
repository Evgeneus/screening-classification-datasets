Survival and valve failure after aortic valve replacement.
 A prospective evaluation of 412 consecutive patients undergoing isolated aortic valve replacement between January 1982 and December 1985 was performed in an attempt to identify the determinants of survival and valve failure.
 A variety of valves were inserted to permit a prospective evaluation of alternative valves including: Bjork-Shiley mechanical (n = 37), Ionescu-Shiley pericardial (n = 261), Hancock pericardial (n = 78), and Carpentier-Edwards porcine (n = 36).
 Thirteen patients died in the hospital (3.2%) and 47 patients died in the follow-up period producing an actuarial survival of 81% +/- 3% at 48 months.
 Survival was independently predicted by advancing age, preoperative New York Heart Association functional class, and the presence of endocarditis (p less than 0.05 by Cox regression analysis).
 The majority of patients were symptomatically improved (New York Heart Association class I or II: 21% preoperative, 88% postoperative).
 Freedom from structural valve dysfunction, prosthetic valve endocarditis, and reoperation for valve-related complications were 95% +/- 2%, 95% +/- 2%, and 92% +/- 2% at 48 months, respectively.
 These valve-related complications occurred more frequently in younger patients and in those with a Hancock pericardial valve (freedom from structural valve dysfunction, 89% +/- 5%; prosthetic valve endocarditis, 84% +/- 9%; reoperation, 78% +/- 10%; p less than 0.05 by Cox regression).
 Freedom from thromboembolism was 88% +/- 2% at 48 months; it was significantly lower in patients with a preoperative thromboembolic event and was not influenced by the type of prosthesis inserted.
 Freedom from anticoagulant-related hemorrhage was 85% +/- 8% at 48 months and was not influenced by any preoperative factors.
