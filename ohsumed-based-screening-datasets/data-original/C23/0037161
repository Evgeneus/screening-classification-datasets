Cycling and the older athlete.
 Cycling provides a dynamic form of aerobic and anaerobic fitness to more than 86 million Americans.
 It provides a freedom that is attractive to individuals of any age, either sex, and any body type.
 It does not require specialized experience or coordination.
 In the older athlete, injuries result primarily from overuse or abuse, and are most common in the upper extremity.
 Such injuries are most often compressive and inflammatory syndromes.
 These injuries are in marked contrast to those seen in the younger cyclist.
 Both groups have a low and similar incidence of accident.
 Overuse injuries can be treated effectively by altering training technique, correcting rider malposition, and decreasing excessive stress, in conjunction with appropriate medical management.
 Prevention of injury (particularly overuse) is the key to avoiding recurrence.
 Appropriate frame size, rider position, personalized training techniques, and clothing are essential in the older athlete in whom change is poorly tolerated.
 Fitness is preserved by regular cycling, possibly by the slowing of the degenerative process, while relieving mental stress and providing "fun sport.".
