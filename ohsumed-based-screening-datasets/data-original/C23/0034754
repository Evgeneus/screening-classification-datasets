Patients with a high defibrillation threshold: clinical characteristics, management, and outcome.
 Of 125 patients prepared to receive implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) with the patch-patch configuration of the difibrillating electrodes, 23 (18%) had high (greater than or equal to 25 joules) defibrillation thresholds (DFTs).
 These patients had lower left ventricular ejection fractions (27 +/- 12 vs 34 +/- 13; p less than 0.03) and a higher incidence of previous heart surgery (47% vs 19%; p less than 0.01) than patients with normal DFTs but did not differ in age, type of heart disease, incidence of concomitant heart surgery, or use of antiarrhythmic medication.
 Defibrillators were implanted in 18 of these 23 patients, 12 during the initial surgery and six after repeat DFT testing 2 weeks later.
 After 22 +/- 11 months of follow-up, four patients with ICDs died (two suddenly, and two of nonsudden cardiac causes).
 Two patients without ICDs died of nonsudden cardiac causes.
 Appropriate shocks were received by five patients (29%) including both who died suddenly later.
 A high DFT may be more common than previously stated.
 It is associated with poor ventricular function and previous heart surgery.
 Repeated DFT testing may be useful in some patients.
 A high DFT does not preclude successful ICD shocks, but other therapies may provide better results.
