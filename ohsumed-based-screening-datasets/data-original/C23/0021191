Percutaneous cholangioscopic or transpapillary insertion of self-expanding biliary metal stents.
 Fifty-two self-expanding metal stents were implanted in 39 patients with malignant (35 patients) or benign (4 patients) biliary stenoses.
 The stents were inserted and properly released by means of a 7 or 9 French gauge delivery catheter via the percutaneous (20 patients) or transpapillary (19 patients) route.
 In all cases the endoprostheses expanded to a diameter of 7 to 10 mm and achieved complete biliary tract drainage.
 Jaundice disappeared in 36 of the 39 patients.
 No early complication was observed.
 After a median follow-up of 121 days (range, 30 to 422 days), 19 of 36 patients are still alive and 17 died of non-procedure-related causes.
 Biliary re-obstruction occurred in five patients due to tumor overgrowth above or below the prosthesis (four patients) or bile encrustation (one patient).
 In patients with malignant stenoses, the probability of stent patency is 78% after 200 days.
 We conclude that large-bore metal stents are safe, effective, and provide better long-term patency than conventional endoprostheses.
