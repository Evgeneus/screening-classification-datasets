Treatment of experimental suprachoroidal hemorrhage with subconjunctival injection of tissue plasminogen activator: a negative report.
 Suprachoroidal hemorrhage was created in 10 albino rabbit eyes.
 Five eyes were treated with subconjunctival injections of 40,000 IU of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) daily for 6 days; five eyes served as controls.
 It took approximately the same amount of time for the suprachoroidal hemorrhages to clear in both the control and treatment eyes.
 We conclude that subconjunctival injection of tPA does not accelerate the clearance of suprachoroidal hemorrhage.
