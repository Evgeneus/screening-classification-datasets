Hearing loss in elderly patients in a family practice.
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate hearing loss in elderly patients.
 DESIGN: Cohort study.
 SETTING: Family practice.
 PATIENTS: All ambulatory patients 65 years of age or older who attended the practice from June to August 1989.
 OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly--Screening Version (HHIE-S) and the Welch-Allyn Audioscope.
 Patients who failed one or both of the screening tests were referred to a speech and hearing clinic for audiologic assessment and treatment recommendations.
 Those with hearing aids were excluded from the main study but were given the opportunity to have them assessed at the clinic.
 MAIN RESULTS: Of 157 eligible patients 42 were excluded: 16 refused to participate, 13 already had hearing aids, and 13 could not be contacted.
 Of the remaining 115, 34 failed one or both of the tests (14 failed the HHIE-S, 9 failed the audioscope test, and 11 failed both).
 Of the 34, 25 completed the audiologic assessment at the clinic.
 Fifteen were found to have severe hearing impairment; the recommendation was hearing aids for 12, further assessment for 2 and no treatment for 1.
 Of the remaining 10 patients it was thought that 6 would benefit from hearing aids.
 Ten of the 11 patients with hearing aids who agreed to undergo testing at the clinic were found to need an adjustment or replacement of their devices.
 CONCLUSIONS: Hearing loss is a significant problem in elderly patients in primary practice.
 Further study is required to determine which of the two screening tools is most effective.
 Most elderly patients with hearing aids may require modification or replacement of their devices.
