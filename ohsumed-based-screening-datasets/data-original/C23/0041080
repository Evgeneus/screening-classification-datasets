Continuous arteriovenous rewarming: report of a new technique for treating hypothermia.
 Survival is rare after major trauma if core temperature falls below 32 degrees C.
 Available rewarming methods are often ineffective.
 We utilized arterial and venous catheters to create a circulatory fistula through the heating mechanism of a modified commercially available counter-current fluid warmer to achieve simple, rapid extracorporeal rewarming.
