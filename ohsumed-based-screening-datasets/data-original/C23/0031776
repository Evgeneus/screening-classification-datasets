Paul Broca and the first craniotomy based on cerebral localization.
 Paul Broca (1824-1880) was a well-known French surgeon-anthropologist-neurologist.
 Best known for his work on cerebral cortical localization and speech mechanisms, Broca also carefully worked out skull and scalp localization for underlying cortical regions.
 In 1871, Broca treated a man who had sustained a scalp laceration from a blow to the head without loss of consciousness or skull fracture.
 The patient exhibited a nonfluent aphasia about 1 month after injury and became progressively obtunded and eventually comatose.
 Suspecting an intracranial abscess, Broca trephined at the region of the left third frontal convolution and drained an epidural abscess.
 The patient improved transiently but died a few days later.
 Autopsy showed a left-sided, predominantly frontal purulent meningoencephalitis.
 Broca's other neurosurgical contributions included various surgical cases, methods for scalp localization of the cerebral convolutions, extensive studies of skull and brain abnormalities, thermoencephalography, and the stimulation of younger surgical colleagues and neurologists to make practical use of cerebral localization.
