Repeat hepatic resection for primary and metastatic carcinoma of the liver.
 During the last 15 years, 19 patients underwent repeated hepatic resections for malignant lesions of the liver.
 The first hepatic resection had been performed four to 40 months earlier for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (nine patients) or hepatic metastases (ten patients), eight of which were of colorectal origin.
 Repeat resection was an extensive hepatectomy in six, a segmentectomy in six and a local excision in seven.
 In one patient, three wedge resections and, finally, hepatic transplantation were subsequently performed after an initial extended right lobectomy.
 The operative mortality rate was 5.2 per cent.
 The three year actuarial survival rate was 64 per cent after the second resection.
