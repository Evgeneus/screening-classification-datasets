Fatal tonsillar herniation in pseudotumor cerebri.
 A 27-year-old woman with pseudotumor cerebri died after lumbar puncture secondary to tonsillar herniation.
 Five years earlier she had a respiratory arrest after lumbar puncture.
 MRI and autopsy ruled out the presence of an Arnold-Chiari malformation or a mass lesion of the posterior fossa, but midsagittal views suggested the presence of low-lying cerebellar tonsils.
