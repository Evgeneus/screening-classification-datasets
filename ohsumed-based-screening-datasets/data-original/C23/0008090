Osteotomy for osteoarthritis of the hip. A survivorship analysis.
 We have reviewed 368 osteotomies carried out for osteoarthritis of the hip at the Nuffield Orthopaedic Centre.
 Survivorship analysis showed that 10 years after osteotomy 47% had required no further surgery, and even after 20 years 23% had still not had a hip replacement.
 Hips with moderate arthritic change showed significantly better results than those with more severe degeneration.
 Osteotomies with varus angulation as well as medial displacement showed longer survival.
