Complications of the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap in head and neck reconstruction.
 A retrospective review of the complications in 211 patients undergoing pectoralis major myocutaneous flap reconstruction is presented.
 The flap was used for mucosal lining of the oral cavity or oropharynx in 109 patients, for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction in 44, for skin coverage in 47, and for other locations in 14 patients.
 Flap-related complications developed in 63% of the patients.
 These included flap necrosis, suture line dehiscence, fistula formation, infection, and hematoma.
 Analysis of risk factors for the development of flap complications showed the following factors to be significant: age over 70; female gender; nomographic overweight; albumin less than 4 g/dL; use of the flap in reconstruction of the oral cavity after major glossectomy; and presence of other systemic diseases.
 The median length of hospitalization for those developing complications was 33 days compared with 16 days for those who did not develop any complications.
 Thirty-five (26%) of the 135 patients developing complications required reoperation and only 2 among these required a second flap.
 Similarly, only 13 of the 61 patients who developed fistulas required surgical closure.
