A comparison of host responses of the Mongolian jird to infections of Brugia malayi and B. pahangi.
 Host responses of jirds receiving a single subcutaneous inoculation of subperiodic Brugia malayi were compared with those of jirds similarly infected with B.
 pahangi.
 Parasite burdens, lymphatic lesion severity, granulomatous reactivity, antibody responses to parasite antigens, and complete blood cell counts were assessed at 60 and 150 days post-inoculation.
 At 60 days post-inoculation, percentages of adults recovered at necropsy and lymphatic lesion severity were greater in B.
 pahangi-infected jirds.
 At 150 days post-inoculation, lesion severity and percentages of worms recovered were similar in both infections.
 No significant differences were noted in either infection in reactivity to homologous or heterologous parasite antigens in any parameter measured.
 Similarities in the kinetics of the inflammatory reactivities of the 2 infections suggest that previous observations made in the jird-B.
 pahangi model could be utilized in designing studies using B.
 malayi.
 Further, the more marked lesion severity observed in B.
 pahangi-infected jirds and the relative ease of maintaining B.
 pahangi in the laboratory support the continued use of this system as a conceptual model for the study of lymphatic lesion pathogenesis.
