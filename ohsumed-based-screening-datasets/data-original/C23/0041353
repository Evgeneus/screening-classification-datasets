Polytetrafluoroethylene vs. polypropylene suture for endoscopic bladder neck suspension.
 Between May 1989 and October 1989, 24 women underwent a prospective, randomized study comparing polypropylene (Prolene) and polytetrafluoroethylene (Gore-Tex) sutures for endoscopic bladder neck suspension.
 Polypropylene was associated with significantly more suture pain than polytetrafluoroethylene.
 Polytetrafluoroethylene was more difficult to tie at a predetermined tension.
