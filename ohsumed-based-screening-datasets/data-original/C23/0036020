Urological aspects of Behcet's disease.
 Behcet's disease, affecting mostly young males in the Mediterranean countries and Japan, is a multi-system disease with urological manifestations.
 In this prospective study of 100 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed Behcet's disease, we found that 89% of the males had experienced scrotal ulceration and 6% had epididymitis.
 We also observed sterile urethritis in 3%.
 Other urological abnormalities appeared to be coincidental findings.
