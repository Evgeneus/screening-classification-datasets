Streptococcal toxic shock associated with septic abortion.
 The group A streptococcus is capable of producing exotoxins that have been linked to a toxic shock-like syndrome.
 Streptococcal toxic shock is a rapidly progressive disease associated with injury to multiple organ systems and a 30-60% mortality rate.
 We present a case of a 40-year-old woman who developed group A streptococcal toxic shock following a spontaneous abortion.
 She required surgical debridement, pulmonary artery catheterization, mechanical ventilation, and massive transfusions.
 Clinicians must be aware of the presentation of this disease, as its incidence appears to be increasing.
