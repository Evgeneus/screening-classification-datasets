Chromosome translocation and c-MYC activation by Epstein-Barr virus and Euphorbia tirucalli in B lymphocytes.
 Dual exposure to Epstein-Barr virus and purified 4-deoxyphorbol ester derived from the plant Euphorbia tirucalli induced a high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements in human B lymphocytes in vitro.
 Rearrangements most commonly affected chromosome 8, the chromosome most often showing structural changes in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cells.
 E tirucalli is indigenous in parts of Africa where BL is endemic and may be an important risk factor for the disease.
