Embolism during caesarean section.
 We investigated the occurrence of gas embolism during Caesarean section using a Doppler ultrasound probe and found that it occurs between uterine incision and delivery.
 Embolism is less common during general anaesthesia than has been reported during regional anaesthesia.
 Both ruptured membranes and a protracted uterine incision to delivery interval predispose to embolism.
