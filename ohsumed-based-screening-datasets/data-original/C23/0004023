The role of endoscopic injection sclerotherapy in the management of bleeding peristomal varices.
 Peristomal varices usually occur in patients with enterostomies who develop portal hypertension, and represent a cause of recurrent or intractable gastrointestinal bleeding.
 Treatment options for such bleeding include surgical ligation of varices, stoma revision with devascularization, injection sclerotherapy, portacaval shunt, or liver transplantation.
 We reviewed the records of seven patients with peristomal varices, who were followed for a mean of 17 months after diagnosis.
 Fourteen episodes of clinically significant peristomal bleeding occurred in six patients.
 Surgical ligation of varices was ineffective in controlling bleeding in two of three patients, although stoma revision with devascularization was temporarily effective in two other patients.
 Injection sclerotherapy, used in three patients, effectively controlled acute bleeding without serious complications or need for surgery.
 Definitive treatment for peristomal bleeding (portacaval shunt or liver transplantation) has prevented any further bleeding in three patients for a mean of 8 months after surgery.
