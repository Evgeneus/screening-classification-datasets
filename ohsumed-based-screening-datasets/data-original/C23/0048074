Phase I/II trial of recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
 Forty-seven patients with hematologic neoplasia received recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) by daily 2-hour infusion following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation from HLA-identical sibling donors in a phase I-II dose-escalation trial.
 Dose levels ranged from 30 to 500 micrograms/m2/d.
 At doses at or below 250 micrograms/m2/d, toxicity felt to be caused by rhGM-CSF was negligible.
 However, three of five patients treated with 500 micrograms/m2/d had unacceptable side effects caused by rhGM-CSF.
 Two different graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylactic regimens were administered.
 Twenty-seven evaluable patients were administered regimens that did not contain methotrexate (MTX) (Group I) and reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL by a median of day 14.
 In contrast, 18 patients who received GVHD prophylactic regimens containing MTX (Group II) reached an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000/microL on a median of day 20.
 Patients in Group I had fewer febrile days and, of those discharged, had shorter initial hospitalizations than patients in Group II.
 The overall incidence of severe acute GVHD (grade 2 or greater) in the rhGM-CSF-treated patients was 28% and was similar to that in historical "good risk" patients who did not receive rhGM-CSF.
 These preliminary data suggest rhGM-CSF is unlikely to exacerbate GVHD in HLA-identical sibling donor transplants and indicate the need for randomized trials of rhGM-CSF in allogeneic marrow transplant patients.
