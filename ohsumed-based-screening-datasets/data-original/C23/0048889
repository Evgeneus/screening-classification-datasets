Cardiac surgery in the octogenarian: perioperative outcome and clinical follow-up 
 The perioperative and follow-up results of cardiac operations employing extracorporeal circulation and cold cardioplegic arrest were examined in 191 consecutive patients greater than or equal to 80 years of age having surgery over a 5 year period (1982 to 1986).
 Most patients had severe preoperative symptoms with functional class III (39.8%) or IV (57.1%) limitation.
 The overall 30 day postoperative cardiac mortality rate was 15.7%.
 The total in-hospital mortality rate was 18.8%; the mean postoperative hospital stay was 16.4 +/- 13.3 days.
 The perioperative mortality rate for elective operations was as follows: coronary artery bypass (5.6%), aortic valve replacement (9.6%), aortic valve replacement with coronary bypass (17.9%) and mitral valve surgery with or without coronary bypass (21.4%).
 Urgent operations were performed in 39 patients (20.4%) with a total perioperative mortality rate of 35.9%; urgent coronary artery bypass was performed in 26 patients (67%) with an in-hospital mortality rate of 23.1%.
 Clinical evidence of left ventricular failure, functional class IV symptoms, left ventricular ejection fraction less than 50%, mitral valve repair or replacement for severe mitral regurgitation and urgent operation were associated with an increased perioperative mortality rate.
 Follow-up study in all 155 patients surviving postoperative hospitalization at 22.6 +/- 14.8 months showed significant improvement in symptom status in all surgical subgroups.
 There were 18 follow-up deaths (11.6%); 10 were noncardiac.
 The actuarial survival rate of the entire study group was significantly better than that in age- and gender-matched control subjects (p = 0.037).
