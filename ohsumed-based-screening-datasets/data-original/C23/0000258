Low-dose sufentanil in major surgery.
 The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of sufentanil 1 micrograms.kg-1 during N2O-O2 and intermittent isoflurane anaesthesia in major non-cardiac surgery.
 Thirty-one patients (18 females, 13 males; mean age 47 yr), undergoing cholecystectomy received a 1 microgram.kg-1 bolus of sufentanil before the induction of anaesthesia with thiopentone.
 On average, three sufentanil increments were administered, to a total (bolus + maintenance) dose of 1.5 micrograms.kg-1.
 Cardiovascular stability was not achieved in eleven patients who then were given isoflurane.
 The arterial pressure decreased after sufentanil (P less than 0.05), reaching a nadir (mean 108/65 mmHg, heart rate 63 bpm) at one minute post-incision.
 Clinically important hypertension or hypotension did not occur in any patient.
 One patient, receiving beta-blocker therapy, required atropine to control bradycardia.
 Postoperative respiratory depression did not occur in patients who received less than one micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 with the last increment being given more than 20 minutes before the end of anaesthesia.
 Slight respiratory depression in the recovery room was reported in one patient, who had received a total of 1.3 micrograms.kg-1.hr-1 of sufentanil, and the last sufentanil increment 24 min before the end of surgery.
 The most frequently reported side-effects were nausea (35 per cent) and vomiting (23 per cent).
 Induction, maintenance and recovery from anaesthesia were rated as "good" in 87, 87, and 74 per cent of the cases, respectively, and "satisfactory" in the remainder.
 We conclude that this technique is valuable to assure good protection of the cardiovascular system without undue respiratory depression during recovery.
