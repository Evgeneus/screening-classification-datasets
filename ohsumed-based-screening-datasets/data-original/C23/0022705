Physiologic parameters and perceived exertion with local muscle fatigue in postpolio subjects.
 Fifty postpolio patients, 34 with and 16 without complaints of progressive loss of muscle strength, and 41 control subjects were studied to compare physiologic measures of the fatiguing process and to determine whether there is a significant interaction between the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and physiologic measures.
 Statistical analyses were by ANOVA and repeated-measures ANOVA.
 The RPE was obtained every 20 seconds during an isometric contraction of the quadriceps at 40% of maximal torque; median frequency (Fm) of the power spectrum of the surface electromyographic signal and neuromuscular efficiency (NME) were constantly monitored.
 The RPE increased similarly (p greater than .05), whereas Fm and NME decreased similarly (p greater than .05) during endurance exercise at 40% of maximal torque in all three groups.
 A significant (p less than .05) interaction was found between RPE and both Fm and NME.
 We conclude that physiologic measures of the fatiguing process (Fm and NME) occur in a similar manner in postpolio and control subjects and that there is a significant interaction between subjective RPE and physiologic measures of the fatiguing process.
