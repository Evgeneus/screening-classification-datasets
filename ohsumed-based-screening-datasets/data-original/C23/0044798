Case report: epidural and bilateral retroorbital hematomas complicating sickle cell anemia.
 Early in the course of a painful crisis, a 19-year-old man with known sickle cell anemia (SCA) developed a clinical picture that resembled either early cavernous sinus thrombosis or retroorbital and bifrontal microinfarcts.
 A brain computer tomography scan demonstrated bilateral retroorbital hemorrhages along with a left frontal epidural hematoma.
 In the absence of trauma, thrombocytopenia, or any other detectable hemostatic defect, this type of hemorrhagic manifestation in the setting of SCA has not, to our knowledge, been previously reported in the literature.
