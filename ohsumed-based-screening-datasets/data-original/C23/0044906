Perfusion without systemic heparinization for rewarming in accidental hypothermia.
 We report on a patient with accidental deep hypothermia (23.3 degrees C) and cardiorespiratory arrest resulting from severe craniocerebral injury.
 Systemic anticoagulation was contraindicated, and the decision was reached to rewarm the patient with cardiopulmonary bypass without systemic heparinization using heparin-coated perfusion equipment.
 The patient was successfully rewarmed, was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass, and recovered.
