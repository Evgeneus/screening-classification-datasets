A forensic application of DNA typing. Paternity determination in a putrefied fetus.
 Using minisatellite DNA probes that hybridize to a variable number of tandemly repeated loci, an individual-specific DNA fingerprint can be determined.
 In the case reported here, we succeeded in extracting high-molecular-weight DNA from a 3-month-old fetus discovered during the autopsy of a murdered 28-year-old pregnant woman reported missing 10 days earlier.
 The results of analysis of restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms showed that all bands present in the fetus's pattern, but absent in the mother's, matched only those of the putative father.
 Thus, the paternity of the victim's husband was ruled out.
