The double-stapled ileal reservoir and ileoanal anastomosis. A prospective review of sphincter function and clinical outcome.
 Fifteen consecutive patients (nine males and six females) who underwent construction of a double-stapled ileoanal reservoir (DS-IAR) were prospectively evaluated.
 Mean and maximal resting pressures preoperatively, before ileostomy closure, and at 12 months, were 53 and 84 mm Hg, 39 and 62 mm Hg, and 62 and 81 mm Hg.
 Mean and maximal squeeze pressures at those same time periods were 96 and 153 mm Hg, 111 and 173 mm Hg, and 95 and 168 mm Hg.
 There were no significant decreases in either resting or squeeze pressure between preoperative values and those obtained 12 months after surgery.
 However, the length of the high pressure zone decreased from 3.8 cm preoperatively to 2.3 cm at 12 months.
 This reflects the sacrifice of the cephalad 1.5 cm of the internal anal sphincter necessary to effect this anastomosis at a mean of 1.4 cm from the dentate line.
 However, this maneuver did not result in poor continence.
 Eleven patients whose ileostomies were closed for a mean of 9 months, ranging from 3 to 15 months, were evaluated regarding functional outcome.
 Only one patient had any incontinence and this patient had incomplete circular-stapled tissue rings, which necessitated transanal suture repair of the anastomotic defect.
 Similarly, three of the four patients who sometimes or rarely use a pad at night had transanal-suture reinforcement.
 Ten of the 11 patients never wear a pad during the day.
 No pelvic or perianal sepsis occurred.
 Stratified squamous epithelium was found in 6 of the 13 distal stapler "donuts" that were examined.
 In addition, 10 patients underwent biopsy of the tissue immediately caudad to the circular staple line at the time of ileostomy closure; in five, only stratified squamous epithelium was noted.
 The DS-IAR is associated with excellent objective physiologic and subjective functional results.
