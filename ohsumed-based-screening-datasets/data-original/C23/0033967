Wrist movements in able-bodied and brain injured individuals.
 The purpose of this study was to compare movement velocity characteristics during targeted wrist movements between able-bodied individuals and a sample of individuals with spasticity secondary to closed head injury.
 Two amplitudes (30 degrees and 60 degrees) of movement were performed at slow and fast velocities, with the forearm either passively supported or actively supported by elbow extension and shoulder flexion.
 Variables measured were the following: (1) average velocity of entire movement, (2) velocity for 10 degrees increments of a movement, and (3) ratio of average peak 10 degrees increment velocity to average velocity.
 In addition, qualitative examination of velocity profiles was performed.
 Slow movements were performed in a discontinuous manner by both groups; however, observable differences in peak/average velocity were noted between groups in the unsupported position during slow and fast movements.
 Able-bodied individuals performed seven of eight fast movements with greater velocity (p less than .05) than brain injured individuals, and the fast movements of the able-bodied subjects were continuous.
