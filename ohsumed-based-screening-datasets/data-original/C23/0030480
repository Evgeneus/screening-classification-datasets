Recurrent spontaneous intrahepatic hemorrhage from peliosis hepatis.
 Peliosis hepatis is a rare and highly lethal liver lesion in which numerous blood-filled cavities or cystic spaces are dispersed throughout the hepatic parenchyma.
 The cause is unknown, although the condition is associated with several disease states and medications.
 Patients may present with hemorrhage, liver failure, the hepatorenal syndrome, cholestasis, or portal hypertension.
 We treated a patient who survived two separate hemorrhages from peliosis hepatis.
 The surgical intervention used, hepatic dearterialization, has allowed this patient to remain asymptomatic for 5 years.
