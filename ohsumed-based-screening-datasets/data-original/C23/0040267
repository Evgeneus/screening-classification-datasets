Change in the expression of a nuclear matrix-associated protein is correlated with cellular transformation.
 We have identified a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nuclear matrix-associated protein in NIH 3T3 cells.
 The immunofluorescence pattern consists predominantly of bright nuclear granule clusters distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, with the exclusion of nucleoli.
 It recognizes a protein of 190 kDa that is down-regulated to various degrees in a panel of single-oncogene-transformed NIH 3T3 cells.
 Its localization is similar, but not identical, to the spliceosomal speckles.
 p190 shows a coordinate expression during the growth cycle of nontransformed NIH 3T3 cells; it is synthesized at the highest level under growth arrest conditions.
 It is expressed in adult mouse brain and is also present in human IMR-90 fibroblasts.
