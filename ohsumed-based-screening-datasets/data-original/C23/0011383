Large diameter expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for infrarenal aortic aneurysm surgery.
 The performance of an expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft used for aortic aneurysm replacement was evaluated.
 ePTFE grafts were implanted in 241 patients undergoing infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair.
 Sixty patients were operated as emergencies for aneurysm rupture and 181 electively.
 One hundred and fourteen bifurcated and 127 tube grafts were inserted.
 The transperitoneal approach was used in 64 cases and the remainder were placed using a retroperitoneal approach.
 There was a one-month mortality of 2.8% in elective and 20% in emergency cases.
 Median follow-up was 26 months.
 Specific graft complications included one infected graft resulting in a graft-enteric fistula.
 No graft rupture, degeneration, dilatation, pseudoaneurysm or late graft limb thromboses were observed in up to 7 years of follow-up.
 The aortic ePTFE prosthesis demonstrated satisfactory performance over the period studied.
