Characterization of rat hyperplastic bile ductular epithelial cells in culture and in vivo.
 A novel intrahepatic biliary cell culture/in vivo transplantation system has been developed with an essentially pure population of bile ductular epithelial cells isolated from rat liver 6-12 weeks after bile duct ligation.
 In primary culture, these cells retain staining strongly for gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase and glutathione S-transferase P.
 The cytoplasm of cultured bile ductular cells reacts with an anti-laminin antibody, but loses immunoreactivity with a monoclonal anti-cytokeratin 19 antibody.
 Semiconservative DNA synthesis in the cultured cells was dependent upon the continued presence of 10% fetal calf serum in the medium.
 Replicating bile ductular cells could be subcultured for a finite number of passages.
 In addition, freshly isolated bile ductular epithelial cells gave rise to well differentiated bile ductular structures when transplanted into the interscapular fat pads of syngeneic recipient rats.
