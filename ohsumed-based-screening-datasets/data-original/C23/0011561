Effect of dietary alpha-linolenic acid on growth, metastasis, fatty acid profile and prostaglandin production of two murine mammary adenocarcinomas.
 The purpose of this study was to determine whether dietary (n-3) fatty acids would affect mammary tumor growth and metastasis.
 Weanling female BALB/c mice were fed diets that contained 10% corn oil (CO), linseed oil (LO) or a fish oil-corn oil mix (FO) for 3-8 wk prior to receiving subcutaneous injections of one of two syngeneic mammary tumor cell types (410 and 410.4).
 Tumor growth was assessed by monitoring mean tumor diameter and tumor weight upon removal.
 Feeding LO, but not FO, reduced the growth (p less than 0.05) of 410.4 mammary tumors compared with growth in those fed CO.
 Metastasis data paralleled the tumor growth rate.
 Feeding LO and FO enhanced (p less than 0.005) incorporation of (n-3) fatty acids into tumors.
 Tumor prostaglandin E (PGE) production was reduced (p less than 0.005) by LO and FO, compared with CO.
 FO feeding reduced 410.4 tumor PGE synthesis more (p less than 0.05) than LO feeding, yet tumor growth was only inhibited by LO.
 These data suggest an inhibitory effect of dietary linolenic acid [i.e., 18:3 (n-3)] on mammary tumor growth and metastasis.
 However, this effect did not directly correlate with diet-induced changes in PGE synthesis.
