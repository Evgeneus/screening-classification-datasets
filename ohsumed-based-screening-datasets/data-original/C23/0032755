L-tryptophan supplementation does not affect postoperative pain intensity or consumption of analgesics.
 Aiming at optimizing serotonin levels in endogenous pain-modulating systems, L-tryptophan supplementation pre- and postoperatively (2 g/day for 7 days) did not affect pain development or analgesic consumption after third molar surgery.
 Biological effects related to an increase in mood were observed, however, indicating transport of L-tryptophan to the central nervous system.
 The findings are discussed in relation to earlier reports on favorable effects of L-tryptophan on experimental pain in healthy subjects and in chronic pain patients.
