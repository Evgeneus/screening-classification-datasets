Combined interferon alfa and doxorubicin in the treatment of advanced cervical cancer.
 Interferon alfa and doxorubicin have been shown to have synergistic effects when tested in vitro with cells derived from cervical cancers.
 A clinical trial was designed, testing interferon alfa plus doxorubicin in patients with advanced or recurrent cervical cancers.
 Twenty-one patients were given interferon alfa, 10 million units per square meter intramuscularly and 10 million units per square meter intravenously over a 30-minute infusion period.
 One hour later 20 mg/m2 doxorubicin was given intravenously slowly over a 2-hour period.
 Treatments were repeated once weekly for 3 weeks.
 Initial response evaluation was done at week 5, and treatment was continued on an every-other-week schedule for patients showing favorable responses or stable disease.
 Bone marrow, hepatic, and renal toxicities were minimal.
 Fever and malaise were the major sources of toxicity.
 Of the 17 evaluable patients, six had clinical partial responses.
 Two of the responders have enjoyed more than 5 years' survival.
 This regimen is well tolerated and does have efficacy in some patients with advanced cervical cancers.
