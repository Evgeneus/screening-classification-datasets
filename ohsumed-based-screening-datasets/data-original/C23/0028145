Midline craniectomy for sagittal suture synostosis: comparative efficacy of two barriers to calvarial reclosure.
 This report quantitatively compares long-term head remolding achieved by two methods for retarding bone reunion after midline craniectomy for sagittal suture synostosis.
 In one group of six children the adjacent bone edges were overlayed with 1.0-cm-wide U-channel silicone strips, and in the other group, composed of seven patients, a considerably larger extent of the adjacent cranium was covered with silicone sheets.
 Mean percent change in the cephalic indices of the former group 18 months postoperatively was 9.1% +/- S.D.
 = 6.7, and of the latter group 23.7% +/- S.D.
 = 6.0 (p congruent to 0.01).
 These results indicate that the use of large silicone sheets lead to a significantly greater normalization of cranial proportions.
