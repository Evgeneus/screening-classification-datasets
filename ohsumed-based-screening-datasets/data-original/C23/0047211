 Two patients with significant relative contraindications to fibrinolysis, and with refractory shock caused by acute pulmonary embolism, who were successfully treated with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) are reported.
 The role of rt-PA in the management of pulmonary embolism is discussed, and pertinent literature is reviewed.
