Bleeding from duodenal lymphangiectasia.
 An 8 year old girl with recurrent upper gastrointestinal bleeding was found to have localised duodenal lymphangiectasia by fibreoptic endoscopy.
 She did not show physical signs or laboratory evidence of significant enteric protein loss.
 A low fat diet seemed to prevent further bleeding.
 Duodenal lymphangiectasia may be associated with gastrointestinal bleeding in children.
