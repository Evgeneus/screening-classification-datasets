Effect of hypotensive epidural anaesthesia on acetabular cement-bone fixation in total hip arthroplasty.
 We selected 20 matched pairs of patients who had had total hip arthroplasty by the same surgeon using the same cemented technique.
 Matching was by age, sex, height, weight and diagnosis.
 One of each pair had received hypotensive epidural anaesthesia, with less than 300 ml blood loss: the other had normotensive general anaesthesia with more than 500 ml of blood loss.
 Early postoperative radiographs were evaluated independently by three blinded observers, using a scoring criteria which assessed the quality of the cement-bone interface.
 The results showed that patients who had received epidural anaesthesia had significantly better radiographic scores (p less than 0.02).
 Our findings suggest that hypotensive anaesthesia facilitates penetration of cement into bone.
