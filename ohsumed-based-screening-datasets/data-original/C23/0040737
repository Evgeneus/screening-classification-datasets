Hospitalisation of prostatic cancer patients undergoing orchiectomy.
 We report our experience with 100 orchiectomies for advanced prostatic cancer in hospitalised patients.
 Approximately 60% of the patients required hospitalisation for additional treatment and investigation of complications due to their disease at the time of orchiectomy.
 In 51 cases the orchiectomy was combined with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP); 37 patients had pathological levels of serum creatinine and 17 had pathological dilatation of the upper urinary tract, 6 of whom required a nephrostomy catheter.
 Because of anaemia on admission, 21 patients received a peri-operative blood transfusion.
 Two patients had significant post-operative bleeding, 2 developed a wound infection and 1 had a deep thrombophlebitis.
 The patients' mean age was 76.4 years and the period of hospitalisation ranged from 3 to 150 days with peaks at 3 and 8 days.
 The most important reason for prolonged hospitalisation was social problems.
 It was concluded that many patients who were hospitalised as a direct consequence of their prostatic carcinoma would have been in hospital for a similar period regardless of the method of hormonal manipulation used.
 Because so many patients have other reasons for hospitalisation, or require additional surgical procedures such as TURP, the true average cost of orchiectomy for advanced prostatic cancer is difficult to determine.
