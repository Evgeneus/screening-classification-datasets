Impact of maternal HIV infection on obstetrical and early neonatal outcome.
 In a case-control study of 177 HIV-seropositive and 326 seronegative women and their newborns in Nairobi, Kenya, maternal HIV infection at term was independently associated with travel to other African countries [odds ratio (OR) 4.9, P less than 0.0001], history of a blood transfusion since 1980 (OR 3.5, P = 0.01), history of more than one sexual partner in the previous 5 years (OR 1.8, P = 0.02) and unmarried status (OR 1.8, P = 0.02).
 Neonates of HIV-positive and HIV-negative women differed little with respect to occurrence of congenital malformations, stillbirths, in-hospital mortality, sex, APGAR score, or gestational age.
 However, the mean birth weight of singleton neonates of HIV-positive women was significantly lower than that of controls (3090 versus 3220 g, P = 0.005), and birth weight was less than 2500 g in 9% of cases and 3% of controls (OR 3.0, P = 0.007).
 Among neonates of HIV-seropositive women, birth weight was less than 2500 g in 17% if mothers were symptomatic and 6% if mothers were asymptomatic (OR 3.4, P = 0.08).
