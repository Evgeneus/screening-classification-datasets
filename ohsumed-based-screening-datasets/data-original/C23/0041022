Effect of nasal packing on eustachian tube function.
 Sixty-three patients undergoing surgery to the nasal septum followed by bilateral packing had pre- and post-operative tympanometry in order to determine the effect on eustachian tube function.
 Fifty-five of the 126 ears tested (46 per cent) developed a reduction in middle ear pressure of at least 50 daPa; 76 per cent became normal within 24 hours of removing the nasal packs.
 All ears were asymptomatic and no patient had evidence of middle ear effusion.
 Nasal packing following septal surgery is a frequent cause of short-lasting eustachian tube dysfunction but rarely severe enough to cause symptoms or middle ear effusion.
 Tubal dysfunction is most likely due to a combination of surgical oedema and a direct effect of the nasal packing.
