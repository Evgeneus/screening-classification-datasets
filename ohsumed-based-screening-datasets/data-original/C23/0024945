Kinetics of T cell activation in acute and chronic forms of murine graft-versus-host disease.
 Induction of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in the parent-into-F1 model is dependent on the presence of T cells in the donor inoculum.
 Although in vivo activation of donor T cells in response to F1 alloantigens is thought to be critical to GVHD induction, direct evidence of activated donor T cells has been lacking in this model.
 In the present study, spleen cells from acute or chronic GVHD mice were studied for evidence of T cell activation at multiple intervals early after GVHD induction.
 Spleen cells from both acute and chronic GVHD mice exhibited striking elevations in spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production, which were maximal 24 to 48 h after GVHD induction.
 Persistent lower levels of spontaneous in vitro activity were observed for spleen cells from mice tested 7 to 9 days after GVHD induction.
 In both forms of GVHD, increased spontaneous proliferation and IL-2 production were dependent on the presence of donor CD4+ T cells.
 These results strongly support the presence of activated donor T cells in vivo.
 Furthermore, these data imply that despite the significant differences in outcome, acute and chronic GVHD share a common early event.
