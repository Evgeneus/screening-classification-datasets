Multisystem failure and hepatic microvesicular fatty metamorphosis associated with tolmetin ingestion.
 Multisystem toxicity including both renal and hepatic failure has been reported with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
 We report a fatal case of multisystem failure associated with tolmetin ingestion in a 15-year-old girl.
 Microvesicular fatty change was found in the liver at autopsy.
 To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-associated multisystem failure to have this histopathologic finding.
