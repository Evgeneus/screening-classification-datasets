Is it correct to correct? Developmental milestones in 555 "normal" preterm infants compared with term infants.
 To determine whether correction for preterm birth should be applied during developmental assessment, we conducted a prospective national survey of very premature infants (born at less than 32 weeks of gestation); neurodevelopment in the first 2 years was studied with the Dutch child health care developmental assessment.
 In 555 preterm children who had no evidence of handicap at 2 years of age, the age at which developmental milestones were reached was established.
 The results were compared with the results of the same assessment in Dutch children born at term.
 During the first year, the development of the very premature children equaled the development of normal children when full correction was applied.
 At 2 years of age, development was equal to or better than normal children's development without correction.
 We conclude that full correction for prematurity should be applied in the first year to avoid overreferral for developmental stimulation, whereas at 2 years of age correction is not necessary.
