Cholestatic liver reaction during heparin therapy.
 Three patients are reported who developed liver enzyme abnormalities of a cholestatic pattern, without jaundice, after 10-28 d of heparin treatment.
 The values normalized within 4 months in all patients.
 Thus heparin should be added to the list of drugs that may cause a cholestatic liver reaction.
