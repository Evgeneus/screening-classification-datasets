 We report an unusual case of primary cutaneous mucormycosis caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer that occurred in a healthy young girl after an insect bite.
 The patient had a slowly extending, indurated, erythematous, and scaling eruption on the right cheek.
 Histologic examination revealed granulomatous dermatitis and characteristic broad, nonseptate, pale-staining hyphae.
 This is the first report of an infection in a human being caused by Mucor hiemalis Wehmer.
 The infection was cured with intravenous amphotericin B.
