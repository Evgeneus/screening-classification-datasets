A t(4;22) in a meningioma points to the localization of a putative tumor-suppressor gene.
 Cytogenetic analysis of meningioma cells from one particular patient (MN32) displayed the stem-line karyo-type 45, XY, -1, 4p+, 22q-, 22q+, which thus had rearrangements of both chromosomes 22.
 The 22q+ marker appeared as a dicentric: 22 pter----q11::1p11----qter.
 The reciprocal product of this translocation has presumably been lost because it lacked a centromere.
 The 22q- chromosome also appeared to have lost sequences distal to band q11.
 We assumed that this marker could have been the result of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 4 and 22.
 To investigate the 4p+ and 22q- chromosomes in more detail, human-hamster somatic cell hybrids were constructed that segregated the 22q- and 4p+ chromosomes.
 Southern blot analysis with DNA from these hybrids showed that sequences from 22q were indeed translocated to 4p+ and that reciprocally sequences from 4p were translocated to 22q-, demonstrating a balanced t(4;22)(p16;q11).
 On the basis of these results we presume that in this tumor a tumor-suppressor gene is deleted in the case of the 22q+ marker and that the t(4;22) disrupts the second allele of this gene.
 The latter translocation was mapped between D22S1 and D22S15, a distance of 1 cM on the linkage map of this chromosome.
 The area in which we have located the translocation is within the region where the gene predisposing to neurofibromatosis 2 has been mapped.
