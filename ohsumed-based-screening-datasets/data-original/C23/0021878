Penetrating injuries to the stomach.
 The charts of 298 consecutive patients with penetrating gastric injuries were reviewed.
 Mechanisms of injury were gunshot wounds in 167, stab wounds in 107 and shotgun wounds in 24.
 Twenty-eight patients died within 24 hours and 27 patients had serosal injuries.
 These patients were excluded from the study.
 The morbidity of gastric injury was defined in 243 patients.
 The probability of morbidity from the gastric wound was assessed by a multivariate analysis of 11 factors, including number of associated injuries, amount of contamination, age, mechanism of injury, shock, thoracostomy tube, injury to operation time, operative time, blood replacement and injury to the diaphragm or colon.
 Extensive complications developed in 65 patients.
 Eleven patients died.
 The gastric injury was directly associated with 15 extensive complications: ten instances of empyema after gastric and diaphragmatic injuries, two instances of gastric repair breakdown, gastric repair bleeding requiring exploration, a missed gastric injury and one instance of gastric outlet obstruction.
 One patient died of sepsis after breakdown of the gastric repair.
 Complications were statistically associated with age, gunshot wounds and the use of 2 or more units of blood.
 Other factors did not statistically increase complications.
 The 12.5 per cent empyema rate (ten of 81 patients) with gastric and diaphragmatic wounds was unexpected, but not statistically significant.
 Morbidity from penetrating gastric injuries is secondary to technical and infectious complications.
 Age, mechanism of injury and blood transfusion correlated with morbidity.
 The increased incidence of empyema suggests consideration of pleural lavage in combined gastric and diaphragmatic injuries.
