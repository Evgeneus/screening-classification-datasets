Microvessel derived endothelial cell isolation, adherence, and monolayer formation for vascular grafts.
 MVECs can be isolated from animal and human fat in quantities and in a pure enough form to produce a cell-lined vascular graft.
 In animal studies grafts treated with these cells are associated with prolongation of graft patency.
 In human implants definitive expression factor VIII related antigen cells has been performed on an MVEC treated graft at 9 months.
 Further studies will be necessary to provide further insight into the healing and long-term behavior of these grafts, both with respect to the thrombogenicity of the surface as well as the influence on anastomotic hyperplasia.
