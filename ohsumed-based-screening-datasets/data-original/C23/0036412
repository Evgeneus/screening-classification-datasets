Fatal human cyclical neutropenia with unresolving tonsillitis and bilateral cervical abscesses.
 Human Cyclical Neutropenia is a rare haematological disorder, characterized by periodic oscillations in peripheral neutrophil levels from normal to neutropenic, during which patients experience ulcerative stomatitis, fever, malaise and occasional cutaneous and subcutaneous infections.
 We present our experience with a fatal case of Human Cyclical Neutropenia together with a brief review of the literature and diagnostic criteria.
 The paper aims to heighten the clinical awareness of the otolaryngologist to the condition.
 Close co-operation with the haematologist is essential both for diagnosis and management.
