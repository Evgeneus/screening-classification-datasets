Hydroxychloroquine is effective therapy for control of cutaneous sarcoidal granulomas.
 Cutaneous sarcoidosis often responds poorly to topical and intralesional corticosteroids but may respond to moderate to high doses of oral corticosteroids.
 To avoid the use of systemic corticosteroids, we treated 17 patients with cutaneous sarcoidal granulomas with hydroxychloroquine (2 to 3 mg/kg/day) in an open clinical trial.
 If response occurred, other medications were first tapered and then the hydroxychloroquine dosage was reduced or stopped.
 The cutaneous lesions of 12 patients regressed within 4 to 12 weeks, and they were able to stop other therapies; three patients had a partial response, and two patients had no regression.
 Two of eight patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis improved.
 No ocular toxicity was noted.
