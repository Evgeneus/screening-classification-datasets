Elevated plasma adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) with adrenal hyperplasia: a new factor in ACTH regulation?
 We report a patient with Cushing's syndrome in whom the etiology of the hypercortisolemia could not be definitely established despite extensive biochemical investigations.
 Results included raised basal serum cortisol, plasma ACTH, and urinary free cortisol; failure to suppress even a paradoxical rise in serum cortisol after dexamethasone (1 mg overnight, 2, 8, and 16 mg/day); and a definite but not exaggerated rise in 11-deoxycortisol after metyrapone.
 After iv CRF, plasma ACTH rose from 22 to 30 pmol/L.
 Abdominal computed tomographic scanning showed adrenal hyperplasia; the presence of an adrenal adenoma, although suspected, was not established.
 An unusual finding was the presence in the urine of large amounts of 21-deoxycortisol metabolites, including 3 alpha,11 beta,17 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-pregnan-20-one and 5 beta-pregnane 3 alpha,11 beta,17 alpha,20 alpha-tetrol.
 On the basis of preoperative biochemical/radiological findings, a provisional diagnosis of ACTH-dependent Cushing's syndrome associated with autonomous bilateral adrenal hyperplasia was made.
 Incomplete bilateral adrenalectomy was performed; adrenal hyperplasia was histologically confirmed, but no tumor was found.
 However, ACTH was measured 1) just before operation when the patient was receiving treatment with metyrapone, and 2) postoperatively when the patient was receiving steroid replacement only, and on these occasions ACTH levels were lower than during the initial investigations.
 Pituitary scans before and after adrenalectomy were similar, offering no evidence of pituitary infarction.
 We propose that abnormal production of 21-deoxycortisol contributed to the aberrant regulation of ACTH and cortisol in this case, providing an example of a previously unreported cause of hypercortisolemia.
