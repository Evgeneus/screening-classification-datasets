Kawasaki-like syndrome after treatment with mesalazine.
 We report a patient who developed a severe hypersensitivity reaction, including rash, lymph node enlargement, fever, hepatitis, and eosinophilia, after sulphasalazine therapy.
 Five years later, he developed a similar reaction after exposure to mesalazine, the salicylic compound of sulphasalazine.
 We conclude that patients with known severe systemic reaction to sulphasalazine therapy are also at risk for such a reaction when treated with a 5-ASA preparation.
