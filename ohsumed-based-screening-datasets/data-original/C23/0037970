Familial leg ulcers of juvenile onset 
 Chronic ulceration of the legs was found in the propositus and in ten male relatives in a family of Iraqi Jews.
 All eleven males had juvenile onset of symptoms.
 Venous lesions with ulceration were found in two of the propositus' brothers and without ulceration in his three sisters.
 The findings suggest an autosomal dominant sex-limited genetic defect.
