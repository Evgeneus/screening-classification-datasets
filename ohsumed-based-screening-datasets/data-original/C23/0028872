Upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery. Predominant finding of aggressive duodenal ulcer disease.
 We reviewed our experience with endoscopically evaluated severe upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage following open heart surgery.
 Of 4892 patients undergoing open heart surgery, 18 (0.4%) sustained upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage requiring endoscopic evaluation.
 Endoscopy identified the source of bleeding in all cases.
 No significant complications of endoscopy were observed.
 Duodenal ulcers (DUs) were found in 16 (89%) of cases and were felt to be the source of bleeding in 15 (83%).
 Aggressive features, such as multiplicity, large size, or distal location were associated with 13 (81%) of the DU cases.
 Complications necessitated endoscopic or surgical therapy in eight (44%) patients with DUs.
 We conclude that aggressive DU disease accounts for the majority of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding following open heart surgery.
