Aspiration in bilateral stroke patients.
 Seventy patients with bilateral strokes underwent neurologic and videofluoroscopic barium swallowing examinations; 34 (48.6%) aspirated.
 Patients with aspiration were more likely to have posterior circulation strokes, abnormal cough, abnormal gag, and dysphonia.
 However, patients likely to aspirate can be identified best by the presence of an abnormal voluntary cough, an abnormal gag reflex, or both.
 The prediction of patients at risk for aspiration was not improved by additional clinical information (ie, presence of dysphonia or bilateral neurologic signs).
