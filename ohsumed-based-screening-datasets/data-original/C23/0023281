Benign parotid tumors: a 24-year experience.
 The medical records of 125 patients benign parotid neoplasms surgically treated over a 24-year period were retrospectively reviewed; 128 tumors were excised.
 These included 90 pleomorphic adenomas, 33 Warthin's tumors, 3 benign lymphoepitheliomas, and 2 oncocytomas.
 The surgical procedures consisted of 2 local excisions, 6 enucleations, 88 superficial parotidectomies, 13 subtotal parotidectomies, and 3 radical parotidectomies.
 The morbidity rate was 49%.
 There was one total permanent facial nerve paralysis (0.7%), four (3%) partial permanent facial nerve paralysis, five (5%) transient total facial nerve paralysis, and 32 (25%) partial transient facial nerve paralysis.
 After a median follow-up of 84 months, there was one recurrence (0.7%).
 A superficial parotidectomy is the minimum procedure that should be performed for the treatment of a benign parotid neoplasm.
