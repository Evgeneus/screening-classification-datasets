Electrophysiologic testing.
 Any attempt to group clinical states according to those in which EPS is indicated and those in which EPS is contraindicated is difficult because of a considerable overlap.
 With this one reservation in mind, indications for EPS can be classified in three general groups.
 These include a group in which the procedure is helpful and frequently indicated, a group in which the procedure is occasionally of benefit but more often there is a difference of opinion among investigators as to its utility, and a third group in which EPS is rarely helpful, often contraindicated, and on occasion harmful.
 The clinical states and the utility of the EPS in each are summarized in Table 1.
