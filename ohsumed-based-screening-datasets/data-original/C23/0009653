Plasma therapy for severe hemolytic-uremic syndrome in children in Atlantic Canada.
 Clinical reports have suggested that therapy with fresh frozen plasma is a useful adjunct in the management of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS).
 We reviewed the charts of 36 children with severe HUS who were treated at the Izaac Walton Killam Hospital for Children, Halifax, over 10 years to assess the effectiveness of plasma therapy.
 All children who required specific supportive therapy for renal dysfunction, hemolysis or serious extrarenal complications were included.
 We compared the outcome of 18 children who received plasma therapy from 1982 to 1987 with that of 18 children who did not.
 The two groups were similar with regard to the severity of HUS, the length of hospital stay, the duration of renal dysfunction and the incidence of disease-related complications, such as seizures, enterocolitis and cardiomyopathy.
 At discharge the prevalence of hypertension was higher in the plasma therapy group than in the control group.
 Plasma therapy did not demonstrate any benefit that would outweigh the risk of fluid overload, hyperproteinemia and transmission of viral infection.
