Goniotomy technique for removal of anterior chamber intraocular lenses.
 Removal of an anterior chamber intraocular lens is often impeded by formation of peripheral anterior synechiae around one or more of the lens haptics.
 We describe a method of lysing adhesions under direct visualization through a contact gonioprism lens.
 This method is relatively atraumatic to vital anterior-chamber-angle structures.
