Azoospermia: a complication of hydrocele repair in a fertile population.
 Although minor complications have been reported, hydrocelectomy generally is considered to be a safe procedure.
 We recently treated 3 patients who became azoospermic after hydrocele repair.
 Of the patients 2 underwent bilateral and 1 unilateral hydrocelectomy.
 All 3 patients had iatrogenic injury to the vas deferens or epididymis after hydrocele repair.
