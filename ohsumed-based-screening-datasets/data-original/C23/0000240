Entrapment of a folded-over introducer sheath in the iliofemoral artery: an unusual complication of PTCA guiding catheter exchange 
 An arterial introducer sheath became folded over in the iliac artery during PTCA.
 This probably resulted from withdrawal of a doubled over Judkins left coronary guiding catheter through the introducer sheath.
 Nonsurgical, atraumatic removal was accomplished after the acute bend of the introducer sheath had been withdrawn to the site of arterial entrance.
