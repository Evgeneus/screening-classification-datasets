Radial shortening for Kienbock disease.
 The cases of twenty-nine consecutive patients (thirty wrists) who had radial shortening for the treatment of stages I through IIIB Kienbock disease were reviewed to assess the results of this procedure.
 Thirteen patients (45 per cent) had a history of trauma, and all thirty wrists had a negative ulnar variance (average, 2.8 millimeters) on radiographs.
 All wrists were re-examined after an average follow-up of 3.8 years (minimum, two years).
 At that time, the pain had decreased in 87 per cent of the wrists.
 Extension of the wrist had improved an average of 32 per cent; flexion, 27 per cent; radial deviation, 30 per cent; ulnar deviation, 41 per cent; and grip strength on the affected side, 49 per cent.
 Analysis of the radiographs by computer digitization showed no significant changes in the amount of collapse of the lunate at the latest follow-up.
 In two wrists, there were complications at follow-up (excessive shortening of the radius and non-union of the radial osteotomy).
 Radial shortening is an effective treatment for Kienbock disease in wrists that do not have degenerative changes in adjacent carpal joints.
 Pain, range of motion, and strength can be expected to improve, but the radiographic appearance of the lunate changes little, if any.
