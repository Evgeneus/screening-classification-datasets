Fistulas between the aorta and tracheobronchial tree.
 Aortobronchial fistula is a rare condition that is invariably fatal if not diagnosed and surgically treated.
 With appropriate surgical intervention, survival rates greater than 70% can be achieved.
 A review of the literature and an illustrative case report are presented.
 A total of 63 fistulas in 62 patients have been described.
 The case we present is unusual in the use of serratus anterior muscle for repair of the fistula.
 Eighty-seven percent of the cases documented in the literature were associated with an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta.
 Eighty-six percent of the fistulas were between the descending aorta and left bronchopulmonary tree.
 More than 95% of patients experienced at least a single episode of hemoptysis, and massive hemoptysis occurred in more than half of the reported cases.
 A correct preoperative diagnosis was made in only 54% of cases.
 Plain chest radiographs definitively demonstrated an aneurysm in only 16%.
 The computed tomographic scan was the most rewarding test, identifying an aneurysm in 11 of 12 patients and the fistula in 50% of them.
 Surgical repair resulted in a 76% survival rate.
