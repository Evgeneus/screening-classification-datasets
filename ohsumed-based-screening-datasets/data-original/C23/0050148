Effects of enteral fat emulsion on fat absorption in obstructive jaundiced rats.
 The effects of fat emulsion given enterally on fat absorption were studied with obstructive jaundiced rats (J group) as compared with jaundice-free rats (C group).
 The J and C groups were subdivided into JE and CE groups using emulsified fat for the fat absorption test, and JU and CU groups using unemulsified fat.
 Rats in all groups were fed for 7 days with regular rat chow.
 After fasting for 12 hours, 14C-labeled fat emulsion was infused to the JE and CE, and 14C-labeled unemulsified fat to the JU and CU groups through a gastrostomy for the absorption test.
 The hourly and cumulative output of 14CO2 by respiration, absorption rate of 14C-labeled fat in the intestine, and metabolic oxidation rate of the absorbed fat were determined during an 8-hour period after the gastroenteral administration of emulsified or unemulsified fat.
 The peak of hourly output was seen after the first 2 hours in the CE, JE, and CU groups, following which a remarkable decline was seen in the CE and CU groups.
 However, a more gentle descent in the JE, and fluctuation at a low level in the JU group were observed.
 The cumulative output in the JE was 61% of that in the CE, while the output in the JU was 16% of that in the CU group.
 The absorption rate in the JE was 81% of that in the CE group, while the rate in the JU was 22% of that in the Cu group.
