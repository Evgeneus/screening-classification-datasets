Vaginal cuff closure at abdominal hysterectomy: comparing sutures with absorbable staples.
 To compare two methods of vaginal cuff closure during abdominal hysterectomy, 60 patients were randomized to one of two cuff-closure methods.
 The vaginal cuff was closed with three interrupted 0-Dexon sutures in 30 and with absorbable staples in 30.
 Both groups were similar with respect to age, gravidity, parity, preoperative indication, hemoglobin, and hematocrit.
 The operative technique and quantity of irrigation used was standardized.
 Operative blood loss was calculated by the weight method and an unactivated, medium flat Jackson-Pratt drain was left in place for collecting postoperative cuff cultures at 24 and 48 hours.
 The mean operative times in the suture group (97.4 minutes) and staple group (93.4 minutes) were not significantly different (P greater than .05).
 Cuff-closure time was more rapid (P = .0001) in the staple group (5.8 minutes) than in the suture group (9.3 minutes).
 Intraoperative cultures were positive in eight of 30 suture patients (26.7%) and eight of 30 staple patients (26.7%).
 Postoperative cultures at either 24 or 48 hours were positive in four women (13.3%) in the suture group and six (20%) in the staple group.
 Febrile morbidity occurred in six (20%) in each group.
 Three staple and two suture subjects developed a vaginal cuff abscess or hematoma, one of whom was readmitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics and draining of the vaginal cuff abscess.
 The presence of a positive vaginal cuff culture did not predict clinical outcome.
 Based on these observations and the increased cost of the stapling device, we conclude that there is no significant clinical advantage of surgical staples over traditional sutures for vaginal cuff closure at abdominal hysterectomy.
