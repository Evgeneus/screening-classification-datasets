Endovascular treatment of intracerebral arteriovenous malformations: experience in 49 cases.
 The authors report the results of treatment in 49 consecutive patients with brain arteriovenous malformations (AVM's) who underwent therapeutic embolization with liquid adhesive agents between 1984 and 1988 at the Toronto Western Hospital.
 Thirty-three patients had no other treatment and were followed up with angiography at 2 years and clinically from 2 to 6 years.
 Of the other 16 patients, 10 had adjunctive radiosurgery and six underwent surgical resection following embolization.
 Seven (14%) of the 49 patients had a morphological cure effected by embolization as evidenced on their 2-year follow-up angiograms: these have remained clinically stable.
 Twelve patients developed neurological deficits after embolization; eight (16% of the series) were transient and four (8%) were permanent.
 Two patients (4%) had a delayed hemorrhage after incomplete obliteration of their malformations.
 Endovascular treatment resulted in clinical improvement in 15 (33%) of the other 46 patients.
 None of the patients who initially presented with hemorrhage had a rebleed following embolization.
 It is concluded that endovascular treatment with liquid embolic material can be an integral part of the multidisciplinary treatment protocol for patients with brain AVM's.
