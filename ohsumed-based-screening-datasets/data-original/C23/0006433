The Maylard incision in gynecologic surgery 
 The transverse muscle-splitting Maylard incision was used in 175 gynecologic patients who required pelvic-abdominal surgery.
 One hundred fifty-three patients (87%) had pelvic malignancy; other indications for operation included uterine myomas, endometriosis, tuboovarian abscess, and benign ovarian cysts.
 Exposure was excellent: 54% of patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy and 17% underwent paraaortic lymphadenectomy.
 Twelve patients (6.9%) had wound complications, but there was neither long-term morbidity nor mortality associated with the incision.
 Fifty-six patients (32%) received preoperative or postoperative pelvic radiation therapy with no detrimental effect on wound healing.
 The Maylard incision is cosmetic, strong, easily learned, and has an acceptable complication rate.
 Unless a vertical incision is indicated, the Maylard technique is preferred when optimal exposure and accessibility to the pelvis are required.
