The prognosis of contact dermatitis.
 This article reviews the prognosis of contact dermatitis, particularly of occupational contact dermatitis.
 Most studies document a poor prognosis for occupational and nonoccupational contact dermatitis.
 The prognoses of occupational and nonoccupational contact dermatitis, irritant contact dermatitis, and allergic contact dermatitis are similar.
 Only a minority of studies on the prognosis of occupational contact dermatitis have found that a job change by the affected worker leads to clearing of the dermatitis.
 Dermatologic and nondermatologic factors associated with a poor prognosis are discussed.
