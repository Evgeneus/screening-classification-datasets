Bladder instillations of trisdine compared with catheter introducer for reduction of bacteriuria during intermittent catheterisation of patients with acute spinal cord trauma.
 An open, prospective, randomised trial was conducted to compare the incidence of significant bacteriuria following 2 methods of intermittent urethral catheterisation in patients with acute spinal cord trauma.
 Twenty-two patients were catheterised with a Nelaton catheter and 50 ml of Trisdine were instilled into the bladder and left there immediately prior to withdrawal of the catheter.
 Fifteen patients were catheterised with a Nelaton catheter with a special introducer to improve asepsis (O'Neil catheter).
 The mean incidence of significant bacteriuria in males and females who received Trisdine bladder instillations was 0.58 and 0.48% per catheterisation respectively; in males and females catheterised with the O'Neil catheter it was 1.16 and 2.93% per catheterisation respectively.
 The instillation of Trisdine into the bladder after each passage of a catheter resulted in a significantly lower incidence of bacteriuria compared with that which resulted from the use of the O'Neil catheter.
 The former method is therefore to be preferred for aseptic intermittent urethral catheterisation in patients with acute spinal cord trauma.
