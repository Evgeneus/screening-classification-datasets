Eosinophil-induced chronic active hepatitis in the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.
 A 19-yr-old man had features of chronic hepatitis with piecemeal necrosis as the sole clinical feature of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome.
 Liver biopsy specimens demonstrated the presence of activated eosinophils and, by immunohistochemical staining, major basic protein in areas of hepatic cell damage.
 The case demonstrates the clinical presentation of the idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome as chronic hepatitis and the association between eosinophil infiltration and degranulation with the presence of hepatocyte necrosis.
