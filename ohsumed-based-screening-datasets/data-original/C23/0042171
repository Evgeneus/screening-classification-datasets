Reversible symptomatic biliary obstruction associated with ceftriaxone pseudolithiasis.
 Ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin, has been associated with the development of sludge or stones in the gallbladders of some patients treated with this medication.
 Such precipitates, which are usually reversible upon discontinuation of the drug, sometimes cause symptoms, have simulated acute cholecystitis, and have even led to cholecystectomy in some cases.
 We report the first known instance of biliary obstruction and secondary pancreatitis in association with reversible ceftriaxone-induced pseudolithiasis.
