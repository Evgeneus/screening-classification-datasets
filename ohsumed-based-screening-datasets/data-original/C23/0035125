Erythroleukemia in a child associated with monosomy 7.
 A case of erythroleukemia (EL) associated with monosomy 7 is reported.
 The EL was diagnosed 20 months after the initial diagnosis of monosomy 7 was made.
 An immunologic study of the blast cells using a monoclonal antibody was positive for glycophorin A, which suggested that they were of erythroid origin; this was confirmed by electron microscopy.
 Chemotherapy was started with low dose cytarabine.
 However, the patient had severe bone marrow suppression and died of pneumonia.
 Our case shows that monosomy 7 is an abnormality of the pluripotential stem cells, including erythroid cells, that resulted in a true erythroid neoplasm.
