IgD immune complex vasculitis in a patient with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever.
 We describe a 27-year-old Dutch woman with the hyperimmunoglobulinemia D and periodic fever syndrome.
 During febrile attacks she occasionally presented with skin lesions on the distal parts of her upper and lower extremities, with the histologic picture of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
 Clear perivascular deposits of IgD and C3 were presented in early lesional skin on immunofluorescence investigation.
 Circulating IgD immune complexes were demonstrated on several occasions, both during and in between clinical attacks.
 These findings are consistent with an IgD immune complex-mediated pathogenesis for the skin lesions.
 In 10 patients with other forms of immune complex vasculitis of the skin, minimal perivascular deposits of IgD were found in four cases.
 In these cases, however, IgD was never found as the solitary immunoglobulin class.
