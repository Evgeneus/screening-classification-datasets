Repeated intestinal ulcerations in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and high serum antiphospholipid antibody levels.
 We report the case of a patient with SLE who had repeated ulceration of the small intestine requiring emergency surgery.
 Pathologic examination revealed microthrombosis and vasculitis at the site of the intestinal ulcers.
 High levels of antiphospholipid antibodies, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged prothrombin time coincided with the episodes of intestinal ulceration.
 Antiphospholipid antibodies may be involved in the development of thrombosis resulting in the repeated episodes of intestinal ulceration in this patient.
 This possibility should be considered in patients with SLE who have intestinal ulceration and appropriate antithrombotic medication should be administered.
