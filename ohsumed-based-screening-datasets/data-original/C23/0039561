Pain centers--organization and outcome.
 Pain treatment centers have evolved at a rapid rate, but they differ in their complexity and services provided.
 Patients, as well as primary care physicians, have difficulty in identifying the appropriate center for a specific problem.
 Guidelines for pain centers have recently been proposed by the International Association for the Study of Pain, along with an attempt at their accreditation.
 Outcome studies from pain centers have proliferated, with a wide range of treatment programs being reported.
 Comprehensive multidisciplinary pain centers using the rehabilitation medicine approach are effective in decreasing disability and increasing the productivity of patients with chronic, disabling pain.
