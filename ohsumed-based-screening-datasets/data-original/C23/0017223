Hydromyelic hydrocephalus. Correlation of hydromyelia with various stages of hydrocephalus in postshunt isolated compartments.
 The clinical features and pathophysiology of specific forms of hydromyelia are analyzed in this report together with the chronological changes of associated hydrocephalus.
 Nine patients were studied; all had hydromyelia with varying degrees of associated hydrocephalus.
 Clinically applicable classification systems were used to evaluate the progression of hydrocephalus (Stages I to IV) and to define the compartment isolated after shunting in the previously communicating cerebral ventricles (Types I to IV).
 Four patients had Stage IV disease (holoneural canal dilatation); one had Stage II and four had Stage I disease (both Stages I and II with supratentorial hydrocephalus).
 All patients were initially treated by ventriculoperitoneal shunting at an average age of 9.9 years.
 Five patients had progressive spinal symptoms before or after treatment of their hydrocephalus.
 Two patients had Type III isolation (an isolated rhombencephalic ventricle) with a functioning ventricular shunt; ventriculography confirmed a communication between the fourth ventricle and the hydromyelia, and both patients improved after placement of a shunt in the fourth ventricle.
 The remaining patients had Type IV isolation (isolated central canal dilatation) with a functioning ventricular shunt.
 This study indicates that in some cases the pathophysiology of hydromyelia is closely related to associated hydrocephalus.
 A new concept of the development of an isolated compartment after shunting is proposed to explain the progression of hydromyelia in these cases.
