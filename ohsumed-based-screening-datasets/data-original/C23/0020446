Otitis media in day-care children. A report from the International Primary Care Network.
 The relationship between day care and acute otitis media and its adverse consequences was analyzed as part of a collaborative multinational study.
 Data from primary care research networks in eight countries were collected on 1335 children, aged 0 to 60 months, at the time of initial visits to their primary care physicians for acute otitis media.
 A history of recurrent acute otitis media, poor hearing, and tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy were all more frequent in day-care children aged 25 to 60 months, compared with those cared for at home.
 Day-care children were brought to their physicians more promptly after the onset of symptoms and received more referrals to otolaryngologists at the time of the index visit for acute otitis media.
 Day care may pose a significant risk for otitis media and its adverse consequences.
