Restenosis 1 to 24 months after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty: a necropsy study of 20 patients.
 This report describes clinical, morphologic and histologic findings at necropsy late (range 1.6 to 24.1 months [average 8.2 months]) after clinically successful coronary balloon angioplasty in 20 patients with coronary angioplasty restenosis.
 Clinical evidence of restenosis occurred in 14 patients (70%), including 6 patients with sudden coronary death.
 Of the 20 patients, 14 (70%) had a cardiac cause of death and 6 (30%) had a noncardiac cause of death.
 Two major subgroups of histologic findings were observed: 1) intimal proliferation (60%), and 2) atherosclerotic plaque only (40%).
 Of the eight sites with atherosclerotic plaque only, six were eccentric lesions and two were concentric lesions.
 No morphologic evidence of previous angioplasty injury (cracks, breaks, tears) was observed in the eight patients with atherosclerotic plaque only.
 Proposed mechanisms for the development of intimal proliferation involve the reaction of smooth muscle cells and platelets, whereas elastic recoil of overstretched eccentric or concentric atherosclerotic lesions represents the most likely explanation for the findings in the latter subgroup.
 On the basis of these morphologic findings at angioplasty restenosis sites, specific treatment strategies for restenosis after coronary artery balloon angioplasty are proposed.
