Molecular methods to detect the Philadelphia chromosome.
 The Ph1 chromosome has two molecular subtypes: a bcr-positive seen in CML and some cases of ALL, and the bcr-negative subtype mainly seen in ALL.
 In CML, because of the restriction of chromosome 22 breakpoints to the bcr, Southern analysis to detect bcr rearrangements also can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome.
 In contrast, the translocation breakpoints on the Ph1 chromosome are scattered in ALL, so that other methods such as PFGE and PCR are necessary to detect the Ph1 chromosome.
 In both CML and ALL, use of these methods to detect molecular abnormalities may be superior to cytogenetics in detecting chromosomal abnormalities.
 Southern analysis also can be used in CML to map breakpoint locations within the bcr.
 This may offer prognostic information as to the length of chronic phase, but there is conflicting information as to the validity of this approach.
 The modified PCR (using cDNA from mRNA) can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome and to define which of the molecular subtypes are present.
 The exquisite sensitivity of this method, which is capable of detecting as little as a single abnormal molecule of RNA or DNA, makes it suited for the detection of minimal residual disease in both CML and ALL.
 This is particularly useful after intensive therapies, such as bone marrow transplantation.
 Whether these low levels of fusion gene expression are of prognostic significance is still unclear.
