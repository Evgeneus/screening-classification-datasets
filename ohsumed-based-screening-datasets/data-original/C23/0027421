Abscesses of the neck in infants and young children. A review of 112 cases.
 A review of 112 patients 5 years of age and younger with cervical abscesses is reported.
 Staphylococcus aureus and group A beta-hemolytic Streptococcus were cultured most often: in 39% and 17% of patients, respectively.
 Sixteen patients (14%) had unusual abscesses such as infected congenital cysts, cat-scratch disease, or myocobacterial abscesses.
 One patient had a necrotizing infection with group A streptococci and anaerobic streptococci.
 Intravenous antibiotic therapy was used in 104 patients, with 94% of these patients receiving a penicillin derivative, usually an antistaphylococcal penicillin.
 Ninety-six percent of the patients had incision and drainage of their abscesses; 8 patients required more than one incision and drainage.
 Two patients required airway intervention, 1 by intubation and 1 by trachetomy.
 Most pediatric cervical abscesses respond well to appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy and incision and drainage.
