Selective attenuation by perivascular blood of prostanoid-dependent cerebrovascular dilation in piglets.
 Cerebral hemorrhagic insults are common in neonates.
 However, the consequences of intracranial blood on cerebral hemodynamics are poorly understood.
 We examined the effects of perivascular blood on cerebrovascular dilator responses in 29 piglets.
 Fresh, autologous blood (n = 15) or cerebrospinal fluid (n = 14) was placed under the dura mater over the parietal cortex, and the piglets were allowed to recover from anesthesia.
 One to four days later, a closed cranial window was placed over the parietal cortex and pial arteriolar responses to arterial hypercapnia (PaCO2 greater than 55 mm Hg), hemorrhagic hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure less than 35 mm Hg), or topical application of 10(-6) and 10(-4) M isoproterenol were determined.
 Pial arterioles in the cerebrospinal fluid group dilated 27 +/- 4% (mean +/- SEM) (n = 11) in response to hypercapnia, 26 +/- 5% (n = 9) in response to hypotension, and 26 +/- 3% in response to 10(-6) M and 40 +/- 4% in response to 10(-4) M isoproterenol (n = 11).
 In the group in which blood was placed on the parietal cortex, pial arterioles did not dilate significantly in response to hypercapnia (8 +/- 3%, n = 11) or hypotension (2 +/- 5%, n = 13) but dilated normally in response to isoproterenol (25 +/- 5% in response to 10(-6) M and 36 +/- 7% in response to 10(-4) M, n = 13).
 We conclude that prolonged contact of pial arterioles with extravascular blood selectively attenuates cerebrovascular dilation in piglets.
