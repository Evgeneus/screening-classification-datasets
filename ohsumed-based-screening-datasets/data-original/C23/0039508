Crossover ilioprofunda reconstruction: an expanded role for obturator foramen bypass.
 The standard obturator foramen bypass extends from the aorta or iliac artery to the ipsilateral superficial femoral or popliteal artery.
 This operation has been both effective and versatile as an indirect bypass procedure for circumventing difficult vascular problems in the femoral triangle.
 A case is presented of a patient whose limb was salvaged by an obturator foramen bypass from the contralateral iliac artery to the profunda femoris artery.
 This unique case is compared to other published cases to emphasize the potential advantages of the profunda femoris as the preferred graft outflow in selected cases of arterial reconstruction through the obturator foramen.
