Effect of epidural clonidine on analgesia and pharmacokinetics of epidural fentanyl in postoperative patients.
 Epidural clonidine produces postoperative analgesia in patients and potentiates opioid analgesia in animals.
 The aim of the current study was to assess the effect of epidural clonidine on the plasma concentrations and analgesic effect of fentanyl after epidural administration.
 Twenty ASA physical status 2 or 3 patients recovering from abdominal surgery were allocated randomly to receive either epidural fentanyl (100 micrograms in 10 ml isotonic saline; EF group) or epidural fentanyl (same dose) plus epidural clonidine (150 micrograms; EF + C group) in isotonic saline solution.
 Analgesia was assessed over a period of 12 h after epidural injection.
 Venous samples were obtained until 360 min after epidural injection for radioimmunoassay determination of plasma fentanyl concentration.
 Onset of analgesia was similar in the two groups of patients (13 +/- 6 and 13 +/- 3 min, respectively, after injection), but duration was more than doubled in the patients receiving clonidine (543 +/- 183 vs.
 250 +/- 64 min).
 Peak plasma fentanyl concentrations (Fmax) and the time to reach Cmax (Tmax) were comparable in the two groups (0.29 +/- 0.15 ng.ml-1 at 16.2 +/- 14.8 min in the EF group and 0.27 +/- 0.11 ng.ml-1 at 8.3 +/- 5.5 min in the EF + C group), as were plasma concentrations at each definite time of measurement.
 Drowsiness and hypotension were noticed in the EF + C group.
 Thus, epidural clonidine appears to prolong epidural fentanyl analgesia without affecting its plasma concentration.
