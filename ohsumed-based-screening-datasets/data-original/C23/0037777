Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy of pancreatic duct stones.
 Chronic calcifying pancreatitis presents a major clinical problem, often requiring extensive surgery.
 Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) offers a new therapeutic option.
 We applied ESWL after endoscopic sphincterotomy of the pancreatic orifice in eight patients with impacted pancreatic duct stones.
 An electromagnetic lithotriptor (Siemens Lithostar, Erlangen, FRG) was used.
 Patients were treated in prone position under fluoroscopic control.
 A mean of 6,813 shock waves (range 1,500-10,000) was delivered in one or two sessions.
 Disintegration of stones was achieved in 6/8 patients, initial relief of pain in 7/8 patients, and total clearance of the pancreatic duct in 3/8 patients.
 One patient had an exacerbation of her pancreatitis one day after ESWL, which resolved rapidly with medical treatment.
 No other complications were observed.
 Four of five patients with fragmented stones had no abdominal complaints at follow-up (mean 17 months, range 3-27).
 Three patients in whom ESWL was not completely successful (two without and one with partial fragmentation) underwent an operation according to Puestow.
 Two of them still have abdominal complaints after surgery.
 From these data, we conclude that ESWL of pancreatic duct stones is a promising new alternative for surgery, when endoscopic stone extraction fails.
