Globus pharyngeus: long-term follow-up and prognostic factors.
 A prospective trial of 80 patients with globus pharyngeus is reported.
 An in-depth analysis of the typical history at presentation is given.
 The average follow-up period was 27 months (range, 21 to 42 months).
 The asymptomatic rate at this interval was 25%, with a further 35% reporting a significant improvement in symptoms.
 Three independent factors were found to influence prognosis (p less than .05).
 These were sex, length of history at consultation, and the presence or absence of associated throat symptoms.
 Male patients having a history of the globus symptom for less than 3 months and not complaining of any associated throat symptoms had the best chance of becoming asymptomatic or symptomatically improved.
 The presence or absence of heartburn or its treatment had no bearing on outcome.
