Open, double-blind and long-term study of vigabatrin in chronic epilepsy.
 We performed an open, double-blind, and long-term study of vigabatrin (gamma-vinyl-GABA, GVG) in patients with treatment-resistant epilepsy who were receiving only one or at most two standard antiepileptic drugs (AEDs).
 The novel design included a parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase that minimized the number of patients receiving placebo and allowed determination of the optimum dose of GVG for each patient before initiation of the double-blind phase.
 The study was divided into four phases.
 The first phase was a 6-week period of baseline observation.
 In the second phase, GVG was added openly to previous AEDs for 8 weeks.
 During the first 2 weeks of this phase, the dose of GVG was increased weekly and then, in the absence of adverse effects, was held constant for the next 6 weeks.
 At the end of this open phase, seizure frequency during the 6 weeks of constant treatment was compared with the baseline seizure frequency for each patient.
 Patients who experienced reduction greater than 50% in the frequency of any seizure type during the open phase were defined as responders.
 These responders were then entered into the third and double-blind phase, in which they were randomly allocated wither to continue active GVG treatment or placebo for 8 weeks.
 Thirty-three patients entered the study; 31 of 33 patients completed the initial open phase.
 Twenty patients achieved a reduction greater than or equal to 50% in the frequency of one or more seizure types and were eligible for the double-blind phase; 10 were randomized to continue GVG and 10 were randomized to placebo.
