Polycystic ovaries: do these represent a specific endocrinopathy?
 Serum pituitary gonadotrophins, oestradiol, testosterone and insulin pulse patterns were examined at 15-min intervals for 6 h in 40 women with a previous diagnosis of polycystic ovarian disease (PCO) based on clinical, endocrinological and ultrasound data.
 Age, duration of symptoms, body mass index (BMI) and ovarian volume showed no correlation with the 6-h mean value of any hormone and testosterone blood levels did not correlate with those of insulin.
 Some patients had high and others low LH pulse pattern components, and few had an inverted LH:FSH ratio.
 Morphological polycystic ovarian changes may be a reflection of various rather than a single pattern of gonadotrophin secretion.
