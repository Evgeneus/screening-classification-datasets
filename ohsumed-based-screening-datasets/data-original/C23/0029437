Definitive diagnosis of breast implant rupture by ultrasonography.
 Silicone breast implantation is entering its fourth decade.
 Our ability to monitor the integrity of "old" prostheses is questioned.
 Clinical and mammographic examinations are reliable indicators of implant rupture only if there has been gel migration away from the implant pocket.
 Ultrasonography is presented as a reliable, sensitive method of evaluation of implant integrity.
 It should be considered the definitive study of prosthesis integrity.
 When sonography is added to mammographic and clinical examination, the preoperative evaluation of symptomatic augmented breasts is complete.
 Ultrasonography may be considered with mammography in the routine breast examination of all previously augmented patients.
