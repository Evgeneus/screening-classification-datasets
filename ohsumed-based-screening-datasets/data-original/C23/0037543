Analyses of 200 lymphadenectomies in patients with penile carcinoma.
 From 1972 to 1987, 200 consecutive lymphadenectomies were performed in 112 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the penis.
 A Gibson incision provided exposure of the iliac and inguinal lymph nodes with a low morbidity rate (5% flap necrosis, 15% wound infection, 16% lymphedema and 9% lymphocele).
 The controversy surrounding the necessity of iliac lymphadenectomy is discussed, since 305 iliac lymph nodes examined did not have metastatic invasion.
