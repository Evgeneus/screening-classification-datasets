The persistence of symptoms in patients with globus pharyngis.
 A follow-up study of 104 patients with globus sensation was performed by postal questionnaire.
 All were asked to complete the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ) and a 12-item Throat Symptom Questionnaire.
 Seventy-two of these patients were sent a follow-up General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).
 Replies were received from 89 patients (86%), 68 females and 21 males, a mean of 31 months after initial presentation.
 The feeling of something stuck in the throat had disappeared completely in 27% of patients, but only 4% were never aware of the throat.
 Throat symptoms showed a reduction with increasing age, but not with increasing interval since presentation.
 The 15 patients initially treated with antacid therapy had significantly greater dyspepsia scores at review than untreated patients, but no other difference was found between the two groups.
 GHQ scores showed a small but significant reduction over time.
 Of EPQ parameters, only the lower lie score in female patients showed any significant difference on repeat testing.
 Those with persistently high throat scores had significantly lower EPQ lie scores and a trend towards higher GHQ scores at follow-up.
 None of the psychological parameters measured at the first interview was found to be of prognostic significance.
 We conclude that, although there is a reduction in occult psychiatric morbidity in patients with the globus sensation over time, underlying personality traits remain stable and that there is a remarkable persistence of pharyngeal symptoms.
