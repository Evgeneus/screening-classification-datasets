Postoperative pulmonary edema in young, athletic adults.
 Pulmonary edema secondary to postextubation laryngospasm is a potentially life-threatening problem, demanding early diagnosis and prompt treatment.
 We believe that this problem has been grossly underestimated in its incidence, as only seven adults have been reported in the English literature, whereas seven adults have been observed at our institution in only a 24 month period.
 All were young, healthy, athletic adult males (average weight, 218 pounds) who underwent relatively minor, uncomplicated surgical procedures under general anesthesia.
 Five of these patients were collegiate and/or professional athletes and had meticulous medical records detailing their clinical course.
 Clinical laryngospasm was noted immediately following extubation and anesthesia by mask with subsequent pulmonary edema.
 The diagnoses were confirmed by clinical examination, arterial blood gas determinations or pulse oximetry, and chest roentgenogram.
 Four adults required reintubation.
 Six of the seven adults demonstrated very rapid resolution of the pulmonary edema with prompt diagnosis and institution of a therapeutic regimen including oxygen, diuretics, reintubation, and/or positive pressure ventilation.
 In one patient, the problem was not immediately recognized, and progressed to florid pulmonary edema requiring emergent intubation 14 hours later in the emergency room, and 3 days of mechanical ventilation.
 The etiology of pulmonary edema following upper airway obstruction represents an interplay between several factors: cardiogenic and neurogenic mechanisms, as well as hypoxia contribute.
 In this group, excessive negative intrathoracic pressure generated by forced inspiration against a closed glottis is the most likely, consistent, and logical explanation.
 This study suggests that young, healthy, athletic males may be at increased risk for this complication.
