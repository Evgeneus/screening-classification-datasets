Hypertrophic smooth muscle in the partially obstructed opossum esophagus. Excitability and electrophysiological properties.
 Partial obstruction of the opossum esophagus leads to thickening of the circular muscle, hypertrophy of smooth muscle cells, and diminution of the extracellular space.
 The pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of this hypertrophied muscle were studied.
 Carbachol produced phasic and tonic contractions of the circular muscle.
 The EC50 for tonic contractions was greater for hypertrophied than for normal muscle (21.1 +/- 3.9 mumol/L vs.
 4.8 +/- 2.2 mumol/L; P less than 0.05).
 The resting membrane potential difference of hypertrophied muscle (-50.8 +/- 0.2 mV) was similar to that of normal muscle (-50.0 +/- 0.2 mV).
 Electrical stimulation of intrinsic nerves in the normal muscle produced a hyperpolarization followed by a depolarization of smooth muscle membrane potential.
 Hypertrophied muscle responded either with an attenuated hyperpolarization or no hyperpolarization, both of which were followed by a depolarization.
 The space constant in the long axes of the hypertrophied circular muscle cells was greater than normal (4.4 +/- 0.2 mm vs.
 3.4 +/- 0.1 mm; P less than 0.001).
 The threshold potential for initiation of action potentials was more negative for hypertrophied (-43.2 +/- 0.4 mV) than for normal circular muscle (-41.6 +/- 0.2 mV; P less than 0.005).
 These data indicate that alterations in neuromuscular function accompany the hypertrophy of esophageal smooth muscle.
