Respiratory complications and hypoxic episodes during inhalation induction with isoflurane in children.
 We have studied the incidence of respiratory complications and hypoxic episodes during inhalation induction with isoflurane in 75 healthy unpremedicated children.
 Problems occurred less frequently when 4% isoflurane in oxygen was used from the outset than with traditional techniques using nitrous oxide and a gradually increasing inspired vapour concentration.
 The improved results observed with the former method may be secondary to more rapid uptake of vapour so that the second stage of anaesthesia characteristic of anaesthetic ethers is shortened considerably.
