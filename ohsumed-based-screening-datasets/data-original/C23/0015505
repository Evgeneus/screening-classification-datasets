Monocortical miniplate fixation of mandibular angle fractures.
 Noncompression monocortical miniplate fixation of mandibular fractures has become a reliable method of providing rigid fixation and eliminating the need for intermaxillary fixation.
 Recent studies, using a variety of internal fixation techniques, have described high complication rates at the mandibular angle.
 This article compares the use of one miniplate vs two miniplates in treatment of angle fractures.
 Since September 1985, 61 patients with 63 mandibular angle fractures have been treated with miniplates.
 Forty-four fractures were fixed with two miniplates.
 Six complications (3.1%) occurred, five of which were in the one-miniplate group.
 The complication rate in the double-miniplate group is the lowest reported of any plating technique.
 The use of two miniplates has proved to be an effective method of treating mandibular angle fractures.
