Hypertrophic spinal pachymeningitis: report of two cases and review of the literature.
 The cases of two patients with idiopathic pachymeningitis hypertrophica that caused progressive paraparesis are presented.
 Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was used to demonstrate this pathological entity in one patient, and myelography was used in the other.
 Decompressive surgery led to significant neurological improvement.
 The etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disease is discussed, and the literature is reviewed.
 To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe the features of this rare pathological entity on magnetic resonance imaging.
