Landau-Kleffner syndrome: a clinical and EEG study of five cases.
 In five children with normal initial psychomotor development, a Landau-Kleffner syndrome appeared at age 3-7 years.
 No neuroanatomic lesions were noted.
 Aphasia and hyperkinesia were isolated in three patients and associated with global regression of higher cortical functions in one patient.
 Massive intellectual deterioration and psychotic behavior were associated with transient aphasia in one patient.
 The epilepsy (focal motor and generalized tonic-clonic seizures, subclinical EEG focal seizures during sleep, and atypical absences) always regressed spontaneously or with antiepileptic drug (AED) treatment.
 The EEG in waking patients showed focal and generalized spike-wave discharges on a normal background rhythm.
 Discharge topography and pattern changed frequently.
 During sleep, discharges always increased.
 At some time during syndrome development, all patients had bilateral spike-waves for greater than 85% of the sleep period, while at other times the discharges were discontinuous or continuous but focal or unilaterally hemispheric.
 Discharge topography and abundance changed from night to night.
 The abnormal EEG and the impaired higher functions developed and regressed together, but not with strict temporal correlation.
 Our own experience suggests that the Landau-Kleffner syndrome and epilepsy with continuous spike-wave activity in slow-wave sleep cannot be clearly differentiated.
 They may be different points on the spectrum of a single syndrome.
