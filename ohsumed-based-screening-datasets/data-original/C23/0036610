Carinal resection for bronchogenic carcinoma.
 Techniques are available for carinal resection and reconstruction for bronchogenic carcinoma involving the carina.
 Successful outcome depends on careful patient selection, thorough preoperative evaluation, careful anesthetic management, strict attention to surgical technique, and compulsive postoperative care.
 Since 1973 we have performed 37 carinal resections for bronchogenic carcinoma: 21 right carinal pneumonectomies, 7 carinal resections, 7 carina plus lobe resections, and 2 carina plus pneumonectomy stump resections.
 Five patients had diseased N2 nodes and 13 patients had diseased N1 nodes.
 Complications included pulmonary (8), vocal cord paresis (3), atrial fibrillation (9), anastomotic stenosis (4), and anastomotic separation (3).
 There were 3 early postoperative deaths (8%).
 All were related to adult respiratory distress syndrome and were unresponsive to aggressive treatment.
 There were 4 late postoperative deaths between 2 and 4 months (10.9%).
 All late postoperative deaths were related to anastomotic complications (stenosis [1] and separation [3]).
 There are 5 absolute 5-year survivors and an actuarial 5-year survival rate of 19%.
