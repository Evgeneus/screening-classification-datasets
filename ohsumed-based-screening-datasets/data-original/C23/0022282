Sudden death caused by coronary artery aneurysms: a late complication of Kawasaki disease.
 The authors describe three cases (two blacks and one Latin American) of sudden death caused by late complications of Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome).
 At autopsy each heart contained multiple coronary artery aneurysms with luminal stenosis caused by intimal hyperplasia and thrombi.
 Although virtually all fatal cases of Kawasaki disease occur within six months of the onset of symptoms, there have been other reported deaths up to 14 years after the acute illness.
 The coronary artery aneurysms of Kawasaki disease may persist and cause death years after the acute illness.
