Mitral valve repair in the extensively calcified mitral valve annulus.
 Mitral valve replacement in patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus is associated with an increased risk of ventricular rupture.
 Until now techniques of mitral valve repair have not been applied to patients with a heavily calcified mitral valve annulus.
 We present 12 patients who underwent extensive decalcification of the annulus with subsequent mitral valve repair between 1987 and 1990.
 Ages ranged from 11 to 78 years; 6 patients were in New York Heart Association functional class II, 4 were in class III, and 2 were in class IV.
 All patients had varying degrees of mitral insufficiency.
 There were no deaths, reoperations, or thromboembolic events.
 Postoperative echocardiography revealed minimal residual mitral insufficiency in only 2 of 12 patients.
 All patients are currently in New York Heart Association class I or II.
 We believe mitral valve repair can be done safely on patients with an extensively calcified mitral annulus, thus avoiding the risks of left ventricular rupture, thromboembolic events, and hemorrhagic complications associated with mitral valve replacement.
