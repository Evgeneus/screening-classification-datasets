Emergency esophagogastrectomy for treatment of hydrochloric acid injury.
 Eight patients with severe hydrochloric acid injury of the esophagus and stomach had early esophagogastrectomy.
 Four patients survived and 6 to 8 weeks later underwent successful substernal colon replacement.
 The value of early diagnosis and subsequent aggressive surgical management of patients who have ingested hydrochloric acid is stressed.
