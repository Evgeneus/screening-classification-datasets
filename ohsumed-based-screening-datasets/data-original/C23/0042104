Kikuchi-Fujimoto syndrome during pregnancy.
 Necrotizing lymphadenitis of the Kikuchi-Fujimoto type developed in our patient during her first trimester of pregnancy, but she carried the infant to full term with no apparent adverse effect.
 Two subsequent pregnancies were not associated with reactivation of the disorder, nor with any recognizable adverse effect on the fetuses.
 A pregnancy should not be terminated because of Kikuchi-Fujimoto necrotizing lymphadenitis when it develops during the first trimester of pregnancy.
