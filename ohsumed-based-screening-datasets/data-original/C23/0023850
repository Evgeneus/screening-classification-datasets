Bilateral Norrie's disease in identical twins.
 A case of Norrie's disease in an identical twins is reported.
 No positive family history was obtained.
 The couple had no other children.
 The older of the twins died at the age of 9 months of uncertain cause.
 To the best of my knowledge this is the first case of Norrie's disease reported in Malaysia.
 And its occurrence in an identical twins is very rare.
