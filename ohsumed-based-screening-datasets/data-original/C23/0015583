T-cell translocation gene 1 (Ttg-1) encodes a nuclear protein normally expressed in neural lineage cells.
 We previously identified and cloned T-cell translocation gene 1 (Ttg-1), a putative zinc finger protein, as a result of its deregulated expression in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line (RPMI 8402) with a t(11;14)(p15;q11).
 We have now characterized its genomic organization and identified the major transcriptional start site to lie within an initiator-like motif.
 Ttg-1 is normally expressed in mouse brain and not in thymus.
 The mouse neuroblastoma cell line, N2a, also expresses Ttg-1.
 Antibodies raised against a TrpE-Ttg-1 fusion protein precipitate an 18-Kd nuclear protein from metabolically labeled 8402 cells.
 Immunofluorescence of N2a cells shows a nuclear pattern.
 The two potential zinc finger domains in Ttg-1 are highly homologous to similar regions in lin-11, mec-3, and lsl-1.
 This data suggests that Ttg-1 may be involved in gene regulation.
