Ovulation induction by step-down administration of purified urinary follicle-stimulating hormone in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome.
 The step-down method can be an alternative method of ovulation induction in women with PCOS.
 This protocol can induce ovulation with a smaller dose of FSH and with lower incidence of excessive ovarian enlargement in comparison with the traditional fixed-dose administration method.
