Behavioral arousal in newborn infants and its association with termination of apnea.
 Arousal is an important protective mechanism that aids in the resolution of obstructive sleep apnea in adults and children, but its role in neonatal apnea has not been investigated.
 The primary aim of the present study was to determine the role of arousal in the termination of apnea in preterm infants.
 Videorecording was used to identify spontaneous behavioral arousal in a group of healthy full-term (n = 7) and preterm (n = 10) infants before and during polygraphic monitoring of cardiorespiratory variables and in a group of preterm infants with apnea (n = 10) during similar polygraphic monitoring.
 Spontaneous arousal rates (mean +/- SE) in full-term infants before and during polygraphic monitoring were 0.18 +/- 0.03 and 0.23 +/- 0.07 episodes/min, respectively.
 Corresponding values in nonapneic preterm infants were 0.24 +/- 0.03 and 0.24 +/- 0.02 episodes/min.
 In apneic preterm infants, mean spontaneous arousal rate during polygraphic recording was 0.26 +/- 0.02, but it was considerably higher during apneic sleep periods (0.59 +/- 0.17) than during nonapneic sleep periods (0.25 +/- 0.01).
 The frequency of occurrence of arousal was significantly higher (P less than 0.005) in long vs.
 short apnea, mixed vs.
 central apnea, and severe vs.
 mild apnea.
 Although a clear association between arousal and apneic resolution was observed in preterm infants, lack of arousal responses in a large number of apneic episodes suggests that behavioral arousal is not essential for the termination of apnea in these infants.
