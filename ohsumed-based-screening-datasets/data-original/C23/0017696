Oral labetalol in hypertensive urgencies.
 The response to incremental doses of oral labetalol in 16 patients with hypertensive urgencies is presented.
 After inadequate blood pressure control with 20 mg of intravenous furosemide, each patient received a 300 mg oral dose of labetalol.
 Subsequent oral doses of labetalol, 100 mg, were administered at 2-hour intervals, if the diastolic blood pressure remained greater than 100 mm Hg.
 The maximum dose of labetalol per patient was 500 mg.
 Five patients required only the initial 300 mg dose of labetalol.
 Two patients required further therapy for satisfactory blood pressure control.
 Mean arterial pressure fell from 156 +/- 12 mm Hg to 123 +/- 14 mm Hg.
