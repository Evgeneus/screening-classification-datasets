An overview of ankle arthrodesis.
 Arthrodesis of the ankle can result in a painless, normal walking gait.
 However, complications in ankle arthrodesis can be major, and can occur when anatomy, deformity, or bony deficiency is not properly addressed.
 Nonoperative treatment should always be considered first, and, if possible, an open or arthroscopic ankle debridement can provide significant pain relief.
 Arthrodesis should be considered after conservative treatment fails.
 Infections, deformity, sensory deficiencies, and bony defects require special consideration.
 The use of bone graft and internal or external compression will enhance the likelihood of a successful arthrodesis.
