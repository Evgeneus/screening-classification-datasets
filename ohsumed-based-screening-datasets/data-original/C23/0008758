Dilatation in the duplex kidney: 3 unusual cases.
 Dilatation in the upper limb of a duplex ureter is usually secondary to obstruction and may be associated with a ureterocele.
 By contrast, vesicoureteric reflux is the usual cause of a dilated lower moiety ureter.
 We report 3 cases in which unusual or complex causes of dilatation of 1 limb of a duplex ureter were demonstrated.
