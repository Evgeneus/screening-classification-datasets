Successful CPR in a severely hypothermic patient using continuous thoracostomy lavage.
 Severe hypothermia with cardiopulmonary arrest often requires prolonged resuscitation while rewarming procedures are implemented.
 A 63-year-old male in cardiopulmonary arrest with a core body temperature of 23.7 C was resuscitated successfully after core rewarming by means of a two-chest-tube continuous thoracostomy lavage procedure.
 This lavage procedure resulted in effective and rapid rewarming after other conventional rewarming methods had failed.
