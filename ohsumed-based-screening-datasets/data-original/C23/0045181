 Persistent ovarian cysts are considered to be the most troublesome complication of ovarian transposition.
 Transabdominal drainage or surgical removal is often required.
 This paper reports the successful use of leuprolide acetate, a GnRH agonist, in the treatment of a symptomatic and persistent ovarian cyst which developed after ovarian transposition.
 The benefits of this therapy over others are discussed.
