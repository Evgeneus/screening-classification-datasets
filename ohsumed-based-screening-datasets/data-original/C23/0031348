Peroneal nerve repair. Surgical results.
 Eleven patients had either repair (two) or nerve graft reconstruction (nine) of the common peroneal nerve or its superficial or deep divisions about the knee.
 The average follow-up period was 29.1 months.
 A good or excellent result was achieved in six (54.5%) patients.
 The results appeared best when direct nerve repair was possible or when a defect of 6 cm or less required grafting.
 Peroneal nerve exploration and repair or reconstruction as required seem indicated for known nerve disruption or unknown nerve continuity if there is no suggestion of continuing recovery by three to six months after the injury.
