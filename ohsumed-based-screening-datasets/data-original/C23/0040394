Biomagnetic localization of ventricular arrhythmias.
 The magnetic fields caused by electrical activity of the human heart can be coherently measured with a highly sensitive, multichannel, superconducting quantum interference-device system and can enable noninvasive localization of the underlying electrical activity.
 The magnetocardiograms (MCGs) of 10 patients with spontaneous premature ventricular complexes (PVCs), three patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT), and four healthy subjects with induced paced beats were recorded for 2-15 minutes.
 After correction for superimposed repolarization activity, the site of origin of the arrhythmias was localized from the magnetic field distribution at the onset of the ectopic beats.
 The localization results of paced beats showed an error of a few millimeters in relation to the position of the catheter tip.
 The results of spontaneous PVC and VT were confirmed with endocardial mapping or associated with ischemic lesions.
 The authors conclude that multichannel magnetocardiographic studies enable the completely noninvasive localization of ventricular arrhythmias.
