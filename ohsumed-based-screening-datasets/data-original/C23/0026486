Functional and urodynamic characteristics of bladder substitution with detubularised right colonic segment.
 A total of 19 patients underwent bladder replacement with a detubularised right colonic segment; 14 males underwent complete substitution after cystoprostatectomy and 5 females had augmentation after subtotal cystectomy.
 The mean follow-up time was 20 months.
 Urodynamic evaluation showed a low pressure reservoir with a mean capacity of 580 ml and normal closure pressure.
 Sensitivity of the bladder to cold was normal in the augmentation group but was lacking in all patients in the total substitution group.
 In all except 1 patient the neobladder emptied effectively upon straining without significant residual urine.
 Seventeen patients were completely continent by day and 10 by night; 1 patient developed hyperchloraemic acidosis requiring treatment.
 Bladder substitution is superior to the standard ileal or colonic conduits with regard to quality of life, and the use of a right colonic segment is functionally comparable with neobladders composed of the ileum or a combination of the right colon and ileum.
 The latter are more difficult to fabricate and so may have more complications.
