Emergency department presentation of renal dialysis patients: indications for EMS transport directly to dialysis centers.
 To determine the pattern of emergency department (ED) utilization by renal dialysis (RD) patients, a prospective study was conducted of dialysis patients presenting to the ED of a regional dialysis center.
 The most common presenting complaints were shortness of breath (SOB), chest pain, abdominal pain, and vomiting; the most common diagnoses were congestive heart failure, chest wall pain, and electrolyte abnormalities.
 Interventional dialysis (ID), defined as emergent dialysis required to treat the patient's presenting complaint, was required for 30 patients, with the most common presenting complaints of these patients being shortness of breath, weakness, and chest pain.
 Only SOB was statistically significant in predicting the need for ID (P less than 0.001), with a positive predictive value of 0.63 and a negative predictive value of 0.85.
 Prehospital implications of these data suggest that RD patients with a chief complaint of SOB should be transported directly to a facility capable of dialysis on an emergent basis.
