Rupture of a benign mediastinal teratoma into the right pleural cavity.
 A 27-year-old woman with a ruptured mediastinal cystic teratoma had high levels of amylase and carcinoembryonic antigen in cystic fluid.
 The activity of the amylase is thought to be the most likely cause of the rupture.
 High levels of carcinoembryonic antigen in pleural fluid are not necessarily indicative of a malignant lesion but may suggest the presence of a ruptured teratoma in patients with mediastinal tumors.
