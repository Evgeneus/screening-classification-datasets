Angelchik prosthesis complicates treatment of adenocarcinoma in Barrett's esophagus.
 Indications for use of the Angelchik prosthesis remain controversial, and many surgeons actively involved in the treatment of reflux disease have not used the device.
 We describe a case that illustrates difficulties associated with resection of a tumor in the presence of this prothesis.
 Such experience suggests that patients known to have Barrett's esophagus might be better treated with standard antireflux procedures.
