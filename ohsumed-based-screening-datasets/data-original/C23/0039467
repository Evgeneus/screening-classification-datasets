Splenic abscesses due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in patients with AIDS.
 Among 60 patients with AIDS seen at our institution, two had splenic abscesses due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis without pulmonary tuberculosis.
 In both cases splenic abscess was the first manifestation of AIDS; the patients had prolonged fever and had lost weight and experienced malaise; slight hepatomegaly was noted in both instances and peripheral lymphadenopathy in one.
 Chest radiography gave normal results in one case and showed hilar lymphadenopathy in the other.
 Ultrasonographic findings were characteristic: homogeneous hepatomegaly and splenomegaly, with multiple filling defects of variable size.
 Diagnosis required splenectomy in one case and biopsy of cervical lymph nodes in the other.
 In both cases Ziehl-Neelsen staining gave positive results; M.
 tuberculosis grew from a culture of splenic tissue of one patient and from a culture of lymph nodal tissue of the other.
 There was a rapid response to antituberculous therapy.
 Splenic tuberculosis seems to be a distinct extrapulmonary entity in patients with AIDS.
 Ultrasonographic images are useful for diagnosis and follow-up.
