Effects of long-term amiodarone therapy on the defibrillation threshold and the rate of shocks of the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.
 The effects of long-term amiodarone therapy on the defibrillation thresholds and the rate of shocks were evaluated in 62 patients who had implantation of an automatic cardioverter-defibrillator (n = 53) or prophylactic implantation of patch electrodes (n = 9) who were survivors of sudden cardiac death (n = 34) or had refractory rapid ventricular tachycardia (n = 28).
 There were 53 men and 9 women, with ages ranging from 18 to 76 years (mean +/- SD, 60 +/- 12).
 Coronary artery disease occurred in 50 patients (80.6%), cardiomyopathy occurred in six (9.7%), valvular heart disease developed in two (3.2%), primary electrical disease developed in two (3.2%), hypertensive heart disease materialized in one (1.6%), and Ebstein's anomaly occurred in one (1.6%).
 The left ventricular ejection fraction varied from 10% to 75% (mean, 37 +/- 17%).
 All patients had failed a mean of 3.9 +/- 1.6 antiarrhythmic drugs prior to implantation of the device.
 Twenty-eight patients (45%) were taking amiodarone up to the time of surgery, with a mean daily dose of 406 +/- 147 mg (range 200 to 800) and for a mean duration of 6.0 +/- 6.7 months (range 1 to 36 months).
 The mean defibrillation threshold (DFT) was 12.0 +/- 4.4 joules (range 5 to 20) in the group taking amiodarone and was not significantly different from that of the group not taking amiodarone (n = 32) (mean DFT 12.3 +/- 5.5 joules, range 5 to 30; p = 0.77).
