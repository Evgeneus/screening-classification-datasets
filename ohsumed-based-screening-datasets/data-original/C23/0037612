The abdomen, thigh, and arm as sites for subcutaneous sodium heparin injections.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate three subcutaneous injection sites for low-dose heparin therapy (5,000 units).
 One hundred and one subjects were randomly placed in one of three groups.
 Group A received injections in the abdomen, Group B, in the thigh, and Group C in the arm.
 Each subject received three injections at the one site.
 Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was measured prior to initiation of heparin and again four hours after the first injection.
 Bruising was measured at 48, 60, and 72 hours postinjection.
 There were no statistically significant differences among groups for either changes in APTT or bruising at 60 and 72 hours postinjection.
 Thus the clinical practice of utilizing the abdomen as the only or preferred site for subcutaneous heparin injections was not supported.
