Methods to diminish intraoperative blood loss.
 With the subcutaneous injection of a saline-vasopressor solution under donor sites and debrided areas, a significant reduction in intraoperative blood transfusions was accomplished.
 No problems in healing of donor sites or skin grafts were encountered.
 Vasodilating anesthetics and ketamine can overcome the local vasopressor action.
 Discontinuing or reducing the concentration of these agents results in less bleeding from the wound.
