Problems encountered in leg shortening.
 We reviewed 46 leg-shortening operations (37 femoral and nine tibial), performed by different methods, to assess the incidence of complications and permanent disability.
 Shortening of as much as 7.5 cm in the femur and 5 cm in the tibia was achieved in men of normal height without any loss of function.
 Complications were seen with all surgical techniques despite the use of modern implants.
 Most problems arose from inadequate stabilisation of the osteotomy.
 The most reliable method of femoral shortening was open subtrochanteric osteotomy with preservation of the isthmus, and fixation with an intramedullary nail locked at its proximal end.
 In tibial shortening, bone excision should be at the level of the flare in the lower diaphysis in order to achieve reliable bone healing.
 Simple intramedullary nail fixation should be supplemented with a long-leg cast for six weeks or the nail should be locked at both ends to prevent postoperative distraction or rotation.
