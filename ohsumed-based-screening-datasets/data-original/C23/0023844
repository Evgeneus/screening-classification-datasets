Eleven years' experience with retinopathy of prematurity: visual results and contribution of cryoablation.
 We report our 11 years' experience of cryotherapy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).
 Charts of 624 infants weighing under 1250 g who were admitted to our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during 1977-87 were reviewed.
 Three hundred and eighty nine babies survived, and the total ROP prevalence was 57.5%.
 Cryotherapy was applied to 35%.
 Only one case (0.25%) of blindness was detected, and four babies (1%) had a final visual acuity of less than 20/200 in one eye.
 The complication rate following cryoablation was very low.
