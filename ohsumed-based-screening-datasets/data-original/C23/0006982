Management of perineal wounds following abdominoperineal resection with inferior gluteal flaps.
 Our experience treating perineal wounds secondary to abdominoperineal resection, either for inflammatory bowel disease or cancer, is presented.
 A total of 16 patients were treated either on a delayed basis or at the same time as the abdominoperineal resection.
 All wounds were closed using the inferior gluteal myocutaneous flap.
 Fifteen of 16 patients have achieved healing, eight of whom had no complications.
 Only minor revisions or local wound care were required in the remaining patients, with only one patient failing to heal.
 Our results compare favorably with previous reports of treatment of this difficult problem.
