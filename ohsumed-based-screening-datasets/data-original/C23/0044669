A cluster of related zinc finger protein genes is deleted in the mouse embryonic lethal mutation tw18.
 We report that a number of related zinc finger protein genes are closely linked on mouse chromosome 17.
 At least four of these genes are transcribed in the 8.5-day postcoitum embryo and are deleted in the t complex early acting embryonic lethal mutation tw18.
 We have evidence that additional finger protein genes are located in this region.
 These findings demonstrate that related finger protein genes can be clustered in the murine genome and identify genes that may be considered as candidates for the tw18 mutation.
