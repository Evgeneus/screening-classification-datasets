Endoscopic sinus surgery: outcome in 155 cases.
 For this retrospective study of endoscopic sinus surgery, charts of 22 patients from a medical center and 133 patients from a private practice (N = 155) were reviewed.
 Preoperative complaints, clinical findings, computed tomographic evidence of extent of sinus disease, surgical outcome, possible predictors of success, and complications were considered.
 Indications for endoscopic surgery were persistence of symptoms despite aggressive medical therapy and radiologic evidence of a significant sinus abnormality.
 Median followup was 12 months.
 Hemorrhage occurred postoperatively in two patients (1.5%); 17 patients required additional endoscopic surgery.
 Overall, 140 (91%) patients believed that the surgery was beneficial.
 Patients with facial pain preoperatively showed the greatest improvement.
 All patients having simultaneous septoplasty (N = 64) had successful outcome.
 The total number of opacified sinuses was not a predictor of outcome, but opacificaiton of the sphenoid sinus correlated with a poorer outcome.
 The patients seen at the medical center had poorer results, but had a larger number of opacified sinuses, were more likely to have had previous sinus surgery, and were more likely to have underlying medical conditions contributing to their sinus disease.
