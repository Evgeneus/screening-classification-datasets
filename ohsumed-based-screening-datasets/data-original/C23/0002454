Geriatric diabetic nephropathy: an analysis of renal referral in patients age 60 or older.
 We report a series of 33 consecutive hospitalized geriatric diabetic patients who were referred for evaluation of diabetic nephropathy, defined as proteinuria greater than or equal to 1 g/d (1,000 mg/24 h) or a serum creatinine concentration greater than or equal to 177 mumol/d (greater than or equal to 2 mg/dL).
 The study population was 60 years old or older (mean age, 68 +/- 6 years), was comprised mainly of women (24 of 33, 72.7%), and was predominantly black (25 of 33, 75.8%).
 All patients had type II diabetes.
 A family history of diabetes in parent or sibling was elicited in 24 (72.7%) patients.
 There were eight patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis and 25 with less severe nephropathy (mean proteinuria, 2.7 g/d [2,700 mg/24 h]; mean creatinine clearance, 0.57 mL-s [34 mL/min]).
 Cardiac disorders were noted in the majority of patients: congestive failure in 20 (60.6%), myocardial infarction in eight (24.2%), and active angina in five (15.2%).
 Other comorbid diseases were present in both hemodialysis patients and the subset of nondialyzed azotemic-proteinuric patients, and consisted of peripheral neuropathy in 31 (93.9%), gastroparesis in 16 (48.5%), retinopathy in 28 (84.8%), and legal blindness in 11 (33%).
 We conclude that geriatric diabetic nephropathy in type II diabetes is similar in presentation and severity of comorbid extrarenal complications to the syndrome described in younger adults.
 This inference must be tempered by both the small size and the limitation imposed by the demographics of the study population, which is predominantly composed of black patients receiving treatment at inner city hospitals.
