Complications of infection and immunologic status after surgery for patients with esophageal cancer.
 Correlations between defective cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and infections following surgery for esophageal cancer were evaluated.
 Peripheral lymphocytes, T cells, B cells, PHA transformation, and PPD skin test were measured in 81 patients with esophageal cancer, 58 with gastric cancer, and 50 healthy controls.
 The depression of CMI was predominant to a similar extent in patients with esophageal cancer and in those with gastric cancer.
 The average level of PHA transformation immediately before surgery was significantly lower in the esophageal cancer patients with fatal septic complications than in those without such problems.
 Although preoperative radiation therapy markedly depressed the levels of the four parameters, this association was also noted in 28 patients not given radiation.
 It thus appears that PHA transformation may be valuable in the prediction of fatal septic complications after major surgery in patients with esophageal cancer.
