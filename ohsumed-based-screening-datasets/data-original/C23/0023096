Truncal vagotomy and pyloroplasty combined with valvular replacement in patients with ulcer disease.
 In 1988, 5 patients (3 men and 2 women) with ulcer disease (mean age 56 +/- 8 years) underwent valvular replacement for aortic (No.
 = 4) or mitral disease (No.
 = 1).
 All patients had had gastroduodenal ulcers.
 Preoperative gastroscopy demonstrated active ulcers (No.
 = 4) and a healed pyloric ulcer with pyloric stenosis (No.
 = 1).
 Despite the presence of ulcers, a non-biologic prosthesis was preferred in each patient because of their young age (No.
 = 3), chronic atrial fibrillation requiring anticoagulant therapy (No.
 = 1), and refusal of the eventuality of subsequent reoperation (No.
 = 1).
 In each patient, a truncal vagotomy with pyloroplasty was performed simultaneously with the valvular procedures by the same incision.
 The postoperative courses were uneventful.
 With a mean follow-up of 15 +/- 3 months, no gastrointestinal bleeding was observed during anticoagulant therapy.
 With anticoagulant drugs, bleeding may occur with a frequency of 4% per patient treatment-year, half of which are gastrointestinal in origin.
 Nevertheless, in selected patients with gastroduodenal ulcers, performing a vagotomy-pyloroplasty simultaneously with valvular replacement allows implantation of a non-biologic prosthesis, with greater durability than bioprosthesis.
