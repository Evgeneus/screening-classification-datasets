Invasive treatment of pancreatic fluid collections with surgical and nonsurgical methods.
 Pancreatic fluid collections (PFC) can be drained surgically or nonsurgically with endoscopic or radiologic techniques.
 To define subgroups of patients with PFC who would benefit from the new modalities, we reviewed a period (1977 to 1990) during which both surgical and nonsurgical invasive techniques were available.
 Patients with phlegmon or necrosis at initial diagnosis were excluded.
 Sixty-five patients (35 male, 30 female) underwent 1 or more drainage procedures.
 A mean postprocedure follow-up of 10.2 months was available for 59 patients.
 Initial management was nonsurgical in 80% of patients.
 Procedures in patients with follow-up comprised invasive nonsurgical drainage (n = 25), invasive nonsurgical drainage plus surgery (n = 22), and surgery only (n = 12).
 Results for each group, respectively, were: morbidity, 20%, 20%, and 24%; mortality, 8%, 5%, and 0%; and successful drainage, 92%, 82%, and 83%.
 The choice of management appeared to be based on etiology and radiologic characteristics.
 Patients with nonalcohol- and nonbiliary-associated pancreatitis without a radiographically defined wall were more common in the invasive nonsurgical group and were successfully treated without surgery.
 Nonsurgical invasive techniques are efficacious in the treatment of PFC in this subgroup of patients.
