Diffuse mesangial sclerosis in a fetus.
 An 18-week fetus was born following termination of pregnancy by prostaglandin induction.
 Pregnancy was terminated because of elevated maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein and ultrasonographic evidence of severe oligohydramnios, intrauterine growth retardation, non-visualization of the bladder, dolichocephaly and possible mild hydrocephalus.
 Pathologic examination disclosed diffuse mesangial sclerosis and histologic evidence of the nephrotic syndrome.
 To our knowledge this is the first reported example of ante-natal diffuse mesangial sclerosis; of fetal congenital nephrosis other than Finnish type; and of fetal congenital nephrosis with prominent glomerular lesions.
