Clinical features of Behcet's disease. Report of four cases.
 Behcet's disease is a multisystem inflammatory disorder of unknown etiology.
 The unifying histologic reaction pattern is a leukocytoclastic vasculitis that affects predominantly the skin, oral mucosa, and eyes.
 Many other sites of involvement have been reported but are inconsistently found in individual patients.
 Early recognition and treatment of Behcet's disease may help prevent devastating permanent sequelae such as blindness.
 Because oral involvement is often the first manifestation of this disorder, dental practitioners are in a unique position to help these patients.
 We report four cases of Behcet's disease in North American patients.
 Diagnostic criteria and treatment options are reviewed.
