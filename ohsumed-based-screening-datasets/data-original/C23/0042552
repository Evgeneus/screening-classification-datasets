Limb-sparing surgery in skeletally immature patients with osteosarcoma. The use of an expandable prosthesis.
 Limb-sparing surgery has a definite role in the treatment of osteosarcoma in children.
 Increased survival, however, raises problems of limb-length discrepancy and prosthetic longevity.
 The concept of an expandable adjustable prosthesis addresses the problem of leg-length discrepancy.
 The problem of prosthesis longevity will require further long-term evaluation of current designs and methods of fixation, as well as the development of a permanent prosthesis or biologic replacement.
 At skeletal maturity, the expandable prosthesis may either be maintained or substituted with another implant or biological alternative if warranted by the clinical situation.
