Chiari pelvic osteotomy for osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia. Indications and long-term results.
 Of 142 Chiari pelvic osteotomies for osteoarthritis in dysplastic hips, most performed by Chiari himself, we were able to review 82 and obtain information about 18 by questionnaire.
 All patients were over 30 years of age at operation; follow-up averaged 15.5 years.
 Twenty hips had undergone secondary total hip replacement.
 The outcome was good in 75%, fair in 9% and poor in 16%.
 High osteotomies all gave good results, and the result also depended on adequate medialisation.
 Statistics were worse for patients over 44 years of age at the time of operation.
 For osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia, the Chiari pelvic osteotomy is an alternative procedure to early hip replacement.
 In contrast to intertrochanteric osteotomy, it has the advantage of facilitating the implantation of an acetabular prosthesis should arthroplasty become necessary at a later stage.
