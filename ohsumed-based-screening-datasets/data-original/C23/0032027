Retinal detachment adherent to posterior chamber IOL after Molteno implant surgery.
 A patient with refractory glaucoma 1 year after cataract extraction and trabeculectomy had Molteno implant surgery.
 Three days after surgery a kissing choroidal effusion and retinal detachment adherent to the posterior chamber IOL were detected.
 Repeated choroidal taps were unsuccessful.
 Removal of the Molteno implant, vitrectomy, and silicone oil injection were required to reattach the retina.
