Cutaneous silica granuloma. A rare entity or rarely diagnosed? Report of two cases with review of the literature.
 Cutaneous silica granuloma is a poorly understood, uncommon condition that may mimic cutaneous sarcoidosis.
 We describe two cases of this entity and their characteristic latency period (between the time of silica exposure to the time of clinical onset of granuloma).
 We also review the histologic and energy dispersive x-ray analysis data, which prove the diagnosis.
 This condition should be recognized as an occupational dermatosis as well as the result of past incidental cuts or abrasions, which result in the development of granulomas, many in old wound scars.
 Differentiation from cutaneous sarcoidosis is possible with polarized light microscopy and energy-dispersive x-ray analysis.
