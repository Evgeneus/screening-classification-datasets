Total cavopulmonary anastomosis versus conventional modified Fontan procedure.
 The total cavopulmonary anastomosis, lateral tunnel Fontan, has been advocated as a preferred method for Fontan type repair.
 From 1987 to July 1990, 39 patients underwent total cavopulmonary anastomoses (group 1) and 39 patients underwent modified Fontan procedures (group 2); patients receiving adjustable atrial septal defects were excluded.
 Diagnoses in group 1 included tricuspid atresia in 5 patients, single ventricle in 32, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 2.
 Diagnoses in group 2 included tricuspid atresia in 20, single ventricle in 17, hypoplastic left heart syndrome in 1, and pulmonary atresia and intact ventricular septum in 1.
 There were no significant differences in age, weight, cross-clamp time, duration of inotropic support, postoperative effusions, or hospital stay between the two groups.
 Early mortality in group 1 was 7.7% (3/39) and in group 2, 2.6% (1/39).
 There was no difference in the incidence of early dysrhythmias or early pacemaker placement.
 Late mortality was 2.8% in group 1 and 8% in group 2 with a mean follow-up of 18 and 25 months, respectively.
 Follow-up in group 1 revealed 33 patients in normal sinus rhythm and 1 patient with episodes of supraventricular tachycardia; no additional patients have required pacemakers.
 Follow-up in group 2 revealed 27 patients in normal sinus rhythm and supraventricular tachycardia in 4 patients; 5 additional patients have required pacemaker placement.
 There is no apparent difference in early outcome between the total cavopulmonary anastomosis and the conventional modified Fontan.
 However, there appears to be an increased incidence of late dysrhythmias and the need for pacemaker placement in the conventional modified Fontan group compared with the lateral tunnel group.
