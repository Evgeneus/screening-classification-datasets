The results of surgical repair of acute tears of the posterior cruciate ligament.
 In 20 patients, the torn posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) was repaired without reinforcement within two weeks after injury.
 Fourteen patients had a midsubstance tear, and in six the ligament was avulsed from the femur without bone.
 There were 11 isolated and nine combined injuries.
 The follow-up period ranged from two to 10.5 years.
 Postoperatively, all had posterior instability graded from 1+ to 2+.
 Nevertheless, the subjective results were good in 15 patients, fair in five, and poor in none.
 Posterior instability did not produce significant functional impairment of the knee for a considerable number of years.
 Suture alone cannot restore the PCL and is not strong enough to withstand the applied forces on the knee.
