Early diastolic clicks after the Fontan procedure for double inlet left ventricle: anatomical and physiological correlates.
 M mode echocardiograms and simultaneous phonocardiograms were recorded in four patients with early diastolic clicks on auscultation.
 All had double inlet left ventricle and had undergone the Fontan procedure with closure of the right atrioventricular valve orifice by an artificial patch.
 The phonocardiogram confirmed a high frequency sound occurring 60-90 ms after aortic valve closure and coinciding with the time of maximal excursion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass.
 One patient had coexisting congenital complete heart block.
 The M mode echocardiogram showed "reversed" motion of the patch towards the right atrium during atrial contraction.
 Doppler flow studies showed that coincident with this motion there was forward flow in the pulmonary artery with augmentation when atrial contraction coincided with ventricular systole.
 The early diastolic click in these patients was explained by abrupt cessation of the motion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass in early diastole.
 In one patient atrial contraction led to a reversal of this motion and was associated with forward flow in the pulmonary artery.
