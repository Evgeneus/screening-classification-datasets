Assessment of severity of coronary narrowings by quantitative exercise echocardiography and comparison with quantitative arteriography.
 To determine the correlation of quantitative assessment of coronary narrowings with left ventricular functional impairment induced by exercise, 57 patients with 1-vessel coronary artery disease and without evidence of collateral flow were studied.
 A significant relation was observed between minimal cross-sectional area, percent area stenosis, minimal lumen diameter, percent diameter stenosis and the percentage of segmental area change from rest to peak exercise in a vascular distribution territory (r = 0.76, p less than 0.001; r = -0.55, p less than 0.001; r = 0.56, p less than 0.001; r = -0.75, p less than 0.001, respectively).
 For minimal cross-sectional area, the best cut-off value to separate significantly patients who had a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who had a normal response was 2 mm2 (p less than 0.001); for percent cross-sectional area stenosis, it was 75% (p less than 0.001); for minimal lumen diameter, it was 0.7 mm (p less than 0.001); and, for percent diameter stenosis, it was 85% (p less than 0.001).
 High cut-off values for angiographic variables are necessary to separate significantly patients who have a decrease in contractility at peak exercise testing from those who have a normal response.
 Several patients with mild coronary stenoses may have either normal or abnormal wall motion during exercise.
 Thus, exercise echocardiography is a useful tool in detecting the presence of fairly severe anatomic narrowing, whereas it is of limited clinical use in the assessment of intermediate coronary atherosclerotic lesions.
