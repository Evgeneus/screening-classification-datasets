Aortoesophageal fistula: a comprehensive review of the literature.
 Aortoesophageal fistula (AEF) is a relatively rare but life-threatening cause of upper gastro-intestinal bleeding.
 The clinical characteristics of AEF are so unique that a presumptive bedside diagnosis can be made at the time of presentation.
 In the past decade, surgical management has improved to the point that cure is now possible.
 For these reasons, we have reviewed the literature.
 We summarize our findings with respect to the etiology and clinical characteristics of AEF.
 Further, we discuss the diagnostic modalities that may be used to confirm the diagnosis, and the therapeutic modalities available to slow the hemorrhage, so as to allow time to correct the anatomic defect.
