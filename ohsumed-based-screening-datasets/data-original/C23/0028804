Prevention of postoperative renal dysfunction in patients with obstructive jaundice: a multicentre study of bile salts and lactulose.
 The role of preoperative lactulose and bile salts in the prevention of postoperative renal failure in patients with obstructive jaundice has been evaluated in a prospective randomized trial.
 One hundred and two patients undergoing surgery for obstructive jaundice (bilirubin greater than 100 mumols/l) were randomized into three groups: those receiving preoperative oral lactulose (n = 35), those receiving oral sodium deoxycholate (n = 32) and a control group of patients receiving no specific treatment (n = 35).
 All patients received intravenous fluids commencing the night before surgery.
 One patient in the control group and none in the treatment groups developed postoperative renal failure.
 Postoperative deterioration of renal function in patients with normal preoperative function was significantly more common in the control group than in the treatment groups (chi 2 = 8.1, d.f.
 = 2, P less than 0.02).
 The incidence of renal failure and impairment was lower in this control group than that reported in previous studies.
 This may be due to the introduction of adequate preoperative hydration.
 Additional protection occurs by the preoperative administration of either lactulose or sodium deoxycholate.
