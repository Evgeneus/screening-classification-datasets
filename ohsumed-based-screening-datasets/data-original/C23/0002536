Spontaneous infarction of placental chorioangioma and associated regression of hydrops fetalis.
 We report a case of a large chorioangioma diagnosed prenatally with concomitant meconium peritonitis and hydrops fetalis in the second trimester.
 Spontaneous regression of the tumor occurred, associated with some resolution of the fetal hydrops and delivery near term with good neonatal outcome.
