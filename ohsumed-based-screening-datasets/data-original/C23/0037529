Evaluation and treatment of blunt renal trauma.
 We examined retrospectively the records of 126 patients with blunt renal trauma to determine the criteria for radiological investigations and the imaging study of choice.
 Of the 3,993 patients admitted to our regional trauma unit during the last 13 years 126 (3.1%) had blunt renal trauma.
 Mean patient age was 32 years (range 13 to 87 years) and the male-to-female ratio was 3:1.
 Mean followup was 7 months (median 4 months).
 Of the patients 72% had a minor renal injury, 17% had a moderate injury and 11% had a major renal injury.
 Treatment was conservative in 114 patients, while 9 underwent a genitourinary operation.
 Results were excellent in 87% of the patients and good in 8%, while 5% failed treatment.
 All patients who had microscopic hematuria without shock had minor injuries.
 Excretory urograms (IVPs) were normal in 74% and 39% of the patients when performed for minor and moderate renal injuries, respectively.
 Computerized tomography (CT) was abnormal in all cases when performed, and was more sensitive and specific than an IVP.
 Therefore, the majority of patients with blunt renal trauma can be treated conservatively with an excellent result.
 Furthermore, radiological investigations are not needed in those with microscopic hematuria and no shock.
 When radiological investigations are indicated a CT scan is the imaging study of choice.
