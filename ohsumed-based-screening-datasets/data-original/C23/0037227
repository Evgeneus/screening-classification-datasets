Use of the optical urethrotome knife in the treatment of a benign low rectal anastomotic stricture.
 Several methods of treatment for benign anastomotic strictures following anterior resection have been described.
 Surgical intervention in terms of re-exploration and excision of the stricture or the formation of a permanent colostomy will be accompanied by substantial morbidity.
 The dilatation of these strictures without direct vision may not be safe.
 We describe a simple method of treating benign rectal anastomotic stricture using an optical urethrotome knife under direct vision.
 This technique affords an accurate incision of the stricture to increase the size of the lumen, thereby relieving obstruction.
