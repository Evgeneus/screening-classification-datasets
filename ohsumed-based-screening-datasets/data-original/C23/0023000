Susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis: human leukocyte antigens DR4 and A1-B8-DR3 are independent risk factors.
 After nearly 18 years of research, the association between human leukocyte antigens A1-B8-DR3 and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis still provokes debate.
 The principal reasons for this are disease heterogeneity and racial variation in the distribution of human leukocyte antigens between populations.
 The aim of the present study was to reexamine the relationship between these antigens and autoimmune chronic active hepatitis in a well-characterized series of patients.
 Ninety-six outpatients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and an additional 14 referred for liver transplantation with end-stage autoimmune chronic active hepatitis were studied.
 Human leukocyte antigen frequencies were compared with those of 100 racially and geographically matched controls.
 The A1-B8-DR3 haplotype was present in 38% of patients compared with 11% of controls (chi 2 = 20.6, p less than 0.0005).
 When all the DR3-positive patients were eliminated, there was a striking secondary association with DR4; 35 (80%) of 44 remaining patients were DR4 positive compared with 31 (39%) of 79 DR3-negative controls (Fisher's exact probability test p = 0.000031, pc = 0.0013).
 In addition patients with A1-B8-DR3 are seen at a significantly younger age than those without (39.75 yr vs.
 48.21 yr, p less than 0.025), relapse more frequently (52% of patients with A1-B8-DR3 relapsed on one or more occasions compared with 34% of patients without this haplotype) and are more frequently referred for liver transplantation.
 These data indicate for the first time that two genes within the major histocompatibility complex closely linked to the DR3 and DR4 genes independently confer susceptibility to autoimmune chronic active hepatitis.
