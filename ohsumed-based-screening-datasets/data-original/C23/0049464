Fabry disease: detection of 13-bp deletion in alpha-galactosidase A gene and its application to gene diagnosis of heterozygotes.
 Polymerase chain reaction amplification of reverse-transcribed messenger RNA from a patient with Fabry disease revealed a 13-base pair deletion in the 5' region (exon 1) of alpha-galactosidase A complementary DNA.
 This gene rearrangement was not detected by Southern or Northern analysis.
 Short direct repeats were present around the breakpoints, and considered to be of pathogenetic significance.
 Gene diagnosis of the mother and a female cousin was successfully achieved by polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA; the former as a Fabry disease heterozygote and the latter as a normal homozygote.
