Macrophages stimulate bone resorption when they phagocytose particles.
 We investigated in vitro a mechanism by which particulate debris may induce bone resorption and cause implant loosening.
 We first studied two standard particles: latex, which is considered to be inert, and zymosan, which is inflammatory.
 Macrophages that phagocytosed either particle became activated, and stimulated 15 times as much bone resorption as did control macrophages.
 For activation to occur, 100 times more latex than zymosan had to be phagocytosed.
 We also found that bone cement and polyethylene particles activated macrophages in a similar manner, and that the necessary amounts of these were intermediate between those of latex and zymosan.
 None of the particles were toxic.
 It was concluded that implant loosening may result from bone resorption stimulated by mediators released by macrophages that have phagocytosed particles of bone cement or polyethylene.
