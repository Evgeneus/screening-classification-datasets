Diagnosis of segmental necrosis in a pancreas transplant by thallium-201 perfusion scintigraphy.
 Thallium-201 was used to image a patient with a pancreatic transplant.
 Incomplete visualization of the graft on the 201Tl scan, compared to CT, led to the diagnosis of segmental necrosis of the tail of the graft.
 Due to the low background and favorable target-to-non-target ratio, 201Tl pancreas scintigraphy may be useful in the follow-up of pancreatic transplants.
