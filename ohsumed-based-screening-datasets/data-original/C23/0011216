Magnetic resonance imaging--the evaluation of choice in residual shunt after congenital heart disease surgery?

 We describe a patient who, after atrial septal defect repair, developed dyspnea and central cyanosis despite normal pulmonary arterial pressures and right heart chamber size.
 A role for early MRI is suggested.
