Determination of ventricular fluid outflow resistance in patients with ventriculomegaly.
 Resorption of the ventricular fluid was studied by measuring ventricular fluid outflow resistance during steady state 1.5 and 5.0 ml/min infusions in 26 patients with substantial enlargement of the supratentorial ventricular system.
 This test may avoid unnecessary use of shunts, but a shunt could be introduced during the same procedure.
