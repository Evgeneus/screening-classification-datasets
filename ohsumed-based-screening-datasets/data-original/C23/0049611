Lack of predictive value of the APACHE II score in hypoalbuminemic patients.
 The APACHE II score predicts mortality in severely ill patients.
 This score does not account for the serum albumin level.
 Ninety-three patients (28 with serum albumin levels less than 2.5 g/dL [group I] and 65 with serum albumin levels greater than or equal to 2.5 [group II]) were retrospectively reviewed.
 Patients were comparable in age, APACHE II score, and compliance with required protein needs.
 Patients with severe hypoalbuminemia had nearly double the death rate of patients with mildly low or normal albumin concentrations (54% compared with 29%).
 The death rate in the severely hypoalbuminemic patients was 5.1-fold higher than would be predicted by their APACHE II score.
 The death rate in those patients with mildly low or normal albumin levels had only a 1.9-fold higher rate than would be predicted by their APACHE II score.
 It is concluded that severe hypoalbuminemia increases the risk of death significantly higher than would be predicted by the APACHE II score.
 APACHE II score is not as accurate in a severely hypoalbuminemic population.
