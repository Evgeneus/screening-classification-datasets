Variable histotoxicity of histoacryl when used in a subcutaneous site: an experimental study.
 Histoacryl (butyl-2-cyanoacrylate) is one of the least histotoxic cyanoacrylate derivatives and is used as a tissue adhesive.
 Clinical applications primarily include skin closure (blepharoplasty incisions, etc.).
 In a recent study, we demonstrated that Histoacryl elicits minimal histotoxicity when used to glue bone grafts to rabbit-ear cartilage.
 Acute inflammation was limited to areas where Histoacryl escaped from between the bone graft and ear cartilage to contact well-vascularized soft tissue.
 In this study, Histoacryl was applied between bone graft and cartilage in one rabbit ear and adjacent to well-vascularized soft tissue with no graft in the opposite ear.
 Histologic analysis revealed minimal if any inflammation when small amounts of glue was used in the nonvascular region between bone graft and cartilage.
 However, subcutaneous implantation contacting well-vascularized soft tissue resulted in increased acute inflammation and prolonged foreign-body giant-cell response.
 Further studies are required to rule out any long-term problems associated with subcutaneous implantation of Histoacryl.
