Eosinophil activation on biologic surfaces. Production of O2- in response to physiologic soluble stimuli is differentially modulated by extracellular matrix components and endothelial cells.
 Production of O2- in response to FMLP, TNF, IFN-gamma, platelet activating factor, LPS, substance P, and PMA by human eosinophils in suspension and in contact with polystyrene ELISA plastic (PL) or biologic surfaces was studied.
 Monolayers of human endothelial cells (HEC) or PL coated with FCS, fibronectin, laminin, collagen types I and IV, fibrinogen, or fibrin were used as biologic surfaces.
 Only PMA and FMLP stimulated O2- generation by eosinophils in suspension.
 Eosinophils residing on HEC monolayers, either untreated or treated with LPS, were unresponsive to all stimuli except PMA.
 PMA induced O2- generation by eosinophils on all surfaces; FMLP on all surfaces but HEC monolayers; TNF and platelet-activating factor only on PL, fibrinogen, and fibrin; LPS and substance P only on PL.
 PMA was equally effective on eosinophils on surfaces and in suspension, whereas the effect of FMLP was greater on eosinophils on surfaces than on eosinophils in suspension.
 IFN-gamma was ineffective on any of the surfaces tested.
 These results indicate that biologic surfaces may profoundly affect the ability of eosinophils to respond with a respiratory burst to physiologically relevant soluble stimuli, the effect varying according to the nature of both the stimulus and the surface.
 Since the respiratory burst generates products of oxygen reduction that are toxic to several tissue components, it follows that biologic surfaces may modulate eosinophil-induced tissue injury.
