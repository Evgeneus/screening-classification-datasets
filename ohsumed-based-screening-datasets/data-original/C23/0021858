Subtle cerebellar phenotype in mice homozygous for a targeted deletion of the En-2 homeobox.
 The two mouse genes, En-1 and En-2, that are homologs of the Drosophila segmentation gene engrailed, show overlapping spatially restricted patterns of expression in the neural tube during embryogenesis, suggestive of a role in regional specification.
 Mice homozygous for a targeted mutation that deletes the homeobox were viable and showed no obvious defects in embryonic development.
 This may be due to functional redundancy of En-2 and the related En-1 gene product during embryogenesis.
 Consistent with this hypothesis, the mutant mice showed abnormal foliation in the adult cerebellum, where En-2, and not En-1, is normally expressed.
