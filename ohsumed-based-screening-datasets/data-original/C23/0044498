Treatment of posterior urethral strictures with a titanium urethral stent.
 A total of 5 patients with recurrent posterior urethral strictures underwent endoscopic placement of an expandable endourethral stent made of titanium.
 Patient age ranged from 17 to 66 years (mean age 42.6 years).
 Followup ranged from 13 to 20 months (mean 14.1 months).
 Of the patients 4 presently have unobstructed voiding with no incontinence.
 To date no side effects have been directly related to the stents and no incrustations or calculi have formed.
 Our preliminary study supports the use of titanium urethral stents as an alternative form of treatment for selected urethral strictures.
