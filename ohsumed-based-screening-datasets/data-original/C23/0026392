Cerebral structure on magnetic resonance imaging in language- and learning-impaired children.
 Using magnetic resonance imaging 20 language- and learning-impaired children were compared with 12 normal control subjects.
 Gross brain structure was remarkably normal in the language- and learning-impaired group.
 Semiautomated morphometry was used to measure hemispheric volumes and cerebral asymmetries in six cerebral regions.
 The volume of the left posterior perisylvian region was significantly reduced in language- and learning-impaired children.
 Asymmetries in inferoanterior and superoposterior cerebral regions were also significantly different in this group.
 Results of descriptive group comparisons of estimated volumes of other cerebral gray-matter structures raise the possibility that some language- and learning-impaired children may have additional volume reductions in cortical and subcortical structures.
 The results suggest that hemispheric specialization of function may be anomalous in this population.
