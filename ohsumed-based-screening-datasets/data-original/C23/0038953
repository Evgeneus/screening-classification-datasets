Urinary fibrinopeptide A in evaluation of patients with suspected acute pulmonary embolism. A prospective pilot study.
 This pilot study assessed the urinary fibrinopeptide A (uFPA) levels and the combination of uFPA test plus ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan in the diagnostic evaluation of acute pulmonary embolism (PE).
 One hundred consecutive patients were studied prospectively.
 Twenty-nine patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria defined in this study (seven with and 22 without PE).
 The uFPA concentration was significantly higher in patients with than without PE (41.1 +/- 2.6 vs 4.8 +/- 2.5 ng/mg of creatinine, p less than 0.0001).
 In all patients with PE, the uFPA levels were higher than threshold value derived by adding 2 standard deviations to the mean uFPA concentration of patients without PE.
 In patients without PE, the V/Q scan was negative in 16, the uFPA test was negative in 18, and at least one of the tests was negative in 21.
 These preliminary data suggest that a negative uFPA test may be helpful in excluding PE and that uFPA in combination with V/Q lung scans may correctly exclude PE in more patients than either test alone.
 Further studies in a large unselected population are needed to confirm these results.
