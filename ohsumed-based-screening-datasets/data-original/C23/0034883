Optimum concentration of bupivacaine for combined caudal--general anesthesia in children.
 Caudal epidural anesthesia has become widely accepted as a means of providing postoperative pain relief and intraoperative supplementation to general anesthesia for children.
 To determine the best concentration of bupivacaine for combined general-caudal anesthesia in children, 122 children aged 1-8 yr scheduled for outpatient inguinal herniorrhaphy were randomized to receive, in a double-blind fashion, caudal anesthesia with bupivacaine in one of six concentrations (0.125, 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.225, or 0.25%).
 After incision, a programmed reduction in inspired halothane resulted, if tolerated by the subject, in an inspired halothane concentration of 0.5% 10 min after incision.
 End-tidal halothane concentration at hernia sac ligation for subjects receiving 0.175% bupivacaine (0.55 +/- 0.03%) was less than that for subjects receiving 0.15% bupivacaine (0.75 +/- 0.05%; P less than 0.05).
 Subjects receiving 0.175% bupivacaine also were discharged earlier from the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (27 +/- 1 min) than were subjects receiving 0.15% bupivacaine (38 +/- 5 min; P = 0.05).
 Children receiving greater than or equal to 0.2% bupivacaine tended to complain more of leg weakness after surgery; however, the difference did not reach statistical significance (39 of 67 vs.
 16 of 47; P = 0.057).
 The incidence of complaints of leg weakness and paresthesia was positively correlated with bupivacaine concentration (r = 0.706; P = 0.05).
 Subjects receiving 0.125% bupivacaine had higher pain scores on arrival to the PACU than did those receiving 0.2% bupivacaine (P = 0.05); there were no other differences in pain scores.
