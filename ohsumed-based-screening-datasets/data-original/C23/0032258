Visual evoked potentials and visual acuity after transurethral resection of the prostate.
 Changes in visual evoked potentials, visual acuity, blood ammonia levels and serum electrolytes (Na+ and K+) after transurethral resection of the prostate using glycine as an irrigating fluid performed under subarachnoid block were studied in 12 patients, in the pre-operative and immediate postoperative periods.
 Visual evoked potentials (p100 latency), recorded by shift of a checkerboard pattern, increased significantly from a pre-operative value of mean (SEM) 101.18 (1.63) msec in the right eye, and 102.5 (1.47) msec in the left eye to 108.91 (1.8) msec (p less than 0.01) and 108.08 (2.53) msec (p less than 0.01) respectively in the postoperative phase.
 There were no changes in visual acuity as assessed by a Snellen's chart, blood ammonia levels and serum electrolyte concentrations.
 The amount of glycine used intra-operatively for irrigation ranged from 3 to 31 litres.
