Severe lactic acidosis related to acute thiamine deficiency.
 The authors report a case of severe lactic acidosis in a 3-year-old boy, after 20 days of total parenteral nutrition without vitamin supplementation.
 This child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia underwent a period of severe refractory lactic acidosis (pH between 6.81 and 7.00 and a serum lactate level up to 38 mmol/liter) leading to cardiac arrest.
 After the initial resuscitation and the subsequent treatment of shock and vitamin K deficiency, acute peritoneal dialysis was instituted to correct the severe lactic acidosis.
 Initial low plasma thiamine levels confirmed the diagnosis of thiamine deficiency.
 An associated transient pancreatic dysfunction was also noted.
 The patient's overall course with thiamine replacement therapy led to a complete recovery within 5 days and no sequelae were noted after 12 months.
