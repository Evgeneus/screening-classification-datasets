123I-iodoamphetamine SPECT brain imaging in alternating hemiplegia.
 Alternating hemiplegia of childhood is an unusual disorder characterized by early onset (occurring before 18 months of age); repeated attacks of hemiplegia involving both sides of the body; other paroxysmal phenomena, such as tonic stiffening, dystonic posturing, choreoathetoid movements, ocular motor abnormalities, and autonomic disturbances, in association with bouts of hemiplegia or occurring independently; and evidence of mental or neurologic deficits.
 A girl was examined because of left hemiplegia at the age of 16 months.
 The patient had begun exhibiting episodes of alternating hemiplegia at approximately 4 months of age.
 They consisted of tonic stiffening and dystonia of the right or left extremities, lasting from 30 min to several hours and followed by residual hemiparesis.
 They were invariably accompanied by ocular motor abnormalities.
 Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and angiography all were normal.
 Single proton emission computed tomography brain images during an acute episode of right hemiplegia demonstrated hypoperfusion of the left cerebral hemisphere.
 Following improvement of the hemiplegia, the patient was re-evaluated.
 The uptake of the radiotracer in the left hemisphere was increased.
 The scan did not demonstrate significant asymmetry in cerebral perfusion.
