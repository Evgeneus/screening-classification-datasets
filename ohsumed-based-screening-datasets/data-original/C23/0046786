The dorsal rat flap: a discussion of the model and the salutary effect of cimetidine on flap survival.
 Failure of skin flaps remains a significant clinical problem.
 The dorsal rat flap, a reliable experimental model, was used to test the efficacy of cimetidine in treating a failing flap.
 Flaps were elevated in 45 rats divided into three equal groups.
 Group 1 was a saline control group, Group 2 received cimetidine 250 mg/kg three times a day for 7 days postoperatively, and Group 3 received cimetidine for 1 day before surgery, and then as in Group 2.
 Necrosis was assessed on the seventh postoperative day.
 Group 2 had 31.1 +/- 1.3 (mean % +/- SEM) necrosis, significantly better than saline control animals (p less than 0.01) and pretreated animals (p less than 0.05).
 These results suggest the usefulness of cimetidine in ischemic flap surgery.
