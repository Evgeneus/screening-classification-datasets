The sequential generation of neutrophil chemoattractant proteins in acute inflammation in the rabbit in vivo. Relationship between C5a and proteins with the characteristics of IL-8/neutrophil-activating protein 1.
 An in vivo experimental peritonitis model was investigated in the rabbit using zymosan as the inflammatory stimulus.
 After an i.p.
 injection of zymosan, exudate was removed at intervals and tested in the back skin of assay rabbits.
 Assay rabbits received i.v.
 injections of 125I-albumin and 111In-neutrophils, and the local accumulation of each label was measured in response to intradermal injections of exudate samples mixed with a potentiating dose of PGE2.
 When peritoneal exudate samples were tested in the presence of a specific anti-C5a antibody, virtually all the edema-inducing and neutrophil chemoattractant activity was abolished in samples taken up to 2 h after the zymosan injection.
 Later samples, however, contained increasing levels of a non-C5a component.
 In C5a-depleted 6-h exudate two peaks of inflammatory activity were separated using cation exchange HPLC.
 Evidence is presented that C5a itself is unable to stimulate the production of these activities.
 Both peaks of activity appear related to IL-8/NAP-1 as they inhibited the binding of 125I-IL-8/NAP-1 to human neutrophils.
