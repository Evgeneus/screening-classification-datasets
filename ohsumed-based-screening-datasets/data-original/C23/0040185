Transfalcine approach to a callosomarginal artery aneurysm.
 We describe a transfalcine approach to clipping and subsequently excising an expanding mycotic callosomarginal aneurysm.
 The patient had a devastating dominant (left) hemispheric spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage and was neurologically improving at the time of surgery nearly 2 months later.
 To avoid retracting the left hemisphere, we approached this left callosomarginal aneurysm from the nondominant side through the falx.
 The approach was straight-forward, and the result was satisfactory.
