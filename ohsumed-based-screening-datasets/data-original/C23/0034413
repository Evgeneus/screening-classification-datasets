Mass closure of the abdominal wound with delayed absorbable suture in surgery for gynecologic cancer.
 There has been a resurgence of interest recently in the optimal method of closure of the midline abdominal wound.
 The focus has been on the high-risk patient in particular.
 The controversy centers on interrupted versus continuous fascial closure and the choice of suture material.
 For three years on a gynecologic cancer service, running mass closure with delayed absorbable suture (Polyglactin) was used.
 Two hundred fifty-six patients were evaluable for analysis.
 The minimum follow-up time was two years.
 There was no wound dehiscence.
 Fourteen patients (5.5%) developed incisional hernias.
 The mass closure technique using delayed absorbable suture was effective in very-high-risk patients.
