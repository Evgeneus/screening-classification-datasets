Prominent meningeal "tail sign" in a patient with a metastatic tumor.
 A prominent enhancement of the dura adjacent to meningiomas has been described as being pathognomonic of these tumors.
 We describe a case where a classic meningeal "tail sign" was associated with an extra-axial metastatic tumor attached to the tentorium.
 There was no tumor invasion of the dura.
 We conclude that this sign is nonspecific and can be seen with dural-based tumors other than meningiomas.
