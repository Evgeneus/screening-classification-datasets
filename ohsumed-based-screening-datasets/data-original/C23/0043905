Incidental appendectomy during videolaseroscopy.
 One hundred incidental appendectomies were performed in patients undergoing operative laparoscopy (videolaseroscopy) for evaluating and treating various major diseases of the reproductive organs.
 Except for a fever resolving within 24 hours in one case and mild periumbilical ecchymosis, there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications.
 All patients were discharged within 24 hours of surgery.
 Average hospital stay was 14 hours.
 All cases have been followed up for a minimum of 8 months.
 We believe any risk associated with elective appendectomy as reported here is minimal and outweighed by the benefits of eliminating future emergency appendectomy, simplifying future differential diagnosis of pelvic pain and removing unsuspected abnormality found in the appendix.
