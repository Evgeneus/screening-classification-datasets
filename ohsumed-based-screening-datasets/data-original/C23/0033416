Effect of vasoconstriction on longitudinal distribution of pulmonary vascular pressure and volume.
 We used an improved version of the low-viscosity bolus method to evaluate longitudinal (arterial-to-venous) differences in the sensitivity of the dog lung lobe vasculature to selected vasoconstrictor stimuli, including hypoxia, and serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine infusions.
 This method revealed a bimodal distribution of local vascular resistance vs.
 cumulative vascular volume under the zone 3 conditions studied.
 Our interpretation of the two modes of relatively high resistance is that they correspond to high resistance per unit volume segments of the arteries and veins upstream and downstream from the relatively low resistance per unit volume capillary bed.
 Thus an increase in the height of the upstream and downstream modes of the resistance distribution suggests constriction in small arteries and veins, respectively.
 Horizontal displacement of the modes along the cumulative volume axis suggests changes in the distribution of volume among the arteries, veins, and capillary bed.
 By use of these criteria, the results are consistent with the concept that each of the vasoconstrictor stimuli studied had a different longitudinal response pattern.
 Hypoxia constricted mainly small arteries, whereas serotonin constricted small and large arteries.
 Histamine constricted large and small veins, and norepinephrine constricted large and small veins and arteries.
