Treatment of constitutional growth delay in prepubertal boys with a prolonged course of low dose oxandrolone.
 Forty six prepubertal boys who had constitutional growth delay were treated with oxandrolone.
 Mean age at the onset of treatment was 11.9 years (range 9.0-14.0) and bone age delay was 1.9 'years'.
 The dose of oxandrolone used was a mean of 0.05 mg/kg (range 0.03-0.18) for a mean of 0.9 years (range 0.2-3.6).
 Height velocity increased from a mean (SD) before treatment of 4.0 (1.0) to 7.5 (1.2) cm/year with oxandrolone.
 Growth rate was sustained at 7.6 (2.2) cm/year in the period after treatment.
 Those boys who attained a testicular volume of 4 ml or greater at the end of the treatment period had the most pronounced sustained growth acceleration.
 Height for bone age SD score did not alter significantly from a mean of -1.0 before treatment to -1.2 after treatment.
 Oxandrolone is a safe and effective treatment for prepubertal boys with constitutional growth delay.
