Prostate-type gland in the epididymis.
 We confirmed the presence of a prostate-type gland in the epididymis of a 30-year-old white man by immunohistochemical analysis using prostate specific antigen and prostate specific acid phosphatase.
 We suggest possible histogenetic mechanisms for such previously undescribed morphological heterogeneity within this wolffian duct derivative.
