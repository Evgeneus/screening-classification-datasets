Coracoclavicular screw fixation for unstable fractures of the distal clavicle. A report of five cases.
 Five consecutive unstable fractures of the distal third of the clavicle were treated by indirect open reduction and internal fixation using a temporary Bosworth-type screw.
 Coracoclavicular fixation provided and maintained reduction of the fracture.
 Healing occurred uneventfully within nine weeks in all cases.
 The screw was removed under local anaesthesia after healing of the fracture and there were no surgical complications.
 Shoulder function was restored to the pre-injury level.
 Temporary coracoclavicular screw fixation appears to be a valuable alternative for the treatment of type II fractures of the distal third of the clavicle.
