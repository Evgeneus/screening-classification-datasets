Confirmation of endotracheal tube placement: a miniaturized infrared qualitative CO2 detector.
 STUDY OBJECTIVES: A miniaturized, infrared, solid-state, end-tidal CO2 detector was used to confirm emergency endotracheal tube (ETT) placement.
 DESIGN: This prospective, clinical study used a miniature, infrared, solid-state end-tidal CO2 detector to confirm ETT placement in an acute setting.
 SETTING: The ICU, emergency department, and hospital floor.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: There were 88 consecutive adult patients requiring 100 emergency intubations.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The indication for airway intervention was considered urgent in 79% and under arrest conditions in 21%.
 The mean number of intubation attempts was 1.83 (range, one to five) with difficulty of intubation of 6.48 and confirmation of 7.75, on a linear scale from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest).
 Determination of ETT position revealed intratracheal intubation in 96% and esophageal intubation in 4%.
 Placement was confirmed by direct visualization or radiography in all cases.
 Sensitivity and specificity for ETT localization was 100% (P less than .0001).
 CONCLUSION: This hand-held infrared capnometer reliably confirms ETT placement under emergency conditions.
