Oral magnesium successfully relieves premenstrual mood changes.
 Reduced magnesium (Mg) levels have been reported in women affected by premenstrual syndrome (PMS).
 To evaluate the effects of an oral Mg preparation on premenstrual symptoms, we studied, by a double-blind, randomized design, 32 women (24-39 years old) with PMS confirmed by the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire.
 After 2 months of baseline recording, the subjects were randomly assigned to placebo or Mg for two cycles.
 In the next two cycles, both groups received Mg.
 Magnesium pyrrolidone carboxylic acid (360 mg Mg) or placebo was administered three times a day, from the 15th day of the menstrual cycle to the onset of menstrual flow.
 Blood samples for Mg measurement were drawn premenstrually, during the baseline period, and in the second and fourth months of treatment.
 The Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score of the cluster "pain" was significantly reduced during the second month in both groups, whereas Mg treatment significantly affected both the total Menstrual Distress Questionnaire score and the cluster "negative affect." In the second month, the women assigned to treatment showed a significant increase in Mg in lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells, whereas no changes were observed in plasma and erythrocytes.
 These data indicate that Mg supplementation could represent an effective treatment of premenstrual symptoms related to mood changes.
