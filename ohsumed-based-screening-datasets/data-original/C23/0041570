Trauma-precipitated migrainous hemiparesis.
 Migraine is a pleomorphic condition in which neurologic manifestations may be absent or a minor or a major feature.
 Similarly, head injury may range from trivial to lethal with regard to neurologic morbidity.
 Migraine may be precipitated by a variety of stimuli, including head trauma, significant or trivial.
 Presented is the case of a patient with migrainous hemiparesis precipitated by minor head injury.
 The clinical features and laboratory and radiological findings of trauma-precipitated migraine are reviewed.
