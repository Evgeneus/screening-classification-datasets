Management of the short-bowel syndrome.
 The patient with short-bowel syndrome after massive small-intestinal resection represents one of the greatest clinical challenges a general surgeon must face.
 Maintaining optimal nutritional and metabolic support until maximum bowel adaptation can occur is the top priority of therapy.
 Currently, no operative procedure for adjunctive management of the short-bowel syndrome is sufficiently safe and effective to recommend its routine use.
 Long-term parenteral nutrition remains the cornerstone of successful management.
