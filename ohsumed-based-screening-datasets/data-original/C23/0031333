Residual functional deficit after partial fibulectomy for bone graft.
 The residual functional deficit caused by partial fibulectomy for bone graft was documented with subjective assessment and clinical and instrumented examination in ten patients.
 The donor leg often remained mildly symptomatic.
 Residual weakness occurred when the middle one third of the fibula was excised.
 However, mild discomfort, residual weakness, and laxity were not considered significant enough to discourage transplantation of large segments of the fibula.
 Postoperative therapy should emphasize muscular strength to minimize the functional deficit.
