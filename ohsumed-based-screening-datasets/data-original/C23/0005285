Computed tomography staging of the paranasal sinuses in chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis.
 In this study, the computed tomography scans of 100 patients with chronic hyperplastic rhinosinusitis were reviewed to establish a clinical staging system.
 Fourteen percent of the patients were classified as Stage I (single-focus disease); 36% as Stage II (multifocal disease responsive to conservative therapy); 32% as Stage III (diffuse disease partially responsive to medication); and 16% as Stage IV (diffuse disease associated with bony changes and poorly responsive to conservative treatment).
 The incidence of recurrent or persistent disease ranged from 13% for Stage II to 30% for Stage IV.
 Stage I and III patients had 13% and 18% recurrence rates, respectively.
 Computed tomography staging is shown to be useful in outlining operative strategies and is a reliable prognosticator of the disease process.
