Traumatic hyphaema: a retrospective study of 314 cases.
 A retrospective study was made of 314 consecutive cases of traumatic hyphaema in a mixed urban and rural Scottish population.
 Secondary haemorrhage occurred in 4.1% of cases and was not associated with a worsening of final visual acuity.
 There were no identifiable risk factors for secondary haemorrhage.
 Poor visual outcome was in most cases attributable to retinal pathology.
 The use of antifibrinolytic agents does not appear to be necessary in such a population, and the importance of detecting associated retinal detachment is emphasised.
