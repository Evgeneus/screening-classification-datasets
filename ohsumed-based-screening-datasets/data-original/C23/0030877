Double-blind controlled study of botulinum toxin in adductor spasmodic dysphonia.
 The treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia using botulinum toxin A was conducted in 13 patients as a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.
 Patients were diagnosed independently by an interdisciplinary team consisting of speech pathologists, an otolaryngologist, and a neurologist.
 The toxin or saline was injected into each thyroarytenoid muscle under electromyographic and laryngoscopic guidance.
 Botulinum toxin A markedly reduced perturbation, decreased fundamental frequency range, and improved the spectrographic characteristics of the voice.
 Fundamental frequency and phonation time remained unchanged.
 Patients injected with botulinum toxin A noticed significant improvement in their voices in comparison with the placebo-treated group.
 Excessive breathiness of the voice occurred in two patients, and mild bleeding in one patient in the botulinum toxin A-treated group.
 Injection with saline resulted in edema of the vocal cord in one patient.
 Botulinum toxin A proved to be an effective and safe treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia.
