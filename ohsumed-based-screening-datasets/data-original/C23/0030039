Mania in the elderly: a 5-7 year follow-up.
 A 5-7 year follow-up study of elderly individuals hospitalized on an acute psychiatric inpatient service for bipolar disorder, manic phase, demonstrates that the prognosis of mania has improved in the past 30 years.
 A majority of those hospitalized for mania are alive and living independently 5 years after hospitalization.
 However, eight of 25 (32%) patients have experienced a decline in Mini-Mental State Exam score to below 24, suggesting a clinically significant cognitive disorder.
 Mortality rates were higher in the manic group than expected from population norms.
 Compared to a group of similarly aged individuals hospitalized for unipolar depression, patients with bipolar disorder had an earlier age of onset and a lesser likelihood of being rehospitalized.
