Bipolar hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fracture of the femoral neck. A prospective randomised trial of cemented Thompson and uncemented Moore stems.
 We performed a randomised prospective trial to compare the results of 27 cemented and 26 uncemented bipolar hemiarthroplasties in active patients with displaced subcapital fractures of the femoral neck.
 After a mean follow-up of 17 months, significantly more of the uncemented group were experiencing pain in the hip and using more walking aids than the patients in the cemented group.
 The incidence of postoperative complications, the early mortality rate and the operating time and blood loss were not significantly different.
 Using otherwise identical prostheses the early results were much better with a cemented Thompson stem than with an uncemented Austin Moore stem.
