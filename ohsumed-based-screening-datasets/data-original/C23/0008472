Function in athymic nude mice of parathyroid heterografts from patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
 Heterotransplantation of adenomatous parathyroid glandular tissue from humans with primary hyperparathyroidism into athymic nude mice creates a unique animal model of this disease.
 The mice manifest high concentrations of both midregion/C-terminal human parathyroid hormone and biologically active intact human parathyroid hormone relative to either mice with no implants or mice that received normal human parathyroid tissue.
 Secretion of these substances is maintained in most mice for at least 9 to 13 months after implantation.
 In addition, animals that have experienced implantation exhibit other characteristics associated with human primary hyperparathyroidism including relative hypercalcemia and increased renal 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1 alpha-hydroxylase activity.
 We also measured these parameters in a group of nude mice that received transplantation of a similar mass of hyperplastic parathyroid tissue that was obtained from patients with uremic secondary hyperparathyroidism.
 Although we hypothesized that the level of human parathyroid hormone secretion from these implants would fall over time in response to the normal host environment, hormone levels remained as high as those in recipients of adenomatous heterografts, even after 9 to 13 months.
 Moreover, similar biologic effect of the excess parathyroid hormone (i.e., relative hypercalcemia, hyperphosphatasemia, and increased 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D biosynthesis) were detected.
 These animal models should prove extremely useful in supplementing our understanding of hyperparathyroid disorder in man.
