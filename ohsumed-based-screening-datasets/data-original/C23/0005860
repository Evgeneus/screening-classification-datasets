Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions with the inflatable expander: a critical appraisal.
 Breast reconstruction using inflatable expanders has become an established and preferred technique.
 Although our knowledge of the biomechanical changes occurring in expanded skin has increased greatly, little information is available regarding average aesthetic results achieved with this technique.
 In order to eliminate the bias of best case selection reports, this study of 60 consecutive patients undergoing skin-expansion breast reconstruction was undertaken.
 Results of the study demonstrated a significant frequency and diversity of complications.
 In particular, immediate breast reconstruction with skin expanders was identified as a high-risk procedure because of its association with skin necrosis and delayed wound healing.
 Although two procedures--insertion and replacement--had been anticipated, patients from both the Boston and New York groups required approximately three operations to complete the expansion process.
 Average aesthetic results, often characterized by problems of symmetry, ptosis, and contour, need to be recognized and improved.
