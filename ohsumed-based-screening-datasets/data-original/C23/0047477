Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and meningitis in acoustic neuroma surgery.
 Cerebrospinal fluid leaks and associated meningitis are the most common life-threatening complications of surgery for acoustic neuromas.
 This retrospective study reviews 319 patients who had surgery for 321 acoustic tumors at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, University of Toronto, from April 1975 to March 1990.
 Cerebrospinal fluid leaks occurred after 13.4% of primary tumor operations.
 Surgical repair was required in 6.2% of all patients; 4.4% needed more than one operation.
 Meningitis occurred in 5.3% of all patients.
 These complications were more common in larger tumors and after the combined translabyrinthine middle fossa approach.
 Transnasopharyngeal eustachian tube obliteration was used to stop recurrent cerebrospinal fluid leaks in two patients.
