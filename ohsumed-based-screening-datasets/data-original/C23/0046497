Circumspinal decompression for thoracic myelopathy due to combined ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and ligamentum flavum.
 Ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) combined with ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) in the thoracic spine can result in serious myelopathy, leading to circumferential compression of the spinal cord in advanced stages of the disease.
 The authors performed circumspinal decompression (circumferential decompression of the spinal cord) on these patients.
 This operation consists of two steps: posterior and lateral decompression of the spinal cord by removal of the OLF (first step) and anterior removal of the OPLL for anterior decompression (second step), followed by interbody fusion.
 In the first step, two deep parallel gutters, covering the extent of the OPLL to be removed anteriorly, are drilled down from the rear into the vertebral body along both sides of the dura to easily and safely remove the OPLL anteriorly at the second step.
 In the second step, the surgical approach varies according to the affected level; costotransversectomy in the upper thoracic spine and standard thoracotomy in the middle or lower thoracic spine.
 According to the authors, circumspinal decompression is not an easy procedure, but from their results in 10 patients, they identify it as a radical and promising surgical procedure.
