Acute aluminum toxicity after continuous intravesical alum irrigation for hemorrhagic cystitis.
 An encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy developed in a seventeen-year-old girl with chemotherapy-induced renal failure while receiving an intravesical aluminum infusion for hemorrhagic cystitis.
 Premortem serum and postmortem tissue aluminum levels were markedly elevated.
 It is likely that her inability to excrete absorbed aluminum contributed to her death.
 Aluminum infusions should be used with caution in patients with renal failure.
