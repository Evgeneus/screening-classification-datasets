A controlled study of the effectiveness of spot dermabrasion ('scarabrasion') on the appearance of surgical scars.
 We report the results of a controlled study on the use of spot dermabrasion ("scarabrasion") on surgical scars.
 In a split scar model, linear scars produced by full-thickness surgical excisions on the face, trunk, and extremities were studied in 48 patients.
 Results of abrasion of the left (top) half of each scar were compared with the untreated right (bottom) half.
 Although scars were improved at 4 and 6 weeks after injury, a significantly greater number responded to abrasion at 8 weeks (p less than 0.05).
 All regions of the body showed comparable improvement.
 The diamond fraise was found to be an effective instrument for scarabrasion.
