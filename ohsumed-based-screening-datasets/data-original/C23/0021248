Transfer function of sound transmission in subglottal human respiratory system at low frequencies.
 The amplitude of sound transmission from the mouth to a site overlying the extrathoracic trachea and two sites on the posterior chest wall was measured in eight healthy adult male subjects at resting lung volume over the 100- to 600-Hz frequency range.
 The ratios of the estimated magnitude spectra of transmission of each of the chest wall sites to the tracheal site were determined, with the resulting spectra representing effective transfer functions of transmission in the subglottal system.
 For the group, the transfer functions exhibited a single peak, which occurred at 143 +/- 13 Hz (mean +/- SD) with a quality factor (Q) of 2.0 +/- 0.2 for the upper chest wall site and at 129 +/- 6 Hz with a Q of 2.2 +/- 0.4 for the lower site.
 The trend of decreasing spectral energy with increasing frequency was indicated by roll-offs of -10 +/- 4 and -17 +/- 5 dB/octave from 300 to 600 Hz at the two sites, respectively.
 The fundamental radial mode of a model thoracic cavity, which is a large rigid cylinder filled with lossless lung tissue, provides a good estimate of the observed low-frequency resonance.
 This agreement suggests that thoracic cavity resonances may have particularly important effects on sound transmission at frequencies below approximately 250 Hz, where the magnitude of parenchymal attenuation appears to be small.
