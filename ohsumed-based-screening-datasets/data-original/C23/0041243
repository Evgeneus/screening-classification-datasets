The effect of 'detailing' on physicians' prescribing behavior for postsurgical narcotic analgesia.
 Physicians have been frequently reported to prescribe inadequately pain medication in the hospitalized patient.
 A number of methods and techniques have been attempted to alter this phenomenon including audit, standard setting, drug utilization evaluation and sanctioning.
 The purpose of the following study was to demonstrate the behavioral efficacy of the technique of detailing.
 We reviewed the postsurgical records of 320 patients for pre-established criteria on the administration of meperidine before and after detailing of the proper prescribing with regard to timing and dose.
 The data show 30% of the sample meeting the criteria before detailing and 43% after detailing had been given.
 We conclude the method of detailing can be effective in altering physician's prescribing behavior for meperidine in postoperative surgical patients.
