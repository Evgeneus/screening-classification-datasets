Hemifacial spasm caused by a spontaneous dissecting aneurysm of the vertebral artery. Case report.
 The authors describe the first reported case of dissecting aneurysm presenting with hemifacial spasm.
 The patient was a 58-year-old woman with left hemifacial spasm of 2 years' duration.
 Cranial nerve examination was otherwise normal and no other clinical symptoms were observed.
 Vertebral angiography revealed a fusiform enlargement of the left vertebral artery and contrast medium remaining in the intramural false lumen in the venous phase.
 Microvascular decompression of the facial nerve with wrapping of the aneurysm resulted in complete relief of the hemifacial spasm.
