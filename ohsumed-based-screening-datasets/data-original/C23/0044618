Stress analgesia: the opioid analgesia of long swims suppresses the non-opioid analgesia induced by short swims in mice.
 In mice, room temperature swimming for as short a period as 15 sec has been found to induce a non-opioid analgesia with a time course of 10-12 min.
 As the duration of the swim is increased, an opioid analgesia develops with a longer persistence (25-30 min); the development of the opioid analgesia appears to suppress the expression of the non-opioid analgesia so that none of the latter is evident after 3 min swims.
 The characteristics of the tail-flick nociceptive test are also described.
