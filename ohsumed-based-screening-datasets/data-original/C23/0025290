Subcapsular hepatic necrosis in liver transplantation: CT appearance.
 Eleven cases of subcapsular hepatic necrosis were found in 47 hepatic transplantation patients who underwent CT examination between the second and 14th postoperative day.
 CT examinations of all 11 cases showed nonenhancing hypodense subcapsular areas with irregular contours in the liver.
 Major vessels were free of obstruction.
 Anatomic correlation, possible in one case, confirmed the diagnosis.
 Size disproportion between the graft and the recipient abdominal cavity reduced hepatic blood flow and caused abnormal pressure points.
 One or both of these factors could result in ischemia in subcapsular areas and explain the subcapsular necrosis.
 Although it has good prognosis without treatment, subcapsular hepatic necrosis is important to recognize to avoid confusion with liver necrosis after vascular thrombosis.
