Neonatal diaphragmatic paralysis caused by chest drains.
 A boy delivered at 32 weeks' gestation developed bilateral pneumothoraces that required multiple chest drains.
 He was dependent on the ventilator for 52 days because of bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis.
 Electrophysiological studies confirmed phrenic nerve damage.
 He eventually made a full recovery.
 It is likely that this damage was caused by the insertion of the chest drains.
