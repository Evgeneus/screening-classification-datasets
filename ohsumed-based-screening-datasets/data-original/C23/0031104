Treatment of hypertensive urgencies with oral nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril.
 Sixty-five patients with uncomplicated hypertensive urgencies were treated in the emergency and cardiology departments with 20 mg nifedipine, 20 mg nicardipine, or 25 mg captopril in a randomized study.
 The study population consisted of 65 patients ranging in age from forty-one to seventy-one.
 Blood pressure and heart rate were assessed for six hours after intake of the antihypertensive agents.
 Within sixty minutes nifedipine reduced blood pressure by an average of 74.7 mmHg for the systolic and 35.4 mmHg for the diastolic.
 Average heart rate increased significantly by 11.6 beats/min at within thirty minutes.
 Nicardipine and captopril produced equivalent falls in systolic (-81.6 and -79.4 mmHg) and diastolic (-37.3 and -33 mmHg) blood pressure respectively, but did not increase heart rate significantly.
 The antihypertensive effect of each drug was maintained until six hours after medication.
 In conclusion, nifedipine, nicardipine, and captopril show similar efficacy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies.
 The authors believe that these drugs can be used as first-line therapy in the treatment of hypertensive urgencies safely and effectively.
