Composition of atherosclerotic plaques in coronary arteries in women less than 40 years of age with fatal coronary artery disease and implications for plaque reversibility.
 This study analyzes the composition of atherosclerotic plaques in the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries in 8 women less than 40 years of age (mean 34) with fatal coronary artery disease (CAD) and compares these data to previous studies of 37 adults greater than 45 years of age (mean 59) with fatal CAD.
 Histologic sections were taken at 5-mm intervals from the entire lengths of the right, left main, left anterior descending and left circumflex coronary arteries.
 With the use of a computerized morphometry system, analysis of the 4 major epicardial coronary arteries showed the major component of plaque to be a combination of cellular (mean percent total plaque area = 65%, standard error = 6%) and dense (19%, standard error = 6%) fibrous tissue.
 Arterial segments narrowed greater than 75% in cross-sectional area from these young women were compared with similarly narrowed arteries from 37 older patients (32 men [86%]) with fatal CAD previously reported by this laboratory, and showed significantly more cellular fibrous tissue and lipid-rich foam cells, and lesser amounts of dense fibrous and heavily calcified tissue.
 The large amount of lipid-containing foam cells and relative lack of acellular scar tissue in coronary plaques in these young women suggests a greater potential for reversibility of these plaques in this subset of patients with CAD.
