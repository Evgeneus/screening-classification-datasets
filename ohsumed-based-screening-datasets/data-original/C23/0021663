Volumetric atrophy of the amygdala in Alzheimer's disease: quantitative serial reconstruction.
 The present study quantitatively assessed volumes of the amygdala and its subnuclei in autopsied cases of advanced Alzheimer's disease (AD) for comparison with age-matched controls.
 Amygdalar nuclei showed significant atrophy in AD with the exception of the paralaminar portion of the basal nucleus.
 The magnocellular regions of the amygdala showed proportionately greater size reductions as a fraction of total amygdala volume than did other areas.
 Computerized reconstruction of the amygdala provided three-dimensional views of a variety of structural alterations accompanying the volumetric declines with AD.
 The apparent selective vulnerability of the magnocellular amygdalar areas coincides with the loss of large nerve cells in AD.
