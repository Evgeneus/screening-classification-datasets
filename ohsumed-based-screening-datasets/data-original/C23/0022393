Obstructed total anomalous pulmonary venous return. Toward neutralization of a major risk factor.
 Among 57 neonates undergoing repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return with severe pulmonary venous obstruction from 1980 through 1989, date of operation (1980 to 1984), preoperative hemodynamic instability, and failure to monitor pulmonary artery pressure postoperatively were risk factors for death.
 Thus, among the 30 patients having repair between 1985 and 1989, the 55-month survival rate including hospital deaths was 83%.
