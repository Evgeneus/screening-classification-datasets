Social density, stressors, and depression: gender differences among the black elderly.
 This research examined gender differences with regard to the effects of social density and stressors upon depressive symptomatology among 600 Black elderly community residents (aged 55-85 years) of Nashville, Tennessee.
 The sample had more females than males and fewer married individuals.
 Approximately half of the males and females lived alone.
 Regression analyses show that poor ego and chronic medical problems were the common predictors of depression among both the males and females.
 Gender differences were found with regard to life events in that females tended to become more depressed as the number of events increased and as level of contact with relatives and friends decreased.
 Further, females with lower levels of social attachment, guidance, and reliability were more depressed.
 None of these social support dimensions related to depression among the males.
 These relationships tended to be stronger for those living alone than for those living with others.
