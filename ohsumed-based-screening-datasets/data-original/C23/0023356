A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, two-center, pilot trial of Cop 1 in chronic progressive multiple sclerosis.
 We found Cop 1 to be effective and relatively safe in a previous (exacerbating-remitting) clinical trial.
 This current trial involves 106 chronic-progressive patients.
 The major end point, confirmed progression of 1.0 or 1.5 units (depending on baseline disability) on the Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale, was observed in nine (17.6%) treated and 14 (25.5%) control patients.
 The differences between the overall survival curves were not significant.
 Progression rates at 12 and 24 months were higher for the placebo group (p = 0.088) with 2-year probabilities of progressing of 20.4% for Cop 1 and 29.5% for placebo.
 We found a significant difference at 24 months between placebo and Cop 1 at one but not the other center.
 Two-year progression rates for two secondary end points, unconfirmed progression, and progression of 0.5 EDSS units, (p = 0.03) are significant.
