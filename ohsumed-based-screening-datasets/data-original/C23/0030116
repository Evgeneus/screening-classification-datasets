The prevalence and management of bronchial anastomotic complications in lung transplantation.
 The prevalence and management of bronchial anastomosis complications have been assessed in a series of 53 patients undergoing lung transplantation.
 Of the 50 patients subsequently at risk of airway complications, these problems occurred in seven (14%).
 Only one patient died as a direct result of the airway complication (2%).
 Four patients required airway stenting, and their management is discussed.
 Although airway healing is normal in the majority of patients undergoing lung transplantation (86%), when deficits occur they can usually be successfully managed with conservative treatment.
 Bronchial stenting may be required on either a temporary or a permanent basis.
