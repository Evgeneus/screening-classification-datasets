Widespread inflammatory response to osteoblastoma: the flare phenomenon.
 A case of vertebral osteoblastoma caused a diffuse, reactive inflammatory infiltrate in two vertebrae, adjacent ribs, and the paraspinous soft tissues.
 The authors call this the flare phenomenon.
 On magnetic resonance images the diffuse inflammatory response caused a misleading appearance that simulated a malignant process (lymphoma or Ewing sarcoma).
 A computed tomographic myelogram was diagnostic.
