Autoerotic death. A definition.
 A definition of autoerotic death is suggested that restricts the use of this term to accidental deaths that occur during individual, usually solitary, sexual activity in which a device, apparatus, or prop that was employed to enhance the sexual stimulation of the deceased in some way caused unintended death.
 The case of the autoerotic asphyxial death of a 48-year-old man is reported in order to demonstrate the application of this definition.
