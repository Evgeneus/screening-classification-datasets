Unusual posterior retinal holes associated with high myopia in XYY syndrome.
 A 49-year-old XYY man was found to have high myopia OU with unusual multiple retinal atrophic holes located in the posterior pole, unrelated to a posterior staphyloma or any other myopic degenerative changes.
 Most of the retinal holes showed signs of self-healing, with no evidence of vitreous traction or retinal detachment.
 High myopia and atrophic retinal holes have been found in other chromosomal disorders and in one sex-chromosomal abnormality.
