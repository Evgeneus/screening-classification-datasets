Use of autologous blood in total hip replacement. A comprehensive program.
 We evaluated the effectiveness of a comprehensive program for the use of autologous blood in reduction of the need for transfusion of homologous blood in total hip replacement in a prospective study of a consecutive series of patients.
 Transfusion of homologous blood was minimized through transfusion of preoperatively deposited autologous blood, intraoperative and postoperative salvage of washed red blood cells, and use of the clinical condition of the patient as the sole criterion for transfusion of non-autologous blood, regardless of the hematocrit.
 The cases of 143 patients who had had 154 primary total hip replacements were studied.
 One hundred and forty-three procedures were done on patients who had not been prevented from donating blood for medical reasons, and 93 per cent of these 143 procedures were performed with the availability of one to five units of preoperatively deposited autologous blood.
 The patients predeposited an average of 2.6 units of blood for each procedure.
 Ninety-two per cent of the procedures for which autologous blood had been predeposited were performed without transfusion of homologous blood.
 In the entire group of patients, almost 90 per cent of the transfused blood was autologous blood.
 Intraoperative salvage of red blood cells was successful in 148 procedures, and salvage was continued in the recovery room for all of these patients.
 An average of 408 milliliters of red blood cells was saved and reinfused, and this was 28 per cent of the average total loss of blood (1435 milliliters) for this series of procedures.
