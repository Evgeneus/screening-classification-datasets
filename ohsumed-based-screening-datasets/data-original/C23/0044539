Microvascular angina. Cardiovascular investigations regarding pathophysiology and management.
 A significant minority of patients with chest pain who undergo cardiac catheterization are found to have angiographically normal coronary arteries.
 Over the past 25 years, several studies have shown that a subset have demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow and cardiac function; however, only a minority of these patients have convincing evidence for myocardial ischemia during stress, and alternative mechanisms have been explored to explain the frequent and debilitating symptoms of pain experienced by the majority of these patients undergoing study.
 Abnormal visceral nociception appears to be a fundamental abnormality in this population, whether or not demonstrable abnormalities in coronary flow or cardiac function can be demonstrated.
