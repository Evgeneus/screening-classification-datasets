Middle ear inflammatory mediators and cochlear function.
 Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has been documented in patients with otitis media.
 Despite a number of clinical and pathologic works dealing with this common problem, animal studies searching for possible relationships between the middle ear inflammation and cochlear function remain insufficient.
 Bacterial inoculation and ototoxins and inflammatory products in the middle ear cavity cause SNHL in rodents.
 Human serum albumin placed in the middle ear cavity in chinchillas also produces SNHL, owing to the effects of nonspecific inflammation in the middle ear cavity.
 Most of the middle ear inflammatory mediators enter the inner ear through the round window route, and alteration of the permeability of the round window membrane plays an important role in causing cochlear dysfunction.
 Although an immunologic response in the middle ear plays an important role in otitis media, the immunologic response in the inner ear as it relates to middle ear inflammatory mediators requires further study.
