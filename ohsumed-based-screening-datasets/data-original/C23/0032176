Safety-belt injuries in children with lap-belt ecchymosis: CT findings in 61 patients.
 We have noted a complex of common injuries in children wearing lap-styled safety belts during vehicular accidents.
 Sixty-one children who were restrained passengers in motor vehicle crashes had linear ecchymosis across the abdomen and had CT for abdominal trauma.
 Thirteen children (21%) had a lumbar spine injury, and 14 children (23%) injured a hollow viscus (bowel, 12; bladder, two); five children (8%) had both spine and hollow viscus injuries.
 Abnormal findings on abdominal CT were recognized retrospectively in three of 13 children with lumbar spinal injury.
 Lateral radiographs of the spine showed lumbar spinal injury in all cases.
 Free intraperitoneal air was noted in on three (25%) of 12 children with bowel injury.
 In eight of those children, CT showed large, unexplained collections of peritoneal fluid.
 The presence of lap-belt ecchymosis should prompt a careful search for spine, bowel, and bladder injury.
 Recognition of the limitations of CT diagnosis of these injuries is important to reduce errors in interpretation.
