Role of quinsy tonsillectomy in the management of peritonsillar abscess.
 Peritonsillar abscess (PTA) is the most frequent complication of acute tonsillitis requiring surgical intervention.
 Debate continues concerning optimal therapy in terms of patient morbidity and cost-effectiveness.
 A retrospective study was performed on 45 tonsillectomies for PTA in military personnel from December 1986 through December 1988.
 Twenty-three quinsy (abscess) tonsillectomies and 22 interval tonsillectomies were identified.
 Parameters studied were age, sex, abscess location, interval prior to operation, blood loss, operative time, operative experience, and combined hospital and convalescent days for the two groups.
 Significant differences were noted between the quinsy and interval tonsillectomy groups concerning the average number of days hospitalized (3.0 versus 4.5) and their respective convalescent periods (10.3 versus 17.3).
 We conclude that quinsy tonsillectomy is the best management for PTA in a young work force when the optimal treatment choice is between interval or acute tonsillectomy.
