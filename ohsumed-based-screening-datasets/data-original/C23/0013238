Cervical rotation flaps for midface resurfacing.
 The midface has long served as a focus for creativity in surgical reconstruction.
 Full-thickness skin grafts, split-thickness grafts, and distal flaps have long been used to attempt to reduplicate existing anatomy in this area.
 Recent reconstruction efforts have focused on the creative use of microvascular free flaps for this purpose.
 This article reports on the use of extensively developed regional rotation flaps as an excellent reconstructive modality for use in this area of the face.
 The details of surgical incisional planning are given.
 The nuances of surgical creation of these flaps and their rotation and suspension into place are given.
 The cases we have done using this technique for the past 3 years are reviewed.
 Our present indications for use of these flaps and their limitations are given.
