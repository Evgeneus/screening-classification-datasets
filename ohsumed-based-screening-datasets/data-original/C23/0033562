Efficient diagnosis of common complaints: a comparative study in the United States and England.
 BACKGROUND.
 The purpose of this investigation was to compare the diagnostic efficiency of American and British family and general practitioners, as measured by their utilization of health care resources and the average length of the diagnostic interval, in diagnosing common complaints.
 METHODS.
 Several hundred charts from teaching practices in the United States and England were identified by computer search and reviewed.
 The charts were those of patients who had presented between 1978 and 1988 with a complaint of chest pain and were subsequently diagnosed as having angina pectoris or reflux esophagitis, or who presented with a complaint of shortness of breath and were subsequently diagnosed as having heart failure or asthma.
 RESULTS.
 The results of this study, which compared teaching family medicine practices in the United States and England, suggest that American family physicians diagnose common complaints such as chest pain and dyspnea in a shorter time with fewer visits and fewer consultations than their English counterparts, but order approximately the same number of diagnostic tests.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 This study demonstrates the difficulties in interpreting international (cross-cultural) comparisons.
 Differences may be due to varying health care systems, economic factors, physician training, and physician practice styles, as well as patient expectations.
