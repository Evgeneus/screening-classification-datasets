A nurse-managed special care unit.
 The authors describe the first year of operation of a nurse-managed intensive care unit (ICU).
 Concerned with the problems, costs, and inadequacies of caring for long-term patients in traditional ICUs, nurse administrators designed a special care unit that incorporates a physical design facilitating family involvement and rehabilitative care, registered nurse case management, and a shared governance management philosophy.
 Compared with traditional ICUs, the effectiveness of the special care unit is tested in terms of patient and nurse outcomes.
 Implications of this innovation for health-care delivery systems and the nursing profession are discussed.
