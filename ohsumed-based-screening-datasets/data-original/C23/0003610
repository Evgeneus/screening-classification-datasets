Placenta previa.
 A placenta previa, whether found fortuitously by ultrasound or with the clinical emergency of maternal hemorrhage, carries significant maternal and fetal risk.
 Accurate diagnosis, judicious expectant management with transfusion as required, and delivery at the time of fetal lung maturation can lead to the most favorable outcome.
 Anticipation of the clinical complication of placenta accreta may avoid some serious consequences.
 Clinical judgement and skill in the performance of cesarean sections, dilatation and curettage, and other forms of uterine invasive techniques may help to keep subsequent incidence of placenta previa at a reasonably low rate.
