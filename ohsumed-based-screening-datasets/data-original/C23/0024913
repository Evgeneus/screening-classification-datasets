Stenting of coronary arteries: has a modern Pandora's box been opened?
 Interventional cardiology has recently witnessed the growth of several alternatives to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, including coronary stenting.
 Although stenting appears to be useful in treating abrupt closure after coronary angioplasty, its effectiveness in limiting the complex processes responsible for late restenosis is much less certain.
 Pathologic examination of stented human saphenous bypass grafts shows extensive deposits of platelets, fibrin and leukocytes along the stent wires within the 1st week and formation of a neointima of variable thickness after 3 months without evidence of foreign body reaction.
 The long-term effects of continuous barotrauma induced by the expanded stent remain unknown.
 It is difficult to assess the relative merits of the new devices, but stenting has several theoretic advantages.
 It seems less disruptive to the underlying architecture of the vessel wall and enjoys favorable theoretic and effective expansion ratios.
 Wide-spread clinical acceptance for stenting will depend on demonstrating that its safety, efficacy and cost efficiency are superior to those of balloon angioplasty.
