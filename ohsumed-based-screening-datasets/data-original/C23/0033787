Attitudes of family practice residents about speech-language-hearing referrals.
 The "family doctor" has been identified as the professional most likely to be contacted by the general public with concerns about communication disorders; yet the family practice physician is unlikely to refer patients with communicative disorders to speech-language pathologists or audiologists for nonmedical evaluation and treatment.
 The purpose of this study was to determine attitudes of family practice residents about referral patterns for communication disorders using a survey format.
 Thirty-nine residents estimated that they had referred an average of 1.5 patients to a speech-language pathologist and 2.2 patients to an audiologist during a six-month interval.
 The findings indicated that these residents did not routinely refer patients to speech-language pathologists.
 When they did refer, a limited view of communication problems was used.
