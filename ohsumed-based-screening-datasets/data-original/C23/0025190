The early management of flap necrosis in breast reconstruction.
 Flap necrosis is a potential complication of any type of breast reconstruction.
 Of 302 breast reconstructions performed by the author at the University of Texas M.D.
 Anderson Cancer Center, some degree of flap necrosis occurred in 59 (19.5 percent).
 Small areas of flap necrosis can be managed with simple observation, but secondary healing may not be complete for months.
 Early and aggressive excision of the ischemic tissue with immediate primary closure often can achieve rapid primary healing.
 In addition, early revision and reshaping of the breast may, in selected patients, permit achievement of a significantly better final result.
 This is true not only for TRAM and latissimus dorsi flaps, but also for the mastectomy flap necrosis sometimes encountered in immediate reconstruction with simple implants or tissue expanders.
