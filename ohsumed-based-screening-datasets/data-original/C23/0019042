Recurrence of Crohn's disease after resection.
 Recurrent Crohn's disease develops in most patients after surgical resection if the patient is followed for sufficient time.
 This review examines various aspects of recurrent Crohn's disease.
 It is concluded that Crohn's disease is a diffuse condition of the gastrointestinal tract and that radical resection of Crohn's disease does not prevent recurrence.
 Assorted factors thought to be associated with recurrence are examined and the relevance of these factors to the surgeon treating Crohn's disease is discussed.
