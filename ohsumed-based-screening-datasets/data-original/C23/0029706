Hypermetabolism in arthrogryposis multiplex congenita.
 Two patients who developed hypermetabolic reactions during anaesthesia and surgery and who were suffering from arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are reported and it is proposed that the reaction is distinct from malignant hyperthermia and independent of the anaesthetic agents used.
 The implications for anaesthetists involved in the management of patients with arthrogryposis multiplex congenita are discussed.
