Interleukin-1 mRNA-expressing macrophages in human chronically inflamed gingival tissues.
 Interleukin-1 (IL-1)-producing cells in inflamed gingival tissues obtained from patients with periodontitis were examined by combined immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization.
 Macrophages, T cells, B cells, and endothelial cells were visualized in the lesions by the immunoperoxidase method using specific antibodies to each cell type.
 Subsequent in situ hybridization using 35S-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probes complementary to human IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNA showed IL-1 transcripts in macrophages predominantly but not in T cells or B cells.
 Neither fibroblasts nor keratinocytes contained the IL-1 message to any significant extent.
 Endothelial cells also were essentially negative for IL-1 messages.
 These findings indicate that IL-1 is produced principally by macrophages in inflamed gingival tissues of humans.
