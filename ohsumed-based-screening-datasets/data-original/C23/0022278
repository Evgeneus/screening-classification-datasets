Radiographic identification by mastoid sinus and arterial pattern.
 A skull and some incomplete postcranial remains were discovered in two searches over a two-month period near Santa Fe, New Mexico.
 The discoveries could be demonstrated to be from the same person, and the remains were shown to be consistent with a specific missing person on the basis of anthropological analysis.
 Further work led to a positive identification on multiple grounds, including agreement of the details of the mastoid sinus and endocranial arterial patterns observed radiographically.
 These features may be useful for establishing positive identification from skeletal remains when antemortem radiographic studies for comparison are limited to lateral cranial vault studies.
