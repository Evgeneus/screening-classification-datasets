Clinical spectrum of leber's congenital amaurosis in the second to fourth decades of life.
 Leber's congenital amaurosis is a type of congenital retinitis pigmentosa in which the fundus abnormalities are extremely variable and to some extent age dependent.
 Most cases are seen in infancy.
 The retinal, electroretinogram, and fluorescein angiographic findings are described in ten patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis who ranged in age from 13 to 36 years when first seen.
 All of the patients were from Honduras and were unrelated except for one pair (a brother and sister).
 The polymorphic appearance of the fundus is emphasized and is particularly striking in the siblings.
 A macular lesion (a bull's-eye maculopathy) not previously associated with Leber's congenital amaurosis is reported as a variant fundus appearance in this entity.
