The effect of omental pedicle graft transfer on spinal microcirculation and laminectomy membrane formation.
 The properties of the omentum and its effect on spinal neurologic disease was investigated.
 Omental pedicle grafts were transferred to the laminectomized lumbar spines of nine neurologically normal dogs.
 Grafts were placed on either the dura or the spinal cord.
 Interruption of the graft's circulation was examined.
 To study the effect, the artery of the graft was injected with contrast and the graft-dura interface studied histologically.
 All injected specimens demonstrated vascular connections from the graft to the neural elements.
 The graft was found to decrease postoperative perineural scarring.
 The omentum appears to possess properties that could be applied to improve outcomes in spinal surgery.
