Molecular characterization of the mouse mannose-binding proteins. The mannose-binding protein A but not C is an acute phase reactant.
 Mannose-binding proteins play a role in first line host defense against a variety of pathogens.
 We report the molecular cloning of two mouse mannose-binding proteins designated A and C based on their close identity with their rat homologues.
 The deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse mannose-binding proteins, as with rat and the human forms, have an NH2 terminus that is rich in cysteine that stabilizes a collagen alpha helix followed by a carboxyl- terminal carbohydrate binding domain.
 We further show that the mouse mannose-binding protein A mRNA, as with the human, is induced like the acute phase reactant serum amyloid P protein, yet the expression of mouse mannose-binding protein C mRNA is not regulated above its low baseline level.
 The expression of both mannose-binding proteins A and C mRNA is restricted to the liver under basal and stress conditions.
