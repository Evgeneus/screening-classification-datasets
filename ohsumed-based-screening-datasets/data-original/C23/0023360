Increased glucose metabolism in the medulla of patients with palatal myoclonus.
 Hypertrophic degeneration of the inferior olivary nuclei is the pathologic substrate for palatal myoclonus, but the physiologic correlate of this finding is uncertain.
 Using the 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose and PET method, we determined the local cerebral metabolic rate of glucose utilization in seven patients with palatal myoclonus (following stroke or infection, or idiopathic), one patient with oculopalatal myoclonus (following a stroke affecting the brainstem), and nine normal subjects.
 The metabolism of glucose in the medulla of the patients with palatal myoclonus was significantly greater than that of the normal subjects.
 This may well have been due to increased metabolism of the inferior olivary nuclei.
 Glucose metabolism in the medulla of the patient with oculopalatal myoclonus was normal.
 These findings suggest that the inferior olivary nuclei, or a region of the brainstem encompassing the inferior olivary nuclei, are hypermetabolic in palatal myoclonus and may be the generators of the involuntary movements in palatal myoclonus.
