Cationic Yersinia antigen-induced chronic allergic arthritis in rats. A model for reactive arthritis in humans.
 Cationic antigens are known to have considerable arthritogenic potential in experimental systems.
 During a systematic search for suitable, naturally occurring candidates an intracellular protein was isolated from the ribosomal pellet of Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3, a bacterial strain associated with reactive arthritis in humans.
 The protein is highly cationic, contains two 19-kD polypeptide chains linked by a disulfide bond, and reveals a strong tendency for spontaneous aggregation.
 It is suggested to be a nucleic acid binding protein.
 We tested this antigen for its ability to induce arthritis after intra-articular challenge in preimmunized rats.
 An acute inflammatory phase followed by transition to chronicity was observed both by technetium-99m scintigraphy and from histology.
 Massive polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration of the synovium was seen early on and fibrosis and thickening of the joint capsule occurred in later stages.
 Control groups showed no evidence of inflammation.
 Western blot and ELISA analysis of unselected sera from Yersinia enterocolitica 0:3-infected patients revealed antibodies to the antigen in the majority of cases, whereas healthy individuals rarely reacted.
 This is the first report of a naturally occurring cationic antigen capable of inducing immunologic tissue injury; it justifies the speculation that cationic antigens from prokaryotic cells could trigger reactive arthritis in humans.
