Iatrogenic injuries of peripheral nerves.
 In this study, we discuss 68 cases in which peripheral nerve trunks were inadvertently divided by surgeons.
 Most of these accidents occurred in the course of planned operations.
 Delay in diagnosis and in effecting repair was common.
 We list the nerves particularly at risk and the operations in which special care is needed.
 We recommend steps to secure prompt diagnosis and early treatment.
