Clinical experience with the Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent.
 Complications that occurred in 247 patients who underwent successful elective stenting to native coronary arteries with the Palmaz-Schatz balloon expandable stent included subacute thrombosis in 7 patients (2.8%), myocardial infarction in 3 (1.2%), death 3 (1.2%), urgent bypass surgery in 4 (1.6%) and major bleeding events in 24 (9.7%).
 Angiographic restenosis occurred in 21 (20%) of 103 patients who received a single stent.
 Subgroup analysis, however, revealed that restenosis of a single stent occurred in 3 (7%) of 45 patients without prior angioplasty compared with 25 (27%) of 91 patients with prior angioplasty.
 Patients with "suboptimal" angioplasty results (dis-section) who received a single stent seemed to have a higher thrombosis rate perioperatively (4 [4%] of 98), but no higher incidence of restenosis (7 [15%] of 46) than that of the total group of patients who received a single stent.
 Coronary stenting may be a valuable adjunct to coronary angioplasty in carefully selected patients.
 Complication rates are similar to those of routine angioplasty; however, angiographic restenosis may be reduced in certain subsets of patients.
