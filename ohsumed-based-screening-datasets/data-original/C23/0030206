Eosinophilic cystitis in children.
 Eosinophilic cystitis is an uncommon inflammatory disorder of the urinary bladder which causes irritative voiding symptoms and may mimic rhabdomyosarcoma radiographically.
 In children, eosinophilic cystitis has been previously reported to be self-limiting and requires no specific therapy.
 Reported herein is a case of a nine-year-old girl in whom eosinophilic cystitis recurred following antireflux surgery, raising the question of an association of eosinophilic cystitis with local trauma such as bladder surgery.
 Consideration should be given to pretreatment with steroids and antihistamines prior to surgery in these patients.
