Classical conditioning of ventilatory responses in humans.
 A classical conditioning experiment, in which an auditory stimulus was paired with a hypoxic stimulus, was carried out on 34 normal subjects assigned to two groups (experimental and control).
 Each subject took part in one session divided into two phases, acquisition and test.
 In the acquisition phase, eight hypoxic and eight auditory stimuli were paired in the experimental group and unpaired in the control group.
 In the test phase, which was identical for the two groups, the hypoxic stimuli were suppressed and three purely auditory stimuli were presented.
 Significant differences between the two groups in ventilatory response to these auditory stimuli provided evidence for conditioning.
 In the control group, no significant changes were elicited by the auditory stimuli, whereas a conditioned increase in total cycle duration was observed in the experimental group.
 The conditioned response closely resembled the first component of the hypoxic response.
 Analysis of the pattern of the conditioned response, along with postexperimental interviews, strongly suggests that this response was not mediated by volitional factors.
