Endoscopic sphincterotomy: the whole truth.
 An 8 year experience of 602 patients (median age 76 years) referred for endoscopic management of common bile stones is reported.
 No patient referred for treatment has been excluded.
 A diagnostic cholangiogram was achieved in 94 per cent and sphincterotomy was accomplished in 91.5 per cent.
 The bile ducts were demonstrated to be completely cleared of stones in 491 (81.6 per cent) of 602 patients.
 A mean number of 1.9 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography examinations per patient were necessary to achieve this result.
 Complications of endoscopic sphincterotomy, which were strictly defined, occurred in 10.5 per cent of patients although five patients had two complications (total complication rate 11.3 per cent).
 The 30-day mortality rate was 2.2 per cent, seven of 13 deaths (1.2 per cent) occurring as a direct result of sphincterotomy.
 There have been statistically significant improvements in bile duct clearance and complication rates with increasing experience of endoscopists.
