Dexmedetomidine prevents epinephrine-induced arrhythmias through stimulation of central alpha 2 adrenoceptors in halothane-anesthetized dogs.
 Since alpha 2-adrenergic agonists have important effects on the adrenergic system that have recently been applied to the anesthetic setting, we investigated the effect of stimulation of alpha 2 adrenoceptors on epinephrine-induced arrhythmias in halothane-anesthetized dogs.
 The arrhythmogenic threshold for epinephrine was determined during halothane anesthesia in the presence of dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha 2 agonist, and L-medetomidine, a stereoisomer of medetomidine that lacks alpha 2-agonist activity.
 Dexmedetomidine increased the arrhythmogenic threshold for epinephrine in a dose-dependent manner during halothane anesthesia.
 At the highest dose of dexmedetomidine, 0.5 microgram.kg-1.min-1, there was a three-fold increase in both the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine and the plasma epinephrine concentration that was reached at this dose.
 On the other hand, L-medetomidine over the same dose range did not effect the arrhythmogenic dose of epinephrine.
 Atipamezole, a central alpha 2 antagonist that crossed the blood-brain barrier, blocked the antiarrhythmic action of dexmedetomidine.
 L-659,066 a peripheral alpha 2 antagonist that does not penetrate the blood-brain barrier, did not affect the antiarrhythmic action of dexmedetomidine.
 Thus, dexmedetomidine's antiarrhythmic effect on epinephrine-induced arrhythmias during halothane anesthesia appears to be mediated at least in part by stimulation of central alpha 2 adrenoceptors.
