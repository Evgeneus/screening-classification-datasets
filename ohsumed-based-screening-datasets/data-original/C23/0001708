Rectovulvar fistula in a child secondary to an unusual foreign body.
 Foreign bodies in the female genital tract are well recognized as a cause of pain, discharge, secretions, and infection.
 In the small child, the presence of a vaginal discharge is usually associated with either a common object which has been inserted or sexual abuse complicated by a sexually transmitted disease.
 A 3-year-old child presented with a recurrent labial secretion and drainage due to an unusual foreign body.
 It was only during a second operation that the possibility of a foreign body was entertained, and diagnostic testing was begun.
 A third operation permitted removal of the foreign body, a large bone probably of animal origin.
 The fistula tract was closed after a colostomy was performed.
 This represents the first reported case of a rectovulvar fistula not of a congenital nature.
