Differences in "primary response" gene expression in renal compensatory hypertrophy and hyperplasia.
 The induction of a family of primary response genes (ie, genes whose transcription is not dependent on new protein synthesis) occurs within minutes after stimulation of quiescent 3T3 cells by phorbol esters and growth factors.
 A similar pattern of gene expression is seen in PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells induced to differentiate by nerve growth factor (NGF), suggesting that a common set of activating signals occur in different forms of cell growth.
 To determine whether the same "activation" process occurs in renal hypertrophy, we measured mRNA levels in mice subjected to uninephrectomy (UNX) or sham operation.
 Regenerative renal hyperplasia was induced by intraperitoneal folic acid (FA) injection with vehicle as control.
 Northern blots showed induction of these genes by FA with elevated mRNA levels persisting for up to 24 to 48 hours.
 UNX and sham operation demonstrated a slight and transient elevation of mRNA levels, with a prompt return to basal levels by 60 minutes.
