A controlled study of caudal epidural injections of triamcinolone plus procaine for the management of intractable sciatica.
 The management of sciatica due to lumbar nerve root compromise remains controversial, probably because few well-controlled studies of conservative management have been performed.
 This preliminary study assesses the efficacy of epidural injections of 80 mg triamcinolone acetonide plus 0.5% procaine hydrochloride in saline, administered via the caudal route, in a double-blind, placebo controlled trial with 1 year follow-up.
 Twenty-three patients were entered into the study: 12 received treatment and 11 placebo.
 The active group showed significant pain relief (P = 0.02) and a significant increase in mobility (P = 0.01) at 4 weeks, which resulted in improved quality of life (P = 0.02).
 At 1 year, subjective and objective measures improved in both groups.
 The improvement was greater in the actively treated group, but only the objective assessment (straight leg raise) was statistically significant.
