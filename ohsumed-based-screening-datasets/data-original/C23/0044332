Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated, Canadian multicenter trial of topical edoxudine 3.0% cream in the treatment of recurrent genital herpes. Canadian Cooperative Study Group.
 Treatment for recurrent genital herpes using edoxudine 3% cream for 5 days was evaluated in 200 patients in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinic-initiated trial.
 Lesion tenderness was predictive of and more sensitive and longer-lasting than the symptom of pain.
 Among patients receiving placebo, times to crusting (P = .043), cessation of investigator-observed signs (P = .005), lesion-associated signs (P = .02), and groin signs (P = .05) were longer in women.
 Edoxudine reduced viral shedding in men (mean 2.7 vs.
 3.4 days, P = .009) and women (2.0 days vs.
 3.5 days, P = .0001).
 Loss of investigator-observed signs (4.4 vs.
 6.2 days, P = .002), investigator-observed lesion tenderness (P = .01), lesion signs (P = .02), groin adenopathy (P = .01), and tenderness (P = .01) occurred earlier in women taking edoxudine.
 Edoxudine was well-tolerated and reduced several signs of herpes in women.
 Its clinical role in recurrent genital herpes remains to be fully determined.
