Ten years of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: neurodevelopmental outcome.
 Cf the 87 survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation over a 10-year period, 67 participated in a follow-up study which included neurologic examination (n = 67), cognitive testing (n = 67), and audiologic assessment (n = 33).
 Matched control subjects for those older than 5 years were also evaluated.
 Outcome was defined as normal for cognitive scores greater than or equal to 85 and normal neurologic examination results, suspect for cognitive scores 70 through 84 or nonfocal neurologic findings such as hypertonia/hypotonia, and abnormal for cognitive scores less than 70 or abnormal neurologic examination results.
 Of the 10 school-aged children studied, 9 were normal and there were no differences in mean cognitive scores between subjects and controls (IQ subjects = 109 +/- 12 [SD], IQ controls = 107 +/- 13).
 For preschoolers aged 2.7 through 4.11 years, the mean cognitive score was 91 +/- 11 and 7 (70%) were normal.
 For infants 6 through 30 months, the mean cognitive score was 101 +/- 22 and 27 (57%) were normal.
 A total of 7 children (21% of those studied) had abnormal audiologic assessments.
 Three children demonstrated mild high-frequency and 4 moderately severe high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss which was bilateral in 3 and of undetermined laterality in 1.
 Abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was significantly associated with cerebral infarction and chronic lung disease.
 Outcome was not related to demographic or perinatal variables, illness severity prior to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or underlying diagnosis.
 Neurodevelopmental outcome among survivors of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in this series is consistent with previous reports of morbidity among neonates with severe respiratory failure treated conventionally.
