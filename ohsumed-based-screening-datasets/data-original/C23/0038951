Respiratory symptoms in Indian women using domestic cooking fuels.
 The effect of domestic cooking fuels producing various respiratory symptoms was studied in 3,701 women.
 Of these, 3,608 were nonsmoking women who used four different types of cooking fuels: biomass, LPG, kerosene, and mixed fuels.
 The overall respiratory symptoms were observed in 13 percent of patients.
 Mixed fuel users experienced more respiratory symptoms (16.7 percent), followed by biomass (12.6 percent), stove (11.4 percent), and LPG (9.9 percent).
 Chronic bronchitis in chulla users was significantly higher than that in kerosene and LPG users (p less than 0.05).
 Dyspnea and postnasal drip were significantly higher in the women using mixed fuels.
 Smoking women who are also exposed to cooking fuels experienced respiratory symptoms more often than nonsmokers (33.3 percent vs 13 percent).
