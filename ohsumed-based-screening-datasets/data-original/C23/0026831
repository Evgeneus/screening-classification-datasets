Inflammatory properties of neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8) in human skin: a light- and electronmicroscopic study.
 Neutrophil-activating protein-1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8), purified to homogeneity from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human peripheral blood monocytes, was injected intracutaneously into human skin.
 Sequential biopsy specimens were taken in order to investigate the sequence of ultrastructural changes induced by the cytokine.
 Whereas intracutaneous injection of 100 ng of NAP-1/IL-8 per site caused no macroscopic changes, by histology infiltration with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) and monocytes was present within 1 h and increased at 3 and 5 h.
 No lymphocyte infiltration was noted.
 The first ultrastructural changes (30 min) consisted of the presence of cytoplasmic 7-nm microfilament bundles, as well as numerous protrusions of the luminal plasma membrane of endothelial cells (EC).
 As a striking feature, multiple 100- to 160-nm electron lucent vesicles could be observed in the EC cytoplasm.
 These structures differed from plasmalemmal vesicles and suggest secretory activity.
 When PMN and monocytes appeared in the vascular lumen (1 h and later), the number of 100-160-nm electron-lucent vesicles had decreased significantly.
 In contrast to C5a-injected skin sites, mast cell degranulation was absent.
