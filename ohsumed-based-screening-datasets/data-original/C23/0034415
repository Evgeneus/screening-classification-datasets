Genital human papillomavirus infection in men. Diagnosis and treatment with a laser and 5-fluorouracil.
 One hundred twenty-eight consecutive men, sexual partners (for more than six months) of women treated for genital condylomata acuminata, were evaluated with colposcopy to assess the percentage of infected men among the couples.
 Ninety-three (73%) of the men were found to have a genital human papillomavirus infection on colposcopically directed biopsies.
 All but one patient were treated with outpatient colposcopically guided laser vaporization under local anesthesia (one patient with extensive condylomata required general anesthesia).
 Two weeks after laser surgery, 5% 5-fluorouracil cream, used in the genital area, was initiated on a weekly basis for two months and every other week for two more months.
 Patients were followed in the clinic with colposcopy performed every eight weeks for six months to evaluate the regimen's results.
 Thirty-seven (40%) of the 93 men had "clinically" apparent genital HPV infection, and 56 (60%) of the 93 had "subclinical" disease (as determined with colposcopy).
 The majority of the patients (87 of 93, or 94%) responded to one laser treatment followed by 5-fluorouracil cream and had no visible lesions at six months.
 Colposcopic evaluation of the male partners of infected women and laser surgery followed by topical 5-fluorouracil therapy appear to be safe and effective in controlling genital HPV infection.
