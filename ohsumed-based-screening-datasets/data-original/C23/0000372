Kinin/prostaglandin system: its therapeutic value in surgical stress.
 Multiple system organ failure as a consequence of injury or sepsis remains the major reason for death in critically ill patients.
 One of the treatment concepts that has recently attracted clinical attention is the administration of kinins and prostaglandins (PGs).
 On the basis of experimental data, there is reason to believe that these compounds may have the potential to manipulate favorably certain processes and mechanisms (such as inflammatory or ischemic reactions) thought to be important in the pathophysiology of surgical stress.
 However, thus far, information on those effects in humans is still scarce.
 On the other hand, administration of kinins and PGs is technically possible and can be performed safely, even in intensive care patients.
 Therefore, different techniques, effects, and side-effects of kinin/PG therapy deserve clinical testing.
 It remains to be seen whether this concept will be useful in the treatment of critically ill surgical patients.
