Attenuated carotid body hypoxic sensitivity after prolonged hypoxic exposure.
 Prolonged exposure to hypoxia is accompanied by decreased hypoxic ventilatory response (HVR), but the relative importance of peripheral and central mechanisms of this hypoxic desensitization remain unclear.
 To determine whether the hypoxic sensitivity of peripheral chemoreceptors decreases during chronic hypoxia, we measured ventilatory and carotid sinus nerve (CSN) responses to isocapnic hypoxia in five cats exposed to simulated altitude of 5,500 m (barometric pressure 375 Torr) for 3-4 wk.
 Exposure to 3-4 wk of hypobaric hypoxia produced a decrease in HVR, measured as the shape parameter A in cats both awake (from 53.9 +/- 10.1 to 14.8 +/- 1.8; P less than 0.05) and anesthetized (from 50.2 +/- 8.2 to 8.5 +/- 1.8; P less than 0.05).
 Sustained hypoxic exposure decreased end-tidal CO2 tension (PETCO2, 33.3 +/- 1.2 to 28.1 +/- 1.3 Torr) during room-air breathing in awake cats.
 To determine whether hypocapnia contributed to the observed depression in HVR, we also measured eucapnic HVR (PETCO2 33.3 +/- 0.9 Torr) and found that HVR after hypoxic exposure remained lower than preexposed value (A = 17.4 +/- 4.2 vs.
 53.9 +/- 10.1 in awake cats; P less than 0.05).
 A control group (n = 5) was selected for hypoxic ventilatory response matched to the baseline measurements of the experimental group.
 The decreased HVR after hypoxic exposure was associated with a parallel decrease in the carotid body response to hypoxia (A = 20.6 +/- 4.8) compared with that of control cats (A = 46.9 +/- 6.3; P less than 0.05).
