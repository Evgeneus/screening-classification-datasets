The surgical management of chronic parotitis.
 Chronic parotitis is a disorder characterized by recurrent painful swelling of the gland with purulent sialorrhea.
 Occasionally, the condition fails to respond to medical management and definitive surgical therapy is necessary.
 Sialolithiasis is the usual etiology in cases of parotitis, although occasionally severe recurrent parotid infections are superimposed on underlying Sjogren's disease.
 Total parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection has been used in such cases in our department and has proved to be an excellent way to manage this disease.
 A summary of our results indicate that the recurring infections were eradicated and that the complication rate is tolerable, considering the magnitude of the problem.
 We feel that it is better to use surgical management early rather than wait for the formation of fistulae or abscesses.
