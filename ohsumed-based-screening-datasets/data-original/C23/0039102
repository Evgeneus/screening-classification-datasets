Competitive control of myosin expression: hypertrophy vs. hyperthyroidism.
 The competition between two opposing influences on the phenotypic expression of skeletal muscle myosin were studied to determine which was the dominant regulator.
 Experimental hyperthyroidism, which induces fast myosin expression, was produced by subcutaneous implantation of a 40-day constant-time-release triiodothyronine pellet.
 Compensatory hypertrophy, which induces slow myosin expression, was produced by surgical removal of a synergistic hindlimb muscle.
 Hyperthyroidism increased the percentage of type II fibers and the fast myosin isoforms in both the plantaris and soleus muscles.
 Hypertrophy significantly increased the percentage of type I fibers and the slow myosin type in the plantaris and soleus muscles.
 However, with the simultaneous introduction of hyperthyroidism and hypertrophy, only the hyperthyroid effects were observed.
 Hyperthyroidism and not physiological demand was found to be the dominant regulator of skeletal muscle myosin expression.
