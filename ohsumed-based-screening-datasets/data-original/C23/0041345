The ileal neobladder.
 The ileal neobladder in many respects approximates the theoretically ideal continent urinary diversion.
 The technique, while more technically demanding than the performance of the standard ileal loop diversion, is not difficult, particularly for surgeons used to performing radical retropubic prostatectomies.
 The ileal neobladder appears to approximate most closely the optimal bladder substitution.
 Although currently feasible only in males, future considerations could conceivably involve urologists working with their colleagues in gynecology and colorectal surgery to extend the benefits of bladder substitution using the ileal neobladder to selected patients having cystectomy for associated gynecologic or colorectal malignancies.
