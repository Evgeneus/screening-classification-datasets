Electronic weaponry--a question of safety [published erratum appears in Ann Emerg Med 1991 Sep;20(9):1031]
 Electronic weapons represent a new class of weapon available to law enforcement and the lay public.
 Although these weapons have been available for several years, there is inadequate research to document their safety or efficacy.
 Two of the most common, the TASER and the stun gun, are reviewed.
 The electronic weapon was initially and still is approved by the US Consumer Product Safety Commission; its approval was based on theoretical calculations of the physical effects of damped sinusoidal pulses, not on the basis of animal or human studies.
 These devices are widely available and heavily promoted, despite limited research into their safety or efficiency and despite recent animal studies documenting their potential for lethality.
