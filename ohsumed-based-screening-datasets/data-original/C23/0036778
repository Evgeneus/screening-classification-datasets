IgM-associated primary diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis: natural history and prognostic indicators.
 Fifty-four adults with primary mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis and IgM deposition were observed for a minimum of three years or until end-stage renal failure.
 The actuarial renal survival was 80 per cent at 5 years and 64 per cent at 10 years; multivariate analysis identified microscopic haematuria, extent of mesangial proliferation and global glomerular sclerosis as independent prognostic indicators.
