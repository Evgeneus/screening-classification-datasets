A prospective evaluation of arterial intimal injuries in an experimental model.
 The management of arterial intimal defects remains controversial because of uncertainty concerning their natural history.
 We developed an experimental canine model to prospectively evaluate posterior wall intimal flaps in the superficial femoral artery.
 Arterial intimal flaps were constructed in 20 anesthetized dogs (40 arteries) and evaluated by arteriography, and angioscopy, and intravascular ultrasound.
 Postoperative patency rates at 1 (n = 20) and 3 weeks (n = 20) were compared with a control group of ten animals (n = 20, arteriotomy without intimal flap).
 Acute thromboses occurred in five experimental arteries with thromboses of eight additional experimental arteries at followup.
 Control patency was 100%, while experimental group patencies were 75% (p less than 0.05) at 1 week and 60% (p less than 0.009) at 3 weeks.
 All thrombosed arteries had intimal flaps with greater than 75% luminal stenosis.
 We conclude that intimal injuries cause arterial thromboses acutely and during subsequent followup.
 Intimal flaps with stenosis greater than 75% as determined arteriographically are at greatest risk for thrombosis.
 Angioscopy and intravascular ultrasound characterize arterial intimal defects and may delineate injuries requiring surgical or endovascular repair.
