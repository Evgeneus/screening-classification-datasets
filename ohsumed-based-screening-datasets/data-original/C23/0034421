Liesegang rings developing within intraperitoneal endometriotic implants. A case report.
 Liesegang rings are acellular, laminated structures that have been reported to accompany a variety of necrotizing and hemorrhagic tissue processes.
 Although most frequently seen in the kidneys and synovium, they can be present in other tissues.
 Liesegang rings are of importance because they are frequently confused by pathologists with helminth ova and nematodes, which they resemble.
 A case of Liesegang rings was associated with intraperitoneal endometriotic implants, with which the rings appeared to have originated.
