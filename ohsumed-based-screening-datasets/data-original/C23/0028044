Malignant biliary obstruction: percutaneous use of self-expandable stents 
 A total of 83 self-expandable metallic stents were placed percutaneously in 69 patients for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction.
 Stent diameter was 1 cm; length, 3.5-10.5 cm.
 Of the 41 patients with common bile duct obstruction, 27 died 0.2-12 months (median, 3.2 months) after stent insertion.
 Two patients developed recurrent jaundice and cholangitis after 6 and 12 months, respectively.
 One patient underwent reintervention.
 Fourteen patients were alive without jaundice 1-8 months (median, 6.3 months) after stent placement.
 Of the 28 patients with hilar lesions, 13 died 0.7-7.6 months (median, 4.3 months) after stent placement.
 Fifteen were alive 1-15.5 months (median, 8.1 months) afterward.
 Recurrent jaundice and cholangitis were seen in eight of the 28 patients (28%) after 1-6 months (median, 3.6 months).
 The cause of malfunction of the stent(s) was tumor ingrowth in one patient, tumor overgrowth at the proximal end in five patients, and overgrowth at the distal end in two patients.
 Reintervention was performed in five patients (18%).
 Stent-related complications were seen in four patients.
