The effect of sodium hyaluronate on the outcome of trabeculectomy.
 The outcome of trabeculectomy with the use of sodium hyaluronate was investigated in 99 trabeculectomies and compared with the results achieved in an earlier series of trabeculectomies without the use of sodium hyaluronate.
 The use of sodium hyaluronate facilitated performance of the surgery and tended to reduce the severity of postoperative shallow anterior chamber and intraoperative bleeding.
 It remains to be shown whether it also may prevent lens opacity increase.
