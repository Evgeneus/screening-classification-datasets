Survivorship analysis and confidence intervals. An assessment with reference to the Stanmore total knee replacement.
 Survivorship analysis is a useful way of expressing the long-term results of joint replacement: it provides a means of comparing the life span of one type of prosthesis with another.
 However, such studies should include a full life-table and the confidence intervals for the survival rates at given times.
 At least 40 surviving prostheses are required to provide reliable results.
