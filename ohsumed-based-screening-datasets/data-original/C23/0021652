Clonal deletion of V beta 14-bearing T cells in mice transgenic for mammary tumour virus.
 Autoreactive T lymphocytes are clonally deleted during maturation in the thymus.
 Deletion of T cells expressing particular receptor V beta elements is controlled by poorly defined autosomal dominant genes.
 A gene has now been identified by expression of transgenes in mice which causes deletion of V beta 14+ T cells.
 The gene lies in the open reading frame of the long terminal repeat of the mouse mammary tumour virus.
