Transantral sphenoethmoidectomy: a procedure for the 1990s?
 Currently, among otolaryngologists, much attention is focused on the surgical management of paranasal sinus disease.
 However, transantral sphenoethmoidectomy is rarely mentioned in the literature of the past several decades.
 We reviewed a consecutive series of 98 patients over a 12-year period who underwent transantral sphenoethmoidectomy in the treatment of severe chronic hyperplastic pansinusitis.
 The major and minor complications encountered are tabulated, as are the clinical outcomes.
 A description of the operative technique is followed by a discussion of the indications for this approach.
 We believe transantral sphenoethmoidectomy has a useful place in modern paranasal sinus surgery.
