Analysis of the two-team approach to anterior spinal fusion.
 An anterior approach to the spine via a thoracoabdominal incision offers the surgeon many advantages.
 The major vascular structures are visualized, stabilization of a long segment of the spine is strong, and recovery is speedy.
 Nevertheless, this is a major operation and one with potential morbidity and mortality.
 At Children's Hospital of New Orleans, the Pediatric Surgery and Pediatric Orthopedic Surgery Services work together to reduce these risks and in so doing maintain an acceptable morbidity.
 With this two-team approach; we operated on the spines of 39 patients between 1978 and 1988.
 The most common indications for operation included idiopathic scoliosis, neuromuscular disease, and congenital abnormalities.
 A thoracoabdominal approach was used in 32 patients, a thoracic approach in four patients, and an abdominal approach in three patients.
 Twenty-nine patients experienced 65 complications; 45 of these complications were respiratory in nature.
 There were no postoperative deaths.
 Factors unrelated to the incidence of postoperative complications included age, volume of crystalloid infused during operation, volume of blood replacement, and length of anesthesia.
