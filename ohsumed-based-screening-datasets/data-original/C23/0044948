Mesonephric rest hyperplasia. A potential diagnostic pitfall.
 A case of mesonephric rest hyperplasia, an incidental finding in the hysterectomy specimen of a 48-year-old woman, was initially misdiagnosed as a well-differentiated cervical adenocarcinoma.
 We highlight the histologic, histochemical, and immunohistochemical features of this potential diagnostic pitfall and review the relevant literature.
