A new look at postoperative instructions following cataract extraction.
 We sought to determine whether, given the decreasing rate of complications associated with cataract surgery and IOL implantation, postoperative restrictions placed on patients undergoing these procedures could be significantly and safely relaxed.
 We reviewed the charts of 216 patients who had undergone capsulorhexis or "can-opener" capsulotomy, phacoemulsification, and insertion of an oval IOL over a 3-year period, noting any operative or postoperative complications.
 All of these patients had been examined the day after surgery and, if no complications were noted, had been instructed only to refrain from activities that produced pain.
 No shield was required, and no instructions were given to restrict showering, hair washing, or any other normal physical activity.
 We found no complications related to any postoperative activity.
 These results suggest that current postoperative instructions typically restricting such patients' activities should be reevaluated.
