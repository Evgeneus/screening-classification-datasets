Metabolic aspects of protection by glycine against hypoxic injury to isolated proximal tubules.
 To clarify the roles of butyrate and acylglycine formation in hypoxic proximal tubule cell injury and protection by glycine and to test the contribution of iodoacetate-suppressible metabolism to protection, (1) it was determined whether protection by glycine is fully expressed when glucose, lactate, alanine, and butyrate are replaced by alpha-ketoglutarate as the sole substrate for the tubules, (2) butyrate metabolism and acylglycine formation were directly measured in control and hypoxic preparations, and (3) it was assessed whether injury produced by iodoacetate, a potent inhibitor of glycolytic metabolism, is subject to protection by glycine.
 Susceptibility to hypoxic injury in medium with alpha-ketoglutarate as the sole substrate was similar to that seen in medium containing glucose, lactate, alanine, and butyrate.
 Tubules in alpha-ketoglutarate medium showed high degrees of protection by glycine against injury produced by 30-min of hypoxia, by iodoacetate alone, and by iodoacetate combined with hypoxia.
 Protection did not require preservation of cell ATP or glutathione.
 In glucose-lactate-alanine-butyrate medium, butyrate, measured by gas chromatography, was rapidly metabolized by oxygenated tubules and fully accounted for basal rates of oxygen consumption.
 Butyrate utilization stopped during hypoxia.
 Neither aspect of butyrate metabolism was altered by glycine.
 Formation of acylglycines was assessed by gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy.
 In preparations treated with glycine, butyrylglycine was detected under both oxygenated and hypoxic conditions; the quantities, however, were small and no other acylglycines were found.
 These observations indicate that protective effects of glycine are independent of short-chain acylglycine formation and glycolytic metabolism.
