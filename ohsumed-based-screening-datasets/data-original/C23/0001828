Emergency intraosseous infusion in severely burned children.
 Severely burned patients require rapid administration of large volumes of isotonic fluids.
 Obtaining adequate intravenous (IV) access in children with greater than 70% total body surface area burns may be difficult, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible.
 This report describes the use of intraosseous infusion technique as a life-saving means of establishing IV access in two severely burned children.
