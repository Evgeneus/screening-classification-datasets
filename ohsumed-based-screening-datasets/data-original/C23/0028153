Ectopic pituitary adenoma in the suprasellar cistern: case report.
 The case of a 56-year-old man with an ectopic pituitary adenoma is reported.
 Neurological examinations, neurodiagnostic imaging, surgical observation, endocrinological evaluation, histological examination, and immunohistological study demonstrated evidence of ectopic prolactinoma in the suprasellar cistern and the presence of a normal pituitary in the sella turcica.
 The patient underwent total removal of the suprasellar mass by a pterional approach, leading to a surgical and endocrinological cure.
