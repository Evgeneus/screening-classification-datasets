Mastoid misery: quantifying the distress in a radical cavity.
 Seventy-eight mastoid cavities were studied in 39 patients who required revision surgery for troublesome symptoms.
 A retrospective questionnaire was used to assign a symptom score to each patient in his pre and post-operative condition.
 The 5 leading symptoms of pain, wax, discharge, smell and giddiness were reviewed.
 A score of 15 points represented the worst case and zero the best.
 The average improvement after surgery was 4.7 points.
 Hearing was not considered in this study.
