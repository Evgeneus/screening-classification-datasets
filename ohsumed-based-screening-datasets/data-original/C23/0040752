Results of surgery for duodenal ulcer: assessment by patients.
 A questionnaire was administered to 224 patients who had undergone 246 operations for duodenal ulcer to see how well this correlated with Visick grading and to provide insight into the patients' feelings about the results of their surgery.
 The patients were divided into three groups by Visick grade: good (grade I, n = 70), satisfactory (grades II and IIIs, n = 104) and poor (grades IIIu and IV, n = 72).
 The distribution of questionnaire responses in each group was statistically different (P less than 0.01).
 Dividing the questionnaire responses into three corresponding groups, 72 per cent of patients assigned themselves to the same group as their Visick grade.
 Three observations were made regarding the Visick system: recurrent ulceration is over-scored and should be included only if symptomatic; grading should acknowledge a wider range of symptoms related to ulcer disease and its treatment; only three grades are necessary.
