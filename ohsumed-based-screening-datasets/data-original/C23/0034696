Elective coronary artery bypass surgery without homologous blood transfusion. Early results with an inexpensive blood conservation program.
 Restriction of donor blood transfusions in cardiac surgery should reduce risks of infective contamination and antigenicity.
 We report a systemic, simple and inexpensive blood conservation program used for 121 consecutive patients who underwent elective coronary artery bypass surgery without need for homologous blood transfusion.
 The left internal mammary artery was grafted in all cases, in addition to saphenous vein grafts.
 Autologous, heparinized blood was removed intraoperatively, pre-bypass, and returned to the patient at conclusion of the extracorporeal circulation.
 The volume remaining in the oxygenator and the tubing set was returned without cell processing or hemofiltration.
 Using the hard-shell cardiotomy reservoir from the heart-lung machine, autotransfusion of the shed mediastinal blood was continued hourly up to 18 hours after surgery.
 The mean postoperative mediastinal bleeding was 551 +/- 206 ml, of which 505 +/- 218 ml was autotransfused.
 No re-exploration for bleeding was required and no homologous red-cell transfusions were given.
 Five patients each received 1-2 units of fresh frozen plasma because of prolonged bleeding time.
 Morbidity was low and mortality nil.
 At discharge the mean hemoglobin was 12.0 +/- 1.4 g/dl and the hematocrit 36.0 +/- 4.2%.
