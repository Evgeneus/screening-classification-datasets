Mouse platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene is deleted in W19H and patch mutations on chromosome 5.
 The mouse W19H mutation is an x-ray-induced deletion of more than 2 centimorgans on chromosome 5 encompassing the white spotting mutation W (encoded by the Kit protooncogene), patch (Ph), and recessive lethal (l) loci.
 The platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha gene (PDGFRA) like Kit encodes a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase.
 By using mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids and haplotype analysis in interspecific backcross mice, mouse Pdgfra was mapped to chromosome 5 in tight linkage with Kit.
 Hybridization of a PDGFRA probe to DNAs from W19H/ + heterozygous mice and patch heterozygous mice, and their wild-type littermates, demonstrated deletion of Pdgfra.
 Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis indicated that Kit and Pdgfra are linked on a 630-kilobase Mlu I DNA fragment.
 Thus the W19H deletion removes at least two receptor tyrosine kinases and the results suggest Pdgfra as a candidate for the Ph locus.
