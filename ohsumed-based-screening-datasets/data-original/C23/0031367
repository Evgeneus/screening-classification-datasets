Esophagocutaneous fistula after anterior cervical spine surgery and successful treatment using a sternocleidomastoid muscle flap. A case report.
 An esophagocutaneous fistula following anterior cervical fusion is rare.
 A 61-year-old man had cervical myelopathy because of ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine.
 Anterior decompression of the cervical spine and anterior fusion with strut bone grafting were performed.
 A second anterior fusion was done because the graft was dislodged after the patient fell out of bed one month after surgery.
 An esophagocutaneous fistula occurred three months after the second anterior surgery.
 One of the causes of this esophagocutaneous fistula was considered to be a pressure necrosis of the esophagus because of to projection of the bone graft.
 Conservative treatment, which consisted of wound drainage and intravenous administration of antibiotics, was tried but was unsuccessful.
 A good result was achieved by cancellous bone grafting, closure of the esophageal fistula, and transposition of a sternocleidomastoid muscle flap to the interspace between the esophagus and the cervical spine.
