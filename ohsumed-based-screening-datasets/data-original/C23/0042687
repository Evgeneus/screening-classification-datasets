Expiratory muscle fatigue in normal subjects.
 We examined expiratory muscle fatigue during expiratory resistive loading in 11 normal subjects.
 Subjects breathed against expiratory resistances at their own breathing frequency and tidal volume until exhaustion or for 60 min.
 Respiratory muscle strength was assessed from both the maximum static expiratory and inspiratory mouth pressures (PEmax and PImax).
 At the lowest resistance, PEmax and PImax measured after completion of the expiratory loaded breathing were not different from control values.
 With higher resistance, both PEmax and PImax were decreased (P less than 0.05), and the decrease lasted for greater than or equal to 60 min.
 The electromyogram high-to-low frequency power ratio for the rectus abdominis muscle decreased progressively during loading (P less than 0.01), but the integrated EMG activity did not change during recovery.
 Transdiaphragmatic pressure during loading was increased 3.6-fold compared with control (P less than 0.05).
 These findings suggest that expiratory resistive loaded breathing induces muscle fatigue in both expiratory and inspiratory muscles.
 Fatigue of the expiratory muscles can be attributed directly to the high work load and that of the inspiratory muscles may be related to increased work due to shortened inspiratory time.
