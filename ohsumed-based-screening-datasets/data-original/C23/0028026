Test-retest reliability of isokinetic knee extension and flexion torque measurements in persons with spastic hemiparesis.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the test-retest reliability of isokinetic torque measurements in the involved and uninvolved knee musculature of 20 subjects with spastic hemiparesis.
 An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure maximal voluntary knee extension and flexion at 60 degrees and 120 degrees/s.
 Peak torque (PT) and average peak torque (APT) data were collected from five repetitions on two separate occasions.
 Average peak torque was defined as the mean of the PT values obtained during each of the five repetitions.
 Spasticity was measured in the involved knee musculature prior to isokinetic testing using the Ashworth Scale.
 Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were high (greater than or equal to .90) for both knees for PT and APT at both angular velocities.
 No clinically meaningful differences were found between the Pearson correlation coefficients and the ICCs of the involved versus the uninvolved knee for any testing conditions.
 We concluded that isokinetic evaluation of torque, as measured by PT and APT in subjects with spastic hemiparesis, can yield reliable results in both extremities.
