Detection of Epstein-Barr virus sequences in Hodgkin's disease by the polymerase chain reaction.
 The authors examined paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsies from 65 cases of Hodgkin's disease for the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA, using the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction technique.
 Overall 40% of the cases were positive for EBV DNA; there were no statistically significant differences in the frequency of EBV positivity among the different subtypes of Hodgkin's disease.
 These results are in agreement with those of previous studies that employed less sensitive detection techniques and suggest that EBV either is present in pathologic tissues only in some phases of the evolution of Hodgkin's disease or is a pathogenetic factor involved in only a portion of cases.
