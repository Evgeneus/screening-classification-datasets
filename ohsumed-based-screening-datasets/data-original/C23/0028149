Magnetic resonance imaging of human spinal cord infarction.
 Magnetic resonance images obtained in two cases of spinal cord infarction are described: one with hemorrhagic thoracic cord infarct, the other with ischemic cervical cord infarct with sequential magnetic resonance imagings.
 An enlarged cord with strand-shape or longitudinal hypointensity on both T1- and T2-weighted images was noticed in the hemorrhagic infarct; hypointensity on the T2-weighted image was thought to be due to hemosiderin, which shortens T2 relaxation.
 In the ischemic infarct, a small, round area of hypointensity on T1-weighted images, and of hyperintensity on T2-weighted images, noted 9 hours postictus ("early infarct") changed on the 22nd day to a cephalocaudal strandlike hypointensity on T1-weighted image, which was enhanced by Gd-DTPA.
 The hypointensity suggested "pencil-like softening" in "medium" age infarct.
 On postictal day 49, it showed an extensive homogeneous hypointensity involving several segments of the cord on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images with negative Gd-DTPA enhancement suggesting "late transverse infarct." We considered that these changes are of value in diagnosing spinal cord infarcts on magnetic resonance imagings.
