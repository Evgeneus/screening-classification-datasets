Altered antigen receptor signaling in anergic T cells from self-tolerant T-cell receptor beta-chain transgenic mice.
 T-cell tolerance to the minor lymphocyte-stimulating antigen Mls-1a in a T-cell receptor (TcR) V beta 8.1 transgenic line of mice is maintained by both clonal deletion and clonal anergy.
 Approximately 20-50% of peripheral CD4+ (but not CD8+) T cells isolated from these mice are anergic and fail to proliferate following TcR ligation.
 We have examined key events in T-cell signaling in peripheral T cells isolated from these mice.
 In this report, we show that the anergic CD4+ T cells did not mobilize calcium or express receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2) following TcR ligation.
 However, the cells retained viability and functional potential because stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin bypassed the block in receptor-mediated signaling and induced IL-2 receptor expression and proliferation of the anergic cells.
