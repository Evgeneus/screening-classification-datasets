Appendicitis: prospective evaluation with high-resolution CT.
 Computed tomography (CT) was used to prospectively evaluate 100 patients with clinical indications for acute appendicitis.
 Examinations were performed with the terminal ileum and cecum filled with contrast material.
 Acute appendicitis was diagnosed when an abnormal appendix or inflammatory changes plus an appendicolith were detected.
 Failure to visualize an abnormal appendix or appendicolith in the presence of pericecal inflammatory changes was considered suspicious but nonspecific.
 CT results were correlated with surgical and pathologic results (74 patients) and other radiologic and clinical findings (26 patients).
 CT helped to diagnose appendicitis (64 patients) and nonspecific right lower quadrant inflammation (five patients) and to rule out appendicitis (31 patients).
 CT had a 98% sensitivity, an 83% specificity, and a 93% accuracy.
 In 17 of 31 patients without CT evidence of appendicitis, other conditions explaining their symptoms were detected.
 When the clinical diagnosis is in doubt, CT can be used successfully to evaluate patients with acute appendicitis.
