Diagnosis of genetic disease by primer-specified restriction map modification, with application to cystic fibrosis and retinitis pigmentosa 
 Detection of small alterations or abnormalities in genomic DNA (eg, point mutations or small deletions) has become increasingly important in the diagnosis of genetic disease and polymorphism.
 When a mutation or polymorphism creates a new restriction endonuclease site, it can easily be identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the DNA region of interest, followed by digestion with the restriction endonuclease.
 However, useful restriction sites are the exception, and a variety of specialised techniques have been developed to identify subtle DNA abnormalities.
 We have shown that where a DNA mutation does not create a useful novel restriction site, such a site can be introduced by PCR and specially chosen primers.
 The approach is simple and inexpensive and should be broadly applicable in the diagnosis of genetic polymorphism and mutation.
 The technique is illustrated here by the three base-pair deletion responsible for most cases of cystic fibrosis and by detection of the point mutation in the rhodopsin gene that has been associated with some cases of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa.
