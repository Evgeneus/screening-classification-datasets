Rupture of atheromatous plaque as a cause of thrombotic occlusion of stenotic internal carotid artery.
 We analyzed the clinical profiles and autopsy findings of five patients who died shortly after developing cerebral infarction following thrombotic occlusion of the internal carotid artery.
 In all five cases, thrombotic occlusion was caused by rupture of the fibrous lining over the gruel of atheroma at the origin of the internal carotid artery showing tight stenosis of the lumen.
 The mean +/- SD shorter diameter of the lumen at the site of occlusion was 1.5 +/- 0.4 mm.
 Our results show that an internal carotid artery with tight stenosis of the lumen by atheroma containing gruel harbors a risk of thrombotic occlusion, which may give rise to cerebral infarction by artery-to-artery embolism or by reduced cerebral perfusion.
