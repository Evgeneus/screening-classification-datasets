Linear lupus erythematosus profundus in a child.
 A 9-year-old Japanese boy had a 6-year history of a linear eruption of the left leg.
 It was characterized histopathologically by an intense lymphocytic panniculitis, perivascular and periappendageal infiltrates of lymphocytes, and vacuolization of the basal cell layer.
 This case represents a clinical presentation of linear lupus erythematosus profundus not previously reported.
