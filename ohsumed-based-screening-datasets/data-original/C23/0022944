Outpatient microsurgical reversal of tubal sterilization by a combined approach of laparoscopy and minilaparotomy.
 A prospective study of 17 cases of microsurgical reversal of tubal sterilization by a combined approach of laparoscopy and minilaparotomy was performed.
 Inclusion criteria included age less than 43; weight less than ideal body weight plus 20%; documentation of ovulation; 2 cm of proximal oviduct on hysterosalpingography; and a normal semen analysis or postcoital test.
 A comparison group of the 5 cases of sterilization reversal performed by a standard inpatient technique during the same period was analyzed.
 The study technique was performed on an outpatient basis in 15 of the 17 cases, 12 patients (71%) conceived 13 intrauterine pregnancies, one ectopic pregnancy occurred, and total patient costs and time until return to work were significantly less with the study versus standard technique.
