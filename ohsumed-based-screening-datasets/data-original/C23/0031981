Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in a patient with a cadaveric dural graft.
 We report a 26-year-old woman with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) who had received cadaveric dural material 33 months before the onset of neurologic symptoms.
 This is the fourth case in which a dural graft was the putative source of the CJD agent.
 All four cases had the grafting before changes in the sterilization procedure adopted in 1987 to inactivate the CJD agent.
