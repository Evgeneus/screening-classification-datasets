Acute L-thyroxine overdose; therapy with sodium ipodate: evaluation of clinical and physiologic parameters.
 Two children with acute L-thyroxine overdose were treated with sodium ipodate, an oral cholecystographic agent.
 Initial thyroxine (T4) levels were elevated to 98.5 mcg/dL and 134.1 mcg/dL, with associated triiodothyroxine (T3) levels of 354 ng/dL and 402 ng/dL.
 T3 levels increased to a maximum of 662 ng/dL and 468 ng/dL.
 With administration of sodium ipodate, the T3 decreased with a simultaneous increase of rT3 level.
 Sodium ipodate effect lasted 72 hours.
 No toxic effect was noted.
 Interestingly, thyroid hormone levels correlated with systolic blood pressure but with no other physiologic parameter.
 Sodium ipodate appears to be a viable treatment modality for acute thyroid overdose in children.
