A phase II evaluation of menogaril in cisplatin-refractory advanced ovarian carcinoma. A collaborative trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group and the Mayo Clinic.
 Forty-one women with advanced, recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma (in whom prior chemotherapy with a platinum-based regimen failed) were treated with menogaril 200 mg/m2 intravenously every 4 weeks in a Phase II trial.
 Partial responses were seen in two of 19 (10.5%) measurable disease patients and three of 12 (25%) nonmeasurable but evaluable patients, an overall objective response rate of 16.1% (95% confidence interval, 5% to 34%).
 Median time to progression for all patients was 2 months and median survival, 5 months.
 Toxicities were acceptable and consisted primarily of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity.
 Twenty-nine percent of the patients had venous irritation or painful phlebitis at the intravenous injection site.
 Menogaril, as administered in this protocol, had modest antineoplastic activity in previously treated ovarian carcinoma patients.
 The responses were of short duration, and there appeared to be no survival advantage with menogaril treatment.
