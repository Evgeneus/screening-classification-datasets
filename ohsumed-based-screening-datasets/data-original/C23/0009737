Total hip arthroplasty with cement. A long-term radiographic analysis in patients who are older than fifty and younger than fifty years.
 The long-term performance of a total of 712 Charnley and STH prostheses was evaluated as a function of the patient's age (older than fifty years or younger than fifty years) and of the underlying disease (osteoarthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or avascular necrosis).
 In patients who were older than fifty years, there were lower incidences of continuous cement-bone radiolucency about the acetabular component (p = 0.04), wear of the polyethylene acetabular cup (p = 0.03), and resorption of the calcar (p = 0.03).
 However, larger percentages of younger patients had rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis.
 In the cohort of patients who had osteoarthrosis, the performance of the prosthesis did not differ significantly between older and younger patients; therefore we attributed the differences that were observed to the disease--that is, to rheumatoid arthritis or avascular necrosis.
