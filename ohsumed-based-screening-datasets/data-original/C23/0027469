Acquired perforating dermatosis. Transepidermal elimination of DNA material and possible role of leukocytes in pathogenesis.
 A patient had acquired perforating dermatosis and suffered from renal disease, diabetes mellitus, and lupus vulgaris.
 Histologic and immunohistochemical studies revealed that the bulk of the coarse granular basophilic material being extruded by transepidermal elimination was of nuclear origin obviously derived from polymorphonuclear leukocytes that were particularly abundant in an early, nonperforated lesion.
 At the lower boundary of the material being eliminated transepidermally, leukocytes were seen to accumulate, to undergo pyknosis and karyorrhexis, and to transform into nuclear debris.
 As a minor component, the material contained collagen fibers with altered staining qualities and, in an early lesion, elastic fibers.
 We speculate that accumulation, disintegration, and enzyme release from polymorphonuclear leukocytes may represent an important, hitherto disregarded driving force in transepidermal elimination.
 Lysosomal enzymes may later be responsible for the alteration of staining properties in collagen fibers, the degradation of elastic fibers, and for opening up the transepidermal route by impairing intercellular keratinocyte cohesion.
