Toxic effects of cisplatin alone and in combination with gentamicin in stria vascularis of guinea pigs.
 The toxic effects on the stria vascularis of treatment with cisplatin alone and combined with the aminoglycoside antibiotic, gentamicin, were studied in guinea pigs.
 The toxicity induced in albino and pigmented guinea pigs was investigated morphologically with light and transmission electron microscopy, and functionally by brainstem-evoked response audiometry.
 The results of hearing thresholds were variable, ranging from no change in one ear in some of the animals to a hearing loss of 20 dB in one or both ears when treated with low-dose cisplatin alone or in combination with gentamicin.
 Bilateral deafness resulted from high-dose cisplatin combined with gentamicin.
 The combined treatment produced prominent structural damage in the stria vascularis.
 The results should be considered when aminoglycoside therapy is required in conjunction with cisplatin.
