Traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm: a case report.
 A case of traumatic carotid-cavernous sinus fistula (CCF) associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is reported.
 A 42-year-old man developed traumatic CCF after severe head trauma.
 Cerebral angiography demonstrated a direct CCF associated with an intradural pseudoaneurysm at the C2 portion.
 Transarterial balloon embolization of the CCF caused severe subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 A CCF with an intradural pseudoaneurysm is life-threatening and requires emergency treatment.
 However, balloon occlusion in such cases is contraindicated because of possible rupture of a pseudoaneurysm.
 Trapping or a direct surgical approach is the treatment of choice.
