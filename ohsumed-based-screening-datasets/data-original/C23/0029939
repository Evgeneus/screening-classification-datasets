Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone alters the hypothalamic effects of morphine in the rat.
 Female rats exhibit a generalized refractoriness to opiate stimulation during periods of steroid-induced LH secretion.
 In the present study we evaluated that role of LHRH in this steroid-induced effect on opiate-responsiveness.
 Central administration to ovariectomized rats of native LHRH or the LHRH agonist [Des-Gly10]LHRH ethylamide causes a dose-dependent refractoriness to the hypothermic effects of morphine.
 The potency relationship of these two LHRH agonists in antagonizing morphine's effect was consistent with their potency in inducing LH release.
 Treatment of ovariectomized rats with estradiol benzoate and progesterone in a regimen which induces a preovulatory-like LH surge, antagonized morphine-induced hypothermia, and the LHRH antagonist [D-Phe2, Pro3, D-Phe6] LHRH, reversed the effects of the gonadal steroids.
 These results indicate that the LHRH secretory dynamics associated with the preovulatory surge of LH may serve to modulate opiate responsiveness and thereby could serve to couple behavioral, sensory, and autonomic events with this neuroendocrine response to gonadal steroids.
