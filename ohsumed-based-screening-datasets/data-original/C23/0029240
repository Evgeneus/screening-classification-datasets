Treatment of acute migraine with subcutaneous sumatriptan.
 Sumatriptan succinate, a 5-HT1D receptor agonist, constricts human cranial arteries.
 Two parallel-group trials for treatment of acute migraines were conducted in the United States.
 Adult patients were randomized and given either 6 mg of sumatriptan succinate subcutaneously (n = 734) or placebo (n = 370).
 At 1 hour, sumatriptan was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing moderate or severe headache pain to mild or no pain (70% vs 22%), in completely relieving headaches (49% vs 9%), and in improving clinical disability (76% vs 34%).
 Sumatriptan also reduced nausea and photophobia significantly better than placebo.
 Patients with residual migraines received another injection; those who had originally received sumatriptan received either a second active injection (n = 187) or placebo (n = 178), while those who had received placebo received a second placebo injection (n = 335).
 Statistical evidence for benefit of second sumatriptan injection is absent.
 Adverse events associated with sumatriptan were tingling, dizziness, warm-hot sensations, and injection-site reactions.
 Sumatriptan is effective and well tolerated in patients with acute migraine.
