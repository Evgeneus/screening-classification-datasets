Late follow-up after repair of left ventricular aneurysm and (usually) associated coronary bypass grafting.
 This study assesses clinical and operative data (LV) aneurysm was repaired to determine factors that might predict in-hospital and long-term outcome.
 Long-term follow-up study was obtained in 296 of 298 patients undergoing LV aneurysm repair with or without coronary artery bypass grafting between 1974 and 1986.
 No patient had sustained a myocardial infarction within 2 weeks of surgery or was undergoing other concurrent cardiac surgery.
 The average age of the study patients was 57 +/- 9 years and the average ejection fraction was 35 +/- 13%.
 Ninety percent of the patients underwent concurrent bypass grafting, with an average of 2.2 +/- 1.3 grafts placed.
 Fourteen (5%) patients died in the hospital, with most deaths attributable to LV dysfunction.
 Advanced age and less extensive revascularization were correlates of in-hospital mortality.
 The 10-year survival was 57%, myocardial infarction-free survival 43%, and freedom from death, myocardial infarction and reoperative coronary surgery 41%.
 Advanced age, systemic hypertension, significant left main coronary artery narrowing and emergent operative status were multivariate correlates of long-term mortality.
 A low-risk population was defined by the absence of these risk factors, and high-risk by the presence of greater than or equal to 1 risk factors.
 The 10-year survival was 71% in the low-risk and 41% in the high-risk groups (p = .0006).
 The 10-year myocardial infarction free survival was 55% in the low-risk and 31% in the high-risk groups (p = 0.0017).
 LV aneurysm repair may be performed with acceptable in-hospital mortality, and the long-term risk may be stratified.
