Salicylate poisoning from enteric-coated aspirin. Delayed absorption may complicate management.
 Acute salicylate poisoning with enteric-coated aspirin may result from accidental ingestion, a suicide attempt, or a complication of long-term therapy.
 Because absorption of enteric-coated aspirin is delayed, use of the Done nomogram to determine toxicity may lead to underestimating the severity of the poisoning.
 Treatment options include induction of emesis or diuresis, gastric lavage, administration of activated charcoal, and surgery.
