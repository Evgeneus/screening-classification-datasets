Differential protective effects of halothane and isoflurane against hypoxic and reoxygenation injury in the isolated guinea pig heart.
 The authors investigated the effects of halothane (HAL) and isoflurane (ISO) on cardiac depression produced by global hypoxia and the recovery of function following reoxygenation is isolated guinea pig hearts perfused with Krebs' solution at constant pressure.
 Isovolumetric left ventricular systolic (LVSP) and end-diastolic pressures (LVEDP) were measured by placing a saline filled, latex balloon into the left ventricle.
 Bipolar electrodes were placed in the right atrium and right ventricle for measurements of heart rate (HR), atrioventricular conduction time (AVCT), and determination of the incidence and severity of dysrhythmias occurring during hypoxia and reoxygenation.
 Hearts were divided into three groups: control (n = 20), halothane (n = 12), and isoflurane (n = 13).
 All hearts were exposed in sequence to oxygenated perfusate (PO2, 530 mmHg), moderately hypoxic perfusate (PO2, 91 mmHg) for 30 min, and then to oxygenated perfusate for 40 min.
 Halothane (1%, 0.4 mM) or isoflurane (1.5%, 0.5 mM) were administered 10 min before hypoxia, during hypoxia, and during the first 10 min of reoxygenation.
 Exposure to halothane and isoflurane before hypoxia produced a 14 and 11% decrease in heart rate, a 32 and 23% increase in AVCT, and a 47 and 28% decrease in LVSP (all P less than or equal to 0.001) for halothane and isoflurane, respectively, and no significant change in LVEDP.
 During hypoxia, HR decreased and AVCT increased similarly in both groups.
 Left ventricular systolic pressure (LVSP) decreased sharply with a narrowing of the prehypoxic differences among the groups.
 In the control and isoflurane groups, LVEDP increased during hypoxia but remained unchanged in the halothane group.
