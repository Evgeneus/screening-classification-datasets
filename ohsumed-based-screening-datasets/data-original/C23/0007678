Intrahepatic cholestasis due to hypersensitivity reaction to procainamide.
 Hypersensitivity reactions to procainamide involving liver dysfunction are rare.
 We describe a patient who developed liver dysfunction after procainamide administration, manifested by fever, jaundice, elevated bilirubin concentration, and alkaline phosphatase concentration.
 Hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated good hepatic uptake of the radionuclide without movement from hepatic parenchyma.
 To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of procainamide-induced intrahepatic cholestasis as demonstrated by radionuclide hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
