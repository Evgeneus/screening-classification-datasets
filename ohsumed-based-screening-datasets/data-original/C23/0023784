Internal capsule plaque and tonic spasms in multiple sclerosis.
 A patient developed hemilateral tonic spasms associated with a relapse of multiple sclerosis.
 An area of demyelination in the right internal capsule was observed on a magnetic resonance imaging scan.
 This lesion was not detectable on a second magnetic resonance imaging scan 10 months after the spasms had ceased.
 Paroxysmal symptoms in multiple sclerosis may represent transient phenomena related to inflammation in acute plaques.
