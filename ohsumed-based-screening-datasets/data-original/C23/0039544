Identifying risk factors in development of clinically significant post-shock-wave lithotripsy subcapsular hematomas.
 A retrospective study of 1,012 shock-wave lithotripsy treatments was performed to identify and analyze the risk factors for the development of six clinically significant post-extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) subcapsular hematomas.
 The patients studied had clinical signs and symptoms that on evaluation were confirmed as originating from a subcapsular hematoma.
 Common factors identified which we believe may put patients at increased risk for the development of subcapsular hematoma included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and obesity.
