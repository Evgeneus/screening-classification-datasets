Traumatic esophageal rupture: unusual cause of acute mediastinal widening.
 We have presented the case of a 32-year-old man who sustained blunt trauma to the chest in a motor vehicle accident.
 Plain roentgenograms showed a widened mediastinum and pneumomediastinum, and an esophagogram with water-soluble contrast material showed an esophageal laceration at the T-4 level.
