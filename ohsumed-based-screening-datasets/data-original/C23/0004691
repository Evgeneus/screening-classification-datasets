Comparison of the Goode T-tube with the Armstrong tube in children with chronic otitis media with effusion.
 Treatment of otitis media with effusion is focused on reaeration of the middle ear cavity.
 In achieving long-term aeration, the insertion of ventilation tubes that have a long duration of stay can be beneficial.
 The results are presented of a trial in which the Goode T-tube was compared with the Armstrong tube.
 Fifteen children were treated between 1981 and 1986 with a T-tube in one ear and a conventional tube in the other.
 The results are different with regard to duration of stay in the tympanic membrane.
 Re-insertions were necessary in 47 per cent in the Armstrong group and in 20 per cent in the T-tube group.
 Otorrhoea occurred in 20 per cent of the Armstrong and 13 per cent of the T-tube intubated ears.
 A persistent perforation was present in 6 per cent of the ears in both groups.
 It is concluded that the Goode T-tube is indicated primarily in cases when long-term ventilation is needed.
