Zinc in the management of tinnitus. Placebo-controlled trial.
 To assess any possible beneficial effect from zinc on tinnitus we performed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind investigation.
 Forty-eight patients with tinnitus were randomized to either placebo or the administration of zinc sulfate as sustained-release tablets of 22 mg Zn++ (Zinklet).
 The tablets were administered three times daily for 8 weeks.
 Every week the patients stated the severity of tinnitus on a number scale from 0 to 10.
 The levels of zinc and albumin in serum were determined both before and after treatment.
 Of 48 patients with tinnitus, hypozincemia was found in only one patient.
 The zinc level increased significantly in the patients treated with zinc.
 We could not demonstrate any beneficial effect from zinc on tinnitus.
 One of the essential reasons for this finding could be that the zinc levels in serum were in the normal range previous to treatment.
