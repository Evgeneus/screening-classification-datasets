Periosteal suspension of the lower eyelid and cheek following subciliary exposure of facial fractures.
 Following craniofacial procedures that involve stripping of the periosteum and soft tissue over the zygomatic maxillary complex, descent of soft tissue with a decrease in anterior projection over the malar area and increase in fullness in the nasolabial fold have been seen to be a problem by these authors.
 Simple repositioning of the soft tissues to their normal anatomic position may be used to alleviate this problem.
