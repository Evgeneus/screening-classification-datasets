Hormonal and metabolic response to operative stress in the neonate.
 It is evident from this review that newborns, even those born prematurely, are capable of mounting an endocrine and metabolic response to operative stress.
 Unfortunately, many of the areas for which a relatively well-characterized response exists in adults are poorly documented in neonates.
 As is the case in adults, the response seems to be primarily catabolic in nature because the combined hormonal changes include an increased release of catabolic hormones such as catecholamines, glucagon, and corticosteroids coupled with a suppression of and peripheral resistance to the effects of the primary anabolic hormone, insulin.
