Topical amethocaine in strabismus surgery.
 A randomized study was performed to assess the effect of topical 1% amethocaine hydrochloride on postoperative analgesia requirements after strabismus surgery.
 Forty children scheduled for elective operation were allocated randomly to receive either topical amethocaine or normal saline.
 Postoperative analgesia was evaluated with the use of a four-point assessment score and analgesic requirements.
 The topical amethocaine provided significantly better postoperative analgesia (p less than 0.001) as measured by both the assessment score and the postoperative analgesia requirement.
