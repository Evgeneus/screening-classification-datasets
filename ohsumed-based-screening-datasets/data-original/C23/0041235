Relationship between perceived self-control of pain, pain description and functioning.
 Recent research has shown an association between preferred coping style and pain report.
 The present study explores in a sample of 51 patients with chronic pain of myofascial origin the relationship between a dispositional measure of coping, the internality dimension of the Pain Locus of Control Scale (PLOC), and ratings of pain intensity, frequency, and pain-related behavioral functioning.
 Patients above the median on the internality dimension of the PLOC reported their pain as less intense and frequent than those below the median.
 No differences were noted on the behavioral functioning measures.
 Results are consistent with previous studies and indicate an association between ability to control pain and variations in magnitude and periodicity of pain.
 The clinical implication of the data is that strategies which provide reduction in pain intensity and frequency might be expected to result in increased perception of personal control of pain.
