Hemifacial spasm. Occurrence in multiple sclerosis.
 We present six patients with hemifacial spasm and multiple sclerosis.
 To our knowledge, this association has not been described previously in the North American literature.
 Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all the patients and plaques consistent with multiple sclerosis were identified.
 In two patients the plaques were seen in the area of the facial nucleus on the involved side.
 We suggest that hemifacial spasm can be a manifestation of multiple sclerosis.
 These cases illustrate the utility of magnetic resonance imaging in the investigation of hemifacial spasm.
 Our findings also support a central (nuclear) origin in multiple sclerosis associated with hemifacial spasm.
