Shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia: effects of three different supports.
 Shoulder subluxation in hemiplegia is a difficult problem to manage and it may be associated with pain and other complications.
 Measurements taken from x-rays have been used to obtain objective measures of shoulder subluxation, but have not been used to compare the effects of different shoulder supports.
 This study used x-ray measurements to evaluate different shoulder supports for subluxation in hemiplegia and to see if there was a significant difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling.
 The Harris hemisling gave good vertical correction of subluxation and compared closely to the uninvolved shoulder.
 The Bobath sling did not correct the subluxation as well, and the mean difference between the two slings was significant.
 The arm trough or lap board was less effective and tended to overcorrect.
 The Harris hemisling and arm trough or lap board had horizontal measurements similar to the uninvolved shoulders.
 The Bobath sling, however, distracted the glenohumeral joint horizontally and was more variable.
 The mean horizontal difference between the Harris hemisling and the Bobath sling was significant.
 These results support the effectiveness and specificity of shoulder support to decrease subluxation after hemiplegia.
