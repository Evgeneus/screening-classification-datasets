Experience with the Sarns centrifugal pump as a ventricular assist device.
 The authors used the Sarns centrifugal pump (Sarns 3M, Ann Arbor, MI) as a ventricular assist device (VAD) in 30 patients between May 1985 and February 1990.
 Sixteen patients were unweanable from cardiopulmonary bypass at the time of surgery; nine were patients who developed cardiogenic shock postoperatively in the intensive care unit.
 One was a donor organ failure; one had a failed PTCA; and one an acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock preoperatively.
 Two patients were bridged to cardiac transplantation.
 Of the 28 nontransplant candidates, 20 (71.4%) were weaned successfully, 14 (50%) were discharged from the hospital, and 13 (46%) are alive from 1 to 46 months postoperatively (mean, 21.1 months).
 Three patients received right ventricular support alone; all three were weaned, and two (66.7%) were discharged.
 Ten patients received left ventricular assistance alone.
 Six (60%) were weaned, and four (40%) were discharged.
 Two patients received left ventricular support initially but were taken back for right VAD insertion because of right-sided heart failure; one (50%) is alive.
 Fifteen patients received biventricular support.
 Eleven (77.3%) were weaned, and eight (53.3%) were discharged.
 Patient ages ranged from 19 to 73 years, with a mean age for men of 59 years and 50.5 years for women.
 There were no thromboembolic events.
 Various clinical parameters were evaluated to determine effect on weanability and survival.
 These results show survival equivalent to any other VAD at this time.
 The centrifugal pump is a convenient and effective means of maintaining ventricular support in individuals who are believed to have salvageable myocardium.
