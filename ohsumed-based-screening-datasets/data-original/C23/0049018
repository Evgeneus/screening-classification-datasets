Umbilical cord occlusion stimulates breathing independent of blood gases and pH.
 The role of umbilical cord occlusion in the initiation of breathing at birth was investigated by use of 16 unanesthetized fetal sheep near full term.
 Artificial ventilation with high-frequency oscillation was used to control fetal arterial blood gas tensions.
 At baseline, PCO2 was maintained at control fetal values and PO2 was elevated to between 25 and 50 Torr.
 In the first study on six intact and four vagotomized fetuses, arterial PCO2 and PO2 were maintained constant during two 30-min periods of umbilical cord occlusion.
 Nevertheless, the mean fetal breathing rate increased significantly when the umbilical cord was occluded.
 In the second study on six intact fetuses, hypercapnia (68 Torr) was imposed by adding CO2 to the ventilation gas.
 When the umbilical cord was occluded, there was a significantly greater stimulation of breathing (rate, incidence, and amplitude) in response to hypercapnia than in response to hypercapnia alone.
 During cord occlusion, plasma prostaglandin E2 concentration decreased significantly.
 Results indicate that cord occlusion stimulates breathing possibly by causing the removal of a placentally produced respiratory inhibitor such as prostaglandin E2 from the circulation.
