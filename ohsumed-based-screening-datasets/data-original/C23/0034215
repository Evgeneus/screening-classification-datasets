Assessment of systemic effects of different ophthalmic beta-blockers in healthy volunteers.
 Systemic beta-blockade after single doses of ophthalmic beta-blockers (one drop in each eye) was investigated in healthy volunteers in two randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled studies.
 beta-Blockade was evaluated by displacement of the bronchodilator (specific airway conductance), positive chronotropic (heart rate), and tremorogenic (finger tremor amplitude) dose-response curve for inhaled isoproterenol.
 In study 1, 0.5% betaxolol, 0.6% metipranolol, and 0.5% timolol were tested in 16 subjects.
 Compared with placebo, all beta-blockers resulted in a significant systemic beta-blockade (p greater than 0.05); the increasing order of potency was betaxolol, metipranolol, and timolol.
 In study 2, 2% butylamino-phenoxy-propanol-acetate (BPPA; a noncardioselective but topically oculoselective drug) and 1% timolol were investigated in 12 subjects.
 Placebo and BPPA showed no differences (p greater than 0.05), whereas timolol resulted in a significant beta-blockade (p less than 0.05).
 Topical oculoselectivity is an important aspect of drug safety of beta-blocking eyedrops.
 Measure of tremor is appropriate to evaluate beta 2-blockade.
