Structural abnormalities of the craniofacial complex and congenital malformations.
 This article was meant to be a very cursory survey of the multiple defects that abnormal development can produce in all areas of the craniofacial complex.
 Careful examination for these abnormalities should lead the clinician to earlier referral of patients for additional examination by a genetics team.
 This often enables more focused care for the individual and better counseling concerning future pregnancies.
 Aase points out that "funny looking face" or "syndromic facies" is no longer helpful.
 Accurate assessment of the face with measurement leads to better diagnosis and ultimately better patient care.
 All children with facial defects deserve early intervention by a multidisciplined craniofacial team including geneticists, surgeons, dentists, speech pathologists, and other specialists.
 Part of the process of early referral to this team involves early detection and recognition in the neonatal period.
 It is hoped that this article stimulates the pediatrician to be aware of these abnormalities, recognize their importance, and seek additional help for patients, no matter what their age.
