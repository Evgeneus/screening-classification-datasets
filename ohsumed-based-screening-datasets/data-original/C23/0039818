Holmium laser angioplasty after failed coronary balloon dilation: use of a new solid-state, infrared laser system.
 A new solid-state laser system was used in a case of saphenous vein graft occlusion untreatable by standard very low-profile balloon angioplasty.
 The 2100 nm infrared pulsed thulium/holmium: YAG laser successfully recanalized an obtuse marginal bypass graft without complications.
 The holmium laser has several advantages over excimer systems and may prove an effective adjunct or alternative to coronary balloon angioplasty.
