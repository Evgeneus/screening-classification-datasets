Establishment of a human acute myeloid leukemia cell line (Kasumi-1) with 8;21 chromosome translocation.
 A novel leukemic cell line with an 8;21 chromosome translocation, designated as Kasumi-1, was established from the peripheral blood of a 7-year-old boy suffering from acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
 The Kasumi-1 cells were positive for myeloperoxidase showing a morphology of myeloid maturation.
 The response in proliferation assay was observed in the culture with interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocytemacrophage CSF (GM-CSF), but not with IL-1 or IL-5.
 Neither granulocytic nor eosinophilic maturation was observed in the liquid culture by the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide, G-CSF, or IL-5, respectively.
 In contrast, induction of macrophagelike cells was seen by the addition of phorbol ester.
 This is the first report of a human AML cell line with t(8;21) that has characteristics of myeloid and macrophage lineages.
 The cell line could be a useful tool for elucidating the pathophysiology of AML with t(8;21).
