A quantitative histopathological study of right bundle branch block complicating acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction.
 The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether necrosis of the right bundle branch is responsible for development of right bundle branch block in acute myocardial infarction.
 Twenty patients with acute anteroseptal myocardial infarction were studied--10 with right bundle branch block (group A) and 10 without (group B)--to evaluate by serial sectioning the pathological extent of myocardial infarction surrounding the right bundle branch and also that of right bundle branch necrosis.
 Myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch more than 8 mm above the moderator band in all of group A, whereas myocardial infarction reached the right bundle branch less than 3 mm above the moderator band in only three patients in group B.
 Nine hearts in group A showed significant necrosis of the right bundle branch.
 In group B and in one case with transient right bundle branch block no necrosis was found.
 The occurrence of right bundle branch block was almost entirely explained by necrosis of the right bundle branch, but transient right bundle branch block did develop without necrosis of the right bundle branch.
