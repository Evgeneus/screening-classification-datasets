Antinuclear antibodies in sera of patients with recurrent pregnancy wastage.
 Four groups of women were studied to determine whether low-level antinuclear antibody titers are associated with a higher risk for pregnancy loss.
 Group A consisted of 30 patients with a history of unexplained fetal losses.
 Group B consisted of 30 women with "explained" fetal losses (e.g., uterine septum or luteal phase defect).
 Ages and number of losses were comparable between the women in groups A and B.
 Group C consisted of 61 healthy pregnant women.
 Group D involved 61 healthy nonpregnant women of reproductive age.
 In groups A and B, 40% and 53.3% of the respective patients had antinuclear antibody titers greater than or equal to 1:40.
 In groups C and D the frequencies of positive antinuclear antibody titers were 8.2% and 5.6%, respectively.
 This study demonstrates a high prevalence of low-titer antinuclear antibody-positive serum in patients with explained and unexplained pregnancy losses.
