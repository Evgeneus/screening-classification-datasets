Islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting as bleeding from isolated gastric varices. Report of a case and review of the literature.
 Gastrointestinal hemorrhage from left-sided portal hypertension and gastric varices is an unusual presentation for islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas.
 Islet cell tumors of the pancreas themselves are rare.
 They present in a variety of ways.
 Those that elaborate functional hormones cause specific neuroendocrine syndromes.
 Nonfunctional tumors characteristically present later with symptoms of metastatic disease or as a result of local enlargement.
 We present a case of islet cell carcinoma of the pancreas presenting with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric varices and review the literature for this rare presentation.
 We emphasize the importance of a careful initial diagnostic work-up that may enable curative surgery.
