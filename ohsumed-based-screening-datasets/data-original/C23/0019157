Loop ileostomy after ileal pouch-anal anastomosis--is it necessary?
 Construction of a loop ileostomy is usually advised in patients having an ileal pouch-anal anastomosis to minimize the complication of chronic pelvic sepsis.
 Formation and closure of a loop ileostomy was associated with a 41 percent and 30 percent complication rate, respectively, in a prospective series of 34 patients.
 This morbidity must now be assessed in relation to the benefits of avoiding temporary fecal diversion in restorative proctocolectomy.
