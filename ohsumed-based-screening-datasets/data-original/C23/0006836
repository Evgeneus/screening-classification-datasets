Positive results of combined therapy of surgery and intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion for far-advanced gastric cancer.
 To evaluate the clinical efficacy of intraperitoneal hyperthermic perfusion (IPHP) for far-advanced gastric cancer, particularly with peritoneal seeding, we investigated the survival times of 59 patients who underwent distal subtotal gastrectomy, total gastrectomy, or total gastrectomy combined with concomitant resection of some of the remaining intra-abdominal organs.
 In all the 30 patients given IPHP, no cancer cells were present posthyperthermically in the lavage from the Douglas pouch.
 The 30 patients given IPHP lived longer than the 29 patients not given IPHP (p = 0.001), with a 1-year survival rate of 80.4% in the former group compared to 34.2% in the latter.
 With respect to a comparison of survival time of patients with peritoneal seeding, 7 patients not given IPHP had a 6-month survival rate of 57.1% and did not survive more than 9 months, whereas 20 patients given IPHP had 1- and 2-year survival rates of 78.7% and 45.0%, respectively; here the difference was significant (p = 0.001).
 The IPHP and control groups without peritoneal metastasis included 10 and 22 patients, respectively, and the 1-year survival rates are 85.4% and 45.3%, respectively.
 The survival rates of the former exceeded those of the latter, with p = 0.015 by the generalized Wilcoxon test.
 Thus this combined therapy offers the promise of extended survival for patients with far-advanced gastric cancer.
