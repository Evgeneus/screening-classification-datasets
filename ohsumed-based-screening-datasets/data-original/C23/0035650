p53 in chronic myelogenous leukemia in acute phase.
 All patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) undergo clinical transition from chronic to acute phase.
 This transition is often associated with deletion of the short arm of chromosome 17 in the form of the i(17q) aberration.
 Since the p53 gene is a suppressor gene and is located on 17p13, we examined the possibility that it is inactivated during progression of CML.
 Therefore, we studied the structure and expression of p53 in the leukemic cells of a large number of CML patients in acute phase.
 We found that although the gene is rarely rearranged, one p53 allele is completely deleted in patients with the i(17q) aberration as well as in some patients who do not show karyotypic changes.
 In all of these patients the remaining allele is inactivated through loss of expression, rearrangement, or point mutation.
 Detailed analysis of some patients who carry both p53 alleles indicated neither loss of expression nor structural alterations.
 It appears that p53 loss of function is associated with progression of around 25% of CML patients.
