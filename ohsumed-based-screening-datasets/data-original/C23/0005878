Antibiotic therapy for common infections.
 Several important points regarding the treatment of urinary tract infections should be made.
 Single-dose and short-course antibiotic therapy is appropriate only for women with acute bacterial cystitis due to E.
 coli.
 Studies comparing single-dose to full-course therapy have not been sufficiently designed to draw valid statistical conclusions, and only TMP/SMX is recommended at this time.
 Recurrent UTI in women is almost always due to reinfection, which is best managed by prophylactic antibiotics.
 Acute bronchitis and acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis are often due to viral infections, and therefore antibiotic therapy is not always needed.
 In acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, the clearest success rates for antibiotic therapy have been in patients, who have all three of the following symptoms: increased dyspnea, increased sputum production, and sputum purulence.
 Mupirocin is an important addition to the agents used to treat bacterial skin infections due to streptococcal and staphylococcal strains.
 In impetigo, mupirocin has been demonstrated to be as effective or superior to oral erythromycin.
 In prostatitis, data on the fluoroquinolones appears impressive, but further comparative trials are needed.
 They may become first-line, empiric therapy.
 The newer oral antibiotics are not recommended as initial, empiric therapy in the outpatient management of common infections, with the possible exception of the treatment of prostatitis.
 These newer agents may be more important in the treatment of recurrent or resistant infections.
