Anterior cruciate ligament allograft transplantation in dogs.
 The biomechanical and clinical performance of bone-ligament-bone anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) allografts was studied in eight dogs.
 Allografts were collected from skeletally mature, healthy dogs using aseptic technique, and stored at -70 degrees for three to five weeks before implantation.
 The allografts were size-matched to the recipient dogs using ACL length and then rigidly fixed in position with interference screws and Kirschner wires.
 Three dogs regained a normal gait, and their grafts sustained breaking loads that were 25%, 41%, and 59% of controls.
 Partial or complete graft failure occurred in the other five dogs at some point in the study.
 Four had intraligamentous rupture and one had an avulsion fracture of the femoral attachment site.
 Joint-fluid cytology was normal in all eight dogs.
 Histologic examination showed persistent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.
 Eventually the allograft cores were incorporated in the host bed.
 Hyperplasia and fibrosis of the synovial membrane were diffuse and persisted as focal accumulations of mononuclear inflammatory cells.
