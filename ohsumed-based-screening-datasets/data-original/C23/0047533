Effect of metoclopramide on angiotensins, aldosterone, and atrial peptide during hypoxia.
 The coupling of aldosterone with renin is altered during acute hypoxemia.
 We measured the various components of the renin-angiotensin system and the plasma levels of immunoreactive atrial natriuretic factor (iANF) during room air and hypoxic gas-mixture breathing before and after administration of metoclopramide, a competitive antagonist of dopamine.
 Seven resting volunteers were studied 1 wk apart under room air and hypoxic conditions (inspired O2 fraction 0.12).
 During hypoxemia, the release of aldosterone induced by metoclopramide was significantly smaller.
 This change was associated with a slight increase in iANF and with a decrease in plasma angiotensin II levels, without any change in immunoreactive blood angiotensin I concentrations.
 Plasma electrolytes and blood acid-base status did not show relevant changes, nor did blood pressure and heart rate.
 We conclude that the decreased aldosterone concentrations seen under hypoxemia are related to decreased angiotensin II levels.
 Other influences, such as elevated ANF, may also mediate this effect.
