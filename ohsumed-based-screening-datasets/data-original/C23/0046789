Three-dimensional x-ray computed tomography of the temporal bone as an aid to surgical planning.
 Three-dimensional x-ray computed tomography (3DCT) has been useful in planning surgical procedures involving craniofacial reconstruction, the pelvis, hip, spine, knee and shoulder.
 The clinical use of 3DCT in temporal bone surgery has not been evaluated.
 We used 3DCT to assess temporal bone anatomy in 9 patients.
 These cases evaluated two encephaloceles, two postinflammatory dehiscences, two temporal bone fractures, one glomus jugulare tumor, one acoustic neuroma, and one meningioma.
 We found 3DCT useful in these temporal bone applications as a supplement to standard two-dimensional CT scanning (2DCT).
 While 3DCT provided a better preoperative understanding of the underlying anatomy, no treatment was modified solely on the basis of the information derived from the 3-D presentation of data.
 We conclude that, although 3DCT images have some qualitative advantages over 2DCT techniques, their value in further defining temporal bone morphology must be evaluated against the cost entailed by their use.
