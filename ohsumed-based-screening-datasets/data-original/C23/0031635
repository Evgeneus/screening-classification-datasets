A simple sore throat? Retropharyngeal emphysema secondary to free-basing cocaine.
 A case of retropharyngeal emphysema associated with drug abuse is presented.
 Although chest symptoms of pneumomediastinum have been widely reported with substance abuse, pain localized to the neck is rarely described.
 In the present case, localized dysphagia was the only complaint, and no free air could be demonstrated within the thorax.
 For uncomplicated cervical emphysema or pneumomediastinum due to substance abuse, extensive workup may be unnecessary, and conservative therapy, including administration of 100% oxygen and observation is recommended if resolution is prompt.
