Thyroarytenoid muscle activity during hypoxia in awake lambs.
 It is generally accepted that hypoxia in early life results in active laryngeal braking of expiratory airflow via the recruitment of glottic adductor muscles.
 We examined the electromyogram expiratory activity of the thyroarytenoid muscle in seven 11- to 18-day-old awake nonsedated lambs exposed to an inspired O2 fraction of 0.08 for 18 min.
 The lambs breathed through a face mask and a pneumotachograph.
 During baseline prehypoxic breathing, the thyroarytenoid muscle was largely inactive in each awake lamb.
 Unexpectedly, no recruitment of the thyroarytenoid muscle was recorded during hypoxia in any of the seven lambs; simultaneous examination of the flow-volume curves revealed an absence of expiratory airflow braking.
 Also unexpectedly, marked expiratory activity of the thyroarytenoid muscle was recorded, with each expiration occurring within less than 10 s after the return to room air.
 The resulting delay of expiration was apparent in the flow-volume loops.
 Thus, in awake 11- to 18-day-old lambs, 1) active expiratory glottic adduction is absent during hypoxia and 2) a return from hypoxia to room air results in prolonged expiration as well as active glottic adduction that controls end-expiratory lung volume.
