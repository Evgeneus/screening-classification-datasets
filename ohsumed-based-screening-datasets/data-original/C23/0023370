Cortical asymmetry of REM sleep EEG following unilateral pontine hemorrhage.
 A 24-year-old woman with a left pontine hematoma showed marked asymmetry in the EEG of REM sleep, suggesting that a unilateral pontine lesion is sufficient to disrupt normal REM sleep EEG in the ipsilateral hemisphere.
 Other REM sleep characteristics (rapid eye movements, muscle atonia) were unaffected by this lesion.
