Effects of immediate postoperative enteral nutrition on body composition, muscle function, and wound healing.
 Thirty-two patients undergoing bowel resection were randomized to receive either immediate postoperative nasojejunal feeding with full strength Osmolite solution for 56 hours (n = 16) or routine postoperative hypocaloric fluids and gradual reintroduction of diet (n = 16).
 Body composition changes were measured at 14 days after operation with in vivo neutron activation analysis, the wound healing response by subcutaneous implantation of Gortex tubes, and muscle function by grip strength, maximum ventilatory volume, and stimulation of the ulnar nerve at the wrist.
 Postoperative fatigue up to 3 months after operation was assessed using a 10-point analogue.
 Successful immediate enteral nutrition was established in 12 of the 16 patients.
 Enterally fed patients had a mean daily caloric intake of 1179 +/- 388 kcal/d (mean +/- SD) over the first 4 postoperative days compared with 382 +/- 71 kcal/d for the controls (p less than 0.0001).
 The amount of hydroxyproline accumulating in the Gortex tubes was also significantly greater (2.5 +/- 1.1 nmol/g tube vs 1.5 +/- 0.8 nmol/g tube; p less than 0.02).
 However, the amount and composition of the weight lost was not significantly different.
 Muscle function was not preserved, and postoperative fatigue occurred to an equal extent in both groups.
 Complications were similar in both groups, except for a preponderance of bowel obstructions in the controls.
 The time to passage of first flatus and first bowel motion, although shorter in the fed group, did not reach significance (p = 0.07).
 We conclude that immediate enteral nutrition is feasible and results in an improved wound healing response.
