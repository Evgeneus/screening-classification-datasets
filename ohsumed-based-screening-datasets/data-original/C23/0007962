Allelic variants at insulin-receptor and insulin gene loci and susceptibility to NIDDM in Welsh population.
 A cohort of 132 well-documented White Welsh non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) subjects were genotyped for 5 restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs) at the insulin-receptor gene (IRG) locus and a polymorphic locus 5' to the insulin gene.
 There was no significant difference in RFLP frequencies between the NIDDM subjects and a group of 87 matched White control subjects.
 Paired haplotype analysis of the IRG RFLPs suggested a difference between NIDDM and control groups for the endonuclease combinations Bgl II-Rsa I and Bgl II-Xba I.
 Analysis of implied haplotypes defined by the endonucleases Bgl II, Rsa I, and Xba I revealed one haplotype to be more prevalent in the NIDDM group; whereas, another haplotype was associated with the control group (P less than 0.02).
 Subset analysis within the NIDDM cohort compared the metabolic response of NIDDM subjects with the differing IRG haplotypes to a standard meal tolerance test.
 Both groups showed equivalent basal and postprandial glucose excursions, but one group revealed a significantly exaggerated plasma insulin response compared with the other (P less than 0.05).
 This may reflect the influence of genetic variation at the IRG locus on insulin sensitivity in patients with NIDDM.
