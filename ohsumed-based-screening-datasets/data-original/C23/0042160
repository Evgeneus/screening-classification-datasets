Incidence of gallstones in liver cirrhosis.
 We conducted a longitudinal follow-up of 72 patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) in order to assess gallstone (GS) incidence.
 The period of survey was 24.5 +/- 12.2 months.
 Patients were divided into two groups: group I--26 patients with ascites at the start or appearing during follow-up, and Group II--46 patients with compensated LC (no ascites) throughout the survey.
 During follow-up, 12 of 72 (16.6%) patients developed GS.
 The global cumulative incidence of GS was 5.5 cases/100 people/year.
 Age and sex had no influence on the incidence of GS in LC; neither had etiology or cirrhosis.
 On the contrary, the study revealed a significant increase in the incidence of GS in decompensated cirrhosis.
 In group I patients, GS appeared more frequently (34.6%) than in group II patients (6.5%) (chi 2 9.479; p less than 0.002).
 The cumulative incidence of GS was five times higher in decompensated versus compensated LC.
