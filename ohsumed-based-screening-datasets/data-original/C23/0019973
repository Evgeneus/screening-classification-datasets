Laparoscopic cholecystectomy using intracorporeal lithotripsy.
 Over a 13-month period (November 1988 to December 1989), we performed our first 104 laparoscopic cholecystectomies using an intracorporeal ultrasonic lithotripsy technique.
 The procedure in three of these patients was converted to an open operation because of hemorrhage with unexpected findings of cirrhosis in two patients and dense subhepatic adhesions in a third.
 Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was successfully used in three other patients in whom common bile duct stones were identified.
 We encountered only three postoperative complications out of all the laparoscopic cholecystectomies performed.
 One complication was a biliary fistula that closed spontaneously 1 week after surgery.
 The remaining complications were attributable to abscesses, one subhepatic and one pelvic, which were aspirated and drained laparoscopically.
 There were no deaths.
 Advantages of the laparoscopic approach included decreased perioperative pain, shortened hospitalization, absence of scar, and more rapid return to prehospitalization activities.
