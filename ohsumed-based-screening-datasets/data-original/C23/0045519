Detection of talocalcaneal coalitions by magnification bone scintigraphy.
 Fibrocartilaginous talocalcaneal coalitions are very difficult to identify on plain radiography in symptomatic children and adolescents before gross ossification occurs.
 Computed tomography (CT) has been successful in identifying osseous and some fibro-osseous coalitions.
 In this series, magnification imaging of the tarsus on bone scintigraphy in the medial-lateral projection correctly identified talocalcaneal coalitions, seven of the nine bars were fibrous or fibro-osseous.
 Three of the fibrous lesions were equivocal or normal on conventional radiography and CT.
 Physiologic accumulations of activity in the growing hind foot are also presented from a control pediatric population.
 Magnification scintigraphy of the hind foot is offered as an adjunct to plain radiography and CT in the diagnosis of elusive nonosseous subtalar bars.
