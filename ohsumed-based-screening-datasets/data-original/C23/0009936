Microscopic Wegener's disease: a particular form of Wegener's granulomatosis.
 We describe a case of Wegener's granulomatosis in which the disease was manifested with crescentic glomerulonephritis, upper airway ulcerations, and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia with consumptive coagulopathy.
 No granuloma was identified but antibodies to cytoplasmic components of neutrophils were strongly positive with a diffuse pattern.
 Because microscopic vessels were predominantly involved (capillaritis), and granuloma were absent, were refer to this particular form of the disease as "microscopic Wegener's disease.".
