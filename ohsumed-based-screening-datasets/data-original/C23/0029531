Effects of variable dose milrinone in patients with low cardiac output after cardiac surgery. European Multicenter Trial Group.
 We studied 99 adult patients after elective cardiac surgery who had low cardiac output (cardiac index less than 2.5 L/min/m2) in spite of adequate cardiac filling pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure less than 8 mm Hg).
 Patients received milrinone by loading dose (50 micrograms/kg over a 10-minute period), followed by a continuous infusion of either 0.375, 0.5, or 0.75 micrograms/kg/min (low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) given for a minimum of 12 hours.
 Patients were allocated to each dosage group sequentially, not randomly.
 Hemodynamic measurements were made before the loading dose and at 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes, 3, 6, and 12 hours after the start of milrinone therapy.
 Further measurements were made at 2 and 4 hours after treatment was stopped.
 Milrinone therapy was associated with a rapid, well-sustained, and highly significant increase in cardiac index in all three dose groups (p less than 0.001), and a similar fall occurred in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure in all groups (p less than 0.001).
 Significant increases occurred in heart rate in all three groups (p less than 0.001).
 Systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance also fell significantly, although changes in this latter parameter were less predictable and more dose dependent.
 Few serious treatment-related adverse effects were seen.
 We conclude that intravenous milrinone is an effective and safe therapy for the treatment of low output states after cardiac surgery.
