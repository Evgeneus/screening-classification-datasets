Effect of portasystemic shunts on subsequent transplantation of the liver.
 Portasystemic (PS) shunts have been regarded as a relative contraindication to hepatic transplantation (HT) because of the potential for increased technical difficulties during the transplant operation.
 We compared operative blood loss, morbidity and mortality in 27 patients with PS shunts and 147 patients with no shunts (NS) who underwent HT.
 The PS shunt group included 12 portocaval (PC), eight mesocaval, four central splenorenal and four distal splenorenal shunts.
 The PS shunt and NS groups were similar with respect to age, preoperative medical status and ABO blood group matching between donors and recipients.
 There were no significant differences in the mean (plus or minus S.D.) intraoperative blood transfusion (9.1 +/- 7.6 versus 9.2 +/- 11.0 units), mean (plus or minus S.D.) duration of anesthesia (8.1 +/- 1.4 versus 7.8 +/- 1.5 hours) and operative mortality (7 versus 11 per cent) between the PS shunt and NS groups, respectively.
 Complications of the biliary tract were significantly higher in the PS shunt group (22.0 versus 5.4 per cent, p less than 0.01) but they did not increase the mortality rate.
 We conclude that a prior PS shunt should not influence the decision to accept patients for HT.
 PS shunts remain a reasonable surgical option for patients with cirrhosis and variceal hemorrhage (refractory to sclerotherapy) who, by virtue of good hepatic function, do not merit immediate HT.
