Superior protective effect of low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution on ischemic myocardium. Clinical study in comparison with St. Thomas' Hospital solution.
 The protective effect of low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution on ischemic myocardium has been assessed in adult patients undergoing heart operations.
 Postreperfusion recovery of cardiac function and electrical activity was evaluated in 34 patients; 16 received low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution (group I) and 18 received St.
 Thomas' Hospital solution, which is enriched with calcium and magnesium (group II).
 There were no significant differences between the two groups in age, sex, body weight, and New York Heart Association functional class.
 Aortic occlusion time (107.3 +/- 46.8 minutes versus 113.6 +/- 44.3 minutes), highest myocardial temperature during elective global ischemia (11.5 degrees C +/- 3.1 degrees C versus 9.3 degrees C +/- 3.2 degrees C), and total volume of cardioplegic solution (44.2 +/- 20.5 ml/kg versus 43.4 +/- 17.6 ml/kg) were also similar in the two groups.
 On reperfusion, electrical defibrillation was required in four cases (25.5%) in group I and in 15 cases (83.3%) in group II (p less than 0.005), and bradyarrhythmias were significantly more prevalent in group II (6.3% versus 44.4%; p less than 0.05).
 Serum creatine kinase MB activity at 15 minutes of reperfusion (12.3 +/- 17.0 IU/L versus 42.6 +/- 46.1 IU/L; p less than 0.05) and the dose of dopamine or dobutamine required during the early phase of reperfusion (1.8 +/- 2.5 micrograms/kg/min versus 6.1 +/- 3.3 micrograms/kg/min; p less than 0.0002) were both significantly greater in group II.
 Postischemic left ventricular function, as assessed by percent recovery of the left ventricular end-systolic pressure-volume relationship in patients who underwent aortic valve replacement alone, was significantly better in group I (160.4% +/- 45.5% versus 47.8% +/- 12.9%; p less than 0.05).
 Serum level of calcium and magnesium ions was significantly lower in group I.
 Thus low-calcium, magnesium-free potassium cardioplegic solution provided excellent protection of the ischemic heart, whereas St.
 Thomas' Hospital solution with calcium and magnesium enabled relatively poor functional and electrical recovery of the heart during the early reperfusion period.
 These results might be related to differing levels of extracellular calcium and magnesium on reperfusion.
