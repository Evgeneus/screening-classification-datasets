Angioplasty of coronary bifurcation stenoses: immediate and long-term results of the protecting branch technique.
 Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTCA) of coronary stenoses involving major bifurcations carries a small but significant risk of side branch occlusion which can be avoided by simultaneously using multiple dilatation systems.
 Among 1,275 PTCA procedures performed between 1984 and 1988 in 1,035 consecutive patients, 42 double wire procedures were applied (4%) to protect and/or dilate major coronary side branches.
 A total of 80 coronary stenoses were attempted of which 76 were located on a bifurcation and 4 on other segments.
 In the first 11 patients (group A), 2 guiding catheters were used and PTCA of each vessel was successfully performed by means of separate double lumen over-the-wire balloon catheters.
 In the next 31 patients (group B), 2 guidewires were advanced through a single guiding catheter and PTCA was attempted using "Monorail" balloon catheters sequentially advanced over the wires.
 In group B, a successful PTCA was obtained in 29 patients (93%) but twisting of the wires hampered balloon progression in 5 cases, such that dilatation could only be performed by stepping back to a single wire technique.
 The procedure time in group B was significantly shorter than in group A: 144 +/- 30 versus 230 +/- 52 minutes (p = .01).
 Repeat angiography was performed in 35 out of 40 patients (87%) after a mean of 180 +/- 46 days following successful PTCA.
 Angiographic restenosis was present in 37% (24/65) of bifurcation segments which, in our experience, is not significantly different from the angiographic restenosis rate in less complex lesions (248/740; 34%; NS).
