Vitamin A levels in premenstrual syndrome.
 To determine whether changes in peripheral vitamin A levels are associated with symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), 10 PMS patients and 10 controls were studied.
 They gave blood at 2- or 3-day intervals through three menstrual cycles.
 The vitamin A was measured by fluorometry after cyclohexane extraction.
 In the controls, vitamin A values were 68.0 +/- 3.2 micrograms/dL (mean +/- SE) during the luteal phase and 69.8 +/- 4.2 micrograms/dL during the follicular phase.
 No significant changes were noted between the two values.
 In the patients, the values were 73.9 +/- 4.2 micrograms/dL during the luteal phase, which was not significantly different from 72.7 +/- 1.8 micrograms/dL during the follicular phase.
 No significant changes were noted between the controls and the patients in either the luteal or the follicular phase.
 Vitamin A deficiency in PMS patients was not demonstrated in our study.
