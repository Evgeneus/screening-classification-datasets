Macrophage antigen presentation and interleukin 1 production after cecal ligation and puncture in C3H/HeN and C3H/HeJ mice.
 Following cecal ligation and puncture with a 25-gauge needle, endotoxin-sensitive C3H/HeN mice have a 45% mortality compared with no mortality in endotoxin-resistant C2H/HeJ mice.
 Macrophage production of interleukin 1 and antigen presentation were studied in these two strains of mice following cecal ligation and puncture at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 hours and at 2, 4, 6, and 8 days.
 Splenic macrophages were cultured with a T-helper cell clone (D10.G4.1), and antigen presentation and interleukin 1 production were measured by D10.G4.1 proliferation.
 Macrophage antigen presentation by C2H/HeJ mice was markedly increased compared with that in C3H/HeN mice at all times after cecal ligation and puncture, most strikingly at 2 days (185m740 cpm for C3H/HeJ mice vs 30,300 for C2H/HeN mice).
 Macrophage interleukin 1 production was significantly increased in C3H/HeJ mice vs C3H/HeN mice at all times after cecal ligation and puncture (except at 2 days) and was maximal at 8 days (25,000 cpm for C3H/HeJ mice vs 5190 for C3H/HeN mice).
 These data suggest that the differences in mortality after cecal ligation and puncture between these two strains of mice may relate to a supranormal response of macrophages of C3H/HeJ mice or to an inadequate response of macrophages of C3H/HeN mice.
