Clinical study of infertile males with varicocele showing no typical radionuclide blood pooling on dynamic image of scrotal scintigraphy.
 A clinical study was done of 19 patients in our male infertility clinic, who were diagnosed as having a varicocele and showed atypical radionuclide accumulation in the dynamic image of scrotal scintigraphy.
 The semen quality was good in 26 percent and poor in 42 percent.
 Patients with severe congestion in the varicocele tended to be small in number.
 The dynamic images of the varicoceles were classified into two groups: one group with no radionuclide accumulation, and one group with patchy radionuclide accumulations.
 Surgical treatment was performed in patients with poor semen quality or with a long infertility period.
 Neither improvement in the semen quality nor impregnation was achieved postoperatively in patients who had shown no accumulation of the radionuclide in the dynamic imaging.
 In patients who had shown patchy radionuclide accumulations, the postoperative results were good.
 We concluded that preoperative dynamic imaging of scrotal scintigraphy is a good means of estimating the postoperative prognosis of fertility.
