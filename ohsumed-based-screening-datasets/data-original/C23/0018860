Mapping of the locus for X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria (Barth syndrome) to Xq28.
 X-linked cardioskeletal myopathy with neutropenia and abnormal mitochondria is clinically characterized by congenital dilated cardiomyopathy, skeletal myopathy, recurrent bacterial infections, and growth retardation.
 We analyzed linkage between the disease locus and X-chromosomal markers in a family with seven carriers, four patients, and eight unaffected sons of carriers.
 Highest lod scores obtained by two-point linkage analysis were 2.70 for St14.1 (DXS52, TaqI) at a recombination fraction of zero and 2.53 for cpX67 (DXS134) at a recombination fraction of zero.
 Multipoint linkage analysis resulted in a maximum lod score of 5.24 at the position of St35.691 (DXS305).
 The most distal recombination detected in this family was located between the markers II-10 (DXS466) and DX13 (DXS15).
 These data indicate the location of the mutated gene at Xq28.
