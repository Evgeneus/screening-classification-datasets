Lower-extremity vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease: prospective evaluation with duplex Doppler sonography.
 Eighty-five men with 92 vascular grafts placed for peripheral vascular disease of the lower extremity underwent a total of 264 examinations with duplex Doppler over a 2.5-year period.
 In 64 patients who underwent more than one examination, the total follow-up encompassed 740 months.
 In 220 native femoral arteries (96.0%) the peak systolic velocity (PSV) was higher than that in the graft.
 Arteriovenous shunting was associated with a normal PSV and a markedly elevated diastolic component at spectral analysis.
 Focal fluid collections were common initially near the graft and usually disappeared uneventfully.
 An average PSV of 32 cm/sec or less was always associated with impending occlusion.
 The sensitivity of an average PSV of 40 cm/sec or less to indicate impending graft occlusion by the next visit was only 33%; the specificity, 94%.
 At initial examination, stenoses were associated with high PSV focally in the graft or low PSV with absent diastolic flow.
