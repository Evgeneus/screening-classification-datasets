Repressor to activator switch by mutations in the first Zn finger of the glucocorticoid receptor: is direct DNA binding necessary?
 Transfection of HeLa cells with cDNA vectors expressing the wild-type human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) enabled dexamethasone to strongly repress cytokine- and second messenger-induced expression of cotransfected chimeric reporter genes containing transcription regulatory DNA elements from the human interleukin 6 (IL-6) promoter.
 Deletion of the DNA-binding domain or of the second Zn finger or a point mutation in the Zn catenation site in the second finger blocked the ability of GR to mediate repression of the IL-6 promoter.
 Unexpectedly, deletion of the first Zn finger, a point mutation in the Zn-catenation site in the first finger, or one in the steroid-specificity domain at the base of the first finger converted GR into a dexamethasone-responsive activator that enhanced basal and interleukin 1-induced IL-6 promoter function.
 These first-finger mutants of GR also mediated dexamethasone-responsive enhancement of expression of the herpesvirus thymidine kinase-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (TK-105-CAT and TK-80-CAT) reporter genes but not of the murine mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat-CAT or the c-fos-CAT (pFC700) reporter genes.
 Wild-type GR was able to specifically bind to DNA fragments containing glucocorticoid response element sequences in both the murine mammary tumor virus and IL-6 promoters, albeit weakly to the latter, in a sequential DNA-binding immunoprecipitation assay.
 The first-finger mutants of GR, however, were inactive in this assay.
 Thus, mutations in the first Zn finger unmask unusual promoter-specific activation properties of GR that may not require direct high-affinity binding of the mutant GR to target DNA.
