Control of blood gas measurements in intensive-care units.
 The frequency of blood gas measurement in two adult intensive-care units was assessed for 7 months before and 12 months after introduction of a protocol of indications for such investigation.
 Demographic, diagnostic, outcome, and intervention data were collected prospectively.
 There were no differences in demographic characteristics, severity or type of illness, survival, or frequency of arterial or pulmonary artery catheter use between the two observation periods, but the frequency of blood gas analysis fell by 44% (p less than 0.001) after the protocol was introduced.
