Complications associated with brachytherapy alone or with laser in lung cancer.
 Relatively little has been reported about destruction through brachytherapy of mucosa-perforating and extraluminary tumors with probable large vessel involvement causing major hemorrhagic or fistular complications.
 We report 12 patients subjected to laser and brachytherapy for centrally occluding lung cancer, whom we have periodically followed up from June 1986 until they died.
 Although all laser procedures were free from complications, necrotic cavitation in five cases, two of which were accompanied by large bronchoesophageal fistulas, and massive fatal hemoptysis occurred in six.
 Minor complications included radiation mucositis (two), noncritical mucosal scarring (two), and cough (four).
 Characteristics that will identify patients at risk of developing fatal hemoptysis and fistulas should be better defined by imaging and endoscopic techniques.
 In such cases, modifying the protocol or using alternative procedures should be considered.
 Minor complications, such as cough, can be avoided by using topical steroid therapy (eg, beclomethasone dipropionate).
