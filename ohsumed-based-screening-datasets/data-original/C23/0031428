Prevalence and severity of morbidity among Gujarati Asian elders: a controlled comparison.
 Asian elders make relatively heavy use of health services: this may be due to higher levels of morbidity, but controlled comparisons have not been carried out.
 A comparison of the prevalence and severity of chronic diseases and use of health services of Asian and indigenous elders was made.
 A sample of 59 Gujarati Asians of mean age 62.9 years and 59 indigenous subjects of mean age 63.9 years of whom 42% (25 in each group) were female drawn from a general practice was studied.
 Asian subjects had a higher prevalence of diagnosed diseases, with the exception of chronic obstructive airways disease, but lower risk of falls and urinary incontinence.
 Asian subjects had higher life satisfaction scores and lower prevalence of depressed mood.
 Asian women were more likely to have had contact with primary care services.
 Both Asian men and women had more frequent hospital admissions, but similar levels of out-patient attendance.
 Body mass index, blood pressure and shoulder joint range of movement were similar for both Asians and the indigenous population.
 Asian subjects had significantly lower peak expiratory flow rates and hand grip strength.
 Asian elders have a higher risk of chronic diseases, but the impact of disease (indicated by life satisfaction, mood, and common disabilities) is less than among the indigenous population.
 Lower peak expiratory flow rates and grip strength among Asian elders are of concern since they may lead to premature arrival at age-related thresholds of physical capacity essential for independence in activities of daily living.
