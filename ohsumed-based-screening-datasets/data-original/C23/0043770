Jaundice and cholestasis. Some common and uncommon causes.
 Jaundiced patients may not always be as sick as they look, and cholestatic patients may be quite ill but not yet jaundiced.
 There is variability in presentation of cholestasis, and jaundice may be intrahepatic or extrahepatic and acute or chronic.
 Even though the diagnosis of jaundice can be elusive, an unnecessarily exhaustive search for a cause should be avoided, because some tests are not without dangers.
 Dr Gordon describes many possible causes, some of which are rare but are still worth consideration.
