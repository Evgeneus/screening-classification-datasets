Depression, chronic fatigue, and the premenstrual syndrome.
 Depression, chronic fatigue, and premenstrual syndrome often coexist in women seeking treatment for premenstrual distress.
 A reliable diagnosis can be made by prospectively rating symptoms for two cycles, taking a careful history, performing physical and gynecologic examinations, and obtaining basic laboratory test results and a psychosocial evaluation.
 Appropriate dietary, hormonal, or antidepressant treatment provided in a caring and competent manner can benefit many women suffering from this otherwise disabling/condition.
