Visualization of acute pulmonary emboli by transesophageal echocardiography.
 This report describes a patient who became hypoxic and hypotensive while awaiting cardiac surgery.
 An urgent transesophageal echocardiogram in the operating room showed a mass at the junction of the main and right pulmonary arteries consistent with thrombus.
 The thrombus was removed surgically, and the patient then had a successful aortic valve replacement.
 Transesophageal echocardiography is therefore useful in the evaluation of the critically ill patient.
