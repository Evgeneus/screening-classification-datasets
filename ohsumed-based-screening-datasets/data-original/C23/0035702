Renal atrophy or infarction in children with neuroblastoma.
 Twelve children with adrenal or upper abdominal paraaortic neuroblastoma developed unilateral or bilateral renal atrophy or infarction.
 At presentation, the children ranged in age from 2 weeks to 9.7 years.
 Neuroblastomas were stage II (n = 1), III (n = 2), IV-S (n = 2), and IV (n = 7).
 Treatment varied but included surgery, chemotherapy, localized abdominal irradiation, and/or bone marrow transplantation.
 Six children developed ipsilateral renal atrophy, five experienced ipsilateral or bilateral acute perioperative renal infarction, and one developed contralateral renal infarction unrelated to surgery.
 During treatment, two patients required hemodialysis; both subsequently died.
 Creatinine concentrations in eight patients have been in the normal range.
 Two patients have had mildly but persistently elevated creatinine levels.
 Renal damage from primary effects of the tumor can develop in children with adrenal or upper abdominal neuroblastoma.
 Treatment, especially surgical resection of the primary tumor, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy, can compound such damage.
