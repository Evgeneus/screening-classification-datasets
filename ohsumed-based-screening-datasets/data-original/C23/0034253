Laceration of the left pulmonary artery during removal of a bronchogenic cyst by right thoracotomy.
 Major vascular involvement by a bronchogenic cyst is rare; most large cysts cause respiratory symptoms.
 We present a case in which a large bronchogenic cyst was adherent to the left pulmonary artery.
 During removal of the cyst by right thoracotomy, the artery lacerated.
 Repair of the artery in such a situation taxes the surgeon's ingenuity and decision-making process.
