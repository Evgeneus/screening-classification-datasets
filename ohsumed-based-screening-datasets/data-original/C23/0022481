Pathophysiology of ischemic skin flaps: differences in xanthine oxidase levels among rats, pigs, and humans.
 Oxygen-derived free radicals have been implicated in a variety of diseases and pathologic processes, including ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI).
 Based on experimental work with rat skin-flap models, the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO) has been proposed as a major source of free radicals responsible for tissue injury and flap necrosis.
 The presence of this enzyme is variable within different tissues of a specific species and between species.
 Xanthine oxidase levels in pig and human skin have not previously been reported.
 The activity of xanthine oxidase in the skin of rats (N = 16), pigs (N = 7), and humans (N = 8) was measured after varying intervals of ischemia and in the rat also following reperfusion.
 Control pig and human skin were found to contain minimal enzyme activity, almost 40 times less than that of the rat.
 In the rat, xanthine oxidase activity was stable throughout a prolonged period of ischemia, and a significant decrease in activity was found after 12 hours of reperfusion (p less than 0.05).
 In humans, xanthine oxidase activity was unaffected by ischemia time, and in the pig, it did not increase until 24 hours of ischemia (p less than 0.05).
 The potential sources of free radicals and the mechanism of action of xanthine oxidase and its inhibitor allopurinol in improving flap survival in different species are reviewed.
