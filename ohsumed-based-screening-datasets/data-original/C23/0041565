Relationship of temperature pattern and serious bacterial infections in infants 4 to 8 weeks old 24 to 48 hours after antibiotic treatment.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: A new management approach to selected febrile infants 4 to 8 weeks old evaluated for possible sepsis is outpatient ceftriaxone therapy, with subsequent re-evaluation 24 to 48 hours after presentation.
 This study assessed whether the temperature profile of such infants during the 24- to 48-hour period after treatment distinguished those with from those without serious bacterial infections (SBIs).
 DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive clinical study.
 PARTICIPANTS: One hundred sixty-one febrile infants 4 to 8 weeks old.
 SETTING: An urban pediatric emergency department and hospital.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: All infants underwent a sepsis evaluation (lumbar puncture, CBC/blood culture, and urinalysis/urine culture) and were hospitalized for at least 48 hours.
 Temperatures were measured on presentation and then every four hours during hospitalization.
 All infants received parenteral third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic therapy, and none received antipyretic medication unless fever was documented.
 Fever (rectal temperature of more than 38.0 C) was documented during the 24- to 48-hour period after presentation in 28 infants (17.6%)--one of a total of 18 infants (5.6%) with SBI and 27 of a total of 143 infants (19%) without SBI (alpha, more than .2: power .30).
 All bacterial isolates in cases of SBI were susceptible to third-generation cephalosporin antibiotics.
 All repeat blood and urine cultures that were performed in infants with bacteremia or urinary tract infections, respectively, were negative 24 hours after presentation.
 CONCLUSION: Infants 4 to 8 weeks old who remain febrile during the 24 to 48-hour period after presentation and initiation of parenteral antibiotic therapy are less likely to have SBI.
 This study did not have sufficient power for this difference to be statistically significant.
