Secondary femoral-distal bypass.
 Thirty-nine secondary femoral-distal (femorotibial and femoroperoneal) bypasses were reviewed and compared to 89 primary femoral-distal bypasses (done during the same time period) to investigate the efficacy of secondary femoral-distal bypass.
 Graft patency at 2 years by life table analysis was similar in both groups (38% primary group vs 36% secondary group).
 However, limb salvage was significantly less in the secondary group (52% vs 68% at 2 years, p less than 0.05).
 This decrease was primarily due to poorer limb salvage using composite grafts (prosthetic/vein) compared to vein grafts in patients who underwent secondary femoral-distal bypasses (37% vs 76% at 2 years, p less than 0.05).
 Postoperative wound infections and mortality were similar in both groups.
 Thus, femoral-distal bypass after failure of a previous infrainguinal reconstruction offers good long-term limb salvage with acceptable surgical risk when autologous vein is available for use as the arterial conduit.
