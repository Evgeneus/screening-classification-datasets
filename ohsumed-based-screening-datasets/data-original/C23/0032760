Disappearance of thalamic pain after parietal subcortical stroke.
 A hypertensive man had a long standing history of contumacious hyperpathia in the right upper extremity, resistant to medical therapy, secondary to a lacunar infarct in the left thalamus.
 A second cerebrovascular accident caused a small lesion in the left corona radiata, interrupting the thalamoparietal interconnections, and terminated the pain instantly.
 Interruption of the subcortical parietal white matter may more effectively control pain than cortical lesions.
 A few surgeons have successfully treated rebellious chronic pain with stereotaxic operations in the corona radiata, resulting in lesions very similar to our patient's.
 This overlooked and nearly forgotten technique may still have value in treating selected cases.
