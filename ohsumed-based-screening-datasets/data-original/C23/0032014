Radical hysterectomy morbidity in relation to age.
 The complications of radical hysterectomy in patients 65 years and older were compared with those in women younger than 65.
 There was no statistical difference in complication rates between the two groups, although the older women had a significantly higher incidence of preoperative medical problems.
 No surgical deaths occurred in either group.
 Our data indicate that selected older women can tolerate radical hysterectomy as well as younger ones.
