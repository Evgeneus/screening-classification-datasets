Bcl-2 is an inner mitochondrial membrane protein that blocks programmed cell death.
 The t(14; 18) chromosomal translocation of human follicular B-cell lymphoma juxtaposes the bcl-2 gene with the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus.
 The bcl-2 immunoglobulin fusion gene is markedly deregulated resulting in inappropriately elevated levels of bcl-2 RNA and protein.
 Transgenic mice bearing a bcl-2 immunoglobulin minigene demonstrate a polyclonal expansion of resting yet responsive IgM-IgD B cells which display prolonged cell survival but no increase in cell cycling.
 Moreover, deregulated bcl-2 extends the survival of certain haematopoietic cell lines following growth-factor deprivation.
 By using immunolocalization studies we now demonstrate that Bcl-2 is an integral inner mitochondrial membrane protein of relative molecular mass 25,000 (25k).
 Overexpression of Bcl-2 blocks the apoptotic death of a pro-B-lymphocyte cell line.
 Thus, Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and interfering with programmed cell death independent of promoting cell division.
