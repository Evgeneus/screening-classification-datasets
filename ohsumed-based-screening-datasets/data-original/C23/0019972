A new technique of surgical treatment of chronic duodenal ulcer without laparotomy by videocoelioscopy.
 We performed truncal posterior right vagotomy with lesser curve anterior gastric myotomy by videocoelioscopy on 10 patients (5 men and 5 women, ranging in age from 19 and 54 years, with a mean age of 32 years).
 All had a long history of chronic duodenal ulcer with a mean duration of symptoms of 3.8 years.
 The mean length of the operation was 60 minutes (range: 55 to 110 minutes).
 There was no morbidity, and all patients were discharged after 5 days.
 The acid secretion tests under basal conditions and under insulin stimulation preoperatively and 1 month postoperatively showed a mean decrease in the basal output of 79.3% and a mean decrease of 83.04% in the maximal output.
 The fibroscopic control at the second postoperative month showed a complete healing of the ulcer in nine patients and a residual ulcer scar in one.
 No patients had any abdominal complaints.
 Right truncal vagotomy and anterior lesser curve seromyotomy by videocoelioscopy is an efficient and elegant method of treating chronic duodenal ulcer, but it needs thorough experimental practice.
