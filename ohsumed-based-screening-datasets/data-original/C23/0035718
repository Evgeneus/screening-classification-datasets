CT-guided percutaneous transpedicular biopsy of the spine.
 Occasionally, vertebral body lesions are encountered that are ill suited to the standard posterolateral approach to biopsy.
 The authors used a transpedicular approach to spine biopsy in six such cases.
 The authors suggest that this approach be used when the location of the lesion does not allow easy access by means of the posterolateral approach.
