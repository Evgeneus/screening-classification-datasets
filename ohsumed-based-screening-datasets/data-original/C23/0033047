Symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following tumor resection: report of two cases.
 The authors report two cases of symptomatic cerebral vasospasm following resection of an acoustic neuroma and a left sphenoid wing meningioma.
 Vascular spasm was documented by transcranial Doppler and angiography studies.
 Both patients responded to hypervolemic therapy.
 Possible mechanisms contributing to this rare complication are discussed.
