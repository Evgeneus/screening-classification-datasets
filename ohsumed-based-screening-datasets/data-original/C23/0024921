Quantitative coronary arteriographic methods in the interventional catheterization laboratory: an update and perspective.
 Recent research advances in the area of quantitative coronary arteriography are described with respect to their potential role in assessing the effects of interventional therapy and monitoring the restenosis process.
 Specific areas emphasized are the importance of quantitative arteriography and absolute measures of arterial dimension in monitoring restenosis, the development of a computerized method for measuring lesion roughness, the potential role of measuring stenosis flow reserve based on component analysis principles, limitations of direct measures of myocardial flow reserve using a digital angiographic method and cautionary notes about clinical applications of videodensitometry.
 The current use of radiography and quantitative measures in limiting arterial injury are briefly reviewed.
 Finally, a perspective is put forth on the need to develop complementary roles for endovascular echocardiography and angioscopy with existing radiographic imaging technology.
