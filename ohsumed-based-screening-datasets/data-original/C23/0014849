Infrainguinal bypass surgery: factors determining late graft patency.
 The results of 373 infrainguinal bypass grafts, in a single centre, between 1980 and 1988 are reviewed.
 One hundred and thirty in situ vein (ISV), 47 reversed saphenous vein (RSV), 118 polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and 78 human umbilical vein (HUV) grafts were used.
 The indications for surgery were disabling claudication in 25 per cent of patients and limb salvage in 75 per cent.
 In 36 per cent of operations the distal anastomosis was above the knee and in 64 per cent it was below the knee.
 Overall 5-year patency rates and limb salvage rates respectively were, for ISV (41 and 69 per cent), RSV (62 and 90 per cent), PTFE (31 and 67 per cent) and HUV (29 and 59 per cent).
 There was no significant difference in patency among these grafts at the above-knee level, but significant differences between vein and prosthetic grafts were evident below the knee (P less than 0.001).
 Using a proportional hazards model the three factors that consistently correlated with late graft patency were graft type (P less than 0.001), site of distal anastomosis (P less than 0.001) and distal run-off (P less than 0.001).
 Overall, the results suggest that prosthetic grafts are a suitable alternative to autogenous vein when the distal anastomosis is above the knee, but vein should always be used, if available, below the knee joint.
