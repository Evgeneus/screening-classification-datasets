The transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the marrow after bone marrow transplantation.
 Of 14 patients who underwent allogeneic or syngeneic bone marrow transplantation, 6 had a transient appearance of small blastoid cells in the bone marrow after transplantation.
 Most of these patients (11) had leukemia, although 3 had severe aplastic anemia.
 The cells were 8-18 micron in diameter and had scant cytoplasm and dense nuclei with smooth, homogeneous chromatin.
 They often had distinct nuclear clefts.
 These cells constituted 4.0-21.3% of the total number of bone marrow cells.
 They were not reactive with peroxidase, alpha-naphtyl butylate esterase, naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase, or periodic acid-Schiff stains.
 Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that the small blastoid cells expressed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, Ia-like, CD19, and CD10 antigens and cytoplasmic mu heavy chains, indicating a precursor B-cell phenotype.
 CD20 antigen was not expressed on these cells.
 The data suggest that cytoplasmic mu may be expressed earlier than CD20 antigen in the differentiation of B-cell lineage.
 The morphologic, cytochemical, and immunophenotypic characteristics did not distinguish these nonneoplastic cells distinctly from leukemic lymphoblastic cells.
 The increase of small blastoid cells was a transient and self-limited phenomenon, in contrast to that of neoplastic blasts.
 These cells should be recognized as a common component of the bone marrow of marrow transplant recipients.
 The significance and role of these cells in immune recovery and hematopoiesis remain uncertain.
