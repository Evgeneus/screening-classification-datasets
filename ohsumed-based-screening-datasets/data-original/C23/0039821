Unrecognized stenosis by angiography documented by intravascular ultrasound imaging.
 This report documents how intravascular ultrasound imaging was used to diagnose a short "napkin-ring" stenosis that was missed by coronary angiography.
 Intravascular ultrasound revealed a lumen of 2.6 x 2.5 mm in diameter and 5.0 mm2 in cross-sectional area, with a residual atheroma that occluded 63% of available cross-sectional area at the stenosis.
