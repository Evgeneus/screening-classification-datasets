Hyperoxia prevents hypoxia-induced bronchial hyperreactivity via a cyclooxygenase-independent mechanism.
 We tested the hypothesis that prior exposure to alveolar hyperoxia prevents the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity, possibly via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism.
 In 15 sheep, specific lung resistance (sRL) was measured before and after 30 min of exposure to either air or a hypoxic gas mixture (13% O2).
 The sheep then inhaled 50 breaths of aerosolized 5% histamine solution (n = 9) or 10 breaths of 2.5% carbachol solution (n = 9), and measurements of sRL were repeated.
 On subsequent days the above protocols were repeated after a 30-min exposure to hyperoxia (O2 greater than or equal to 95%), without or after pretreatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg).
 After air-sham exposure, carbachol and histamine increased mean sRL to 370 +/- 40 (SE) and 309 +/- 65% of baseline, respectively.
 Exposure to the hypoxic gas mixture had no effect on baseline sRL but enhanced the airway responsiveness to carbachol and histamine; mean sRL increased to 740 +/- 104 and 544 +/- 76% of baseline, respectively (P less than 0.05).
 Prior 30-min exposure to hyperoxia prevented the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity to carbachol (sRL = 416 +/- 66% of baseline) and histamine (sRL = 292 +/- 41% of baseline) without affecting the airway responsiveness to these agents after air.
 Pretreatment with indomethacin did not reverse the protective effects of hyperoxia or the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity.
 We conclude that 1) prior exposure to alveolar hyperoxia prevents the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity and 2) neither the protective effects of hyperoxia nor the hypoxia-induced enhancement of bronchial reactivity is mediated via a cyclooxygenase-dependent mechanism.
