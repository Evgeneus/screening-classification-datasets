Effects of enflurane on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia.
 The effects of enflurane on cardiac electrophysiologic parameters and on inducibility of ventricular tachycardia (VT) by programmed stimulation were studied in 12 patients (11 men, 1 woman, mean age +/- standard deviation 55 +/- 8 years) with drug refractory sustained monomorphic VT who underwent transcatheter ablation with high-energy direct-current shocks.
 One catheter ablation procedure was performed in 10 patients, whereas 2 ablation sessions were necessary in 2 patients.
 Programmed ventricular stimulation was performed on 2 separate days (mean interval 19).
 There were 2 baseline studies, 1 several days before ("baseline study I") and the second at the beginning of the ablation procedure ("baseline study II") while the patient was awake and nonsedated.
 The third programmed stimulation study was done 15 to 30 minutes after administration of anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide ("enflurane study").
 Rate of sinus rhythm, QRS duration, PQ interval and ventricular effective refractory period were unaltered, whereas QTc interval increased significantly after initiation of anesthesia.
 Before and after induction of general anesthesia, clinical VT was inducible in all patients.
 However, in 1 patient, induction of VT was only possible by pacing in the left ventricle after enflurane administration.
 Based on these data, it is concluded that general anesthesia with enflurane, oxygen and nitrous oxide has no marked influence on inducibility of clinical VTs.
 Therefore, this type of anesthesia may be useful for nonpharmacologic, ablative procedures requiring general anesthesia.
