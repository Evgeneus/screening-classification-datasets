Steroid-responsive tubular aggregate myopathy.
 We report a man with an acute myalgia/cramp syndrome and tubular aggregates on his muscle biopsy.
 He was placed on prednisone and was found to be exquisitely sensitive to the drug, with changes of only 5 mg precipitating recurrence of symptoms.
 He was eventually tapered off all steroids, without symptoms, and repeat biopsy showed no tubular aggregates.
 We recommend similar patients be given a trial of high-dose steroids.
