Duplex Doppler sonography of the carotid artery: false-positive results in an artery contralateral to an artery with marked stenosis.
 Anecdotal reports have described a false-positive "jet effect" or velocity increase in the carotid artery contralateral to an artery with significant stenosis or occlusion when using duplex Doppler sonography.
 In this study, the frequency, significance, and possible reasons for this finding were evaluated by a retrospective comparison of duplex sonography and angiography.
 Twenty-three patients with unilateral 81-100% carotid artery stenosis who underwent both duplex sonography (16 Acuson, seven Quantum) and angiography were evaluated.
 In 14 patients, there was an accurate or slight underestimate (less than 20%) of stenosis present in the internal carotid artery contralateral to an artery with tight stenosis/occlusion.
 In nine, a velocity increase in the internal carotid artery resulted in overestimation (10-80%) of the actual degree of stenosis.
 In one of these nine patients, real-time images were sufficient to explain the velocity increase on the basis of vessel tortuosity.
 In one, falsely elevated velocity resulted from inaccurate assignment of the Doppler angle of incidence in a patient in whom real-time visualization of a distal internal carotid lesion was poor.
 In four of the nine patients, cross filling via the circle of Willis toward the side of greater stenosis occurred.
 However, seven of 14 patients in whom there was duplex sonography/angiography agreement or slight duplex sonography underestimation also had cross filling.
 Vertebral artery patency did not correlate well with the presence of a "jet effect." These findings suggest that an increase in blood flow velocity with duplex Doppler sonography in the internal carotid artery on the side opposite an artery with a tight stenosis is a common source of error and is not readily explained by angiographic evidence of collateral flow.
