Liver viability after ischemia-reperfusion.
 Lack of a reproducible model to quantitatively assess hepatocellular injury following ischemia has made it difficult to assess new strategies for minimizing hepatic injury.
 We studied the progression of hepatocellular injury after ischemia and ischemia with reperfusion in rats.
 Irreversible injury was quantitated using a triphenyltetrazolium chloride assay that was shown to correlate with ultrastructural changes.
 Adenosine triphosphate decreased to 36% of basal values after 30 minutes, but returned to normal with reperfusion with no decrease in viability.
 In contrast, viability fell by 30% after 60 minutes of ischemia, and by 64% when 60 minutes of ischemia was followed by reperfusion.
 We conclude that reperfusion of ischemic liver increases the degree of irreversible damage.
 The model employed here seems to be useful for studying ischemic and reperfusion injury in the liver.
