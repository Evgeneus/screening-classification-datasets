Natural anticoagulants in systemic lupus erythematosus. Deficiency of protein S bound to C4bp associates with recent history of venous thromboses, antiphospholipid antibodies, and the antiphospholipid syndrome.
 The association of thrombosis with antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) could be due to their interference with natural phospholipid dependent anticoagulant mechanisms.
 We studied antigenic protein C (APC), functional protein C (FPC), free protein S (FPS), protein S bound to C4 binding protein (C4bp-S), antithrombin III (ATIII), as well as IgG and IgM anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 38 patients with SLE with a history of thromboses and 70 patients with SLE without such history.
 We found a high frequency of deficiencies of natural anticoagulants in both groups of patients with SLE but, because of patient selection, we could not determine the actual prevalence of these defects.
 Patients having had a venous thrombosis in the previous year had low C4bp-S more frequently than patients with older or no thromboses.
 When we divided our patients with SLE into those who had a definite, probable, questionable or no antiphospholipid syndrome (aPS) we found the frequency of C4bp-S deficiency to be significantly higher in those with definite aPS than in those without aPS.
 Intermediate proportions were found in patients with probable and questionable aPS.
 The levels of C4bp-S decreased as the levels of aCL, particularly IgG, increased.
 Stepwise discriminant analysis of natural anticoagulants selected deficiencies of C4bp-S and FPC with increased ATIII as a set of variables with highest predictive power for classification of patients with and without aPS.
 Thus, deficiencies of natural anticoagulants may occur frequently in patients with SLE.
