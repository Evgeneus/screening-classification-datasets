The influence of exercise-induced temperature elevations on the auditory brain-stem response (ABR).
 The influence of exercise on the auditory brain-stem response (ABR) was examined in 16 healthy volunteers (8 female and 8 male).
 Ipsilateral ABR recordings were obtained before and after exercise on a bicycle ergonometer.
 The rise of body temperature so generated was 0.5-2.1 degrees C (mean, 1.3 degrees C) as measured in the contralateral external auditory meatus.
 Latencies of waves III and V (but not wave I) were found to be significantly lower immediately post-exercise (P less than 0.01).
 The temperature relations of the latency of wave V are described by the regression equation: Latency (ms) = 11.06-0.146 x temp.
 (degrees C).
 (The effects on amplitude were not significant, nor were male/female differences.) It is suggested that exercise hyperthermia could be an appropriate model for the evaluation of the ABR in fever.
