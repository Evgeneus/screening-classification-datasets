KTP laser stapedotomy: is it safe?
 Recent published concerns about the potential for visible light lasers to injure the inner ear have led to differing conclusions.
 While one has advised cautious application of a visible light laser, another eschewed visible light lasers in favor of the CO2 laser.
 Others have anguished over the efficacy of stapes surgeons as numbers of suitable candidates for otosclerosis surgery decline.
 In three years' experience with the KTP-532 laser, 80 primary and revision stapedotomies have been completed by this author.
 The author's experience with low morbidity and high air-bone gap closure rates are presented.
 The absence of apparent cochlear injury suggests that properly used KTP laser systems are safe.
 Competitive results were obtained with less than prolific numbers of stapes surgeries.
