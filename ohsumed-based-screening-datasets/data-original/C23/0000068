Skin manifestations in congenital deficiency of leucocyte-adherence glycoproteins (CDLG).
 In congenital deficiency of leucocyte-adherence glycoproteins (CDLG) there is an immunodeficiency with impaired leucocyte function and cutaneous and extracutaneous infections occur.
 In more than 30% of cases the condition has a fatal course.
 We report the skin manifestations of three siblings with CDLG in which areas of skin necrosis occurred that resembled pyoderma gangrenosum.
