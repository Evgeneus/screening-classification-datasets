Hearing aid evaluation and fitting.
 Although many patients with hearing loss benefit from medical or surgical intervention, the vast majority have noncorrectable hearing disorders for which rehabilitation through amplification is indicated.
 There are three goals for the application of hearing aids: (1) to amplify normal conversational speech to levels that are maximally understandable to the patient; (2) to help the patient hear other environmental sounds; and (3) to assist in the educational or habilitative process for those children who sustain hearing loss prior to language and speech development.
 In addition, there are certain issues that require medical consideration when a wearable device is placed in the ear.
 This article describes current hearing aid technology; reviews its benefits, limitations, and application for typical patients; discusses the medical aspects of hearing aid fitting; and describes new hearing aid technology on the horizon.
