Correlation between histology and nerve excitability after reinnervation of paralyzed strap muscles in the rabbit.
 We have recently shown that the mean muscle chronaxie for nerve pedicle implanted into denervated rabbit strap muscle is comparable to that of normal nerve.
 This study correlates excitability with histologic characteristics of muscles reinnervated via nerve-muscle pedicles (NMP) and direct nerve implants (DNI).
 Strength duration curves were measured in 13 rabbits 3.5 to 5 months after reinnervation by NMP (n = 6) and DNI (n = 7).
 Following this, control (n = 5) and reinnervated straps were harvested immediately before the animals were killed and frozen in liquid nitrogen.
 The material was submitted for hematoxylin-eosin stains as well as trichrome stains for general morphology, myofibrillar ATPase and NADH for fiber typing, and cholinesterase for determination of denervated fibers.
 In all animals with low chronaxie, expected type grouping from reinnervation was noted (n = 10).
 By contrast, the three animals in which chronaxie was abnormally elevated demonstrated fibrosis, inflammation, and absence of or poor type grouping.
 This suggests that type grouping is necessary for excitability after reinnervation of paralyzed striated muscles.
