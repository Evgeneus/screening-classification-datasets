Ligamentous compression of the celiac axis: CT findings in five patients.
 Compression of the celiac trunk by the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm is an uncommon angiographic and surgical finding that rarely may be symptomatic.
 We retrospectively reviewed contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans in five patients with severe ligamentous compression of the celiac axis, confirmed by surgery and/or angiography, and compared the findings with those of enhanced scans of 100 consecutive patients without known ligamentous compression.
 In all five patients with ligamentous celiac artery compression, CT showed effacement or narrowing of the celiac trunk by an anterior soft-tissue band.
 Dilated peripancreatic collateral vessels were seen in four cases, and poststenotic dilatation of the distal celiac trunk was seen in two cases.
 The normal appearance of the vasculature was seen in the majority (76%) of the 100 control subjects, but in eight patients the celiac origin was obscured on CT scans, and in 16 patients the celiac trunk appeared narrow or effaced.
 Our experience suggests that severe ligamentous celiac artery compression can be identified on CT.
 However, the isolated CT finding of effacement or obscuration of the celiac axis occurs sufficiently often in normal patients that it is not adequate evidence to establish the diagnosis of celiac artery compression.
