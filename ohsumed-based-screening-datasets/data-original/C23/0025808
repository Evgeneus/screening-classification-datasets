Coronary-subclavian steal corrected with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
 We describe a case of coronary-subclavian steal syndrome treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
 A 58-year-old female who had her first coronary bypass operation 6 years previously and a second operation 3 years previously involving the left internal mammary artery and right gastroepiploic artery, developed unusual angina on effort characterized by left precordial pain, pain in the left shoulder and arm, tinnitus and dizziness.
 Angiography revealed retrograde flow to the left subclavian artery via the left vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery.
 Severe stenosis of the left subclavian artery was demonstrated at its ostium.
 Restoration of antegrade flow to the vertebral artery and left internal mammary artery by transluminal angioplasty resulted in complete resolution of these symptoms.
