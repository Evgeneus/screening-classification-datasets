The cold-knife technique for endourological management of stenoses in the upper urinary tract.
 Between 1985 and October 1989 we managed 13 patients with primary and 43 with secondary obstruction of the upper urinary tract with the endourological cold-knife technique.
 We treated 26 patients with stenosis of the ureteropelvic junction, 9 with infundibular stenosis, 12 with ureteral obstruction after inflammation or radiation therapy, 7 with stricture of the ureter in kidney transplants and 2 with stenosis of the ureter after ureterosigmoidostomy.
 Endourological management was successful in 42 of 56 cases with a decrease or total elimination of obstruction.
 Stenosis recurred in 9 patients.
 Our results indicate that the cold-knife technique should be attempted as the initial approach in all cases of primary or secondary obstruction of the upper urinary tract.
