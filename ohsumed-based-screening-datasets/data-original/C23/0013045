Nodular regenerative hyperplasia: a cause of ascites and hepatomegaly after chemotherapy for leukemia.
 Tender hepatomegaly and ascites occurred in a young woman receiving cytosine arabinoside and daunorubicin for acute myelogenous leukemia.
 Whereas veno-occlusive disease was suspected clinically, liver biopsy showed nodular regenerative hyperplasia with no evidence of hepatic vein abnormalities.
 It is postulated that nodular regenerative hyperplasia can be initiated by hepatotoxicity of chemotherapy agents used to treat leukemia and/or that these agents exacerbate clinical manifestations of this histological abnormality.
 Nodular regenerative hyperplasia should be added to the list of liver problems occurring in patients with leukemia.
