Isotopic study of the effects of platelets on development of intimal thickening in autologous vein grafts in dogs.
 The effects of platelets on the development of intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts was investigated using canine poor run-off models.
 A new apparatus consisting of a shielding lead block to measure in vivo platelet adherence only on the intima of the vein graft was developed.
 In 23 dogs, 51Cr-labelled platelets (20 microCi/kg) were injected and isotope emission over the grafts was counted.
 Platelet adherence was expressed as the thrombocyte accumulation index (TAI), i.e.
 the ratio of counts over the graft under an abnormal flow condition in the poor run-off model to those over the graft under normal flow conditions of the contralateral leg.
 The TAI of the total graft (TTAI) was significantly high immediately and on the first and third days after implantation.
 The TAIs of the proximal (PTAI) and distal (DTAI) portions of the vein graft were also high at these same times.
 At 7, 10, 14 and 21 days, the TAI was almost equal to 1.0, a time at which endothelial regeneration was complete as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy.
 Thus, the prominent intimal thickening of arterially transplanted autologous vein grafts in dogs, induced under an abnormal flow condition, correlates well with the enhanced platelet adherence on the intima of the vein grafts in an early period after implantation.
