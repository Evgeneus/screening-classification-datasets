Cor triatriatum with isolated pulmonary venous stenosis in an adult: diagnosis with transesophageal two-dimensional echocardiography.
 The diagnosis of cor triatriatum in an adult was made from routine two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography.
 The findings of aliasing and turbulence in the roof of the left atrium suggested pulmonary venous stenosis.
 A transesophageal echocardiogram defined both the hemodynamic features of nonobstructing cor triatriatum and the presence of isolated pulmonary venous stenosis.
 The clinical use of transesophageal echocardiography with color flow Doppler in the elucidation of complex anatomic substrate is demonstrated.
