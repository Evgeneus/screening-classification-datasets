Long-term results of peridural morphine in 225 patients.
 The long-term results of peridural morphine in 225 cancer patients have been evaluated.
 Two methods were employed: percutaneously implanted catheter (175 patients) and subcutaneous reservoirs (50 patients).
 In the 225 patients, the mean duration of implantation of the peridural catheter was 47.3 days (7-420 days), the mean daily dose of morphine was 13.4 +/- 6.9 (5-80 mg) delivered by 2.6 +/- 0.7 (1-8) injections.
 The mean duration of action was calculated to be 9.3 +/- 3.8 h (3-32 h).
 Satisfactory analgesia was achieved in 133 patients (59.1%) in whom peridural morphine was the sole analgesic treatment.
 Peridural morphine appeared to be especially effective in patients with pain arising in the abdominal region.
 Complications due to morphine and the catheter were evaluated.
