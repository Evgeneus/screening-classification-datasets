High-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase in serum has properties similar to the enzyme in plasma membranes of the liver.
 Partially purified high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase from serum was compared with two other forms of the enzyme from the human liver, enzyme in native plasma membranes and purified alkaline phosphatase as a hydrophilic dimer.
 In a high-molecular-weight form from serum and plasma membranes, and when treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, alkaline phosphatase showed a major band on gradient gel electrophoresis with a mobility equivalent to 400 kD.
 Nondetergent-treated material from both sources did not enter the gel and was in the voided volume of a gel permeation column.
 Stimulation of catalytic activity by four different phospholipids and by albumin yielded similar results for high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase and for the enzyme in plasma membranes, but these were different from the hydrophilic form.
 Inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase had similar effects on all forms.
 Of the three forms of the enzyme, only the hydrophilic dimer did not become incorporated into liposomes or adsorb to octyl-Sepharose after solubilization with Triton X-100 and removal of the detergent.
 Km (substrate concentration to give half maximal velocity) values with p-nitrophenylphosphate and heat and sodium dodecyl sulfate stabilities were similar for all forms.
 In the high-molecular-weight form from serum and in plasma membranes, alkaline phosphatase and 5'-nucleotidase showed similar rates of release by phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C.
 Three preparations of phospholipase D failed to release alkaline phosphatase from either the high-molecular-weight form or from plasma membranes.
 Based on these similarities, it is probable that the complex of high-molecular-weight alkaline phosphatase in serum most often originates from fragments of hepatic plasma membranes.
