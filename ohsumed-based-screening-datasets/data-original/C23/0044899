Complement activation during bypass in acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.
 Serial complement estimations during cardiopulmonary bypass are reported in a patient with acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency.
 Although the extent of classic and alternative pathway activation appeared appropriate, exaggerated common pathway activation with massive increase in the C3d:C3 ratio occurred.
 A fatal hemostatic disorder, pulmonary edema, and circulatory collapse ensued despite prophylaxis and therapy.
