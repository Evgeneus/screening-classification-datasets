Retrospective postmortem dementia assessment. Validation of a new clinical interview to assist neuropathologic study.
 Neuropathologic studies of dementia and normal aging suffer from a lack of individuals examined for the presence and severity of dementia before death.
 To increase clinical information in such cases, a retrospective collateral interview was developed.
 Thirty-nine individuals were studied; 27 had autopsies.
 In all cases, the autopsy confirmed the Retrospective Collateral Dementia Interview (RCDI) diagnosis of the presence or absence of dementia; the RCDI had a sensitivity of 88% and a specificity of 80% for specifically detecting probable Alzheimer's disease.
 Agreement between the RCDI and premortem diagnosis was 96%; between RCDI and medical records, 100%.
 Agreement between RCDI staging of dementia severity and the last assessment of the living subject was 70%; between the RCDI and a brief staging at death, 86%.
 This validation confirms the value of postmortem interviews with close informants to assess dementia presence and severity.
