A huge intracranial xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa: case report.
 Xanthogranulomas of the dura presenting with clinical symptoms are rare.
 We report here a case of a huge dural xanthogranuloma in the middle cranial fossa, which caused hemiparesis through marked displacement and stenosis of the middle cerebral artery.
 Although such tumors usually arise in association with histiocytosis X or familial hyperlipoproteinemia, the present case was not associated with these diseases.
