Development of language in six hemispherectomized patients.
 The development of language skills in the isolated right hemisphere was investigated by comparing the performance of 3 left hemispherectomized with that of the 3 right hemispherectomized patients and three groups of control subjects on baseline clinical measures of language and on production and judgement of morphological markers.
 The initial brain insult in the hemispherectomy patients of each group had occurred either during early, middle or late childhood.
 The left hemispherectomy patients were severely impaired in language processing across all three stages of language development.
 The consequences of a right hemisphere insult on language development were more restricted, with deleterious effects being apparent only in the case in which the lesion was acquired during early childhood.
