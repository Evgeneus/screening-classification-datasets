Cardiopulmonary perfusion and cerebral blood flow in bilateral carotid artery disease 
 The fear of cerebral complications after cardiopulmonary bypass in patients with heart disease and severe carotid artery disease has led many authors to suggest combined approaches in these patients.
 The pathogenetic mechanism for stroke is based partly on the stenotic narrowing of the carotid artery.
 A diameter reduction of 75% is frequently considered hemodynamically significant and indicative of an increased risk for neurological morbidity.
 We studied the cerebral blood flow in 7 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting who also had severe bilateral carotid disease.
 The results were compared with the results in 17 patients without carotid disease who had bypass grafting.
 The cerebral blood flow was measured by xenon 133 washout technique before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass with moderate hypothermia.
 Acid-base regulation was according to the alpha-stat theory, and blood pressure was kept greater than 50 mm Hg.
 The cerebral blood flow levels (mL.100g-1.min-1) before, during, and after cardiopulmonary bypass in the study group (30 +/- 11, 31 +/- 8, 47 +/- 20) (mean +/- standard deviation) were almost identical to those in the control group (30 +/- 11, 28 +/- 8, 47 +/- 12).
 The cerebral blood flow levels for the left and right hemispheres in the group with carotid disease were comparable and within normal ranges.
 In 2 patients, slight differences were noted between hemispheres, and this finding may indicate an increased risk for ischemia.
 These patients, however, did not show any signs of postoperative deficit.
 The flow limitations of critical carotid stenoses do not seem to imply a risk for cerebral hypoperfusion if cardiopulmonary perfusion is performed in a controlled manner.
