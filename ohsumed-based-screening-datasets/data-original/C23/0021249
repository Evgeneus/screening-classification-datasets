Neurogenic inflammation of the rat trachea: fate of neutrophils that adhere to venules.
 The goal of this study was to determine whether neutrophils that adhere to the vascular endothelium in association with neurogenic inflammation in the respiratory tract migrate out of the blood vessels or whether they detach and reenter the circulation.
 We also sought to determine whether the fate of the neutrophils is influenced by neutral endopeptidase (NEP), an enzyme that degrades the tachykinins that produce neurogenic inflammation.
 Neutrophils in the tracheal mucosa of anesthetized pathogen-free rats were examined 5 min or 4 h after neurogenic inflammation was produced by an injection of capsaicin (100 or 200 micrograms/kg iv).
 In whole mounts of these tracheae stained histochemically for myeloperoxidase, adherent intravascular neutrophils had a spherical or teardrop (regular) shape and migrating neutrophils had a polarized amoeboid (irregular) shape.
 The number of regular neutrophils in the tracheae was increased at both times, but the increase at 4 h was only half that present at 5 min.
 The reduction between 5 min and 4 h was not offset by an appreciable increase in the number of irregular neutrophils, unless NEP was inhibited by phosphoramidon.
 We interpret these results as indicating that the rapid adherence of neutrophils to the vascular endothelium after an injection of capsaicin is followed by a gradual reentry of the neutrophils into the circulation and comparatively little neutrophil migration.
 However, when the effect of the stimulus is increased and/or prolonged by inhibition of NEP, some of the adherent neutrophils migrate out of the vessels.
 Thus the activity of NEP can regulate both the magnitude of the neutrophil adherence and the fate of the adherent cells.
