Chromosomal analysis of unfertilized oocytes and morphologically abnormal preimplantation embryos from an in vitro fertilization program.
 In vitro fertilization cycles yield a low percentage of pregnancies.
 Eighty-five to ninety percent of the transferred embryos do not implant, and the abortion rate approaches 30%.
 Aneuploidy is assumed to be responsible for a major portion of this pregnancy wastage.
 The purpose of this study was to determine if there was any correlation between morphology and chromosomal content of unfertilized oocytes and rejected embryos.
 To assess the chromosomal content of oocytes and embryos, we used the method described by Tarkowski in 1966.
 Sixty oocytes fron 28 women, aged between 27 and 41 years, were analyzed.
 Sixty-seven percent were aneuploid; of these, 23.35% were hyperhaploid, 23.35% were hypohaploid, 8.35% were hyperdiploid, 3.35% were diploid, and 8.35% showed premature chromosome condensation.
 Of 20 preimplantation embryos analyzed, 80% were aneuploid, 10% were diploid, 5% were haploid, and 5% showed structural anomaly.
 Correlation was found between maternal age and aneuploidy in oocytes and between morphology and genetic balance in preimplantation embryos.
