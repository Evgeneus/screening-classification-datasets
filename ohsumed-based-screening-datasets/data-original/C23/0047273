Study of belching ability in antireflux surgery patients and normal volunteers.
 The ability to belch was evaluated by a novel test, after gaseous stomach distension to standard volume, in 16 patients after antireflux surgery and nine healthy volunteers.
 A structured assessment of dyspeptic symptoms was also carried out in both groups.
 Repeat studies in volunteers showed acceptable reproducibility for the new test of belching capacity (within-subject coefficient of variance 4.5 per cent).
 After antireflux surgery, patients had lower volume individual belches (median(range) 27.5(0-104) ml in patients versus 76(15-165) ml in volunteers; P less than 0.02) and belched less gas within 1 h of the stimulus than volunteers (median(range) 205(0-1363) ml in patients versus 456(45-818) ml in volunteers; P less than 0.05).
 Belching frequency was similar in both groups.
 The incidence and severity of symptoms were unrelated to belched gas volumes.
