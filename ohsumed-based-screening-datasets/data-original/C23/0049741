Acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation analgesia in comparison with moderate-dose fentanyl anaesthesia in major surgery. Clinical efficacy and influence on recovery and morbidity 
 The efficacy of acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation analgesia, supplemented by small doses of fentanyl (mean 1.2 micrograms/kg, SD 1.7) was compared with moderate-dose fentanyl anaesthesia (mean 22.9 micrograms/kg, SD 2.8) in 29 patients who underwent surgery for retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.
 The present study describes the anaesthetic techniques and comparison of haemodynamics, demand for analgesics after surgery, recovery and blood gases, restoration of urinary and bowel functions, convalescence in terms of self-reliance and the postoperative course in respect of fatigue and morbidity.
 A more rapid return of consciousness, an absence of hypercapnia and a smaller decrease in pH were observed in patients who received acupuncture and transcutaneous stimulation (p less than 0.05).
 No clinically relevant disadvantages attributable to the method were demonstrated.
