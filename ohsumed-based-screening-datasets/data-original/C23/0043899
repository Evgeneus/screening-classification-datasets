Short-term variation in abnormal antenatal fetal heart rate records.
 In a retrospective study the relation of reduced fetal heart rate variation to fetal acidemia was analyzed with a computerized system for numeric analysis.
 Between 1983 and 1987, 78 pregnancies were identified in which at least one record of the fetal heart rate had very low long-term variation.
 The outcome was analyzed to determine the numeric criteria of fetal heart rate variation that most efficiently detect a fetus that will die (preterminal) or is dying (terminal).
 Because fetal compromise was found on occasion to be associated with a slow sinusoidal fetal heart rate rhythm that increased measures of long-term variation.
 It was necessary to define a new index of short-term fetal heart rate variation (the 1/16 minute epoch-epoch variation).
 This was closely related to long-term variation (r = 0.9) but provided better detection of preterminal records as judged by metabolic acidemia at delivery or intrauterine death.
