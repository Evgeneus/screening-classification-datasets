Combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon. Results in patients who have a varus deformity of the foot due to spastic cerebral palsy.
 Twenty patients who had a varus deformity of the foot secondary to spastic cerebral palsy had twenty-two operations involving combined split anterior tibial-tendon transfer and intramuscular lengthening of the posterior tibial tendon, with and without concomitant lengthening of the Achilles tendon.
 Preoperatively, all patients had had a dynamic varus deformity of the hindfoot and adduction of the forefoot in both the stance phase and the swing phase of gait.
 At an average follow-up of 6.2 years (range, 2.3 to 8.8 years), there were fourteen excellent, four good, and four poor clinical results.
 Two patients who had a fixed varus deformity of the hindfoot and one patient who had a very weak anterior tibial muscle had a poor result.
 We concluded that the combined procedure is effective for correction of a flexible varus deformity of the foot in patients who have spastic cerebral palsy.
