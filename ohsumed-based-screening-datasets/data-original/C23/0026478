Non-antireflux versus antireflux ureteroneocystostomy in adults.
 A retrospective analysis of ureteric reimplantation in adults showed that a high proportion (71%) had been treated by non-antireflux procedures.
 Analysis of the ureteroneocystostomy success rate in aetiological groups where either antireflux or non-antireflux techniques were used indicated the superiority of antireflux surgery in the prevention of reflux.
 The risk of stenosis at the site of anastomosis was equal in both groups.
 No significant difference in the preservation of renal function was detected in the 2 groups.
 It was concluded that antireflux procedures offered no advantage over non-antireflux ureteric reimplantation in adults.
