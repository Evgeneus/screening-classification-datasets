Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, morphea, and coexistence of both diseases. Histological studies using lectins.
 Histological studies using three lectins, lens culinaris agglutinin, soybean agglutinin, and Ulex europaeus agglutinin-I, were carried out in a case of coexistent lichen sclerosus et atrophicus and morphea, five cases of morphea, and two cases of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.
 The lectin staining patterns of the formaldehyde-fixed epidermis of patients with morphea were not different from those of normal epidermis, but epidermis of patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus showed different staining patterns.
 Lens culinaris agglutinin stained the basal and the spinous layers of the normal epidermis and that of patients with morphea but stained only the basal cells of the epidermis from patients with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus; epidermal Ulex europaeus agglutinin binding was observed only in the cases of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.
 Moreover, in the patient with coexistent diseases, the morphea lesion showed the staining profiles of morphea and the lichen sclerosus et atrophicus lesion showed the staining patterns of lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, respectively.
