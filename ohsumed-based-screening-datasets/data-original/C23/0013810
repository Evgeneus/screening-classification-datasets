Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web 
 Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved.
 Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history.
 We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke.
