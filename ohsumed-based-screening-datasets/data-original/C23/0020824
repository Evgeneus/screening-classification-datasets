Recurrent herpes gestationis with postpartum flare: a case report.
 A case of herpes gestationis recurring in each pregnancy, with a postpartum flare-up in the last pregnancy, is described.
 The diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy.
 The first pregnancy ended in a term stillbirth, but there were favorable outcomes in four subsequent pregnancies.
 Histopathologic examination of the placentas of the last three pregnancies revealed varying grades of villositis.
 Symptoms improved with oral corticosteroids.
