Research and policy directions. Salt and blood pressure.
 The relation between dietary intake of sodium chloride and blood pressure levels remains controversial.
 The critical questions concern whether there is a susceptible subgroup at risk of elevated blood pressure because of sodium chloride consumption.
 If there is such a subgroup, what is its size and how can it be identified? Further clinical trials are needed to determine the long-term effects of sodium chloride reduction on blood pressure.
 The risk of disease, including stroke and coronary heart disease, is linear with blood pressure levels.
 A small change in blood pressure can have a relatively large impact on disease, even within the normal range of blood pressure.
