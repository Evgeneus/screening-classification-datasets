Scleroderma and L-tryptophan: a possible explanation of the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.
 Scleroderma developed in six women who were taking L-tryptophan.
 Fasciitis and morphea were most common, but one patient had pleural effusion, hypertension, and signs of cardiac and kidney failure.
 In five patients the biopsy findings were characteristic of scleroderma; the sixth patient had Crohn's disease and developed fasciitis; her biopsy specimen showed inflammatory arteritis.
 All patients' conditions improved after cessation of their L-tryptophan intake, initiation of corticosteroid therapy, or both.
 These findings confirm previous data that show altered tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in some patients with scleroderma and fasciitis, particularly with tryptophan loading.
