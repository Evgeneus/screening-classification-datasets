Exposure of the intracavernous carotid artery in aneurysm surgery.
 The pterional intradural approach was used in five cases of large and giant carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms and in two cases of intracavernous aneurysms that arose from the anterior siphon knee in the cavernous sinus (CS) and extended into the carotid cistern.
 In four cases of large carotid-ophthalmic aneurysms removal of the anterior clinoid process and the roof of the optic canal gave easy access to the pericarotid ring.
 The anteromedial part of the pericarotid ring was dissected to expose the extradural portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) proximal to the neck and to make enough room between the wall of the CS and the extradural portion of the ICA, thus allowing easy clipping of the neck.
 In one case of a giant carotid-ophthalmic aneurysm extending into the CS with an extradural origin of the ophthalmic artery and in two cases of an intracavernous aneurysm arising from the siphon knee, neck clipping was performed by opening the lateral wall and roof of the CS after removal of the optic strut.
 The opening of the lateral wall anterior to the 3rd nerve facilitated wide exposure of the anterior siphon knee.
 The horizontal portion of the intracavernous ICA as well as the whole aspect of the aneurysm could be exposed as a result of the extended opening of the cavernous roof anterior to the posterior clinoid process.
 Successful operative results were obtained in all seven patients.
 A visual field detect as an operative complication was noted in one patient.
 No disturbance of ocular movements was noted.
