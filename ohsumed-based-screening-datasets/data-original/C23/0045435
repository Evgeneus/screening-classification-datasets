Detection of inadvertent respiratory placement of small-bore feeding tubes: a report of 10 cases.
 Documented inadvertent respiratory placement of small-bore feeding tubes was identified in 10 patients over a 2-year period in five intensive care units and two general wards.
 Types and effectiveness of bedside methods used by clinicians to test tube position were described.
 The most frequently used methods were observation for respiratory distress and auscultation of the abdomen during air insufflations through the tubes.
 It was concluded that commonly used bedside methods to test feeding tube placement often gave false reassurance that the tubes were properly positioned.
