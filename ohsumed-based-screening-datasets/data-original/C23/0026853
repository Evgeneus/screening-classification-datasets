Posttraumatic stress disorder following recent-onset psychosis. An unrecognized postpsychotic syndrome.
 Clinical experience with psychotic patients early in the course of their illness suggested that symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may not be uncommon after recovery from an acute psychotic episode.
 Thirty-six patients recovering from an acute psychotic episode within 2 to 3 years of onset of their illness were assessed as inpatients and followed up on two occasions during the year after discharge.
 The prevalence of PTSD was found to be 46% at 4 months and 35% at 11 months, measured by a questionnaire linked to DSM-III criteria.
 The relationships between negative symptomatology and PTSD symptoms and between depressive symptomatology and PTSD symptoms were also examined; a significant correlation was found only for the latter.
 The psychopathological, preventive, and therapeutic implications of these findings are discussed, and future research strategies are proposed.
