Emergency management of the adult female rape victim.
 Estimates are that one in every six women is raped during her lifetime.
 The family physician must be able to evaluate and treat the rape victim in the emergency setting.
 A detailed history, careful physical examination, collection of medical specimens for legal purposes, assessment of the patient's psychologic state, prophylaxis of venereal disease and pregnancy counseling are required.
