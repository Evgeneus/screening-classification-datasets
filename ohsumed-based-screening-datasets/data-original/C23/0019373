'Two-stage turbinectomy': sequestration of the inferior turbinate following submucosal diathermy.
 Submucous diathermy of the inferior turbinates is a widely practised procedure.
 Three cases are presented in which surgery was complicated by avascular necrosis of the turbinate bone.
 Each patient required a debridement procedure before healing and recovery of normal mucociliary function could take place.
