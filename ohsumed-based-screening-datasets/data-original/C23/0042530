Myocardial perfusion imaging with thallium-201 to evaluate patients before and after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
 Thallium-201 imaging may be used to help determine the distribution and amount of myocardium in jeopardy and the success of revascularization after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
 Single photon emission computed tomography is particularly advantageous because of its ability to differentiate vascular territories and thus evaluate patients with multivessel disease.
 Myocardial infarction resulting from complications such as distal embolization and side-branch occlusion can be detected.
 Thallium-201 imaging early after angioplasty may show abnormal results caused by transiently insufficient coronary flow reserve.
 However, studies performed 6 weeks or more after angioplasty accurately detect early restenosis and may identify those individuals likely to become symptomatic and eventually develop restenosis in the future.
