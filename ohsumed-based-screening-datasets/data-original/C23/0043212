Cine magnetic resonance imaging for diagnosis of right coronary arterial-ventricular fistula.
 In two cases of coronary arterial-ventricular fistula, detailed morphologic evaluation of the affected coronary artery was performed by MRI.
 Cine-MRI enabled both identification of the fistula and evaluation of the direction of shunt blood flow.
 Thus, MRI is a valuable noninvasive procedure in the anatomic and physiologic diagnosis of coronary arterial fistula.
