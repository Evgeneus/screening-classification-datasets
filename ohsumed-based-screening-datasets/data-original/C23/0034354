Granulomatous peritonitis and appendicitis of food starch origin.
 Two patients with food starch granulomatous reactions, one a necrotising granulomatous peritonitis after the perforation of a gastric ulcer and the other a non-necrotising granulomatous appendicitis, are described.
 The possibility of food starch induced inflammation must be considered in the differential diagnosis of granulomatous diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.
