Aseptic colon resection by an invagination technique. Experimental study on dogs.
 A new aseptic colon resection by an invagination technique is presented.
 The bowel to be resected is invaginated down into the healthy intestine, and the anastomosis is sutured in one layer of continuous suture before transection by a diathermy wire, placed in the intestinal lumen via the anus.
 Sections of bowel that cannot be invaginated, e.g., because of a tumor, are first removed by transection between pairs of cable ties, which close the lumen.
 Twenty dogs were operated on without receiving prophylactic antibiotics.
 In 10, the intestine was transected between cable ties.
 An imprint, taken from the anastomosis and subcutis, was cultured.
 The bacterial count at the anastomosis exceeded 100 in only three cases; in the subcutis, this was the case in one dog.
 One wound infection developed.
 Serial barium enemas at 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks revealed no anastomotic leakage.
 One early death because of a total anastomotic dehiscence was encountered, and two dogs were killed because of wound dehiscence and anastomotic stricture, respectively.
 It is concluded that, in dogs, the method is easily and safely performed, but further experimental studies are needed.
