A new point mutation in the 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine-binding domain of the c-erbA beta thyroid hormone receptor is tightly linked to generalized thyroid hormone resistance.
 Two different mutations in the c-erbA beta thyroid hormone receptor have recently been reported as genetic abnormalities responsible for the syndrome of generalized thyroid hormone resistance (GTHR).
 We have now found in a third kindred, D, in which GTHR is inherited as a dominant disease, a new point mutation in the T3-binding domain of c-erbA beta.
 A guanine to cytosine base substitution at nucleotide position 1305, which altered codon-335 from glutamine (CAG) to histidine (CAC), was found in one allele of 10 affected members and was not found in 6 unaffected members.
 This C-1305 sequence was not present in 106 random alleles, indicating that it was a mutation in c-erbA beta, and it was tightly linked to GTHR in kindred D, with a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 4.19 at a recombination fraction of 0.
 The tight linkage result confirms that GTHR maps to the c-erbA beta locus in multiple kindreds.
 In view of the tight linkage between the C-1305 mutation and GTHR, and that this mutation is a nonconservative alteration in a crucial region of the T3-binding domain, it is probably the genetic defect in kindred D responsible for GTHR.
 The kindred D receptor appears to result in a different phenotype of tissue resistance compared to the previously reported kindred.
