Antibody-enhanced infection of monocytes as the pathogenetic mechanism for severe dengue illness.
 Antibody-dependent enhancement of certain virus infections can occur in cells expressing Fc receptors.
 This mechanism plays an important pathogenetic role in the development of complications associated with dengue virus infection, including dengue hemorrhagic infection and dengue shock syndrome.
 The virulence of the virus, characterized by the ability to infect Fc receptor-bearing monocytes also influences the development of these severe illnesses.
