Salpingoscopy in patients with contralateral ectopic pregnancy.
 Patients who experience a tubal pregnancy have a poor prognosis in terms of reproductive potential and are at increased risk of a repeat EP.
 Salpingoscopy is a new endoscopic technique that allows the detection of abnormalities of the tubal mucosa.
 In seven patients with a follow-up longer than 6 months, an IUP occurred only in patients with a normal ampullary mucosa, whereas a recurrent tubal pregnancy occurred in the patient that conceived with an abnormal tubal mucosa.
 These preliminary results suggest that salpingoscopy may constitute an important prognostic factor in these patients.
