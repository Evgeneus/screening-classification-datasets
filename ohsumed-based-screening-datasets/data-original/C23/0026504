Primary repair of colon injuries in a developing country.
 Because there are several specific disadvantages to a colostomy in a developing country, primary repair for colon injury was electively performed.
 Sixty-one consecutive patients with colon injury were seen between 1978 and 1989 and 57 of these (93 per cent) underwent primary repair.
 In four a colostomy was constructed.
 Emergency repair was carried out regardless of site or mode of injury, presence of hypotension or peritoneal contamination.
 There was one death unrelated to anastomotic complications and one anastomotic leakage.
 The faecal fistula closed spontaneously in 4 weeks.
 The wound infection rate was 10 per cent.
 These data support the emerging view that primary repair of colon injury is the management of choice.
