Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain assessment after intracerebroventricular administration in patients with terminal cancer.
 Morphine pharmacokinetics and pain relief were evaluated after intracerebroventricular administration of morphine (0.4 +/- 0.11 mg) in seven patients with cancer suffering from intractable pain.
 Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), lumbar CSF, and plasma morphine concentrations were analyzed by a specific morphine radioimmunoassay.
 A two-compartment model was sufficient to describe the kinetics of morphine in ventricular CSF.
 Morphine diffuses to the lumbar level, and the mean maximum concentration was 192 +/- 105 ng/ml at 4.5 +/- 1.3 hours.
 Ventricular and lumbar CSF morphine kinetics showed a similar decline during the elimination phase, with terminal half-lives of 3.8 +/- 0.6 hours and 4.2 +/- 1.6 hours, respectively.
 Pain relief was evaluated by a visual analog scale: the test showed a rapid onset of analgesia (less than 10 minutes).
 Analgesic effectiveness reached a maximum between 6 and 10 hours.
 The relationship between pharmacologic effect and morphine concentrations in ventricular CSF resulted in an anticlockwise hysteresis curve.
 The presence of morphine in lumbar CSF suggested an additive spinal action of morphine, which probably plays a role in the duration of analgesia.
