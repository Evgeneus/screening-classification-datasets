Stress incontinence and cystoceles.
 We studied prospectively 62 women with cystoceles by video-urodynamics before and after operative repair.
 Of 29 women with grades 1 and 2 cystoceles 8 had residual urine, 14 had urge incontinence and 24 had symptoms of stress urinary incontinence.
 Of these women 23 had urodynamic evidence of stress incontinence, as did 3 of 5 without stress incontinence symptoms.
 Of 33 women with large cystoceles 22 had symptoms of stress urinary incontinence but 10 more had urodynamic evidence of stress urinary incontinence.
 Of these 33 women 18 had significant residual urine and 24 had urge incontinence.
 Operative repair resolved stress incontinence in 51 of 54 women, urge incontinence in 33 of 38 and residual urine in 24 of 26.
 Cystoceles recurred in 3 patients, and enteroceles developed in 3 and recurred in 2.
 These findings indicate that cystoceles may cause voiding dysfunction and lack of symptoms of stress incontinence is unreliable in patients with cystoceles.
 In addition, cystoceles are associated with other symptoms, most of which actually resolve after operative repair.
