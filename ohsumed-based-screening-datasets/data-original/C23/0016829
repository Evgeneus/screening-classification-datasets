A severe multisystem reaction to sulindac.
 We present a case of a severe reaction to sulindac.
 A 30-year-old woman with quiescent systemic lupus erythematosus received sulindac for nonspecific migrating chest pain.
 An initial course of therapy produced an unrecognized sensitization to the drug with a febrile illness and rash.
 Readministration of the drug caused an anaphylactoid reaction as well as evidence of cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary, and hematologic dysfunction.
 The patient's illness had evidence of types I, II, and III hypersensitivity reactions.
