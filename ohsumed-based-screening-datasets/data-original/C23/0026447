Vitreon, a new perfluorocarbon.
 We evaluated a new liquid perfluorocarbon, perfluorophenanthrene (Vitreon).
 This material has proven to be non-toxic in vitrectomised rabbit eyes for up to six weeks.
 Present investigation under FDA guidelines establishes both the safety and efficacy of Vitreon in human eyes.
 We used Vitreon for intraoperative hydrokinetic retinal manipulation in 15 patients.
 In cases of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (6), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (5), giant retinal tear (2), retinal dialysis (1), and tractional retinal detachment (1) the retina was successfully reattached.
 Postoperatively two patients developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy necessitating further surgery, and one patient developed hypotony.
 Follow-up showed 100% reattachment rate with a mean duration of 6.3 months.
 Postoperative visual acuity ranges from light perception to 20/30.
