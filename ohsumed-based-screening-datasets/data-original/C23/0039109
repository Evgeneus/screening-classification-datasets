Hydronephrosis after aortofemoral bypass graft. A prospective study.
 This prospective study was designed to determine the frequency and natural history of hydroureteronephrosis (HUN) after placement of an aortobifemoral vascular graft.
 A total of 30 patients were evaluated by the study protocol, which included: pre and postoperative biological kidney function tests, preoperative and early postoperative (14th day) intravenous pyelograms and a late (mean 18th month) urologic examination by renal ultrasonic tomography.
 Four asymptomatic, early cases of HUN were observed in the 57 ureters examined (7%); all four complications regressed in less than 30 days.
 No cases of symptomatic early or late HUN were observed in this series.
 Asymptomatic early HUN was a frequent complication in our series (7%) but its benign course does not justify systematic screening.
 These asymptomatic complications contrast with the symptomatic cases of early or late HUN reported in the literature which necessitated urologic and vascular investigations.
