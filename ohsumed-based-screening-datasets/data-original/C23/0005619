Pain relief achieved by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and/or vibratory stimulation in a case of painful legs and moving toes.
 A patient is described with painful legs and moving toes.
 The pain had been occurring for more than 15 years, and a variety of therapies had been attempted with only partial, if any, success.
 Only morphine had succeeded in relieving the pain, but it had to be discontinued to avoid tolerance and dependence.
 We devised a treatment consisting of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), vibratory stimulation (VS), and a combination of the two methods (TENS + VS).
 TENS brought about partial pain relief, but was less effective than VS; dual stimulation (TENS + VS) led to complete alleviation of the pain.
 Four months later, the patient was applying dual stimulation himself at home and was thus able to maintain complete relief with 3 or 4 weekly sessions.
 We suggest that dual stimulation results in a large-scale recruitment of large-diameter afferent fibres and may thus set up a powerful inhibitory control of nociception in our patient.
