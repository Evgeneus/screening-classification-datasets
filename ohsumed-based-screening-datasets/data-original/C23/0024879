Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in the elderly: early and long-term results.
 The immediate and long-term efficacy of coronary angioplasty in the elderly was determined by studying 752 patients greater than or equal to 65 years old and comparing patients greater than or equal to 75 years old with those 65 to 74 years old.
 The oldest patients were more highly symptomatic, were more likely to be in heart failure, had more multivessel disease and were more likely to undergo multivessel dilation.
 The immediate success rate of angioplasty was higher in the oldest patients (92.8% versus 82%) (p = 0.0003).
 The hospital mortality rate was also higher (6.2% versus 1.6%) (p less than 0.001).
 Long-term overall survival was high.
 However, long-term event-free survival was lowest in the oldest patients, and recurrent severe angina was particularly common.
 Thus, in very elderly patients, coronary angioplasty is usually successful, but extra caution is warranted; also, long-term relief from angina is less common than in younger patients.
