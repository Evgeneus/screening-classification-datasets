Stimulation of glucose transport in skeletal muscle by hypoxia.
 Hypoxia caused a progressive cytochalasin B-inhibitable increase in the rate of 3-O-methylglucose transport in rat epitrochlearis muscles to a level approximately six-fold above basal.
 Muscle ATP concentration was well maintained during hypoxia, and increased glucose transport activity was still present after 15 min of reoxygenation despite repletion of phosphocreatine.
 However, the increase in glucose transport activity completely reversed during a 180-min-long recovery in oxygenated medium.
 In perfused rat hindlimb muscles, hypoxia caused an increase in glucose transporters in the plasma membrane, suggesting that glucose transporter translocation plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia.
 The maximal effects of hypoxia and insulin on glucose transport activity were additive, whereas the effects of exercise and hypoxia were not, providing evidence suggesting that hypoxia and exercise stimulate glucose transport by the same mechanism.
 Caffeine, at a concentration too low to cause muscle contraction or an increase in glucose transport by itself, markedly potentiated the effect of a submaximal hypoxic stimulus on sugar transport.
 Dantrolene significantly inhibited the hypoxia-induced increase in 3-O-methylglucose transport.
 These effects of caffeine and dantrolene suggest that Ca2+ plays a role in the stimulation of glucose transport by hypoxia.
