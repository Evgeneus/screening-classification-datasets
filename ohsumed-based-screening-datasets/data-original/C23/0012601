Omeprazole in H2 receptor antagonist-resistant reflux esophagitis.
 We conducted a retrospective review of 25 patients with severe reflux esophagitis treated with omeprazole because of failure of H2 receptor antagonists to heal their esophagitis.
 Prior to beginning omeprazole (40 mg/day), all patients were on H2 antagonists for at least 9 months and still had endoscopic evidence of longitudinal (grade II) or circumferential (grade III) distal esophageal ulceration.
 Omeprazole therapy brought about complete endoscopic healing in 24 of 25 patients (96%).
 Twenty-three of 24 healed patients were then restarted on H2 antagonists as maintenance therapy.
 Repeat endoscopy was performed if symptoms recurred.
 Fourteen of 24 patients (58%) had recurrence of endoscopic esophagitis documented between 26 and 300 days from the time of starting maintenance therapy.
 Two of these 14 patients opted for antireflux surgery, whereas the remaining 12 were once again given omeprazole, which again resulted in symptom resolution in all patients.
 These data suggest that most patients with H2 receptor antagonist-resistant ulcerative esophagitis cannot be successfully maintained on H2 antagonists even after the ulcers have been healed with omeprazole.
 Further studies are required to determine the role of omeprazole compared to other treatments in the long-term maintenance therapy of these patients.
