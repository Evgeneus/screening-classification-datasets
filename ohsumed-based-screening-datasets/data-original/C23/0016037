Clinical and electrophysiologic determinants, treatment and survival of patients with sustained malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurring late after myocardial infarction 
 To assess the clinical and electrophysiologic determinants, treatment and survival of patients with sustained malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias late after myocardial infarction, a total of 108 patients (mean age 61 +/- 10 years) were studied.
 Thirty-two patients (Group I) had sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias 8 to 60 days (mean 13 +/- 9) after acute myocardial infarction.
 The remaining 76 patients (Group II), who served as a control group, had no sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias less than or equal to 60 days after infarction.
 The most significant independent determinants of sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias late after infarction were the presence of late potentials (chi square = 16.07, p = 0.0001), defined as an abnormal signal-averaged QRS complex in association with an abnormal root-mean-square voltage in the terminal 40 ms of the QRS complex, and an abnormal ejection fraction of less than 40% (chi square = 10.09, p = 0.001).
 Sustained ventricular tachycardia was induced in 27 (96%) of 28 Group I patients.
 Among the 32 patients in Group I, antitachycardia therapy included antiarrhythmic drug therapy as the sole preventive measure in 14 (44%); map-guided surgery or coronary artery bypass surgery, or both, in 14 (44%) and the automatic cardioverter-defibrillator in 4 (12%).
 The arrhythmias were rendered noninducible in 83% of patients after map-guided surgery and in 41% after drug therapy.
 During a follow-up period of 20 +/- 14 months, five Group I patients (15%) had an arrhythmic event and four (9.3%) had a cardiac-related death.
 All five patients who had an arrhythmic event were receiving antiarrhythmic drug therapy.
