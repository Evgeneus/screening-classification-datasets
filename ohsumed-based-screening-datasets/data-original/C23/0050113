Pituitary hormone response to thyrotropin-releasing hormone in secondary amenorrheic women associated with simple weight loss.
 OBJECTIVE: To investigate endocrine dysfunction in simple weight loss amenorrhea.
 DESIGN: We studied pituitary hormone responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) in 10 women with simple weight loss amenorrhea.
 SETTING: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital, University of Tokushima at Tokushima, Japan.
 PATIENTS, PARTICIPANTS: Secondary amenorrheic women associated with simple weight loss who did not have anorexia nervosa.
 INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous injection of 500 micrograms of synthetic TRH.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), thyrotropin, and prolactin were measured before and 15, 30, and 60 minutes after TRH injection.
 RESULTS: In normally menstruating women on day 7 of the cycle TRH did not affect serum LH and FSH levels.
 In women with simple weight loss amenorrhea, however, TRH raised serum LH and FSH levels significantly (P less than 0.01, respectively).
 Prolactin response to TRH was significantly (P less than 0.05) lower in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea than in normally menstruating women.
 CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that TRH causes a significant rise in serum LH and FSH and the impaired prolactin response in women with simple weight loss amenorrhea.
