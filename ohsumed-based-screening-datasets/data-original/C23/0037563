Cytomegalovirus epididymitis following renal transplantation.
 Cytomegalovirus infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals.
 The disease is usually systemic in expression although localized infection can occur, particularly in the lung, liver, retina and gastrointestinal tract.
 We report a case of cytomegalovirus epididymitis with limited systemic manifestations occurring 2 months after renal transplantation in a patient immunosuppressed with azathioprine, prednisone and cyclosporine.
 Diagnosis was confirmed by observation of typical cytopathic changes in epididymal cells.
 Clinical resolution occurred with epididymo-orchiectomy and 9-(1,3-dihydroxy-2-proproxymethyl)guanine therapy.
 To our knowledge this presentation has not been described previously in the transplant literature and it is extremely rare in other forms of inherited or acquired immune deficiency.
