Relationship between outlet obstruction constipation and obstructed urinary flow.
 Ten women with symptoms and radiological features of outlet obstruction constipation underwent urodynamic bladder studies.
 The results were compared with ten age- and sex-matched controls.
 The mean (s.e.m.) peak flow rate for patients was 19.4 (6.4) ml/s compared with 32.1 (7.2) ml/s for controls (P less than 0.05).
 The mean (s.e.m.) voiding time for patients was 62.9 (23.7) s against a corresponding value of 15.6 (6) for controls (P less than 0.05).
 The mean (s.e.m.) bladder volume in patients was 482 (80) ml compared with a control value of 254 (112) ml (P less than 0.03).
 The mean (s.e.m.) detrusor pressure during the voiding phase was 53.3 (12) cmH2O.
 These results demonstrate that patients with outlet obstruction constipation have a generalized pelvic floor disorder resulting in obstructed urinary flow.
