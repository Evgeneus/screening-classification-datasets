Management of adipsia by a behavioural modification technique.
 Adipsia combined with diabetes insipidus after hypothalamic damage may produce major difficulties in clinical management.
 If there is an associated memory impairment it may be impossible to teach self-regulation of fluid balance, necessitating long-term hospital supervision.
 The successful use of a behaviour modification technique to achieve independent drinking and allow discharge from hospital into the community is described in a patient with adipsia, diabetes insipidus and memory impairment resulting from the removal of a craniopharyngioma.
