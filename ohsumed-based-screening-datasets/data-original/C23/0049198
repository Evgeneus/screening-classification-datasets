Hepatitis C viral RNA in serum of patients with chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis: detection by the polymerase chain reaction using multiple primer sets.
 The recently introduced antibody test for hepatitis C virus infection has already proved to be valuable in many situations such as screening blood donors and diagnosing chronically infected patients, but this antibody assay has certain limitations.
 Hepatitis C virus itself is usually present in clinical specimens at very low titers; therefore a useful assay for the virus must have very high sensitivity.
 We have developed a simple, highly sensitive assay for hepatitis C virus RNA based on the polymerase chain reaction.
 In this test RNA extracted from hepatitis C virus-infected serum or plasma is used as the template for double polymerase chain reaction with nested primers.
 Sensitivity studies demonstrate that this assay is able to detect hepatitis C virus at or beyond the sensitivity level of chimpanzee infectivity.
 Preliminary studies in chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis showed that 16 of 36 patients positive for antibody to hepatitis C virus and 2 of 4 patients negative for antibody to hepatitis C virus were positive in the polymerase chain reaction test.
 By retesting the polymerase chain reaction-negative patients with several sets of polymerase chain reaction primers, we found hepatitis C virus RNA in 35 of the 40 patients including all 4 seronegative patients.
 Normal human plasma and plasma from patients with hepatitis B infection did not react in this test.
 This assay has proved to be valuable for determining the presence of hepatitis C virus RNA in various samples.
 Furthermore, it offers the possibility of diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection in patients who do not react in the presently available antibody tests.
