Focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver: MR findings in 35 proved cases.
 MR images of 28 patients with 35 lesions of hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia were reviewed to determine the frequency of findings considered typical of this condition (isointensity on T1- and T2-weighted pulse sequences, a central hyperintense scar on T2-weighted images, and homogeneous signal intensity).
 Fifteen lesions were imaged at 0.6 T with T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo (SE) pulse sequences; 20 lesions were imaged at 1.5 T with T1-weighted SE and gradient-echo pulse sequences and T2-weighted SE pulse sequences.
 Diagnosis of focal nodular hyperplasia was made pathologically in 25 patients, with nuclear scintigraphy in four, and with follow-up imaging in six.
 Only seven lesions (20%) were isointense relative to normal liver on both T1- and T2-weighted images.
 On T1-weighted SE images, 21 lesions (60%) were isointense relative to normal liver, 12 (34%) were hypointense, and two (6%) were hyperintense.
 On T2-weighted SE images, 12 lesions (34%) were isointense and 23 (66%) were hyperintense relative to normal liver.
 A central scar was present in 17 lesions (49%) and was hypointense relative to the lesion on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images.
 Twenty lesions (57%) were of homogeneous signal intensity throughout the lesion, except for the presence of a central scar.
 All three MR imaging characteristics were present in three cases (9%).
 We conclude that hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia has a wide range of signal intensity on MR imaging.
