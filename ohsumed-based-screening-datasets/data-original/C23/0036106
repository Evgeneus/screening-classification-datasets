Medical treatment of chronic otitis media: steroid or antibiotic with steroid ear-drops?
 The aim of this study was to evaluate whether, in the treatment of active non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media, the effectiveness of gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops is due solely to the contained steroid or to the combination of antibiotic and steroid.
 Sixty-four patients presenting to the Ear, Nose and Throat outpatient department with active non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media were randomly allocated to receive either gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops, or betamethasone ear-drops, for up to 4 weeks.
 Activity in the ear was assessed at 2 and 4 weeks.
 Gentamicin with hydrocortisone combination drops were significantly more effective than betamethasone drops (P less than 0.001) in producing inactivity of chronic otitis media, being effective in 80% as opposed to 29% of cases.
 The effectiveness of gentamicin with hydrocortisone ear-drops appears to be due to the combination of antibiotic and steroid.
