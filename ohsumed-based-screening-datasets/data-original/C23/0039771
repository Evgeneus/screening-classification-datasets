Fatal aortic rupture during balloon dilatation of recoarctation.
 In an eight year old boy with a patch aortoplasty, the aorta ruptured during balloon angioplasty for recoarctation.
 At necropsy a 1.5 cm long, full thickness tear and a separate, smaller, intimal tear were found.
 Histological examination showed thinning of the elastic laminae of the aorta.
 Angioplasty for recoarctation may be dangerous in patients with a patch aortoplasty.
