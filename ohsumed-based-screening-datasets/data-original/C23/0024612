Serum-erythropoietin concentration during acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema.
 Reduced oxygen tension is regarded as the primary physiologic signal for the production of erythropoietin (EPO).
 There is little information available about early changes of EPO production in man due to severe hypoxia.
 The purpose of the present study was to examine the time course of EPO in serum of patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema (ACPE).
 In 29 patients (seventy-five +/- six years, mean age +/- SEM) who were hospitalized within two hours after onset of symptoms of ACPE, serum EPO concentrations were monitored for up to seventy-two hours.
 At the moment of admission all patients showed significantly increased EPO concentrations of 121 +/- 64 mU/mL (mean +/- SEM) compared with a healthy population (15-35 mU/mL).
 Twenty-three patients who recovered within thirty minutes (group A) exhibited a quick return of their EPO serum levels to normal.
 The remaining 6 patients (group B) had a protracted clinical course and their EPO concentration showed a further increase up to the end of the observation period.
 The comparative monitoring of concentrations of alpha-1-proteinase inhibitor, antithrombin III, C-reactive protein, fibronectin, hapotoglobin, and transerrin in serum and plasma revealed no significant changes.
 Thus a major contribution of fluid shifts into or from the intravascular compartment to the observed changes in EPO concentration seems to be unlikely.
 The data suggest that the production and release of EPO in the kidneys due to altered oxygen delivery is a fast-responding mechanism.
