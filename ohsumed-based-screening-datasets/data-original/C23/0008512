Experience with Duraphase penile prosthesis: its use as replacement device.
 The Duraphase Penile Prosthesis is a new, articulating type of semirigid prosthesis which appears to have several advantages over other semirigid penile prostheses.
 This series describes the experience with this prosthesis in 12 patients and highlights the experience in 4 patients who underwent removal of other types of prostheses due to mechanical or functional problems and replacement with the Duraphase prosthesis.
 The device has been mechanically reliable during short follow-up, and there has been excellent patient satisfaction.
