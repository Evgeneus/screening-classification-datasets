Agglutination of blood cardioplegia by cold-reacting autoantibodies.
 Cold-reacting autoantibodies occasionally occur in patients requiring cardiac operations.
 This report describes the clinical course of 1 patient with cold-reacting autoantibodies and intracoronary agglutination of the blood cardioplegia solution.
 Observations made in vivo and in vitro are considered in discussing recommendations for the management of extracorporeal circulation and cardioplegic arrest in patients with clinically silent cold-reacting autoantibodies.
