Use of a chlorhexidine dressing to reduce microbial colonization of epidural catheters.
 We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a chlorhexidine dressing in reducing the microbial flora at the insertion site of epidural catheters.
 These catheters were used for acute pain management and were dressed either by a standardized method or with a CHX/urethane sponge composite.
 Microbial colonization of the catheter developed in 9 of 31 controls (29.0%) and 1 of 26 (3.8%) catheters with the CHX dressing (P less than 0.05%).
 The CHX dressing caused no adverse effects.
 The data suggest that delivery of antiseptic to the catheter wound site reduces catheter colonization with a possible reduction in the risk of epidural catheter-related infection.
