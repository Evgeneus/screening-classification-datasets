Prospective evaluation of maternal serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels in 3428 pregnancies.
 As part of a multicenter prospective study, second-trimester human chorionic gonadotropin and alpha-fetoprotein concentrations were evaluated.
 Data included maternal age, human chorionic gonadotropin level, alpha-fetoprotein level, weight, race, and pregnancy outcome of 3428 pregnancies at between 15 and 20 weeks' gestation.
 The results of the study indicate that human chorionic gonadotropin levels decrease as maternal weight increases, that weight-adjusted human chorionic gonadotropin levels for Oriental and black women are higher than for white or Hispanic women, and that twin pregnancies have higher human chorionic gonadotropin levels than singleton pregnancies.
 Of 255 pregnancies that did not have normal outcomes, 54 (21.2%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median and 26 (10.2%) had alpha-fetoprotein levels greater than 2.5 multiples of the median.
 Of 11 pregnancies with fetal aneuploidy, 6 (54.5%) had human chorionic gonadotropin levels greater than 2.0 multiples of the median.
 It is concluded that in human chorionic gonadotropin screening programs for fetal Down syndrome, weight and race adjustments are necessary for accurate risk assessment.
