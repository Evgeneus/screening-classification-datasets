Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism demonstrated in a patient with cerebellar astrocytoma.
 A case of calcification in the striopallidodentate system associated with pseudohypoparathyroidism, clinically manifested after operation for a cystic astrocytoma of the cerebellar vermis, is reported.
 Bilateral symmetrical striopallidodentate calcification accompanying a disturbance in calcium metabolism is rare.
 Only a few cases have been described previously in the literature, of which only six were accompanied by pseudohypoparathyroidism.
 The importance of identifying hypoparathyroidism, especially pseudohypoparathyroidism, early in the course of investigation is discussed.
