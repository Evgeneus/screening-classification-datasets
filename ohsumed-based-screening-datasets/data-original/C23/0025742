Chinese hamster ovarian cells transfected with the murine interleukin-6 gene cause hypercalcemia as well as cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis in tumor-bearing nude mice.
 The effects of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in vivo were assessed by inoculating Chinese hamster ovarian (CHO) cells which were transfected with the murine IL-6 gene in nude mice.
 Nude mice bearing CHO cells expressing IL-6 developed hypercalcemia.
 Tumor-bearing mice also showed increases in white cell count, platelet count, and decreases in body weight.
 In nude mice carrying CHO tumors which had not been transfected with the IL-6 gene, there were no changes in these parameters.
 These results suggest that increased circulating concentrations of IL-6 in patients with malignant disease may contribute to a number of paraneoplastic syndromes including hypercalcemia, cachexia, leukocytosis and thrombocytosis.
