Premenstrual syndrome. Tailoring treatment to symptoms.
 Despite the interest in premenstrual syndrome (PMS) taken by the media and the public in recent years, some women still do not recognize the cyclic nature of their symptoms.

 Dr Nader discusses the major categories of symptoms and when they occur, summarizes theories on the cause of PMS, and comments on how well these theories have been substantiated by testing.
 Choosing agents for treatment on the basis of symptoms to be controlled is also described.
