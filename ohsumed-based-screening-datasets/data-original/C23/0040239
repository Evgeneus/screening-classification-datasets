Clinical and pharmacokinetic basis for the antimicrobial treatment of acute otitis media.
 Given the astonishing frequency in childhood of acute otitis media and its significant morbidity, such as hearing loss and possibly speech delay, improving treatment of response is essential.
 Since bacteria are an important cause of otitis media, antimicrobial treatment remains the cornerstone of such treatment.
 Over the last four decades, many clinical studies have shown that antibiotics can relieve symptoms and prevalent complications, although a universal cure is still elusive.
 This article summarizes the most pertinent clinical and experimental research on treating and preventing acute otitis media, with a focus on intervention trials and the pharmacokinetic behavior of antimicrobial drugs.
