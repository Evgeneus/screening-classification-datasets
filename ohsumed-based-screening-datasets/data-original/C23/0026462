Acute spinal cord injury: magnetic resonance imaging correlated with myelopathy.
 Thirty-one patients (29 males and two females, 13-87 years of age (mean, 46.7 years] with acute spinal cord injury were studied by MR (magnetic resonance) imaging and the results were correlated with neurological findings.
 Magnetic resonance images were obtained with a 0.5 T superconductive MR scanner (Phillips Gyroscan S5).
 Initial imaging was performed within 24 hours after trauma in 13 patients, 1-7 days in 13 patients and 7-14 days in five patients.
 Twenty-six patients underwent follow-up examinations with MR imaging.
 Cord abnormalities including cord compression (23 patients), cord swelling (seven patients), and abnormal signal intensities on either T1 or T2-weighted images (26 patients) were observed on initial examination.
 Multivariate analysis showed that cord compression and abnormal intensities on T1-weighted images were important prognostic indicators.
 Hyperintensity on T2-weighted images was non-specific but correlated well with clinical recovery.
 Magnetic resonance imaging is useful in predicting the prognosis and for planning treatment following spinal cord injuries.
