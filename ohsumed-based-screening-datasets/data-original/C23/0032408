Human fetal hepatocytes respond to inflammatory mediators and excrete bile.
 Under strict observation of the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki Human Research Committee, primary hepatocyte cultures were prepared from second-trimester fetal liver specimens.
 We have shown for the first time that fetal hepatocytes have the capacity to produce an acute-phase response on treatment with inflammatory mediators.
 Addition of interleukin-6 to the cultures resulted in strong induction of C-reactive protein and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin expression, whereas albumin expression was repressed.
 In contrast to interleukin-6, transforming growth factor-beta did not induce C-reactive protein expression.
 However, as in adult hepatocytes, fetal cells responded to transforming growth factor-beta by reduced albumin synthesis.
 We were able to show by virtue of fluorescein excretion into sealed clefts that fetal hepatocytes have the functional capacity to form bile.
 Our findings indicate that second-trimester hepatocytes can be regarded as fairly mature liver cells.
