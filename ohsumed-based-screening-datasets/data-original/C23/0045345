Permissivity of primary cultures of human Kupffer cells for HIV-1.
 Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) represent the largest reservoir of fixed macrophages in the body.
 Accordingly, we have undertaken a study to evaluate their susceptibility to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
 Five-day-old primary cultures of Kupffer cells (KC) were infected with HIV-1, and as the infection progressed, syncytia appeared.
 Within the cells, viral proteins were detected by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies directed against gp120 and p24.
 Electron microscopic examinations revealed the presence of typical Lentivirinae particles.
 The particles released from KC in the extracellular medium showed reverse transcriptase activity and p24 antigen; they could infect lymphocytic cells and were neutralized by a HIV+ patient's serum or an anti-gp120 monoclonal antibody.
 Our results thus demonstrate that the interaction of HIV-1 with KC in vitro leads to a productive infection.
 They suggest that the KC may be involved in the pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection and may (i) participate in the transmission of the infection to the peripheral blood cells, (ii) play a role in the depletion of uninfected CD4+ cells.
