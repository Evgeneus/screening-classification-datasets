Practice patterns and costs of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
 We conducted an observational study at three hospitals in Boston to examine the patterns of practice and the costs involved in the medical management of noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
 A total of 111 patients were identified and studied: 42 from hospital 1, 38 from hospital 2, and 31 from hospital 3.
 There were no significant differences in the management of the patients, except for the more frequent use of upper gastrointestinal radiography at hospital 3 and the more frequent use of cimetidine at hospital 2.
 Only a small percentage (3-7%) of patients required surgery, and overall mortality (0-8%) was low.
 The average cost of hospitalization, determined by using the New England Medical Center cost model, was calculated for direct costs ($3,180).
 The majority of costs incurred were for hospital bed or intensive care unit stay (63%) and transfusion of blood products (14%), with costs for physicians' services (9%), endoscopy (2%), and upper gastrointestinal radiography (1%) accounting for only a small percentage.
 This study demonstrates remarkable similarity in practice patterns and resource utilization at three different hospitals and provides data on the actual costs involved in hospitalization for noncirrhotic, upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
