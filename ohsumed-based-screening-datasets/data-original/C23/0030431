Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser-assisted pulmonary resections.
 The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser is a new approach to limited pulmonary resection.
 It avoids distortion of surrounding pulmonary tissue and potential pleural space problems, which can occur with mechanical stapler resections.
 We have recently used this laser to manage 39 pulmonary lesions in 20 patients.
 There were no major postoperative complications, and air leak after resection was minimal.
 Neodymium:yttrium-aluminum garnet laser excision is a useful method that may have an advantage over mechanical stapling techniques for the limited resection of many pulmonary lesions.
