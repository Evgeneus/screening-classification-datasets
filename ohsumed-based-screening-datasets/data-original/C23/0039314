A controlled clinical trial of E5 murine monoclonal IgM antibody to endotoxin in the treatment of gram-negative sepsis. The XOMA Sepsis Study Group 
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of adjunctive monoclonal antibody antiendotoxin immunotherapy in patients with gram-negative sepsis.
 DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial.
 SETTING: Thirty-three university-affiliated centers, including Veterans Affairs, community, and municipal hospitals.
 PATIENTS: Hospitalized adults with signs of gram-negative infection and a systemic septic response.
 INTERVENTION: Patients were assigned to receive either 2 mg/kg of a murine monoclonal antibody directed against gram-negative endotoxin (E5) or placebo.
 A second infusion was administered 24 hours later.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality over the 30-day study period, resolution of organ failures, and safety.
 RESULTS: Four hundred eighty-six patients were enrolled.
 Three hundred sixteen had confirmed gram-negative sepsis (54% bacteremic, 46% nonbacteremic).
 The survival difference was not statistically significant for all patients.
 Among patients with gram-negative sepsis who were not in shock at study entry (n = 137), E5 treatment resulted in significantly greater survival (relative risk, 2.3; P = .01).
 Resolution of individual organ failures was more frequent among these patients, occurring in 19 (54%) of 35 patients in the E5 group vs eight (30%) of 27 in the placebo group (P = .05).
 Four reversible allergic reactions occurred among 247 patients (1.6%) receiving E5.
 No other toxicity was identified.
 CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with E5 antiendotoxin antibody appears safe.
 It reduces mortality and enhances the resolution of organ failure among patients with gram-negative sepsis who are not in shock when treated.
