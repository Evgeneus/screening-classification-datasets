Hypothalamic or central obesity is associated with an early rise in plasma insulin concentration.
 Insulin levels in a 7-year-old boy with hyperphagia and obesity following an episode of meningoencephalitis were studied sequentially during the course of progressive weight gain.
 High fasting insulin levels (1183 pmol/L) and strikingly high insulin release in response to glucose (7892 pmol/L) were found within weeks of the onset of the illness.
 The abnormality in insulin secretion occurred prior to the marked weight gain.
 Hyperinsulinemia was not accompanied by hypoglycemia.
 Early hyperinsulinemia may be a primary event in the development of hyperphagia and obesity following hypothalamic injury.
