Differential effects of transforming growth factor-beta 1 and phorbol myristate acetate on cardiac fibroblasts. Regulation of fibrillar collagen mRNAs and expression of early transcription factors.
 Cardiac fibroblasts are responsible for synthesis and deposition of fibrillar collagen types I and III.
 Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) has been proved to increase collagen biosynthesis in various systems, both in vivo and in vitro.
 We have investigated the effect of TGF-beta 1 on collagen gene expression in cultured cardiac fibroblasts and have compared this effect with that of a mitogenic agent, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).
 The regulation of collagen types I and III gene expression was examined by using cDNA probes to rat alpha 2 (I) and mouse alpha 1 (III) procollagens.
 Quiescent cultured cardiac fibroblasts from rabbit heart were treated with TGF-beta 1 (10-15 ng/ml) and PMA (200 ng/ml).
 After 24 hours of treatment with TGF-beta 1, the abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 2 (I) and pro-alpha 1 (III) collagens was increased by 112% (p less than 0.001) and 97% (p = 0.05), respectively, in treated fibroblasts compared with untreated cells.
 However, PMA-treated cells showed an opposite response: a 42% (p = 0.01) decrease in mRNA levels for pro-alpha 2 (I) collagen was observed.
 Immunofluorescent staining of cardiac fibroblasts in culture with anti-type I collagen antibody showed that alterations in mRNA levels led to altered collagen synthesis: cellular collagen was relatively increased in TGF-beta 1-treated cells and significantly diminished in PMA-treated cells.
 The abundance of mRNA for pro-alpha 1 (III) collagen was not affected by PMA treatment.
