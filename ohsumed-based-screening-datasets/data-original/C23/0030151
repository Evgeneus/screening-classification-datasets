Excision of limbal dermoids.
 We reviewed the clinical files of 10 patients who had undergone excision of unilateral epibulbar limbal dermoids.
 Preoperatively, all of the affected eyes had worse visual acuity (P less than .02) and more astigmatism (P less than .01) than the contralateral eyes.
 Postoperatively, every patient was cosmetically improved.
 Of the eight patients for whom both preoperative and postoperative visual acuity measurements had been obtained, in six it had changed minimally (less than or equal to 1 line), and in two it had improved (less than or equal to 2 lines).
 Surgical complications included persistent epithelial defects (40%) and peripheral corneal vascularization and opacity (70%).
 These complications do not outweigh the cosmetic and visual benefits of dermoid excision in selected patients.
