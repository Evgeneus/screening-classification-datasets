Safety and efficacy of laparoscopic cholecystectomy. A prospective analysis of 100 initial patients 
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy quickly emerged as an alternative to open cholecystectomy.
 However its safety, efficacy, and morbidity have yet to be fully evaluated.
 During the first 6 months of 1990, we performed 100 consecutive laparoscopic cholecystectomies with no deaths and a morbidity rate of 8% (8 of 100 patients; 4 major, 4 minor).
 There were 81 women and 19 men, with a mean age of 46.1 years (range, 17 to 84 years).
 All patients had a preoperative history consistent with symptomatic biliary tract disease, and most had proved gallstones by sonography.
 This included four patients with acute cholecystitis.
 Mean operating time improved significantly from month 1 to month 6 (122 +/- 45.4 minutes versus 78.5 +/- 30 minutes, respectively), indicating a rapid learning curve.
 Mean hospital stay was 27.6 hours, reflecting a policy of overnight stay.
 Postoperative narcotic requirements were limited to oral or no medications in more than 70% of patients.
 A regular diet was tolerated by 83% of the patients by the morning following the procedure.
 Median time of return to full activity was 12.8 +/- 6.8 days after operation.
 In addition analysis of the hospital costs of these 100 cases demonstrates a modest cost advantage over standard open cholecystectomy (n = 58) (mean, $3620.25 +/- $1005.00 versus $4251.76 +/- $988.00).
 There was one minor bile duct injury requiring laparotomy and t-tube insertion, two postoperative bile collections, and one clinical diagnosis of a retained stone that passed spontaneously.
 Four patients required conversion to open cholecystectomy because of technical difficulties with the dissection.
 Although there is a significant learning curve, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is a safe and effective procedure that can be performed with minimal risk.
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be performed by surgeons who are trained in biliary surgery and knowledgeable in biliary anatomy, and, as with all operations, it should be performed with meticulous attention to technique.
