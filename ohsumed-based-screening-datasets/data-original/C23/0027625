HELLP syndrome: a case report with guidelines for diagnosis and management.
 A 25-yr-old patient with a twin pregnancy of 34 weeks gestation developed HELLP syndrome and required urgent delivery by Caesarean section.
 Before operation, a central venous catheter and urinary catheter were inserted, and fresh frozen plasma and platelets were administered to correct hypovolaemia and severe thrombocytopenia.
 This case demonstrates the critical condition of these patients before operation and that extensive preoperative preparation and invasive monitoring are necessary for successful management.
 The choice of anaesthetic is governed by the presence of liver and renal dysfunction and severe thrombocytopenia.
