Use of a knee-brace for control of tibial translation and rotation. A comparison, in cadavera, of available models.
 We assessed the relative restraints that are provided by fourteen currently available functional knee-braces, using six limbs in cadavera.
 The tests were made at 30 and 60 degrees of flexion of the knee, and a mechanical loading system applied loads that caused anterior-posterior translation and internal-external rotation.
 The braces limited abnormal tibiofemoral displacements by 10 to 75 per cent in translation; there was more variation in rotation.
 This study demonstrated that functional knee-braces provide a restraining influence that may be beneficial in the control of abnormal displacements of the knee, but that the degree of restraint varies considerably.
