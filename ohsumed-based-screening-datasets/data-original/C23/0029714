Wound infiltration of local anaesthetic after lower segment caesarean section.
 The analgesic efficacy of subcutaneous wound infiltration with 20 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine after elective lower segment section Caesarean section was studied in 28 patients in a double-blind randomised controlled manner using a patient-controlled analgesia system.
 The mean 24-hour morphine consumption of the placebo group and the bupivacaine group was similar (76 mg and 68 mg respectively).
 Analysis of the cumulative hourly morphine consumption failed to show any statistically significant differences between the groups.
 However, on a weight-adjusted basis statistically significant differences in morphine consumption were demonstrated, although these may not be clinically important.
 Subjective experiences of pain, nausea and drowsiness assessed by linear analogue scoring were similar in both groups.
