Lingual thyroid: the diagnostic value of magnetic resonance imaging.
 Lingual thyroid is an uncommon developmental aberration of embryogenesis.
 It may present as a mid-line, non-tender, painless, reddish appearing swelling in the throat.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a relatively new diagnostic method for this condition.
 Two cases of lingual thyroid are reviewed with their MRI's and surgical results.
