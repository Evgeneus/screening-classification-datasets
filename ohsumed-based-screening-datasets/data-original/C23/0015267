Unfavorable outcome following early surgical repair of ruptured cerebral aneurysms--a critical review of 238 patients.
 Among 238 consecutive patients admitted early with ruptured cerebral aneurysms, surgical repair within 48-72 hours was feasible in 200 cases.
 Unfavorable outcomes among the latter 200 patients are analyzed and discussed in this paper.
 Preoperatively, 148 patients were in Hunt and Hess grades I-III, 33 were in grade IV, and 19 in grade V.
 After clipping of the aneurysm, all patients received a regimen of topical intracisternal and intravenous/peroral medication with the calcium antagonist nimodipine.
 The overall rate of unfavorable outcomes was 25%, ie, outcome with moderate or severe deficit or lethal outcome.
 The reasons for unfavorable outcomes among these 49 patients were the devastating effect of the bleed (severe subarachnoid hemorrhage or additional intracerebral hemorrhage) in 31 patients (15% of the 200 patients), a surgical complication in 11 (5.5%), preoperative rebleeding in three (1.5%), delayed ischemia from vasospasm in one (0.5%), and various others in three further patients (1.5%).
 Unfavorable outcome occurred in 11% of patients with preoperative grades I-III, in 52% of patients with grade IV, and in 16 of 19 patients with grade V.
 Among the 141 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage but not intracerebral or intraventricular hematoma, 16 made an unfavorable outcome, ie, 11% versus 56% among patients with intracerebral hematoma/intraventricular hematoma on preoperative computed tomography scan.
 The present data seem to speak in favor of early surgery.
 Since half of the patients with intracerebral hematoma and poor outcome had suffered previous warning leaks, it appears to be a continuing challenge to diagnose warning leaks before a massive hemorrhage occurs.
