Importance of bone marrow cytogenetic evaluation before autologous bone marrow transplantation for Hodgkin's disease.
 Alkylating agents used either with or without radiation therapy have been associated with the development of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) after treatment of both malignant and nonmalignant disorders.
 This report describes seven patients with recurrent Hodgkin's disease (HD) evaluated for bone marrow transplantation (BMT) who developed chromosomal abnormalities, and emphasizes the importance of bone marrow cytogenetic studies before bone marrow harvest.
 Three patients with histologically normal bone marrow underwent autologous BMT and subsequently developed an MDS or ANLL.
 Four patients had the clonal abnormality detected before bone marrow harvest and did not proceed to BMT.
