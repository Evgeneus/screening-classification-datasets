Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction using freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts. Two year results in thirty-six patients [published erratum appears in Am J Sports Med 1991 May-Jun;19(3):272]
 Thirty-six of 44 patients (82%) who underwent ACL reconstruction using freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts were evaluated at least 2 years postoperatively.
 A detailed subjective evaluation using the Lysholm scale was recorded as well as a functional evaluation using the Tegner activity scale.
 All of the patients received a detailed physical examination that included testing with the KT-1000 ligament arthrometer and the Cybex dynamometer.
 Complete chart reviews and radiographic evaluations were also obtained.
 Only 17 patients were considered to be functionally successful and performing at their desired activity level.
 The average KT-1000 showed a side-to-side difference of 5.9 mm at 30 pounds for the successful group and 7.9 mm for those who had functional failure.
 The Lysholm scores were 91.6/100 versus 61.1/100 in the failures.
 Eight patients (22%) at repeat surgery were noted to have complete dissolution of the graft.
 Large femoral cysts were noted radiographically in all of these patients.
 It was concluded that freeze-dried, ethylene oxide-sterilized, bone-patellar tendon-bone allografts have a high failure rate and cannot be recommended for ACL reconstruction.
