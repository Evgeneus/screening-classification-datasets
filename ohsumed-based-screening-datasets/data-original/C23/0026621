Characterization of liver epithelial cells transfected with myc and/or ras oncogenes.
 While many liver tumors contain activated myc and ras oncogenes, the mechanisms by which these genes contribute to cellular transformation is poorly understood.
 Activated versions of the cellular oncogenes, c-myc and/or c-H-ras were transfected into normal rat liver epithelial cells to identify cellular pathways that are altered in the cells containing the oncogenes.
 The results of these and other investigations indicate that the biological properties associated with the transfection of c-myc include immortalization, reduced contact inhibition of growth, activation of phospholipase A2-mediated pathways, increased sensitivity to transformation with a ras gene, and greatly increased sensitivity to growth factors.
 The biological properties associated with the transfection of the ras gene include morphological transformation, anchorage-independent growth, tumorigenicity, increased phosphatidylinositol metabolism, the induction of growth-factor processing and secretion, which leads to (exogenous) growth factor-independent tumor growth, and a marked resistance to normal inhibitors of growth such as TGF-beta.
 It is proposed that the complementary actions of the myc and ras genes in cellular transformation may be related to the ras-induced secretion of autocrine growth factors by cells sensitized to their effects by the myc gene.
 The increased stimulus for growth coupled to a ras-induced insensitivity to growth inhibitors may lead to clonal expansion of these cells and tumor development.
