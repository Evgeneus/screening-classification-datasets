Hyperinsulinaemia in thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis.
 To test the hypothesis that there is an abnormal serum insulin response to a carbohydrate load in thyrotoxic hypokalaemic periodic paralysis (THPP), 18 men with THPP and 15 with uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis were studied during an oral glucose tolerance test.
 The THPP group had significantly higher fasting insulin concentrations (27.6 [3.6] vs 13.4 [1.8] mU/l; p less than 0.005) and a higher overall insulin response to oral glucose (p less than 0.001 by ANOVA) than the thyrotoxicosis group.
 There were no significant differences in fasting or stimulated glucose.
 Hyperinsulinaemia may be an important factor in the precipitation of acute paralysis in THPP.
