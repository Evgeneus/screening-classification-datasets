Total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection.
 Reports of high mortality and amputation rates following total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection have prompted the use of alternate approaches including local antibiotics, partial resection, in situ revascularization, and graft excision without revascularization.
 Experience with aortic graft infection was reviewed to establish current morbidity and mortality rates and evaluate our bias in favor of total excision and extra-anatomic bypass.
 Aortic graft infection was identified in 32 patients, 8 with aortoenteric fistulas.
 The mean interval between graft placement and infection was 34 months.
 History of groin exposure (75%) or multiple prior vascular surgery (50%) was common.
 Clinical signs included fever and/or leukocytosis (23 patients), false aneurysm (9 patients), graft thrombosis (6 patients), groin infection (11 patients), and gastrointestinal hemorrhage (6 patients).
 Microbiologic data, available in 26 patients, demonstrated gram-positive organisms in 15 patients and gram-negative in 9.
 Multiple organisms were seen in 11 patients.
 Patients were treated by partial removal with (8 patients) or without (4 patients) revascularization or total removal with (18 patients) or without (2 patients) revascularization.
 Revascularization was by an extra-anatomic route, either simultaneous or staged.
 Overall morbidity/mortality was less in the revascularized groups (p = 0.01), while late complications were seen only after partial removal (p less than 0.01).
 The best results were found after total excision with revascularization.
 No patient in this group experienced late infection or amputation during a mean follow-up of 34 months (range: 1 to 168 months).
 Complications after total excision and extra-anatomic bypass for aortic graft infection are lower than generally appreciated.
 This approach should remain the standard to which other approaches are compared.
