The ectopic ovary. A case report and review of the literature.
 We describe an ectopic ovary in a stillborn female.
 To our knowledge, this is the first report of an extra ovary in an infant.
 This case prompted a review of ectopic ovarian tissue, which is known by a variety of terms, the most common being accessory ovary and supernumerary ovary.
 We suggest that (1) many of the past cases should be classified as ovarian implants rather than true embryologically derived ectopic tissue; and (2) the terms accessory ovary and supernumerary ovary are imprecise and should be modified.
