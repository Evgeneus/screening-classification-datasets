Vagally mediated acid hypersecretion and lesion formation in anesthetized rat under hypothermic conditions.
 The pathophysiological changes associated with hypothermia were investigated in the rat stomach under anesthetized conditions.
 The animal was placed in a styrene foam box and the core body temperature was kept between 24 and 36 degrees C using a heat lamp and refrigerant pack.
 Lowering of body temperature (less than 30 degrees C) produced acid hypersecretion and induced hemorrhagic lesions in the gastric mucosa; these responses reached the maximum at 28 degrees C, and a significant relationship was found between acid output and lesion score.
 Hypothermia (28 degrees C) also caused a marked increase of gastric contractile activity and mucosal blood flow (MBF), but the ratio of acid output to MBF became greater when compared to that obtained under normothermic conditions.
 These changes induced by hypothermia (28 degrees C) were completely blocked by vagotomy and were significantly inhibited by atropine, hexamethonium, clonidine, or TRH antiserum.
 However, lowering body temperature did not significantly affect acid secretory, motility, and ulcerogenic responses induced by carbachol in the vagotomized rat, excluding local mechanisms (suppression of the inhibitory nerves) in the hypothermia-induced changes.
 We conclude that hypothermia alone stimulates vagally dependent acid secretion and motility, resulting in damage in the gastric mucosa.
 These changes may be centrally mediated by TRH, which is released in association with the thermogenic response to hypothermia.
