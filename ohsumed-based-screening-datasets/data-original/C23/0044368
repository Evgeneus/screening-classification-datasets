Clinical symptoms in young adults with atypical chest pain attending the emergency department.
 Clinical symptoms were studied in 69 consecutive patients below the age of 40 years who were attending the emergency unit because of unexplained chest pain.
 In a structured interview a few weeks after the emergency visit, only one-third of the patients reported that they believed in the doctor's diagnosis; they believed in a psychological or cardiac origin of the pain more often than the doctors.
 The chest pain was most often described as oppressive and/or stabbing.
 In 95% of cases it was central or left-sided.
 Associated symptoms were commonly reported, breathlessness being most commonly reported by two-thirds of the patients, followed by dizziness, palpitation and numbness/tingling.
 Mental symptoms such as tiredness, anxiety and tension were frequently reported.
 On the basis of the background literature the aetiology is discussed.
 We conclude that immediate symptom analysis, including psychosomatic symptoms, particularly breathing problems, is of central importance.
