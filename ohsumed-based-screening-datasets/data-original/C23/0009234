Balloon catheter tamponade in cardiovascular wounds.
 From 1980 to 1990, operative balloon catheter tamponade was used in 12 patients with cardiac or vascular injuries from penetrating wounds.
 In nine patients, a balloon catheter was passed into a bleeding site through a bullet track or proximal artery and inflated with saline or radiologic dye.
 In two of these patients, the proximal balloon catheter was folded on itself, tied in that position, and left in the patient permanently.
 In the other seven patients in this group, the balloon catheter was attached to a three-way stopcock and left temporarily inflated postoperatively.
 These patients were then observed in the intensive care unit for 3 to 4 days, at which time the balloon was withdrawn.
 Eight of nine patients survived without recurrent hemorrhage after removal of the balloon catheter, while one patient with a Fogarty balloon placed in the carotid siphon died of a cerebral infarction.
 Balloon catheter tamponade was also used on a temporary basis in one patient with a posterior cardiac wound and in one patient with an anterior stab wound of the inferior vena cava at the renal veins, whereas in two patients with high cervical arteriovenous fistulas, one had permanent placement of the balloon catheter while the other had temporary placement.
 One of the latter patients also had acute hemorrhage.
 Although all four patients survived, one of the patients with a fistula developed a recurrence and another required two separate operative procedures for correct placement of the balloon to cure the fistula.
