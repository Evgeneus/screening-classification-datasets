Cocaine and indomethacin: fetal anuria, neonatal edema, and gastrointestinal bleeding.
 A case is reported in which exposure to cocaine and indomethacin was associated with development of fetal anuria, anasarca, and neonatal gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
 Cocaine and indomethacin may act synergistically to adversely affect renal, cardiovascular, and platelet function.
 It may be prudent to obtain a drug history and urine screen for cocaine before instituting indomethacin therapy for preterm labor or polyhydramnios.
