Ryanodine contracture: a potentially specific in vitro diagnostic test for malignant hyperthermia.
 In vitro contracture tests used currently for malignant hyperthermia (MH) do not possess absolute specificity.
 This is potentially a great problem in the study of the genetic approach which offers the best prospect for the development of a non-invasive diagnostic test for the condition.
 The calcium release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum has been proposed as the site of the MH defect.
 Ryanodine, which binds avidly to this channel, was shown to differentiate between muscle of MH susceptible and normal patients in terms of in vitro contracture response.
 This ryanodine contracture response is proposed as a potentially specific in vitro diagnostic test for MH.
