Patterns of neuropsychological impairment after severe blunt head injury.
 A consecutive series of 100 subjects with severe blunt head injuries was followed up 6 years after trauma.
 Neuropsychological test performances of 82 subjects and of a noninjured control group were analyzed by two principal components analyses (PCAs).
 Each PCA extracted 15 factors relating to a range of cognitive impairments, as well as neuropsychological features consistent with posttraumatic personality changes.
 Measures identified by the PCAs were applied to 85 head-injured subjects in the series to examine the incidence of impairment in four neuropsychological areas: disorders of learning and memory, neuropsychological features consistent with posttraumatic personality change, slowness in rate of information processing, and a range of basic neuropsychological skills.
 Overall, impairments occurred in 70% of the series.
 Disorders of learning and memory were the most common type of deficit (56.5%), with disturbances in basic neuropsychological skills the least frequent (16.5%).
 Variability among subjects with respect to the types and combinations of neuropsychological impairments was a characteristic feature of this clinical group, but the largest proportion (one-third) demonstrated isolated impairments.
 The implications of the incidence and selectivity of neuropsychological impairments are discussed.
