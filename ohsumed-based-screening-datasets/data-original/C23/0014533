Delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression.
 We report two unusual cases of delayed hearing loss after neurovascular decompression of structures within the cerebellopontine angle.
 In the first case, the patient noted a unilateral hearing loss 3 weeks after undergoing vascular decompression of the trigeminal nerve for tic douloureux.
 This gradually improved over an 18-month period.
 In the second case, the patient awoke on the 4th day after vascular decompression of the facial nerve for hemifacial spasm with a bilateral hearing loss that has remained unchanged after the onset.
 These are examples of delayed acoustic dysfunction occurring with a shift in surgically freed vessels and may have been induced by newly directed neurovascular compression or distortion.
