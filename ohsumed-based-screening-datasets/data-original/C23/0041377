Genetics of colon cancer.
 Strikingly rapid advances in the identification of genetic events that are important in colonic carcinogenesis have been made in the past several years.
 Specific inherited (adenomatous polyposis coli gene) and acquired (ras gene point mutations; c-myc gene amplification; allelic deletion at specific sites on chromosomes 5, 17, and 18) genetic abnormalities appear to be capable of mediating steps in the progression from normal to malignant colonic mucosa.
 Understanding these genetic factors and how they influence cellular function will have a profound effect on medical practice.
 High-risk populations will be (and are being) identified by genetic markers, thus allowing prevention and screening to be more precisely targeted to the population at risk; intervention strategies will be designed on the basis of the known cellular defects of neoplastic colonic mucosa; and new molecular preventive and therapeutic approaches can be developed.
