Reduced psychological morbidity after breast conservation.
 Psychological morbidity was compared in 52 patients treated by mastectomy and 67 patients treated by lumpectomy for early breast cancer.
 An informal counselling service was provided for all patients.
 Morbidity was measured at 6, 9 and 12 months after surgery with two self-rating scales: the general health questionnaire and the Leeds depression and anxiety scales.
 There was a significant excess of severe depression in the mastectomy group.
 In contrast to the findings of previous research, this result suggests that breast conservation reduces psychological morbidity.
