Passage of a colon 'cast' after anoabdominal rectal resection. Report of a case.
 The authors report a case of the passage of a total colonic J-pouch "cast" per anus after anoabdominal rectal resection and colonic J-pouch-anal anastomosis.
 This occurred without development of cuff abscess and was not due to occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery.
 This was successfully treated, with preservation of anal function, with resection of the colonic J-pouch by transanal approach.
