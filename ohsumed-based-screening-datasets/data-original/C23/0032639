Effect of glycine on medullary thick ascending limb injury in perfused kidneys.
 The addition of 2 mM glycine to the recirculating perfusate of isolated perfused rat kidneys almost completely prevented the severe morphological injury to tubular cells lining the medullary thick ascending limb (mTAL) that normally develops in this preparation.
 Glycine was similarly effective in reducing mTAL injury associated with hypoxic perfusion, indomethacin and amphotericin.
 Fractional reabsorption of sodium was increased with glycine, without any change in perfusate flow to the whole kidney and without consistent improvement in GFR.
 L-alanine demonstrated a similar though less pronounced cytoprotective action, but glutamine, cysteine, glutamate, cysteine plus glutamate, 1-serine and 4-aminoisobutyric acid all had little or no effect in preventing severe mTAL injury.
 The protective effect of glycine was unimpaired by the arginine analogue NG-monomethyl-l-arginine (L-NMMA), suggesting that the endothelial-derived relaxing factor, NO, was not involved.
 The action of glycine was not reduced by the addition of a substrate (benzoate) or a product (hippurate) of the glycine N-acyltransferase reaction.
 Glycine did not depress the respiration of dispersed mTALs prepared from rat kidneys.
 The cytoprotective effect of glycine in the mTAL of perfused kidneys, shared with l-alanine, appears to be relatively specific for these amino acids and probably unrelated to a diminution in cell work.
