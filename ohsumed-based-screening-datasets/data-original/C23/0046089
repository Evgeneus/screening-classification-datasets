Carbon dioxide laser vaporization of recalcitrant symptomatic plaques of Hailey-Hailey disease and Darier's disease.
 Carbon dioxide laser vaporization of localized, recalcitrant intertriginous plaques was done in two patients with Hailey-Hailey disease and two patients with Darier's disease.
 After treatment, only one patient had recurrence in one treatment site.
 All patients had significant clinical and symptomatic improvement.
 Destructive treatment must include the follicular infundibulum in Darier's disease, because histologically this was the focus of recurrent disease at one treated site.
 We suggest carbon dioxide laser vaporization for the treatment of chronic, localized, symptomatic plaques of Hailey-Hailey or Darier's disease, if medical therapy has been ineffective.
