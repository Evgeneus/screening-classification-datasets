The surgical pathologist's role in liver transplantation.
 Liver transplantation has become an option in treating a wide variety of diseases.
 The surgical pathologist, as a member of the transplantation team, is increasingly involved in the evaluation of allograft dysfunction.
 Interpretation of the liver allograft biopsy specimen requires integration of clinical history, biochemical data, and histologic patterns of a wide variety of lesions, including harvesting injury, vascular thrombosis, rejection, infection, and recurrent disease.
 This article reviews the varied histologic appearances of the more common forms of liver allograft injury, the contexts in which they arise, and their distinction from one another.
