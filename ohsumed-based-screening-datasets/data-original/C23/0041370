Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura treated with plasma exchange or exchange transfusions.
 Of 40 patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, 17 were treated with plasma exchange, 15 with exchange transfusions, and 6 with both types of therapy.
 One patient died before being treated and another patient was seen but not treated.
 Plasma exchange was performed daily for a mean of seven exchanges per patient.
 The replacement fluid during plasma exchange was fresh frozen plasma in all cases.
 The complete response rates for each type of treatment were as follows: 88% for plasma exchange (15 patients), 47% for exchange transfusions (7 patients), and 67% for exchange transfusions and plasma exchange (4 patients).
 Clinical and laboratory factors were examined for any statistically significant association with therapy response.
 Treatment with plasma exchange was statistically the initial factor most strongly associated with prognosis.
 Paresis, paresthesias, seizures, mental status change, and coma showed no association with response to treatment.
 Some of the laboratory factors that did not show significant association with treatment response were the initial creatinine, hemoglobin, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, and total bilirubin.
 This study supports the hypothesis that plasma exchange has significantly improved the prognosis of patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
 These patients should be treated aggressively regardless of the severity of their symptoms.
