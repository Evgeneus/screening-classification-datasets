Wildervanck or cervico-oculo-acoustic syndrome and MRI findings.
 In 1952, Wildervanck described the first case of what he styled the cervico-oculo-acoustic (COA) syndrome.
 This comprises Klippel Feil's (KF) anomaly (congenitally fused cervical vertebrae), congenital sensorineural deafness and Duane's retraction syndrome (deficient abduction with retraction on adduction).
 Since that original paper, there have been further reports describing this triad, either completely or incompletely.
 A further case of this syndrome is reported and the first report of MRI head scan findings in this condition is presented.
 In addition, the origin of mirror movements observed as part of the KF syndrome are discussed.
