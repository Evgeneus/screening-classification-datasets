Testicular torsion: a surgical emergency.
 Testicular torsion is caused by twisting of the spermatic cord, which results in compromised testicular blood flow.
 The degree of ischemic injury is determined by the severity of arterial compression and the interval between the onset of symptoms and surgical intervention.
 Torsion usually occurs at puberty, and an anatomic defect known as "bell-clapper" deformity is usually present.
 Typical symptoms include acute scrotal pain with associated nausea and vomiting.
 Up to one-half of patients report previous similar episodes.
 On examination, the testis is high-riding, tender, swollen and firm.
 Testicular scan or Doppler ultrasound examination can be helpful in distinguishing torsion from acute epididymitis.
 Prompt surgical treatment is indicated to reduce the torsion, and bilateral orchiopexy is performed to prevent recurrence.
 Exocrine function, as determined by semen analysis, is often abnormal after unilateral torsion.
