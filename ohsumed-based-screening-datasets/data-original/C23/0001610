Hemiplegia in posterior cerebral artery occlusion.
 We report 4 patients with hemiplegia due to a posterior cerebral artery occlusion.
 Associated clinical signs were aphasia, alexia or a neglect syndrome, hemianopia, and hemisensory loss.
 Hemiplegia was due to infarction in the lateral midbrain.
 The level of the occlusion in the posterior cerebral artery may be located distal to the junction with the posterior communicating artery.
