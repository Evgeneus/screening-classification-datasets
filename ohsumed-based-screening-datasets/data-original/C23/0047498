An evaluation of clinical variables in determining the need for pelvic examination in the emergency department.
 STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of multiple clinical variables to predict an increased or decreased probability of pelvic pathology, therefore determining when a pelvic examination is needed.
 DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
 SETTING: An urban emergency department.
 TYPE OF PARTICIPANTS: 246 female patients presenting with abdominal pain and undergoing pelvic examination.
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The patients were divided into two groups.
 Group 1 consisted of 99 patients without pelvic pathology (40%) and group 2 consisted of 147 patients with pelvic pathology (60%).
 Pelvic pathology was defined as presence of infective discharge (with confirmation on wet mount/potassium hydroxide smear), presence of adnexal mass and/or tenderness, cervical motion tenderness, uterine enlargement and/or tenderness, blood in the vaginal vault, and culture report positive for Neisseria gonorrhea.
 The following variables achieved statistical significance (P less than .05) using a logistic regression model: history of vaginal discharge (odds ratio, 2.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.23 to 4.32]); history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia (4.35 [1.52 to 12.40]); right upper quadrant pain on physical examination (0.33 [0.13 to 0.85]); and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination or history (1.73 [0.94 to 3.19]).
 CONCLUSION: History of vaginal discharge, history of dysmenorrhea/menorrhagia, and left lower quadrant pain on physical examination act as risk variables predicting presence of pelvic disease.
 Right upper quadrant pain on physical examination acts as a protective variable to predict absence of pelvic disease.
 This information may aid the emergency physician in determining the need for a pelvic examination in women with abdominal pain.
