Duodenobronchial fistula.
 Duodenobronchial fistulas are an extremely rare subgroup of abdominobronchial fistulas, which include bronchobiliary, gastrobronchial, enterobronchial, colobronchial, and splenobronchial fistulas.
 Only one case of a duodenobronchial fistula has been previously reported.
 Duodenobronchial fistulas occur as a complication of a duodenal injury.
 The characteristic symptoms are a cough that produces copious bilious secretions, shortness of breath, and fever.
 The diagnosis is made by contrast gastrointestinal studies.
 Treatment requires an abdominal approach with interruption of the fistula at its duodenal origin and control of the inciting inflammatory process.
 With prompt diagnosis and treatment, thoracic drainage or pulmonary resection should not be needed.
