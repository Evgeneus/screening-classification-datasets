Perineal excision of the rectum for prolapse in the elderly.
 A perineal operation is described for the treatment of rectal prolapse.
 The surgery improves functional outcome by correcting the anatomical anomalies associated with the condition.
 In 17 elderly women, there was one perioperative death and one recurrence.
 At a median follow-up of 24 months, 13 patients were able to control solid stool and three were profoundly incontinent.
 The operation may be an alternative to the more invasive abdominal procedures for the treatment of the majority of patients with prolapse.
