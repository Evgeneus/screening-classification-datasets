Temper tantrums.
 Temper tantrums are a normal response to anger and occur commonly in the child between one and four years of age.
 They arise from the child's thwarted efforts to exercise mastery and autonomy.
 Tantrums occur more frequently in the active, determined child who has abundant energy.
 Parenting practices that may encourage tantrums include inconsistency, unreasonable expectations, excessive strictness, overprotectiveness and overindulgence.
 Boredom, fatigue, hunger or illness may reduce the child's tolerance for frustration.
 Management consists of teaching the parents to understand the underlying meaning of tantrums and to modify parental behaviors that may perpetuate or accentuate the problem.
 Temper tantrums are best handled by ignoring the outburst, offering nurturance to the child after the tantrum has subsided and helping the child learn to express negative feelings in more acceptable ways.
