Splanchnic oxygen consumption in septic and hemorrhagic shock.
 Oxygen consumption (VO2) is dependent on oxygen delivery (DO2) in septic shock.
 Local hypoxia with later secondary organ failure may develop, however, despite an often hyperdynamic circulation.
 The splanchnic organs seem to be of vital importance in this context.
 In experiments performed in pigs we compared total body VO2 and DO2 with oxygen consumption and delivery in the gastrointestinal organs and the liver in two different shock states: (1) septic shock induced by peritonitis (n = 6) and (2) hemorrhagic shock (n = 6).
 Another group of six animals not in shock served as controls.
 Total, gastrointestinal, and liver DO2 decreased in a similar pattern in both septic and hemorrhagic shock.
 Gastrointestinal and liver VO2 increased in sepsis, whereas it was unchanged in hemorrhage.
 In the later phase of sepsis, liver VO2, but not gastrointestinal VO2, again decreased, because liver oxygen extraction was almost total and liver DO2 decreased further.
 The development of flow-dependent liver hypoxia was reflected in a decrease in liver lactate turnover (increased liver lactate release) during late sepsis.
 Early hypoxia in the splanchnic region is suggested as a plausible mechanism behind the development of secondary organ failure, especially in sepsis.
