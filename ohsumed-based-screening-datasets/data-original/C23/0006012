Persistent segmental cutaneous anesthesia after a brown recluse spider bite.
 Patients with brown recluse spider bites commonly suffer from pain, muscular aching, and a variety of local dysesthesias during the acute and resolution phases of toxin-induced injury.
 This is our first well-documented observation of persistent cutaneous anesthesia caused by a spider bite.
 The anesthetic area conformed to the distribution of a specific nerve, the transverse cervical cutaneous nerve.
 The identification of the spider as a brown recluse and the location of the bite over the nerve's usual pathway strongly suggest that the venom was responsible for this complication.
