Chest pain: an evaluation of the initial diagnosis made by 25 Flemish general practitioners.
 Twenty-five general practitioners collected information on 318 contacts of patients with a new episode of chest pain, discomfort or tightness.
 A list of complaints, signs and symptoms were checked, together with the initial diagnosis, made by the GP immediately after the physical examination.
 The initial diagnosis was compared to a follow-up diagnosis.
 The gain in certainty was also compared.
 The GP made a correct initial diagnosis in 82% of patients.
 In 8% there was a clinically important difference, and seven of 17 episodes of oesophageal disease were missed.
 For their initial diagnosis, the GP scored 74% certain, 20% uncertain and no diagnosis in 6%.
 For the final diagnosis, these figures were 88%, 8% and 4%.
