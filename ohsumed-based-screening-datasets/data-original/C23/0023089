Late rupture of a superior intercostal artery following repair of aortic coarctation.
 Having had surgical repair of aortic coarctation at the age of 12 years, and re-operation at the age of 19 years for stenosis at the site of the previous repair, a 29 years old man presented as an emergency with a 24 hour history of interscapular pain, haemoptysis and collapse.
 At thoracotomy he was found to have a ruptured superior intercostal artery which was ligated.
 Spontaneous rupture of an intercostal artery has not been previously recorded.
