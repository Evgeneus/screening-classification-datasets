Experimental short-bowel syndrome: effect of an elemental diet supplemented with short-chain triglycerides.
 To determine whether short-chain triglycerides (SCTs, 1:1 triacetin:tributyrin, wt:wt) enhance intestinal adaptation in short-bowel syndrome (SBS), male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 60% distal small-bowel resection with cecectomy and received either a chemically defined diet (CD) or a CD containing 40% of nonprotein energy as either medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) or SCTs.
 After 12 d the SCT group had significantly increased jejunal mucosal weight compared with the MCT and CD groups and had significantly increased segment weight and mucosal protein compared with the CD group.
 In the colon the SCT group had significantly increased segment and mucosal weights and mucosal protein and DNA compared with both the MCT and CD groups.
 Body-weight change and measurements of serum ketones, albumin, glucose, and triglycerides revealed no significant differences among groups.
 SCTs improved jejunal and colonic adaptive growth and maintained comparable nutritional status in SBS when compared with CD alone or CD with MCTs.
