Tuberculous bronchial stenosis: CT findings in 28 cases.
 Bronchial stenosis is a complication of tuberculous parenchymal or lymph node disease and may adversely affect its treatment.
 Findings on plain radiographs may be nonspecific or simulate malignancy.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of CT in diagnosing this abnormality.
 We reviewed the findings in 28 patients who underwent CT to evaluate bronchial stenosis proved by bronchoscopy.
 Eighteen had evidence of tuberculosis on bronchial biopsy.
 In the other 10 the biopsy findings were nonspecific, but tuberculous lesions were elsewhere in the thorax.
 Twelve patients (43%) had CT findings of concentric bronchial stenosis, uniform thickening of the bronchial wall, and involvement of a long segment of the bronchi.
 In 14 patients (50%), CT showed obliteration of bronchial outlines by adjacent lymphadenopathy, parenchymal consolidation, and absence of intraluminal air.
 In two patients, the abnormality was not visible on CT.
 Our experience shows that CT is useful for identifying bronchial stenosis caused by tuberculosis.
 However, the findings vary, and in more than half of the patients concentric narrowing and uniform thickening of the bronchi are not seen.
