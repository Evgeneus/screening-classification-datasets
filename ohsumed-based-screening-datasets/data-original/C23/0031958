Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy of childhood: treatment with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin.
 We treated four children with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) with high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).
 All patients received 400 mg/kg of IVIG a day for 5 days during relapses, and one patient received additional periodic infusions of 400 mg/kg.
 All patients showed excellent recovery of motor strength following each relapse that was treated with IVIG.
 Compared with plasmapheresis (which was used to treat relapses earlier), recovery of function with IVIG treatments was similar, and in two patients it was superior, to plasmapheresis.
 There were no side effects with IVIG treatments as compared with plasmapheresis with which two children had infection of central lines with Staphylococcus epidermidis, one had profuse bleeding from accidental extrusion of a central line, and one had multiple episodes of major venous thromboses.
 High-dose IVIG was a safe and effective adjunctive therapy for childhood CIDP in these four patients.
