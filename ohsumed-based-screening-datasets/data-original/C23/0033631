Chronic hematocele complicating renal failure and hemodialysis.
 A patient with a recent history of genitourinary tuberculosis, chronic renal failure and hemodialysis presented with a slow growing scrotal swelling that had enlarged during the last 3 years.
 Physical examination and sonography were suspicious for testicular tumor, and surgical exploration and inguinal orchiectomy were performed.
 Ultimately the mass proved to be a chronic hematocele, a rare complication of uremic coagulopathy and hemodialysis.
 Because hematocele may clinically and sonographically resemble a testicular tumor, the proper management of a complex multiseptated scrotal mass without obvious history suggestive of hematocele is surgical exploration and orchiectomy.
 Awareness of this common presentation may obviate orchiectomy.
