Periorbital hematoma secondary to sinusitis in a child.
 Periorbital abscess secondary to sinusitis is a well-recognized entity in children.
 However, subperiosteal hematoma is extremely rare and has been reported in only four adult patients.
 This article presents the case of a 4-year-old girl with sinusitis, proptosis, and decreased visual acuity.
 Surgical exploration of the orbit revealed the presence of a large organizing subperiosteal hematoma that was drained.
 The presence of a periorbital hematoma should be suspected in patients with acute onset of proptosis and findings of a periorbital mass and sinusitis on computed tomographic scan.
