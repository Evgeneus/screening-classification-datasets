Osteochondrodysplasia in Fryns syndrome.
 Various skeletal abnormalities have been identified in roentgenograms of persons with Fryns syndrome, but to our knowledge, no histopathologic description of bone or cartilage has been published.
 We describe disordered endochondral and intramembranous bone formation in a premature female infant with Fryns syndrome.
 This infant and a full sibling (ie, had same set of parents) with Fryns syndrome in addition exhibited delayed ossification of the basiocciput and of cervical vertebral bodies, also previously undescribed in Fryns syndrome.
 These findings expand the spectrum of Fryns syndrome to include osteochondrodysplasia.
