Spontaneous rupture of a normal bladder.
 We have reported a case of spontaneous rupture of a normal urinary bladder.
 Patients with this rare condition characteristically have a recent history of heavy alcohol intake, sudden onset of abdominal pain coincidental with bloody urine, generalized peritonitis, and abnormal renal chemistry.
 A high index of suspicion will lead to early diagnosis and treatment, minimizing the mortality attributed to this condition.
