Modification of the Bankart reconstruction with a suture anchor. Report of a new technique.
 We assessed the effectiveness of a new suture anchor that has been designed to anchor sutures into a blind, straight hole drilled in bone.
 The strength of fixation in glenoid bone is 67 N for the No.
 0 anchor and suture, and 82 N for the No.
 2 device with suture.
 During 1988 and 1989, 32 patients underwent a modified Bankart reconstruction for recurrent anterior glenohumeral instability at two centers as part of a prospective study of this modified technique.
 There were no complications as a result of the technique.
 The four surgeons involved agreed that the suture anchor simplified the procedure.
 Seventeen patients have been reviewed, with more than 1 year followup.
 Ninety-four percent had good to excellent results according to the Bankart rating scale.
 There was one recurrent dislocation in a football player.
