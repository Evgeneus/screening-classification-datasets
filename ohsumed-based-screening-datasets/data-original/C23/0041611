Phasic sleep components in infants with cyanosis during feeding.
 Although brainstem immaturity has been postulated as one of the pathogenesis underlying cyanosis during feeding (CDF), there has been no widely accepted physiologic parameter that reflects brainstem function.
 We recently proposed that the dissociation index (DI), one of the phasic sleep parameters, is a reliable and quantitative sleep parameter for assessing brainstem maturation during early infancy.
 In the present study, we evaluated brainstem impairment in infants with CDF using phasic sleep components.
 Polysomnographies were obtained for 12 infants with CDF who were equally divided into 2 groups: one had or subsequently experienced apparent life-threatening events or sudden infant death syndrome (ALTE-SIDS group) and the other did not (CDF group).
 Rapid eye movement density and the number of gross movements (body movements, including the trunk, lasting greater than or equal to 2 sec) in the patients were identical to those in the controls.
 In the CDF group, the decrease of the average DI value from the controls was significantly less than the decrease in the ALTE-SIDS group.
 CDF may be a mild expression of brainstem immaturity.
 DI appears to be useful when evaluating infants with cyanosis during feeding.
