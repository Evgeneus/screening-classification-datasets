Serum aldolase isozyme levels in patients with cerebrovascular diseases.
 A subunit specific radioimmunoassay was developed for the quantification of human aldolase A, B, and C.
 The method used was a double antibody radioimmunoassay using radioiodinated purified aldolase A, B, or C subunits as the ligand, specific chicken antibodies to aldolase isozymes and rabbit antibodies to chicken IgG.
 The Iodogen method was used for iodination of the purified isozyme subunits in this study.
 Human brain tissue contained similar concentrations of aldolase A and aldolase C, and a smaller amount of aldolase B, which was the main isozyme of liver tissue.
 Levels of serum aldolase A were greater than 203 ng/ml, the upper limit of normal, in six of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and in 11 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage.
 Nine of 24 patients with cerebral infarction and 16 of 31 patients with cerebral hemorrhage had serum aldolase C levels greater than 4.1 ng/ml, the upper limit in normal sera.
 These data suggest that serum aldolase C may be a more specific and sensitive marker of cerebrovascular diseases than aldolase A.
 We also demonstrated that serial measurement of serum aldolase C in patients with cerebrovascular diseases might be useful in estimating prognosis, since serially increasing serum aldolase C levels during the course of these diseases were correlated with a high mortality rate.
