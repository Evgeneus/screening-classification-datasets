Insights into the mechanisms of defective antigen presentation after hemorrhage.
 Although hemorrhage depresses macrophage antigen presentation (AP), a critical component in eliciting an antigen-specific immune response, it is not known which particular step in macrophage AP (i.e., uptake, ingestion, catabolism, or presentation of degraded antigens to T cells) is defective.
 To study this, C3H/HeN mice were bled to an arterial mean blood pressure of 35 mm Hg, maintained for 60 minutes, and then adequately resuscitated.
 Peritoneal and splenic macrophage cultures were prepared 2 and 24 hours after hemorrhage.
 Macrophage AP capacity was measured by coculturing macrophages with the T-helper cell clone D10.G4.1.
 To gain information about macrophage ability to digest the specific antigen conalbumin, lysosomal activity was bypassed by use of chemically denatured conalbumin peptides.
 To study macrophage ability to present conalbumin peptides, macrophages were fixed and D10.G4.1 proliferation in response to fragmented conalbumin was determined.
 AP of native conalbumin by peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages was depressed (p less than 0.05) by 50% (peritoneal macrophages) and 55% (splenic macrophages) 2 hours and 57% (peritoneal macrophages) and 35% (splenic macrophages) 24 hours after hemorrhage.
 In contrast, presentation of conalbumin peptides was only slightly decreased.
 In addition, the ability of fixed peritoneal macrophages and splenic macrophages to present conalbumin peptides was similar in hemorrhaged and sham mice.
 Because bypassing of macrophage lysosomal activity with degraded native antigens prevented the suppression of AP, the results suggest that hemorrhage-induced suppression of AP is not caused by a reduced macrophage capacity to present antigenic peptides but by decreased antigen catabolism by macrophages.
