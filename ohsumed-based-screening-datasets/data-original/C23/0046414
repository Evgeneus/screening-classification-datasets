Comparison of different doses of epinephrine on myocardial perfusion and resuscitation success during cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a pig model.
 Published results of dose-response effects of adrenergic drugs (epinephrine [E]) vary so much between studies because of differences in animal models and duration of ischemia before drug administration.
 In this investigation the effects of different doses of E on coronary perfusion pressure (CPP), left ventricular myocardial blood flow (MBF) and resuscitation success were compared during closed-chest cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) after a 4-minute period of ventricular fibrillation in 28 pigs.
 MBF was measured during normal sinus rhythm using tracer microspheres.
 After 4 minutes of ventricular fibrillation CPR was performed with the use of a pneumatic piston compressor.
 After 4 minutes of mechanical measures only, the animals were randomly allocated into four groups of seven, receiving 0.015, 0.030, 0.045, and 0.090 mg/kg E intravenously respectively.
 MBF measurements were started 45 seconds after E administration; hemodynamic measurements after 90 seconds.
 Four minutes after the first administration, the same E dose was given before defibrillation.
 The CPP of animals given 0.015, 0.030, 0.045 and 0.090 mg/kg E were as follows: 16.3 +/- 6.1, 25.6 +/- 5.8, 33.2 +/- 8.4 and 30.4 +/- 6.3 mm Hg.
 The left ventricular MBF values were: 14 +/- 9, 27 +/- 11, 43 +/- 6, 46 +/- 10 mL/min/100 g.
 The differences between the groups receiving 0.015 and 0.045 mg/kg and between the groups receiving 0.015 mg/kg and 0.090 mg/kg were statistically significant (P less than .05).
 Resuscitation success was 14.3%, 42.9%, 100% and 86.7% respectively.
 A significant difference in resuscitation success was found only between 0.015 mg/kg and 0.045 mg/kg E.
