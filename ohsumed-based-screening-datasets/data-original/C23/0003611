Postpartum hemorrhage: placenta accreta, uterine inversion, and puerperal hematomas.
 Puerperal hematomas, although rare, can be potentially morbid or life-threatening events.
 Early surgical management, including clot evacuation, layered closure, drainage, antibiotics, and fluid replacement (including blood), usually result in satisfactory outcome.
 Prevention is clearly preferable and often achievable with careful initial repair of episiotomies and lacerations.
