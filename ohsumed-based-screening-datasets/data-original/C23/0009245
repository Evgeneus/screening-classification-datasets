Continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs for filling and lining the post-exenteration pelvis.
 Pelvic exenteration has a high complication rate due, in large part, to the extensive raw surfaces and dead space it creates.
 Numerous techniques have been used to control this space and line these surfaces, but none, to date, has proven to be a reliable solution.
 We investigated the use of continent ileocolonic urinary reservoirs as a new "flap" to fill and line the pelvis in 17 patients, and found that our historical complication rate of 44% for pelvic exenteration was reduced to 18%.
 These reservoirs appear to be an improved method of managing the post-exenteration pelvis.
