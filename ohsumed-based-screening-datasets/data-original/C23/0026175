Spatial control of gut-specific gene expression during Caenorhabditis elegans development.
 The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was transformed with constructs containing upstream deletions of the gut-specific ges-1 carboxylesterase gene.
 With particular deletions, ges-1 was expressed, not as normally in the gut, but rather in muscle cells of the pharynx (which belong to a sister lineage of the gut) or in body wall muscle and hypodermal cells (which belong to a cousin lineage of the gut).
 These observations suggest that gut-specific gene expression in C.
 elegans involves not only gut-specific activators but also multiple repressors that are present in particular nongut lineages.
