Disability in persons hospitalized with AIDS.
 This study documents the types and degree of disability seen in persons with AIDS at discharge from acute hospitalization.
 Based on 37 discharge evaluations using the Functional Independence Measure (FIM), 60% required human assistance in at least one of 18 FIM areas.
 Thirty-two percent required human assistance in five or more areas.
 Fifty-one and 38% required human assistance in stair climbing and ambulation, respectively.
 Feeding and bathing required assistance in about 33% and transferring to tub or shower in 25% of the sample.
 Increasing disability was associated with longer duration of AIDS diagnosis and increasing lengths of hospital stay (P less than 0.01 and P less than 0.05, respectively).
 There were individuals who remained nearly functionally independent up to 30 months after an AIDS defining event.
 The overall variability in function, however, was not significantly different between those with diagnoses less than and greater than 12 months.
 We conclude that significant physical disability exists in persons with AIDS at discharge from acute hospitalization.
 Consultation with and intervention by rehabilitation professionals may be helpful in the management of physical disability in this population and setting.
