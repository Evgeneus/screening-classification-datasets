Synthesis of 70K stress protein by human leukocytes: effect of exercise in the heat.
 To determine whether reinduction of 70,000-Da (70K) stress protein synthesis could be used as an assay for thermal history and/or cellular levels of 70K stress protein in hyperthermic humans, leukocytes were obtained before and after 2 h of exercise and then incubated at 37 or 41 degrees C.
 Five healthy males completed 2 h of treadmill exercise consisting of running at 4-6 km/h for 30-45 min followed by 75-90 min of walking up a 2-10% grade.
 This exercise bout was performed by two subjects in hot (46 degrees C, 15% relative humidity) and by five subjects in cooler (30 degrees C, 40% relative humidity) environmental conditions.
 Exercise resulting in rectal temperature (Tre) less than 40 degrees C did not alter the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized by leukocytes incubated at 41 degrees C.
 In contrast, exercise resulting in Tre greater than 40 degrees C reduced the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized by leukocytes incubated at 41 degrees C.
 A protein immunoblot, probed with an antibody specific for the inducible 72K stress protein, showed that the reduction of 35S-labeled 70K stress protein in these postexercise leukocyte samples occurred without marked elevations of this protein.
 In vitro incubation of human leukocytes at 40 degrees C for 15-120 min reduced, in a time-dependent manner, the amount of 70K stress protein synthesized during a subsequent 41 degrees C heat stress.
 This reduction of 70K stress protein synthesis in 41 degrees C-treated leukocytes was abolished when cycloheximide was present during the 40 degrees C preincubation.
