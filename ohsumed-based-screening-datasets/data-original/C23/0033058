Transplant aspiration cytology: applications to kidney and liver transplantations.
 In summary, cytologic monitoring of renal and liver transplants is a well established diagnostic procedure.
 The prime value of the FNAB relates to the posttransplantation perioperative period: the acute alterations in the transplant, such as acute rejection and the differential diagnoses, can be established in most cases.
 However, evaluation of vascular patterns of rejection, in particular chronic rejection, is impossible to obtain from the FNAB.
 A needle core biopsy is needed.
