Percutaneous intra-aortic balloon pump: emphasis on complications.
 In a review of our 5-year experience with intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) insertion I examined the complications of percutaneous IABP placement in 93 patients, and compared them with those reported in other studies in the literature.
 I analyzed several variables that may affect the complication rate.
 Of 78 patients in our series who had percutaneous IABP cardiac assist, 15 (19%) had complications, which falls into the acceptable range reported by others.
 Among 15 patients who had surgical placement of an IABP, the complication rate was similar at 20%.
 The complication rate after IABP insertions done by surgeons primarily in the operating room was compared with that from insertions done by cardiologists in the catheterization laboratory.
 The overall complication rate was found to be higher in the second group, 28.0% compared with 12.8%.
 The application of the IABP in cardiogenic shock was associated with a high complication rate (46%).
 On the other hand, its insertion before cardiac surgery was associated with a relatively low complication rate (9.5%).
