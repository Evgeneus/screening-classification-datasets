Transoesophageal pacing for perioperative control of neonatal paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
 The perioperative management of a 16-day-old infant with recurrent supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is discussed.
 Vagal manoeuvres and medication were not adequate in controlling the SVT.
 Since the patient was scheduled for extensive surgery in the prone position, it was decided to use transoesophageal pacing as the method of choice for conversion of SVT.
 Transoesophageal pacing succeeded several times in overriding the SVT and restoring normal heart rate and haemodynamic variables.
 The advantages and disadvantages of various methods of treating SVT in the newborn are discussed.
