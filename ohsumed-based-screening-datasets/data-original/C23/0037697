Intraaortic balloon pumping as the postangioplasty strategy in acute myocardial infarction.
 To assess the usefulness of intraaortic balloon pumping (IABP) in acute myocardial infarction (AMI), 114 patients with anterior AMI undergoing emergency percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) for total occlusion of the left anterior descending artery were studied.
 After successful PTCA 66 patients were treated with conventional therapy (group I), and 48 patients were treated with IABP for 25 +/- 8 hours (group II).
 The reocclusion rate was significantly lower in group II (2.4% vs 17.7% p less than 0.05).
 An increase in ejection fraction in group II compared with group I was marginally significant (4.5 +/- 12.2% vs 9.2 +/- 13.0%, p = 0.08).
 Vascular complications occurred in two patients, but there were no deaths from IABP.
 These results suggest that after successful PTCA for acute myocardial infarction, IABP prevents reocclusion and may add strength to reperfusion in the improvement of left ventricular function.
