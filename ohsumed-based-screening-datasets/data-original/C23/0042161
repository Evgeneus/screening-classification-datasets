Treatment of esophageal varices: low versus high dose of 5% ethanolamine oleate.
 Twenty-four patients, undergoing sclerotherapy for esophageal varices, were injected with 10-20 ml of ethanolamine oleate 5% in the first treatment session (group A).
 Fourteen patients were injected with 40 ml of the same sclerosant in the first session (group B).
 Retrospective analysis was carried out to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two doses.
 Variceal eradication was achieved in group B in significantly fewer sclerotherapy sessions.
 Rebleeding occurred in 16% of patients in group A, compared with no rebleeding in group B.
 There was no significant difference in the incidence of various complications.
 We conclude that the use of 40 ml of 5% ethanolamine oleate in the first session is more effective and as safe as the use of 20 ml of the same sclerosant.
