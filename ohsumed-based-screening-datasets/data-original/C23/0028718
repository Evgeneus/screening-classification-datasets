Fibreoptic bronchoscopy without general anaesthetic.
 We have used flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy using sedation and local anaesthesia in 50 children aged 2-19 years (median 10) using an Olympus BFP20 instrument.
 Indications were opportunistic pneumonias (n = 11), persistent atelectasis (n = 11), recurrent pneumonia (n = 7), miscellaneous lower airway disease (n = 7), recurrent wheezing (n = 3), haemoptysis (3), to diagnose infection or rejection of heart-lung transplants (n = 3), stridor (n = 2), suspected airway compression (n = 1), evaluation of tracheostomy (n = 1), and suspected foreign body (n = 1).
 In 43 cases (86%) the diagnosis was related to the primary indication.
 In five (10%) unrelated abnormalities were found, and five (10%) were normal.
 In 13 (26%) treatment was altered as a result of flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy.
 Complications were transient respiratory arrest (n = 2), hypoxia (n = 2), pneumonia (n = 2), and laryngospasm (n = 1).
 All complications were followed by complete recovery.
 Our results suggest that flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy is safe.
 Advantages over rigid bronchoscopy include greater visual range, fewer complications, and the avoidance of a general anaesthetic.
 Though invasive it can yield important diagnostic and therapeutic information.
