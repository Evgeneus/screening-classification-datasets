Indium-111-leukocyte imaging in acute cholecystitis.
 Eleven patients with suspected acute cholecystitis underwent sequential 99mTc-iminodiacetic derivative (IDA) and 111In-white blood cell (WBC) imaging to determine if 111In-WBCs accumulate within an acutely inflamed hemorrhagic gallbladder wall and, thus, could be employed as a reasonable alternative to 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy in detecting acute cholecystitis.
 Seven patients had surgically confirmed acute cholecystitis.
 Of these cases, five had a true-positive 99mTc-IDA and 111In-WBC, one an indeterminate 111In-WBC and true-positive 99mTc-IDA, and one a true-positive 111In-WBC and false-negative 99mTc-IDA scan.
 The remaining four patients did not have acute cholecystitis.
 All visualized their gallbladder within 1 hr after 99mTc-IDA administration and none had 111In-WBC gallbladder wall uptake.
 Both 111In-WBC and 99mTc-IDA scintigraphy accurately detected acute cholecystitis: hepatobiliary scintigraphy demonstrated a cystic duct obstruction and 111In-WBC imaging detected the inflammatory infiltrate within the gallbladder wall.
 The sensitivity and specificity of each was 86% and 100%, respectively.
