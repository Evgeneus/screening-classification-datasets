Stricture disease: radiology of urethral stents.
 Self-expanding metal stents are emerging as an effective alternative treatment in the management of urethral obstruction.
 The radiologic studies of 33 men with anterior urethral strictures (subprostatic, n = 11; bulbar, n = 22) that had recurred despite repeated optical urethrotomy and dilation were reported.
 In all patients, the stricture was successfully treated with stent insertion.
 Urethrography performed 1 month later in 19 patients showed an irregular intrastent lumen of varying degrees due to a hyperplastic urothelial reaction confirmed at endoscopy the same day.
 Available follow-up urethrograms in seven patients at 3 months showed that the hyperplasia was settling, and by 6 months, the intrastent lumen was smooth and of good caliber.
 Urethrography revealed postoperative structures in 14 patients.
 Strictures seen at 1 month (n = 6) were due to initial stent misplacement and were treated with the insertion of a second stent.
 Strictures seen 3 months after insertion (n = 4) occurred within the stent lumen and were considered to be significant at endoscopy in only one patient.
 Strictures that developed 6-12 months after stent insertion (n = 4) were not within the stent and were considered to represent genuine new strictures.
