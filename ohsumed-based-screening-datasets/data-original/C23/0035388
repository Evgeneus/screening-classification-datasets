Chronic prosthetic vascular graft infection visualized with technetium-99m-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime-labeled leukocytes 
 Technetium-99m-HMPAO labeled leukocytes demonstrated chronic femoro-femoral prosthetic vascular graft infection several times during an 18-mo period in a 77-yr-old man.
 The intensity and distribution of the uptake in the graft were fluctuating in different imaging occasions possibly indicating the strength and location of the infection.
 Gallium-67-citrate imaging showed negative results twice.
 The reason for negative 67Ga results remained obscure.
 The infected graft was removed and the patient did well 5 mo postoperatively.
