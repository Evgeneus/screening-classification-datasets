Disturbances in the cerebral perfusion of human immune deficiency virus-1 seropositive asymptomatic subjects: a quantitative tomography study of 18 cases.
 Quantitative measurements of cerebral blood flow (CBF) by xenon-133 (133Xe) tomography, together with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), psychometric tests, and laboratory analyses were performed on 18 human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) seropositive asymptomatic subjects.
 Abnormalities of cerebral perfusion were observed in 16 cases (88%).
 These abnormalities were particularly frequent in the frontal regions (77% of cases).
 MRI demonstrated leucoencephalopathy in only two cases.
 EEG showed only induced diffuse abnormalities in two cases.
 Psychometric tests showed restricted moderate disturbances in 55% of patients.
 These disturbances mostly concerned those sectors involved in cognitive functions and memorization.
 These results indicate that quantitative measurements of CBF by 133Xe-SPECT is capable of detecting abnormalities of cerebral perfusion at a very early stage (Phase II) of HIV-1 infection.
 These abnormalities are indications of disturbances resulting from unidentified metabolic or vascular lesions.
 This technique appears to be superior to MRI at this stage of the disease's development.
 It could provide objective information leading to earlier treatment, and prove useful in evaluating potential antiviral chemotherapy.
