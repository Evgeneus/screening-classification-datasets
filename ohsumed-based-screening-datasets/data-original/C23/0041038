The significance of circulating cells carrying t(14;18) in long remission from follicular lymphoma 
 Peripheral blood mononuclear cell fractions from 15 patients in continuous clinical remission from follicular lymphoma for longer than 10 years were examined for cells carrying the t(14;18) translocation using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
 The assay used was able to detect one positive cell in approximately 5 x 10(5) cells (a single 14q+ molecule in 2.5 micrograms DNA).
 Cells positive for t(14;18) were found in six of eight patients initially presenting with stage III or IV disease, compared with zero of seven of those with stage I or II disease (P less than .05).
 In two cases 14q+ junction regions were also successfully amplified from formalin-fixed biopsy material obtained at presentation 12 and 17 years previously.
 In both, sequence analysis demonstrated that the cells circulating in remission belonged to the original clone.
 These results indicate that cells bearing t(14;18) frequently persist in the peripheral blood in long remission of advanced follicular lymphoma and question the value of their presence as a predictor of relapse.
