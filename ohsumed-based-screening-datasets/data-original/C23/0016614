Exocrine pancreatic function in chronic liver diseases.
 To confirm the respective influence of chronic alcoholism and liver disease on exocrine pancreatic function in cholecystokinin secretin (CS), tests were performed on patients with chronic liver cirrhosis (LC) and non-cirrhotic (nLC) disease of alcoholic (A) and nonalcoholic (nA) etiology.
 Results were compared in four subgroups (ALC, N = 26; AnLC, N = 45; nALC, N = 18; and nAnLC, N = 43).
 Volume of duodenal juice and bicarbonate output (BO) were increased and maximal bicarbonate concentration was decreased in ALC, compared with those in normal controls.
 Comparison of LC and nLC indicated that the volume, BO, and amylase output (AO) were greater in LC than in nLC of alcoholic etiology, but not in those of nonalcoholic etiology.
 The initial disappearance rate (KICG) of indocyanine green (ICG) excretion correlated with a parameter of CS test in alcoholic liver disease (vs.
 volume: r = -0.51, p less than 0.01 vs BO: r = -0.40, p less than 0.01), but not in nonalcoholic liver disease.
 Concurrent chronic pancreatitis with pain and definite exocrine insufficiency was observed in only one ALC patient and in four AnLC patients, but in none of the nonalcoholics.
 In alcoholic liver disease, exocrine pancreatic secretion tends to increase with severity of liver damage, but concurrence of definite chronic pancreatitis is not correlated with the severity.
