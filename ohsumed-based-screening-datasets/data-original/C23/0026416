Balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children.
 Traditionally, the treatment of esophageal strictures in children has been done with mercury bougies in a prograde fashion or with Tucker dilators passed along a guide wire in a retrograde manner.
 An alternative approach has used a balloon dilatation catheter passed over a guide wire previously placed under fluoroscopic guidance.
 Over the past 5 years, this technique has been used in 43 procedures for both discrete and diffuse strictures.
 The interventions were performed in a total of 15 patients ranging in age from 8 months to 21 years.
 In all cases, there was improvement of the preceding symptoms following dilatation.
 This report details the experience with this technique at Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, Ohio, emphasizing the indications, contraindications, and potential complications associated with balloon dilatation of esophageal strictures in children.
