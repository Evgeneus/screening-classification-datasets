Dystonia in Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy.
 Adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism is a syndrome in search of a pathology.
 We therefore reviewed the literature on dystonic manifestations in autopsy-proven cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD).
 Only 6 of 140 autopsy reports of MSA remarked on the presence of dystonia in life, but personal observations suggest prominent antecollis may develop at some stage in up to 1/2 of sufferers.
 Similarly, very few (15/118) clinicopathologic observations on PSP included convincing dystonic manifestations, in contrast to some clinical reports where blepharospasm and early limb dystonia were prominent.
 Virtually any form of focal and segmental dystonia may sometimes occur with clinically diagnosed PD, with occasional descriptions of hemidystonia-hemiparkinsonism.
 However, there is pathologic confirmation of this diagnosis in only 1 case.
 With many patients thought clinically to have PD proving pathologically to have another cause for their parkinsonism, the true frequency and the range of dystonic manifestations acceptable in PD remain unknown.
