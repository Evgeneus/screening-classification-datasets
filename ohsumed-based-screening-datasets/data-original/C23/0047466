Intrinsic vasculature of the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve--implications for site of lesion in Bell's palsy.
 Recent studies of the intrinsic vasculature of the cat facial nerve have demonstrated relatively poor blood supply to the labyrinthine segment.
 In this study, the intrinsic vasculature of the human facial nerve was systematically evaluated in 25 temporal bones and three fresh cadaver nerves.
 Cross-sectional vessel counts were obtained for the labyrinthine, tympanic, and mastoid segments.
 Capillary densities for each segment were derived from these data.
 The labyrinthine segment of the human facial nerve, like that in the cat, contains fewer and smaller intrinsic blood vessels than do the mastoid and tympanic segments.
 This may indicate that the labyrinthine segment of the facial nerve may be more vulnerable to ischemic damage.
 In conjunction with the previously demonstrated narrowness of the labyrinthine fallopian canal, these findings support the contention that the labyrinthine segment is a likely site of lesion in Bell's palsy.
