The impact of nonidentical ABO cadaveric renal transplantation on waiting times and graft survival.
 Blood type O recipients of cadaveric renal transplants have longer pretransplant waiting periods than blood type A, B, and AB recipients.
 To evaluate reasons for and consequences of this discrepancy, we studied both the frequency of various donor and recipient blood type combinations and their outcomes.
 Among 37,659 cadaveric renal transplants performed during 1983 through 1989, there were 2,625 transplants (7%) received by patients of compatible but nonidentical blood types.
 Of 18,575 type O donor organs, 16,784 were received by type O patients for a recipient to donor ratio of 0.9.
 The corresponding ratios were greater than 1.0 for all other blood types (1.02 for blood type A, 1.14 for type B, and 2.18 for type AB).
 This causes blood type O patients to have a lower access to transplantation and to have significantly longer waiting times than patients of all other blood types.
 This inequality of access diminished significantly (P less than 0.001) over the years, but did not resolve by 1989.
 Analysis of relative risk for first graft loss by multiple regression (Cox) showed that transplantation across compatible blood types had a 9.1% higher risk (P less than 0.1) than that of transplantation among identical blood types.
 Cadaveric renal transplantation within identical blood types optimizes access to transplantation and avoids further aggravating past disadvantages for blood type O recipients.
