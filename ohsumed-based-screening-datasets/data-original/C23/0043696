Long-term efficacy of repeat argon laser trabeculoplasty.
 The role of repeat argon laser trabeculoplasty (RALT) in the management of open-angle glaucoma is controversial.
 To determine the long-term efficacy of RALT, the authors reviewed case records of 44 patients (50 eyes) who received RALT for uncontrolled glaucoma at the Wills Eye Hospital before 1986.
 Success was defined as a 3 mmHg or greater decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) to less than 22 mmHg, and no further surgical intervention.
 By life table analysis, RALT was successful in 35% of eyes at 6 months, in 21% at 12 months, in 11% at 24 months, and in 5% at 48 months.
 Thirty-three percent of eyes in which primary ALT was successful for 1 year were successful 12 months after RALT.
 Complications included IOP spikes in 12%.
 In conclusion, RALT was generally not effective for long-term control of open-angle glaucoma, but may be useful as a temporizing measure.
 However, this use of RALT must be weighed against the risks of complications and the additional progression of disease before more definitive surgical intervention.
