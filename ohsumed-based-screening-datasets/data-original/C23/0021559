Bialaphos poisoning with apnea and metabolic acidosis.
 A 64-year-old man with ethanol intoxication, ingested a bottle of Herbiace (100 ml, 32 w/v% of bialaphos, CAS #35597-43-4, Meiji Seika Kaisha, Tokyo, Japan).
 He had severe metabolic acidosis and was treated with infusions of sodium bicarbonate and furosemide, plus gastric lavage and enema.
 The metabolic acidosis improved 15 hours after treatment but nystagmus, apnea and convulsions were progressive.
 Although his sensorium was clear, spontaneous respirations were not observed for 64 hours.
 The electroencephalographic findings of atypical triphasic waves and slow waves suggest a unique response to bialaphos poisoning.
 His clinical course indicates that the management of apnea is critically important to recovery from bialaphos poisoning.
