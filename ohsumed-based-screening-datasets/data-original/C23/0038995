Abnormalities of gastrointestinal motility in children with nonulcer dyspepsia and in children with gastroesophageal reflux disease.
 In 11 children (mean age 44.2 months) with symptoms suggesting upper intestinal dysfunction (nonulcer dyspepsia), in nine children (mean age 27.3 months) with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease, and in seven controls (mean age 20.4 months) we investigated fasting [for 3 hr or until two migrating motor complexes (MMC) were observed] and fed (90 min) antroduodenal motility by means of perfused catheter system; furthermore, we measured both gastric emptying of a radiolabeled milk formula and fasting duodenogastric reflux during manometry by assessing bile salt concentration in gastric aspirates.
 No structural abnormalities of gastrointestinal tract and organic disorders were detected in the patients.
 In a high proportion of both groups of patients we found manometric abnormalities of interdigestive and fed motor patterns that were not seen in the controls: absence of antral phase III of MMC; significant decrease of antral and/or duodenal motor activity during fasting and/or fed periods; abnormal propagation or configuration of MMC phase III that was significantly shorter than in controls; bursts of sustained fasting and/or fed phasic duodenal activity, frequently uncoordinated with adjacent gut segments.
 When compared to controls, the mean intragastric concentration of bile salts during all MMC phases and the mean 1-hr percent gastric activity of the radiolabeled milk were significantly higher in the two groups of patients.
 We conclude that in a high proportion of children with nonulcer dyspepsia and of children with GER disease, gastrointestinal manometry may reveal significant irregularities of antral and duodenal motility, which are associated with increased duodenogastric reflux and delayed gastric emptying.
