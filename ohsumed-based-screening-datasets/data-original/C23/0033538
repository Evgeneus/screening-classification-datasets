The zinc-reversible antimicrobial activity of neutrophil lysates and abscess fluid supernatants.
 There is some evidence to suggest that microbial growth inhibition may occur in chronic abscesses.
 A substance perhaps responsible for this phenomenon is calprotectin, a neutrophil cytoplasmic protein that inhibits microbial growth and that belongs to a class of proteins often having specific binding sites for zinc.
 In the present study, the suppressive effects of either human or mouse neutrophil lysates on Candida albicans growth were found to be completely reversed by micromolar quantities of zinc but not by iron or other trace elements.
 Similarly, supernatants of exudates from experimental abscesses in mice or from clinical specimens of abscesses in humans markedly inhibited the proliferation of C.
 albicans, and this effect was also completely reversed by zinc.
 A protein complex characteristic of calprotectin was identified in the abscess fluids.
 Preparations of the neutrophil growth-inhibiting protein, containing predominantly calprotectin, were shown to have zinc-binding activity by a dialysis technique.
 These findings suggest that the major mechanism of C.
 albicans growth inhibition by abscess fluids is through competition for zinc by a cytoplasmic protein apparently released from dying neutrophils.
