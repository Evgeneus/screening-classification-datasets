An approach to the evaluation and treatment of microscopic hematuria.
 Persistent microscopic hematuria in children is most often benign or untreatable.
 The evaluation of microscopic hematuria in an otherwise healthy child need not require invasive and costly laboratory studies.
 The initial evaluation must look for signs of life-threatening causes of hematuria, i.e., hypertension, edema, oliguria, or significant proteinuria.
 If these are absent, a stepwise evaluation is suggested, which includes microscopic examination of the urine for red blood cell casts, a test for proteinuria, serum creatinine, and serial follow-up.
 Renal biopsy may establish a diagnosis but rarely changes the treatment in a child with asymptomatic isolated microscopic hematuria.
