Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinotomy for retinal reattachment in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases.
 Posterior 360 degrees retinotomy in conjunction with extensive peripheral retinectomy was necessary for retinal reattachment in 18 eyes.
 A visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 22% of the patients; in patients with rubeosis, regression was found in 89%.
 Of the hypotonus eyes, preoperatively 78% were normotensive postoperatively after removal of anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) covering ciliary epithelium.
 The major intraoperative complication was hemorrhage, which could be readily controlled.
 Recurrent retinal detachment (RD) occurred in 39% and reproliferation in 50% of the patients.
