Treatment of systemic vasculitis with pooled intravenous immunoglobulin.
 The therapeutic effect of a course of high-dose, pooled, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) on disease activity and circulating antineutrophil cytoplasm antibodies (ANCA) was investigated in 7 patients with systemic vasculitis.
 5 had active disease despite conventional immunosuppression, and 2 had not received any treatment.
 All 7 had clinical improvement, which was sustained in 6 and transient in 1.
 The fall in ANCA concentrations to a mean of 51% of the pre-treatment values was maintained during follow-up.
 C-reactive protein concentration also dropped considerably.
 IVIg seemed to confer a useful therapeutic effect without adverse reaction.
