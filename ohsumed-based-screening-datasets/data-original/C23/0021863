Cadherin cell adhesion receptors as a morphogenetic regulator.
 Cadherins are a family of cell adhesion receptors that are crucial for the mutual association of vertebrate cells.
 Through their homophilic binding interactions, cadherins play a role in cell-sorting mechanisms, conferring adhesion specificities on cells.
 The regulated expression of cadherins also controls cell polarity and tissue morphology.
 Cadherins are thus considered to be important regulators of morphogenesis.
 Moreover, pathological examinations suggest that the down-regulation of cadherin expression is associated with the invasiveness of tumor cells.
