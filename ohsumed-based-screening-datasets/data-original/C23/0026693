Chemical and postural influence on scalene and diaphragmatic activation in humans.
 The electromyographic activity of the diaphragm (EMGdi) and scalene muscle (EMGsc) was studied in the supine and upright positions, respectively, during hyperoxic progressive hypercapnic rebreathing (HCVR) in five healthy males.
 End-expiratory esophageal pressure (EEPes) was quantified on a breath-to-breath basis as a reflection of altered end-expiratory lung volume.
 There was no significant difference in the slopes of EMGdi, expressed as a percentage of maximum at total lung capacity vs.
 minute volume of ventilation (VI), between the supine and upright positions [0.79 +/- 0.05 (SE) vs.
 0.92 +/- 0.17, respectively].
 In contrast, the slope of the regression line relating EMGsc to VI was steeper in the upright than in the supine position (0.69 +/- 0.05 vs.
 0.35 +/- 0.04, respectively; P less than 0.005).
 Positive EEPes at comparable VI at the ends of HCVRs were of greater magnitude upright than supine (3.27 +/- 0.68 vs.
 4.35 +/- 0.60 cmH2O, respectively, P less than 0.001).
 We conclude that altering posture has a greater effect on scalene and expiratory muscle activity than on diaphragmatic activity during hypercapnic stimulation.
