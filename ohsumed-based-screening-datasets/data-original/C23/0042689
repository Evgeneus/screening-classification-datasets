Role for tumor necrosis factor as mediator of lung injury following lower torso ischemia.
 Ischemia and reperfusion of the ischemic lower torso lead to a neutrophil- (PMN) dependent lung injury characterized by PMN sequestration and permeability edema.
 This mimics the injury seen after infusion of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF), a potent activator of PMN and endothelium.
 This study tests whether TNF is a mediator of the lung injury after lower torso ischemia.
 Anesthetized rats underwent 4 h of bilateral hindlimb tourniquet ischemia, followed by reperfusion for 10 min, 30 min, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h (n = 6 for each time point).
 Quantitative lung histology indicated progressive sequestration of PMN in the lungs, 25 +/- 3 (SE) PMN/10 high-power fields (HPF) 10 min after reperfusion vs.
 20 +/- 2 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (NS), increasing to 53 +/- 5 PMN/10 HPF after 4 h vs.
 23 +/- 3 PMN/10 HPF in sham animals (P less than 0.01).
 There was lung permeability, shown by increasing protein accumulation in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, which 4 h after reperfusion was 599 +/- 91 vs.
 214 +/- 35 micrograms/ml in sham animals (P less than 0.01).
 Similarly, there was edema, shown by the lung wet-to-dry weight ratio, which increased by 4 h to 4.70 +/- 0.12 vs.
 4.02 +/- 0.17 in sham animals (P less than 0.01).
 There was generation of leukotriene B4 in BAL fluid (720 +/- 140 vs.
 240 +/- 40 pg/ml, P less than 0.01), and in three of six rats tested at this time TNF was detected in plasma, with a mean value of 167 pg/ml.
 TNF was not detectable in any sham animal.
