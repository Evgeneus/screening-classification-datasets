Epidural haematoma requiring surgical decompression following repeated cervical epidural steroid injections for chronic pain.
 We report a case of epidural haematoma following a steroid injection into the cervical epidural space.
 The complication occurred on the seventh such injection over a 2 year period for chronic spinal pain.
 Surgical decompression over the seventh cervical and the upper 3 thoracic vertebrae was required to alleviate the symptoms of paralysis and anaesthesia.
 The patient subsequently required skin grafting to the surgical site and two trans-urethral resections of the prostate gland during his 6 week hospital admission.
 He made a full recovery.
