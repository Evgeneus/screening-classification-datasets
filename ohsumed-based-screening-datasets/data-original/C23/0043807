Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients with ruptured intracranial aneurysms.
 Cerebral vasospasm in elderly patients who were operated on the acute stage after subarachnoid hemorrhage was studied under strict criteria.
 The 138 patients were classified into three age groups: 59 years or younger (group A: 73 cases), 60 to 69 years (group B: 37 cases), and 70 years or older (group C: 28 cases).
 Severity of both the subarachnoid hemorrhages on computed tomography scan and the angiographic vasospasms was graded.
 The angiographic vasospasms were analyzed at the internal carotid artery, M1 segments of the middle cerebral artery, and A2 segments of the anterior cerebral.
 In all the relationships among the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades, the Hounsfield numbers, and the operative approaches to the angiographic vasospasm grade, there was a tendency for the angiographic vasospasm grades to be lower with increasing age in both the internal carotid artery and the M1 segment of the middle cerebral artery.
 This tendency was more apparent in the larger vessels, that is, the internal carotid arteries.
 Close correlations of the angiographic vasospasm grades to the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and to low-density area on computed tomography scan were found in both the M1 and A2 territories in the three groups.
 However, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the incidences of symptomatic vasospasm and low-density area on computed tomography scan.
 Regarding the surgical outcome, the older the patients, the higher were the mortality rates: 8% in group A, 11% in group B, and 25% in group C.
