Pontine myelinolysis after correction of hyponatremia during burn resuscitation.
 Central pontine myelinolysis is a neurologic disease produced by the rapid correction of hyponatremia.
 This report describes the occurrence of central pontine myelinolysis in a patient with burns.
 The natural history of this paralyzing condition and suggestions for its prevention are discussed.
 Severely burned and hyponatremic patients are at risk for this disorder because a large amount of sodium ion is typically required for the treatment of burn shock.
 Awareness of this phenomenon and avoidance of rapid correction of hyponatremia are essential to its prevention.
