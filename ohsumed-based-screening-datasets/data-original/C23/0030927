Scrub and murine typhus in children with obscure fever in the tropics.
 Between October, 1985, and February, 1987, 28 (8.7%) cases of scrub and murine typhus were diagnosed among 320 children with greater than or equal to 1 week history of obscure fever.
 Scrub typhus is a rural disease and characterized by fever, tachypnea and hepatosplenomegaly.
 Skin rash was rare and eschar was absent.
 Four patients had pneumonia and two had meningitis.
 Murine typhus, more an urban disease, was milder and half the patients presented exclusively because of night fever.
 Slightly enlarged liver and skin rash were the only significant physical signs.
 Lacking the classical textbook presentations, both rickettsioses often were missed or diagnosed as enteric fever.
 Recognition is important because patients with either disease respond well to treatment with chloramphenicol or doxycycline.
