Diagnostic imaging of musculoskeletal infection. Roentgenography; gallium, indium-labeled white blood cell, gammaglobulin, bone scintigraphy; and MRI.
 A great deal of effort has been made to evaluate and define the role of various diagnostic imaging techniques in various clinical settings that complicate the diagnosis of osteomyelitis.
 Except possibly in neonates, bone scintigraphy remains generally recommended when there has been no previous osseous involvement.
 In other cases of chronic disease, previous fracture or trauma, prosthesis, and diabetic foot, In-WBC scintigraphy is generally accepted as an appropriate imaging technique.
 MRI will play an increasingly important role in diagnosing osteomyelitis and may prove to be an important adjunct in these cases.
 Research continues to improve our current diagnostic armamentarium.
 In-IgG appears to avoid practical deficiencies encountered with 67Ga and In-WBC; it remains to be seen what role this agent will play in routine clinical practice.
 All agents to date image inflammation, not infection, and most require delayed imaging sessions, usually at 24 hours.
 These shortcomings necessitate further research to develop new radiotracers that can provide useful images within several hours and that are specific for infection, perhaps ultimately delineating the particular microorganism involved.
