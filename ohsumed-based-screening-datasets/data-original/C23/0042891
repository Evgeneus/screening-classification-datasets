Association of hypovolemia after subarachnoid hemorrhage with computed tomographic scan evidence of raised intracranial pressure.
 Hypovolemic patients are more likely to suffer delayed cerebral ischemia and infarction after a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).
 Prompt recognition and correction of hypovolemia may improve the outcome.
 We have identified computed tomographic (CT) scan findings that increase the probability of a patient presenting with hypovolemia soon after an SAH.
 The plasma volume (PV) of 25 patients admitted within 96 hours of an SAH was measured using radioiodinated serum albumin.
 The normal PVs were measured in an outpatient setting 6 months later or predicted from their total body water.
 Nine patients (36%) were found to be hypovolemic, defined as a fall in PV exceeding 10% of the normal PV (mean fall, 18 +/- 2%).
 Sixteen patients were normovolemic or hypervolemic (mean PV, +9 +/- 2%).
 The basal cisterns were compressed or obliterated on the CT scans of all hypovolemic patients compared with 12.5% of normovolemic patients (chi-square, 14.52; P less than 0.01).
 The probabilities of a patient being hypovolemic if the CT scan indicated raised intracranial pressure were high: hydrocephalus, P = 0.80; compression of the basal cisterns, P = 0.82; and compression of the basal cisterns associated with intracerebral hematoma or midline shift, P = 1.00.
 Patients with an SAH and radiological evidence of raised intracranial pressure should be considered at particular risk for systemic hypovolemia.
