Thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser treatment of bullous emphysema.
 A new technique of thoracoscopic laser ablation of pulmonary bullae suitable for patients with multiple bullae and diffuse emphysema was developed and assessed in 22 patients.
 20 of 22 patients survived.
 Pre-operative and postoperative functional evaluation is available for the 11 patients followed up for more than a month; at 1 to 3 months postoperatively there were increases in FVC (mean 2.0 litres pre-operatively to 2.7 litres postoperatively, p less than 0.001), in FEV1 (0.74 to 1.06 litres, p = 0.01), and in maximum exercise treadmill times (5.4 min to 8.0 min, p less than 0.01).
 Postoperative air leaks lasted a mean of 13 days and usually resolved spontaneously.
 Other complications were bleeding (1 patient) and unilateral acute lung injury (1 patient).
 These results suggest that selected patients with diffuse emphysema and pulmonary bullae may benefit from thoracoscopic carbon dioxide laser ablation.
