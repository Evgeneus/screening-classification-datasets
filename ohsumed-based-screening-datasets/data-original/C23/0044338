Epidemiology of acute rheumatic fever in a multiethnic, multiracial urban community: the Miami-Dade County experience.
 During the mid-1980s, several US communities experienced outbreaks of acute rheumatic fever (ARF), often involving predominantly white, middle-class individuals living in suburban or rural settings.
 The medical records of all patients diagnosed with ARF in Miami-Dade County, Florida, between 1984 and 1988 were reviewed.
 Thirty-five cases met the revised Jones criteria and were considered definite; four additional cases were classified as probable.
 Carditis was present in 54%.
 Of the 39 patients, 32 (82%) were black.
 The annual incidence of ARF among black children aged 5-14 years was 12.25 per 100,000 compared to 0.71 for other (non-Hispanic white plus Hispanic) children (P less than .001).
 ARF was centered in the inner city, where the incidence among black children reached 15.21.
 Despite the multiethnic, multiracial character of Miami-Dade County and the rapid influx of immigrants, ARF in this community remains primarily a disease of underprivileged, black inner-city children.
