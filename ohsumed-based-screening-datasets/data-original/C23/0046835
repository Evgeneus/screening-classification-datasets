Progress in cancer.
 Definite progress has been made against cancer since the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971.
 Physicians are giving increased attention to cancer prevention.
 The exciting changes in molecular biology provide increased knowledge about basic mechanisms in tumor growth and metastases.
 Detailed discussions of two common solid cancers--breast and colorectal--attest to continuing advances in cancer diagnosis and treatment.
 All of these augur well for further progress in oncology.
 Continued research, basic and clinical, is mandatory.
