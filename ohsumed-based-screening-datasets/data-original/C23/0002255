Neurologic complications of cardiac transplantation.
 Between 1984 and 1989, orthotopic cardiac transplantations were done in 90 patients from 10 to 65 years of age for end-stage, refractory congestive cardiomyopathy.
 Two patients had had ischemic strokes 5 months and 18 years, respectively, before transplantation.
 Six patients (7%) suffered acute neurologic events perioperatively.
 Three patients suffered cerebral infarctions.
 In 1 case this occurred 10 days before transplantation--probably as a result of systemic hypoperfusion--with the placement of ventricular assist devices.
 Two others suffered infarctions 5 and 21 days, respectively, after transplantation, each of probable embolic origin.
 Two patients had an acute intracerebral hemorrhage 21 and 36 days, respectively, after transplantation; both were located within the basal ganglia and subcortical regions.
 Both patients had moderate to severe hypertension, and in 1, renal failure and a coagulopathy developed before hemorrhage.
 Tremor, seizures, and an altered level of consciousness developed in 1 patient as an apparent toxic reaction to cyclosporine treatment.
 Only 1 patient died as a result of the neurologic complication--of an acute intracerebral hemorrhage.
 Three patients recovered fully, 2 partially.
 Only the case of drug toxicity could be directly attributed to the transplantation procedure itself.
 We conclude that the risk of an acute neurologic insult with orthotopic cardiac transplantation is low but may result from drug toxicity, cerebral ischemia, or hemorrhagic mechanisms.
