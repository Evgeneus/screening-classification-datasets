Increased tryptase levels in suction-blister fluid from patients with urticaria.
 The levels of tryptase in the suction-blister fluid from patients with chronic urticaria, urticaria pigmentosa, cholinergic urticaria, urticarial dermographism, prurigo of unknown origin, eczema, psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and from healthy controls were studied.
 The blister fluid from controls contained up to 15 micrograms/l of tryptase, whereas that from patients with active urticaria contained greater than 50 micrograms/l.
 This study demonstrates that patients with urticaria have mast cells that readily release tryptase in both the lesional and non-lesional areas of skin.
