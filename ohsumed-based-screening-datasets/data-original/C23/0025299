The importance of adequate anticoagulation to prevent early thrombosis after stenting of stenosed venous bypass grafts.
 Stent implantation in native coronary arteries may be complicated by acute thrombosis, despite the use of stringent anticoagulation.
 Thrombotic occlusion of stented venous grafts may occur less frequently, possibly because of the larger caliber of these grafts.
 We report our experience with 46 stents (Wallstent, Medinvent, Lausanne, Switzerland) implanted in 35 lesions of 24 consecutive patients (mean age 64 years, range 43 to 75).
 Two overlapping stents were implanted in seven patients, and three overlapping stents were positioned in two.
 After implantation, activated partial thromboplastin time was maintained at two to three times the control level by intravenous administration of heparin (160 to 550 mg daily) until thrombotest values were reduced 5% to 10% by acenocoumarol.
 Impending thrombotic occlusion was recognized in two suboptimally anticoagulated patients: patient A after implantation of four stents and patient B after anticoagulation therapy was discontinued because of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
 Coronary artery bypass grafting was performed successfully in both patients.
 A third patient had a myocardial infarction on day 7 after stent implantation, in spite of adequate anticoagulation and optimal medical drug therapy.
 It is concluded that stringent anticoagulation therapy appears mandatory to maintain graft patency after stent implantation.
