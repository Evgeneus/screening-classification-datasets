Spinal cord herniation associated with an intradural spinal arachnoid cyst diagnosed by magnetic resonance imaging.
 Two rare cases of spinal cord herniation associated with intradural spinal arachnoid cyst are reported.
 A preoperative magnetic resonance imaging scan demonstrated the presence of spinal cord herniation, identified as a protrusion continuous with the spinal cord.
 Surgery upon the intradural spinal arachnoid cyst improved progressive neurological dysfunction.
 The authors postulate that spinal cord herniation occurred for the following reason: The pressure of the intradural arachnoid cyst on the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord caused thinning of the dura, leading to a tear and, thus, the development of an extradural arachnoid cyst.
 Along with the enlargement of intradural arachnoid cyst, the spinal cord herniated through the tear in the dura into the extradural arachnoid cyst.
