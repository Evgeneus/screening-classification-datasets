Microvascular permeability increases early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury.
 To test the hypothesis that microvascular injury is involved in the pathophysiology of acid-induced esophagitis, the effect of acid perfusion on intraluminal plasma protein loss was studied in relation to histological changes.
 Four groups of opossums (n = 6 in each) were perfused with either normal saline control) or 10, 20, or 100 mmol/L isoosmolar hydrochloric acid at 2 mL/min for 90 minutes using a midesophageal catheter.
 The distal esophagus was cannulated via a gastrostomy, and the effluent was collected and measured for intraluminal loss of IV injected 125I-bovine serum albumin.
 Plasma protein loss in the control group was constant with a total loss of 3.40 +/- 0.69 mg/g dry wt.
 Perfusion of 10, 20, and 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid increased total protein loss to 8.06 +/- 2.62, 13.94 +/- 2.72, and 27.34 +/- 4.34 mg/g dry wt, respectively.
 The protein loss was not associated with intraluminal blood loss, as measured by previously injected 51Cr-labeled autologous red blood cells.
 Histological changes, scored by a blinded observer, were significant only between control animals and those perfused with 100 mmol/L hydrochloric acid.
 Separate studies using the vascular tracer monastral blue B demonstrated an increase in labeling of lamina propria blood vessels that varied directly with the concentration of acid perfusate, thereby providing direct morphological evidence of microvascular injury.
 These studies suggest that increased microvascular permeability occurs early in the course of acid-induced esophageal injury.
