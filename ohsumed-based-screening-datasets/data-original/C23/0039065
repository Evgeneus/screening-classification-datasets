Respiratory compliance during sedation, anesthesia, and paralysis in infants and young children.
 Although total respiratory compliance (Crs) has been shown to fall in adults on induction of halothane anesthesia, no successful paired studies have been reported in children.
 The multiple occlusion technique was used to measure Crs in 17 infants and young children during sedated sleep (CrsS) and shortly after, following induction of halothane anesthesia (CrsA).
 Crs fell in all but one infant after induction of anesthesia, with a mean fall of 34.7% (range 0-58%).
 This was accompanied by a reduction in tidal volume and increase in frequency in every case.
 In 7 of the 17 children, who were to be paralyzed for surgical purposes, Crs was also measured in this anesthetized-paralyzed state.
 When tidal volume administered during manual ventilation was similar to that observed during measurement of CrsA, Crs during this low-volume ventilation was similar to CrsA.
 When tidal volume was increased and Crs remeasured, there was a significant increase in every case, with the high-volume Crs within 10% of CrsS in all but one child, in whom there was a 31.4% increase with respect to CrsS.
 Changes in tidal volume accounted for approximately 50% of the variability in each state.
 These results demonstrate a highly significant fall in Crs in infants and young children after induction of halothane anesthesia.
 In addition it appears that this reduction in Crs can be reversed by paralyzing the child and manually ventilating with tidal volumes approximating those seen during sedation.
