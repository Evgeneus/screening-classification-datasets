Maternal plasma level of endothelin is increased in preeclampsia.
 Endothelin is a potent vasoconstrictor that is reportedly increased in conditions characterized by endothelial damage.
 Maternal plasma endothelin levels were compared between 27 women with preeclampsia (23 without and 4 with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome) and 14 women with normotensive pregnancies.
 The mean +/- SEM plasma endothelin values were significantly higher in patients with preeclampsia uncomplicated by the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome (5.48 +/- 0.30 fmol/ml vs 3.86 +/- 0.28, p less than 0.001).
 In addition, the preeclamptic group with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome had significantly higher endothelin levels than those without the syndrome (8.30 +/- 1.62 fmol/ml vs 5.48 +/- 0.30, p less than 0.05).
 There was no correlation between plasma endothelin values and either systolic or diastolic blood pressure.
 We conclude that plasma endothelin levels are significantly increased in women with preeclampsia and particularly in those with the hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count syndrome, suggesting an association with widespread endothelial damage.
