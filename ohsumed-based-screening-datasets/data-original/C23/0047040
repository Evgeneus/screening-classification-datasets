Incidence of heterotopic ossification after total hip replacement: effect of the type of fixation of the femoral component.
 The incidence and severity of heterotopic ossification after sixty-five consecutive primary uncemented total hip replacements were compared with those after seventy consecutive primary hybrid total hip replacements (consisting of an uncemented acetabular component and a cemented femoral component).
 All patients had had the arthroplasty because of osteoarthrosis.
 The sex distribution, prevalence of bilateral disease of the hip, and frequency of previous operations were similar in both groups.
 All of the operations were performed by one surgeon who used the same operative approach.
 Preoperative, immediate postoperative, and six-month follow-up radiographs were reviewed for all patients.
 For 90 per cent of the hips, radiographs that were made after a minimum follow-up of one year were also reviewed.
 In the group of patients who had an uncemented femoral component, there was a statistically significant increase in the frequency of heterotopic bone and in its severity.
 Either none or only class-I ectopic bone developed in 74 per cent of the hips in the hybrid group, compared with 40 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005).
 In contrast, class-III or IV heterotopic ossification was evident in 13 per cent of the hips in the uncemented group (p less than 0.005).
 None of the patients in the hybrid group needed reoperation for excision of ectopic bone, but four (6 per cent) of the patients in the uncemented group needed such a reoperation because of severe limitation of motion.
