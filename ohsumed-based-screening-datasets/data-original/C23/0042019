Staving off acute otitis media. When is prophylaxis with antibiotics desirable?
 Acute otitis media affects most young children and is the condition for which children are most frequently treated with antibiotics.
 A pattern of recurrent acute ear infections develops in some children and is a source of frustration for parents and physicians.
 Recurrent episodes can exacerbate asthma or other underlying medical problems, and long-term effects can include chronic otitis media with permanent middle-ear injury and, possibly, delay in psychomotor and language development.
 Antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the number of episodes of acute otitis media in children at high risk for recurrent infection.
 There is no perfect antibiotic to prevent acute otitis media.
 However, the risks associated with the drugs described in this article are low.
 Prophylaxis with antibiotics does not prevent all episodes of acute otitis media but can reduce the number of episodes by 50%.
