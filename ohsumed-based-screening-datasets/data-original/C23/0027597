Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis 
 Endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery of the sympathetic chain has been the preferred treatment for palmar or axillary hyperhidrosis in this unit since 1980.
 A retrospective study was carried out of the first 112 patients with case material derived from a postal questionnaire, chart review and outpatient assessment.
 Eighty-five patients undergoing bilateral transthoracic electrocautery who replied to the questionnaire (76 per cent response rate) form the basis of this study.
 There were 65 females and 20 males with a mean age of 24.3 years (range 15-40 years).
 The hands alone were affected in 20 patients (24 per cent), the axillae alone in 17 (20 per cent) and both areas in 48 (56 per cent).
 Mean hospital stay was 3.1 days (range 1-7 days).
 Outcome was assessed by 92 per cent of patients immediately after operation as 'very much improved' or 'moderately improved', and this assessment persisted in 85 per cent after a mean follow-up of 43 months (range 3-95 months).
 Cosmetic results were rated as satisfactory by 95 per cent.
 Apart from pain after operation, morbidity was limited to transient Horner's syndrome in three patients, surgical emphysema in three, and pneumothorax requiring a chest drain in one.
 A repeat procedure was needed in one patient because of an inadequate first operation.
 Some compensatory hyperhidrosis occurred in 54 (64 per cent) patients.
 As a minimally invasive procedure, endoscopic transthoracic electrocautery should be considered the treatment of choice for palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis.
