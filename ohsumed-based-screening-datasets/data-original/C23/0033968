Problems and coping strategies of individuals with traumatic brain injury and their spouses.
 A pilot investigation is reported on the problems and coping strategies of 20 married men and 11 married women with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and their able-bodied spouses.
 All injured subjects experienced severe head injury at least one and a half years earlier.
 A structured, small-group discussion process was used to elicit a prioritized list of problems and a similar list of coping strategies.
 Individuals with TBI and their spouses identified problems in living as most important; loss of employment and restrictions on autonomy were reported as the most problematic.
 Men with TBI placed priority on controlling their anger, whereas, women with TBI were concerned with their mood disorders, particularly depression.
 Women with TBI and able-bodied wives of men with TBI placed high priority on the use of support groups as a coping strategy.
 Men placed higher priority on individualistic approaches to adjustment, such as suppression of feelings.
 A number of testable hypotheses resulted from the pilot study.
