Fine surface structure of an intraspinal neurenteric cyst: a scanning and transmission electron microscopy study.
 The case of an 11-year-old boy with an intraspinal neurenteric cyst, which recurred 8 years and 3 months after surgery, is presented.
 Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of the cyst epithelium revealed marked resemblance to that of the respiratory tract, despite the presence of numerous goblet cells mimicking intestine on light microscopy study.
 Detailed ultrastructural findings are described.
