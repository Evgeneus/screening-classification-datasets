Bouveret's syndrome: an unusual twist on the classic cause.
 Bouveret's syndrome is a duodenal obstruction caused by a gallstone, manifested mostly as a gastric outlet obstruction.
 We have reported an instance of Bouveret's syndrome caused by two separate stones, either of which could independently have caused the obstruction.
 It is imperative to be sure that the obstruction is relieved before terminating the operative procedure.
