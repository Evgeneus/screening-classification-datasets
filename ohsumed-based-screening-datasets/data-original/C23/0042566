The management of IIB osteosarcoma. Experience from 1976 to 1985.
 From 1976 to 1985, 75 IIB osteosarcomas have been treated out of a total of 98 osteosarcomas at the authors' institution.
 Because of the effective chemotherapy including high-dose methotrexate administered during this time period, the surgical management changed, and only ten patients out of the 75 IIB osteosarcomas required an amputation.
 The overall result of 76.7% of disease-free, three-year survival was equally distributed regardless of the surgical procedure.
 Endoprosthesis, resection with or without grafts, and rotationplasties, as well as amputations, revealed similar results.
 No negative influence from the limb-sparing surgery could be observed.
