Spinal cord stimulation: a contemporary series 
 Forty-three patients with chronic pain disorders of different causes were selected for spinal cord stimulation.
 All underwent implantation of a ribbon electrode through a small laminotomy, under general anesthesia.
 Thirteen patients (30%) failed to obtain significant pain relief during a period of trial stimulation, and their electrodes were removed.
 The remainder underwent a definitive implant and were followed for a mean of 13 months (range, 3-33 months).
 Nineteen of them (63%) continued to experience pain relief.
 A detailed analysis of this series, as well as a literature review, is presented.
