Thirty-six month follow-up of a contemporary phakic intraocular lens for the surgical correction of myopia.
 Twenty-three eyes underwent implantation of a glass anterior chamber phakic myopic intraocular lens by one of the surgeon co-authors.
 The follow-up was 18 to 36 months.
 All refractions were unchanged and stable within six weeks after surgery.
 Best-corrected visual acuity was achieved in all cases; in 56% of operated eyes, a one-to-three line visual improvement was noted over the preoperative status.
 No operative complications were encountered; no postoperative complications were noted in either the immediate or delayed phase.
 No intraocular lenses were removed.
 There was a 5.3% loss in endothelial cell count which was unchanged throughout the study.
 The contemporary phakic myopic intraocular lens offers a seminal approach to the surgical treatment of myopia.
