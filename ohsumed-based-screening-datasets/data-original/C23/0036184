A randomized comparative study of laser photocoagulation, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of actively bleeding ulcers.
 A randomized study was performed to compare the efficacy of Nd:YAG laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the treatment of active bleeding from peptic ulcers.
 Nine hundred and forty-eight consecutive patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding underwent endoscopy and 91 patients with active bleeding from peptic ulcer were randomized to receive laser (N = 30), heater probe (N = 31), and bipolar electrocoagulation (N = 30).
 The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base was assessed at endoscopy.
 The three treatment groups were comparable in their clinical and endoscopic characteristics.
 There was no significant difference among patients treated with laser, heater probe, and bipolar electrocoagulation in the rate of re-bleeding (10%, 19.4%, and 10%), duration of hospital stay (4, 4, and 5 days), and proportion requiring emergency surgery (7%, 13%, and 7%), but the cost per patient was higher with laser than heater probe and bipolar electrocoagulation.
 The angulation of the probe to the ulcer base did not affect the re-bleeding rate.
 No complication was reported.
 We conclude that the three modalities were equally effective and safe in endoscopic hemostasis but because bipolar electrocoagulation and heater probe were cheaper, they were recommended for use.
