The management of atypical non-cardiac chest pain.
 Atypical, non-cardiac chest pain is common and disabling, and often persists despite negative medical investigations.
 Aetiology is disputed and management is difficult.
 A multi-causal model in which both psychological and physical factors play a part is helpful; a fundamental factor is continued misinterpretation of minor physical symptoms as evidence of heart disease.
 We report supportive evidence and describe a psychological treatment derived from the model.
 In a randomized trial, cognitive behavioural methods were effective in reducing chest pain, disability and use of medication, in patients both with and without psychiatric disorder.
 The clinical implications are discussed.
