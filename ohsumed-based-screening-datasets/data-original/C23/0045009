The benefit of the Hemonetics cell saver apparatus during cardiac surgery.
 This retrospective chart review of 155 patients having coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) over a two-month period determined whether the use of a cell saver apparatus (CSA) (1) reduced or increased the requirements for homologous blood; (2) increased the incidence of post-surgical bleeding; (3) was cost-effective.
 Two groups of patients were identified.
 Group 1 (n = 99) received both CSA processed red blood cells and homologous blood components.
 Requirement for homologous blood products was reduced in the first 24 hr after surgery (0.5 +/- 1.0 vs 1.3 +/- 1.8 units; P less than 0.05) when compared with Group 2 (n = 56) in whom only homologous blood products were utilized.
 More patients in Group 1 had no transfusion requirements (45 vs 8; P less than 0.05) and there was no increased risk of major haemorrhage.
 When the capital costs are included, utilization of the CSA was not cost-effective.
 We conclude that utilisation of a CSA was safe, with no increased risk of bleeding, reduced requirements for homologous blood transfusions, but added to the cost of the procedure.
