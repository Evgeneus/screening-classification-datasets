Whither short-course chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis?
 Short-course chemotherapy is well established for the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis but not for extrapulmonary disease.
 We present a series of 35 cases in which chemotherapy for tuberculous meningitis was given for a period of less than 2 years.
 Short-term therapy was associated with recrudescence of tuberculous meningitis and, in some cases, with the development of deep cerebral infarcts and permanent neurological deficits.
 We think short-term chemotherapy for tuberculosis of the central nervous system is inadequate.
