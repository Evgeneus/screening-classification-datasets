Intradural chordoma of the tentorium cerebelli. Case report.
 A rare case of intradural chordoma is described.
 The literature contains seven examples of intradural extraosseous chordoma, all reported in a ventral location.
 This is the first reported case of a primary intradural chordoma distant from the clivus and involving both the supra- and infratentorial compartments.
