Radiology of continent urinary diversion.
 The continent urinary diversions described in this article represent only a small number of the techniques that have been reported in the urologic literature.
 An attempt has been made to discuss diversions that are currently in common use or have been recently described and hold potential for becoming more widely accepted.
 The radiologist with a basic understanding of continent urinary diversions plays an important role in evaluating patients who have had these procedures.
 Complications can be detected and evaluated and occasionally treated with interventional techniques.
 As continent urinary diversions become more frequently performed, it is important that radiologists become aware of their construction techniques, radiographic appearance, function, and potential complications.
