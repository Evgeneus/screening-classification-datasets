The time course and magnitude of spontaneous recovery of parkinsonism produced by intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine to monkeys.
 We studied rhesus monkeys with hemiparkinsonism or bilateral parkinsonism produced by unilateral or bilateral intracarotid administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine.
 Using a standardized clinical rating scale, 4 hemiparkinsonian monkeys showed a 13 to 56% (mean, 36%) spontaneous improvement during an observation period of up to 25 weeks.
 Generally, recovery leveled off after 14 weeks.
 Four bilaterally parkinsonian monkeys showed a 5 to 42% (mean, 22%) improvement over a period of up to 30 weeks.
 Our findings emphasize that spontaneous recovery is a potentially confounding characteristic of this monkey model when used for assessing novel antiparkinsonian therapies.
