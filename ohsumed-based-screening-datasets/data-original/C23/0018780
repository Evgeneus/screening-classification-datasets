Scalp necrosis in a neonate treated with cultured autologous keratinocytes.
 A neonate compromised by a stressful labor, low birth weight, anemia, seizures, and enterocolitis developed necrosis of a caput succedaneum of the calvaria.
 Coverage with cultured autologous keratinocytes was successful and represents a treatment modality with minimal morbidity compared with conventional split-thickness skin grafts.
