Human immunodeficiency virus exanthem.
 The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) exanthem can be the primary manifestation of HIV infection.
 We report three cases of an exanthematous skin eruption associated with acute HIV infection.
 HIV antigen (p24 core antigen) was present, whereas results of the HIV antibody test were negative.
