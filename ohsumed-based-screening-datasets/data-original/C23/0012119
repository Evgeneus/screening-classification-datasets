Electrical pacing for dynamic treatment of unilateral vocal cord paralysis. Experiment in long-denervated muscle.
 In order to explore the possibility of clinical application of laryngeal pacing as a treatment for unilateral vocal cord paralysis, we examined the reactivity of atrophic muscle to electrical stimulation in dogs whose recurrent laryngeal nerves were damaged by crushing, dissection followed by resuturing, or a 3-cm neurectomy.
 The threshold level to induce enough vocal cord adduction reached the maximum at 2 weeks after nerve injury, decreased with time, and never surpassed 7 V in each case.
 On the basis of results of these preliminary probings, laryngeal pacing was conducted on a dog 15 months after resection of the laryngeal nerve.
 Adduction of the paralyzed vocal cord for synchrony with the intact cord was achieved by 7 V of electrical stimulation of the thyroarytenoid muscle that was triggered by signals from the cricothyroid muscle.
