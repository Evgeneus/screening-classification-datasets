Acute short-term memory loss from trimethyltin exposure.
 We report a case of organic tin exposure in a graduate chemistry student.
 The inhalational and transcutaneous exposure occurred following a laboratory explosion.
 The patient initially presented with first and second degree burns of the face and chest, and developed an acute loss of short-term memory 72 hours after exposure.
 The memory loss gradually improved over the course of several months.
