Reading problems in adult chronic headache sufferers.
 In a questionnaire survey we determined the prevalence of problems with reading, at present as well as in the past, in adult chronic headache sufferers as compared with age- and sex-matched controls.
 The reading problems inquired about were those with reading in general, reading quickly, prolonged reading and reading comprehension.
 The subjects were also asked about present and past problems with writing, concentrating, performing mathematics and overall learning.
 Significant differences in the prevalences of the problems studied between the headache sufferers and controls were observed on just two items and only for the female groups.
 These items were present problems with reading comprehension (39.3% versus 7.5%; p = 0.002) and concentrating (46.4% versus 17.5%; p = 0.015).
 We concluded that adult female headache sufferers have impaired reading comprehension and concentration abilities which do not seem to originate from the past.
