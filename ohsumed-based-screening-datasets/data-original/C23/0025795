Abdominal aortic aneurysm in chronic thoracic dissection. Report of two cases.
 Two cases of lower abdominal aortic aneurysm in association with chronic thoracic dissections are reported.
 These infra-renal aortic aneurysms, superimposed on an abdominal extension of the dissection, always require surgical treatment because of their well known tendency to enlarge and rupture.
 The authors report their experience and discuss the management of this complication in chronic dissections treated surgically.
