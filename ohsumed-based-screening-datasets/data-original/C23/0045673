Tissue plasminogen activator as an alternative to vena cava interruption in recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism.
 We have described a woman with pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) who had acute dyspnea, chest pain, and hypotension during adequate heparin therapy.
 Pulmonary angiography was consistent with recurrent PTE.
 The patient was given intravenous TPA and showed significant improvement.
 Repeat angiography showed resolution of the thrombus in the right main pulmonary artery.
 The patient did not require vena cava interruption.
