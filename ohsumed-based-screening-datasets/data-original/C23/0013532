Elevated expression of the genes for transforming growth factor-beta 1 and type VI collagen in diffuse fasciitis associated with the eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome.
 Full-thickness skin biopsies obtained from four patients with rapidly progressive diffuse fasciitis associated with the Eosinophilia-Myalgia syndrome (EMS) were examined for the expression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), type VI collagen, and fibronectin genes employing immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridizations.
 The immunohistochemical studies demonstrated increased deposition of TGF-beta, type VI collagen, and fibronectin epitopes in the extracellular matrix of the fascia in comparison to the adjacent dermis in the same specimens.
 Increased levels of type VI collagen mRNA, as evidenced by positive in situ hybridization signals with an alpha 2(VI) collagen cDNA, were also found in the fascia in comparison with the dermis.
 In situ hybridizations of affected fascia with a human sequence-specific TGF-beta 1 cDNA demonstrated numerous fibroblasts displaying positive hybridization signals indicative of high levels of transcripts for this cytokine.
 In contrast, no hybridization signal for TGF-beta 1 was detected in fibroblasts in the adjacent dermis.
 These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1 may play an important role in the development of the connective tissue alterations present in EMS-associated diffuse fasciitis.
