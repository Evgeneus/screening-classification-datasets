Effect of enteral nutrition on exocrine pancreatic function.
 Twelve patients with chronic pancreatitis underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy in which the pylorus was preserved.
 The effects of parenteral and enteral nutrition on pancreatic secretion were compared.
 Postoperative nutrition was administered by needle-catheter jejunostomy in seven patients and by total parenteral nutrition in five patients.
 Pancreatic juice, drained directly from the pancreatic duct, was collected in 4-hour fractions.
 Volume, bicarbonate, protein, amylase, and chymotrypsin were measured.
 In the first two postoperative days, there was a slow increase in all measured indices.
 On the third postoperative day, an abrupt rise occurred, after which pancreatic secretion stabilized.
 No differences in exocrine pancreatic secretion were observed between the enteral and parenteral methods of feeding.
