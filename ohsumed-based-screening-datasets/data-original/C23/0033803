Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of aortocoronary venous bypass grafts and effect of the caliber of the grafted coronary artery on graft stenosis.
 The influence of morphologic parameters on the recurrence of stenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of 49 stenoses in aortocoronary venous bypass grafts of 41 patients was investigated.
 Vessel dimensions were measured quantitatively.
 Angioplasty was successful in 46 stenoses (94%) of 38 patients (93%).
 In 35 patients (92% of successfully treated patients) with 42 stenoses, control angiography was performed after a mean interval of 189 +/- 186 days.
 In 9 patients (26%), 9 stenoses (21%) had recurred.
 The diameter of the grafted coronary artery distal to the anastomosis was significantly smaller in grafted arteries with than without recurrent stenoses (1.92 +/- 0.52 vs 2.45 +/- 0.50 mm; p less than 0.01).
 Recurrence also correlated with the ratio between graft diameter and coronary artery diameter greater than 1.35 (p less than 0.02) and with the stenosis length greater than 10 mm before angioplasty (p less than 0.01).
 Graft age, graft diameter and stenosis location in the graft had no significant influence on recurrence.
 Thus, the diameter of the grafted coronary artery and the length of the critical stenosis are parameters for recurrence after angioplasty of graft stenoses and should be considered in the selection of patients for this intervention.
