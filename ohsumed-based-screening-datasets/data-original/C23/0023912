Cortical blindness after coronary angiography: a rare but reversible complication.
 Transient cortical blindness is a recognized complication after vertebral and cerebral angiography but is a rare event after cardiac angiography.
 The development of cortical blindness appears to be an adverse reaction to the contrast agent which results in an osmotic disruption of the blood-brain barrier which appears to be selective for the occipital cortex.
 Patient outcome appears to be generally favorable with return of vision within 24-48 hr.
 This study describes three patients who had transient cortical blindness after cardiac catheterization and reviews what is known about this unusual problem.
