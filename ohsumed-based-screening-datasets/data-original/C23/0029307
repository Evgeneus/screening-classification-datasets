Intracerebral hemorrhage after lumbar myelography with iohexol: report of a case and review of the literature.
 Intracranial hemorrhage is an uncommon complication of dural puncture.
 In most instances, hematomas are subdural; they may be unilateral or bilateral.
 Rarely are intraparenchymal cerebral hemorrhages related to dural puncture.
 This report describes a delayed occurrence of bilateral intraparenchymal hemorrhages in a 38-year-old woman 7 days after lumbar myelography with iohexol.
 A review of the literature is presented.
