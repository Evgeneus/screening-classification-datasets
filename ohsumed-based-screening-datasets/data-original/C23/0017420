Ectopic thyroid tissue in the submandibular region.
 This report describes an unusual location of ectopic thyroid gland tissue.
 A growth in the left submandibular area was surgically excised, and the microscopic examination of the specimen revealed thyroid tissue with colloid goiter.
 Because this entity cannot be clinically distinguished from a salivary gland tumor, ectopic thyroid tissue should be considered in the differential diagnosis of swellings involving the submandibular area.
