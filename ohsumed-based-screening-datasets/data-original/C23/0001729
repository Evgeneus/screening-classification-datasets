Use of magnetic resonance imaging in the diagnosis of cortical blindness in pregnancy.
 Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be helpful in the assessment of eclampsia and preeclampsia with central nervous system symptomatology such as cortical blindness.
 We describe a rare case of complete binocular blindness postpartum with no other neurologic deficits, in which MRI abnormalities were undetected on computed tomography.
 The better soft-tissue discrimination of MRI may visualize important but subtle lesions which ultimately may help to explain the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism in such cases.
