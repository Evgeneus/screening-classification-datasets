Force-velocity and 30-s Wingate tests in boys at high and low altitudes.
 The effects of high altitude (HA, 3,700 m) on performance during a force-velocity test (maximal anaerobic power, MAnP) and a 30-s Wingate test (mean power, P) were studied in boys 7-15 yr of age.
 Forty-seven children acclimatized to HA were compared with 101 living at low altitude (LA, 330 m).
 They had the same good nutritional status and the same level of physical activities [average 5.4 +/- 1.1 (SD) and 5.2 +/- 1.9 h/wk at HA and LA, respectively].
 They performed the two tests using the same calibrated cycle ergometer.
 For the Wingate test, O2 uptake (VO2) during the 30 s and the peak of blood lactate concentration ([L]p) during the recovery were also measured.
 No difference in MAnP was observed between HA and LA.
 P, [L]p, and VO2 were lower at HA.
 This suggests that the altitude of 3,700 m did not affect the performance of the force-velocity test but reduced that of the Wingate test.
 This decrease in P was linked to a lower participation of glycolysis and aerobic metabolism.
 The latter is related to a reduced aerobic performance at HA.
 In addition, the slopes of the relationships between age and MAnP, P, and [L]p were the same at HA and LA, indicating that chronic hypoxia did not alter the development of the anaerobic metabolism during puberty.
