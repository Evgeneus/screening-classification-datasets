Use of purified streptokinase in empyema and hemothorax.
 Enzymatic debridement of the pleural cavity for retained hemothorax or empyema is a frequently overlooked option.
 Thirteen of fourteen patients (93%) with retained pleural collections underwent successful enzymatic debridement and tube drainage with purified streptokinase injections.
 The average increase in chest tube output following streptokinase injections was 158%.
 No significant adverse reactions occurred.
 One patient required thoracotomy when streptokinase therapy failed.
 Two others had successful resolution of their pleural collections but required thoracotomy for other indications.
 There were two deaths (14%), which were unrelated to the use of streptokinase or residual empyema.
 Intrapleural streptokinase is a safe, effective means of removing retained proteinaceous collections in the pleural space.
 It is a useful adjunct to chest tube drainage and may obviate the need for more invasive procedures.
