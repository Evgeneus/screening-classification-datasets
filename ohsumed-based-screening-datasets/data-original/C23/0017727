Histology of the lens in the Weill-Marchesani syndrome.
 The Weill-Marchesani syndrome is a rare systemic connective tissue disease characterised by small stature, brachydactyly, ectopia lentis, and spherophakia.
 Three siblings with typical manifestations of this syndrome were reported.
 The ophthalmological findings in all these cases were spherophakia, severe myopia, a shallow anterior chamber, and narrow angle glaucoma.
 Two cases underwent laser iridotomy and drug treatment.
 In the third case the lens was removed from the eye because of injury, and this lens was examined by light and electron microscopy.
