Exploring the molecular basis for variability among patients with Becker muscular dystrophy: dystrophin gene and protein studies.
 Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) often results from in-frame mutations of the dystrophin gene that allow production of an altered but partially functional protein.
 To address potential structure-function relationships for the various domains of dystrophin, we examined both the dystrophin gene and protein in 68 patients with abnormal dystrophin.
 Eighty-six percent of BMD patients with dystrophin of altered size have deletions or duplications, and the observed sizes of dystrophin fit well with predictions based on DNA data.
 Deletions within the amino-terminal domain I tended to result in low levels of dystrophin and a more severe phenotype.
 The phenotypes of patients with deletions or duplications in the central rod domain were more variable.
 This region can be divided into three portions based on differences in clinical presentations of patients.
 Deletions around exons 4553 were most common and generally caused typical BMD; however, phenotypic variability among patients with similar mutations suggests that epigenetic and/or environmental factors play an important role in determining the clinical progression.
 In contrast, deletions or duplications in the proximal portion of this domain tended to cause severe cramps and myalgia.
 Finally, loss of the middle of this region probably causes a very mild phenotype, as only one such patient was found and his only symptom was elevated serum creatine phosphokinase levels.
