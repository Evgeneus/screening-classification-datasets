Pneumoparotid: a case report.
 Pneumoparotid is an unusual condition resulting from air being forced into the parotid ductal system.
 When it develops, it is a result of increased intraoral air pressure.
 Diagnosis is based on the etiologic factor, palpatory evidence of tissue emphysema, the escape of frothy saliva from the involved duct, and the sialographic finding of retained ductal air and ductal infection.
