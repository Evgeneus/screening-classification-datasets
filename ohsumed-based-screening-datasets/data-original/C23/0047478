An analysis of the retrolabyrinthine vs. the retrosigmoid vestibular nerve section.
 Vestibular neurectomy is gaining widespread acceptance as a primary means of controlling medically refractory vertigo.
 However, debate continues over the adequacy of vestibular neurectomy within the cerebellopontine angle, long-term control, and the most appropriate surgical approach.
 To address these issues, we retrospectively reviewed 118 patients who underwent vestibular neurectomy between October 1984 and January 1988.
 Forty-two patients who underwent a retrolabyrinthine approach and 44 patients who underwent a retrosigmoid approach completed a written questionnaire and provided a recent audiogram.
 According to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines, complete or substantial vertigo control was achieved and maintained in 95% of patients in both surgical groups.
 Hearing, tinnitus, and fullness results over the long term are variable.
 The advantages and disadvantages of the various vestibular neurectomy approaches will be detailed.
 On review of our results and surgical experience, we now prefer the retrosigmoid approach.
