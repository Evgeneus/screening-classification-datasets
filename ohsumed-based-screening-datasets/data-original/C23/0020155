Splenic artery aneurysm rupture [published erratum appears in Am J Emerg Med 1991 Mar;9(2):205]
 Splenic artery aneurysms are rare and usually asymptomatic.
 However, rupture can produce severe abdominal pain and prove lethal.
 Two cases of ruptured splenic artery aneurysm are presented.
 In one, cocaine injection occurred immediately prior to the onset of symptoms and may have precipitated the event.
