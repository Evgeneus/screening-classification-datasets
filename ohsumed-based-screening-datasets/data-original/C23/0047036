Total hip arthroplasty. The role of antiinflammatory medications in the prevention of heterotopic ossification.
 Postoperative prophylaxis with antiinflammatory medications, primarily indomethacin, is extremely effective in preventing the severest degrees of heterotopic ossification (HO) after a total hip arthroplasty (THA) and the recurrence of excised HO developed after a previous hip surgery.
 Prophylaxis with indomethacin should be given in 25-mg doses three times daily for at least three weeks, starting on the first postoperative morning.
 However, a shorter treatment period may be equally effective in preventing the severest degrees of HO, and a postoperative delay of five days before the initiation of prophylaxis does not seem to be followed by the development of severe HO.
 As evaluated one year after surgery, treatment with antiinflammatory medications in the immediate postoperative weeks did not increase the incidence of implant-bone interface radiolucencies, aseptic loosening, or revisions in cemented or cementless THAs when compared with cases that did not have postoperative treatment.
 However, although no major complications have been reported regarding the use of antiinflammatory medications in the prevention of HO after THA, orthopedic surgeons prescribing such treatment should be aware of their contraindications as well as early and late side effects.
 Since several antiinflammatory agents are reported to be effective in preventing HO, future reports dealing with HO after THA should always include information about the postoperative antiinflammatory treatment used.
