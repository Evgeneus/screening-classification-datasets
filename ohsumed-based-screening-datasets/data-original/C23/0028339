Bone modulation in sustained hematopoietic stimulation in mice.
 To understand the etiology of bone modulation and hypercalcemia observed in granulocytosis of a tumor-bearing animal model and to gain insight into the implication of sustained hematopoietic stimulation on the bone tissue, in vivo responses of normal mouse hematopoietic and bone tissues to long-term injections of recombinant human and murine granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), murine granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), and human erythropoietin were quantitatively analyzed.
 Osteoclast activation was estimated by the osteoclast-endosteal ratio, determined by morphometric analyses of femoral sections.
 Medullary and bone areas were measured on transverse ground bone sections of the tibia.
 Recombinant murine G-CSF provoked marked granulocytosis associated with significant increases in the number of marrow granulocytes and their progenitors, and caused expansion of granulopoietic marrow into fatty marrow.
 The bone of G-CSF-treated mice showed a significant increase in endosteal osteoclast numbers with medullary area enlargement and a reduction in the bone thickness; indicative of endosteal bone resorption.
 Although GM-CSF had little effect on granulopoiesis, it caused peritoneal macrophages to increase and induced similar bone changes as those observed in G-CSF treatment.
 Enhanced erythropoiesis stimulated by erythropoietin was also associated with evidence of endosteal bone resorption.
 Bone changes induced by these growth factors were not associated with hypercalcemia.
 These animal studies document association of bone modulation in sustained stimulation of hematopoiesis, and implicate important physiologic effects of hematopoietic growth factors on skeletal tissue in vivo.
