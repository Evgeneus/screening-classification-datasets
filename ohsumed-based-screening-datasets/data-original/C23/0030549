High-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide followed by autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease.
 Between February 1986 and March 1990, 56 patients with relapsed Hodgkin's disease treated with high-dose cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide (CBV) received an autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation (PSCT) rather than an autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) because each patient had a marrow abnormality, either hypocellularity or tumor involvement.
 At least 6.5 x 10(9) mononuclear cells/kg patient weight were collected from the peripheral blood of each patient, cyropreserved, and returned intravenously following CBV administration.
 Three patients had an early death 2, 22, and 25 days after PSCT.
 The actuarial event-free survival for these 56 patients at 3 years was 37% and was at least as good as that reported for relapsed Hodgkin's disease patients treated with CBV and ABMT.
 The 30 patients who had no marrow metastases at the time of PSC harvesting had an actuarial event-free survival of 47%, while those 26 patients with marrow metastases had a significantly different actuarial event-free survival of 27% (P = .02).
 CBV and PSCT for patients with relapsed Hodgkin's diseases who have marrow hypocellularity in traditional harvest sites or histopathologic evidence of BM metastases can result in long-term event-free survival.
