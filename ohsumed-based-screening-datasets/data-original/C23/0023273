Intravascular ultrasound imaging of an acute dissecting aortic aneurysm: a case report.
 A case of acute dissecting aortic aneurysm is described in which intravascular ultrasonography was used at the time of aortography to produce real-time, 360 degree cross-sectional images of the aorta.
 The transmural vessel morphology visualized by this new catheter-based technology allowed confirmation of the diagnosis and identification of distal extension to the aortic bifurcation.
 The case demonstrates the unique potential of this modality in diagnosis and possible therapy in vascular diseases.
