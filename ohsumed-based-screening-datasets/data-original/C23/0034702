Myocardial lactate dehydrogenase and its isoenzyme activities in transplanted human hearts.
 Lactate dehydrogenase and its heart (H) and muscle (M) subunit activities were studied in right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies from eight transplanted human hearts and compared with five chronically failing hearts and six normal human hearts from brain-dead liver/kidney donors.
 Of the 17 transplant biopsies (taken 5-95 weeks postoperatively), only two showed histologic signs of chronic rejection: They were excluded from the group analysis.
 A higher proportion of the M subunit of lactate dehydrogenase (M%) was found in the transplanted and the chronically failing hearts than in the normal hearts, presumably reflecting increased myocardial anaerobic glycolytic stress.
 In the early post-transplantation period, M% was higher in the transplanted than in the chronically failing hearts.
 Thereafter M% gradually fell, but had not reached normal levels 1-2 years after transplantation.
 During that time it was similar to the values in the chronic-failure hearts.
 In the two biopsies with chronic rejection, M% was nearly twice as high as in contemporaneous biopsies showing mild or no rejection.
 Monitoring of enzymatic adaptation from endomyocardial biopsies may be of clinical interest.
