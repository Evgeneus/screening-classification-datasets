Naloxone reverses pattern of obstruction of the distal common bile duct induced by analgesic narcotics in hepatobiliary imaging.
 It is widely known that narcotics, such as morphine, cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, increasing pressure in the common bile duct.
 This pharmacologic effect has been applied to hepatobiliary scintigraphy in patients with chronic cholecystitis or cholestasis to reducing the time required for a diagnostic study.
 However, this feature of narcotics could result in delayed or nonvisualization of the small bowel, simulating a distal common bile duct obstruction, in patients requiring parenteral narcotic analgesics who must undergo hepatobiliary scintigraphy.
 We report on three patients where administration of intravenous naloxone hydrochloride (Narcan), a narcotic antagonist, was helpful in distinguishing narcotic-induced spasm of the sphincter of Oddi from true obstruction of the common bile duct.
