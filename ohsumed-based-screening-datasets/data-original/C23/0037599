Behavioral audiometry.
 Behavioral audiometry is based on observation of overt responses to controlled auditory stimuli, as contrasted with electrophysiologic procedures, which involve electrophysiologic monitoring or direct recording of the bioelectric correlates of the original signal.
 When reinforcement is added to the behavioral procedures, the infant or young child provides highly reliable responses, and it is possible to test most infants 6 months of age and older with these procedures.
 The combination of both behavioral and electrophysiologic procedures can resolve most clinical questions regarding the auditory function of young infants and children.
