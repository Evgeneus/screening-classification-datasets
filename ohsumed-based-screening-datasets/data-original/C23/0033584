Auriculotemporal syndrome following the preauricular approach to temporomandibular joint surgery.
 Forty-seven joints in 28 patients were examined 4 months to 10 years after temporomandibular joint (TMJ) surgery via a modified preauricular approach.
 Many patients had undergone multiple procedures.
 None of the patients had any subjective or objective evidence of auriculotemporal syndrome (ATS), although patients in previous studies with more extensive incisions have demonstrated ATS.
 It was concluded that ATS is an unlikely complication following TMJ surgery.
 A small incision without an oblique superior extension may further reduce the risk.
