 Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare histiocytosis also known as lipoid granulomatosis.
 Oral findings have not been reported previously to our knowledge.
 This case report documents evidence of oral sequelae of Erdheim-Chester disease.
 A patient whose course was followed for 10 years at the National Institutes of Health had premature alveolar bone resorption.
 He underwent full-mouth extraction at age 29 years because of severe periodontitis.
 Histopathologic evidence of Erdheim-Chester disease was demonstrated in the periodontal soft tissues.
