Tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesions of the head and neck.
 The term 'tumefactive fibroinflammatory lesion' has been used to describe a fibrosclerosing disorder which has a locally destructive nature but is characterized by a benign histological appearance.
 We report five patients, over a five year period, with such a lesion.
 The clinical behaviour and surgical findings suggest the lesion to be an invasive malignancy.
 However, the histological appearance of an admixture of chronic inflammatory cells and fibrosis is consistent with a benign condition.
 We recommend surgical excision of the lesion as the mainstay of treatment; other studies report the use of steroids and radiotherapy.
