Long-term efficacy of Al3+ for prevention of bioprosthetic heart valve calcification.
 AI3+ preincubation has been shown in 21 and 60 day implants to inhibit calcification of glutaraldehyde preserved bovine pericardium (GPBP) in the rat subdermal model.
 This study was designed to assess the long-term anticalcification efficacy of GPBP AI3+ preincubation.
 Rat (50-60 gm, male, CD Sprague-Dawley) subdermal implants of GPBP, pretreated with 0.01 M or 0.1 M AICI3, were carried out for 21, 60, 90, and 120 days.
 Each explanted GPBP was analyzed for Ca2+ by atomic absorption spectroscopy and for AI3+ by atomic absorption spectroscopy or neutron activation irradiation.
 Results showed profound long-term (implant duration 120 days) inhibition of calcification after GPBP preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 (Ca2+ = 21.8 +/- 12.6 micrograms/mg), compared to control (Ca2+ = 329.0 +/- 20.3 micrograms/mg).
 After preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 and 21 day rat subdermal implantation, GPBP AI3+ levels declined from 9033 +/- 680 micrograms/g (control = 6.3 +/- 3.7 micrograms/g) to 2700 +/- 156 micrograms/g; however, there was no further significant decline in GPBP AI3+ levels after long-term implantation of 120 days (2618.4 +/- 349 micrograms/g).
 The authors conclude that GPBP preincubation in 0.1 M AICI3 markedly inhibited pathologic calcification to 7% of control values in the rat model after long-term (120 day) subdermal implantation.
