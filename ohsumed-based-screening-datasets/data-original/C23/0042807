Curative treatment of scalp arteriovenous fistulas by direct puncture and embolization with absolute alcohol. Report of three cases.
 Three cases of direct arteriovenous fistulas of the scalp (two involving cirsoid aneurysms) are presented.
 All three patients were treated with direct puncture of the venous pouch and injection of absolute ethyl alcohol during compression of the venous outflow of the fistula.
 Two of the three patients were cured with this treatment alone.
 The third patient, with a very high-flow giant fistula, required injection of glue to close the fistula and subsequent surgical extirpation of the resulting hard mass lesion.
