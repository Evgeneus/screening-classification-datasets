Glutathione peroxidase deficiency and childhood seizures.
 4 children with intractable seizures, repeated infections, and intolerance to anticonvulsants had evidence of glutathione peroxidase deficiency.
 2 had low intracellular enzyme activity but normal blood selenium and high plasma glutathione peroxidase concentrations.
 The other 2 had low intracellular glutathione peroxidase activity with low circulating glutathione peroxidase and selenium concentrations.
 The clinical state of the children improved after discontinuation of anticonvulsant medication and selenium substitution.
