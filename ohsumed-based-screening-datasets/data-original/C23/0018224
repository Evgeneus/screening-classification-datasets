Reversal of cardiac and vascular hypertrophy by antihypertensive therapy.
 Cardiovascular hypertrophy, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, and arteriolar hypertrophic changes are common in established hypertension.
 Left ventricular hypertrophy, in particular, markedly increases the risk of cardiovascular complications and death.
 The ability of an antihypertensive agent to reverse hypertrophic changes could, therefore, be greatly advantageous.
 Clinical studies with beta-blockers have shown them able to substantially reduce left ventricular hypertrophy.
 For reversal of arteriolar hypertrophy, vasodilatory beta-blockers have been shown to be preferable to ordinary beta-blockers, possibly because vasodilation reduces vascular smooth-muscle tone, which may facilitate reversal of hypertrophy.
 Theoretically, a vasodilatory beta-blocker, such as celiprolol, would therefore appear to offer advantages because of its ability to reverse left ventricular and arteriolar hypertrophy in addition to its antihypertensive action.
 The practical and clinical effects of cardiovascular hypertrophy reversal remain to be fully evaluated; however, it is logical to assume that they would be of considerable benefit to the hypertensive patient.
