Very late recurrence of renal vasculitis.
 We report a case of renal vasculitis with a relapse occurring 9 and a half years after the original presentation.
 The plasma creatinine six months before relapse was only 118 mumol/l.
 During the initial illness there was histological evidence of glomerular damage but at the time of relapse renal biopsy showed the remaining glomeruli to be normal with the destructive process causing fibrinoid necrosis of arteries.
