Total replacement for post-traumatic arthritis of the elbow.
 Fifty-three of 55 consecutive elbow replacements for post-traumatic arthritis were followed for a minimum of two years (mean 6.3, range 2 to 14.4).
 The patients presented difficult management problems, having undergone an average of two previous operations per joint; 22 joints had suffered prior complications; 18 had less than 50 degrees of flexion and six were flail.
 One of three versions of the Coonrad prosthesis was employed in all.
 During the follow-up period, 10 patients underwent 14 revision procedures for aseptic loosening; 38 elbows are currently without progressive radiolucent lines.
 In two patients an elbow had to be resected, one for deep infection and the other for bone resorption following a foreign-body reaction to titanium.
 The current design of the Coonrad prosthesis offers a reliable option for the treatment of post-traumatic arthritis but should be used only in carefully selected patients over the age of 60 years.
