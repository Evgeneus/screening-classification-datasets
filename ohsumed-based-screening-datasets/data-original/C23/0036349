Site-directed mutagenesis of the region around Cys-241 of complement component C2. Evidence for a C4b binding site.
 We probed the functional significance of the region around Cys-241 in human C2 by testing the hemolytic activity of a series of mutant rC2.
 Mutant C2 cDNA were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis and expressed transiently in COS cells.
 Wild-type rC2 had threefold higher specific hemolytic activity than native serum C2.
 Substitution of Gly, Ala, or Ser for Cys-241 resulted in a slightly, but significantly, increased activity.
 In addition, I2 had no effect on the activity of these mutant C2.
 Substitution of Lys for Gln-243 increased the hemolytic activity by more than two-fold.
 Increased activity in all cases was due to slower decay rates of the C3 convertase.
 Finally, substitution of Leu or Ala for Asp-240 or Ser-244, respectively, resulted in more than 100-fold decrease of hemolytic activity.
 The results suggest that residues 240 to 244 of human C2 represent an important structural determinant of the C4b binding site of C2a.
 They also confirm that Cys-241 is the residue responsible for the increased activity of C2 reacted with I2.
