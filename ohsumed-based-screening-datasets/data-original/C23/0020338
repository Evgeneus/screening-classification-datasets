Systemic and renal production of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin in decompensated liver disease and hepatorenal syndrome.
 To assess the role of altered renal and systemic production of thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin in the hepatorenal syndrome, urinary excretion of their major renal and extrarenal metabolites was measured in patients with compensated and decompensated liver disease, chronic renal failure, and hepatorenal syndrome.
 Urinary excretion rates of all prostanoids (renal and extrarenal) were increased in subjects with liver disease compared with normal controls.
 Moreover, they were considerably higher in subjects with severe hepatic decompensation but good renal function compared with those with hepatorenal syndrome.
 In contrast, the excretion rate of all metabolites was reduced in patients with chronic renal failure.
 The excretion rate of all metabolites was markedly elevated during the early stages of hepatorenal syndrome and decreased in parallel with creatinine clearance.
 When corrected for creatinine clearance, there was a strong correlation between prostanoid excretion and serum bilirubin in subjects with liver disease; there was no difference, however, in the excretion of renal and extrarenal prostanoids between hepatorenal syndrome and severe hepatic decompensation.
 It is concluded that hepatic decompensation is associated with a progressive increase in prostanoid excretion but that changes in production of prostacyclin or thromboxane A2 are unlikely to be major factors in the pathogenesis of the hepatorenal syndrome.
