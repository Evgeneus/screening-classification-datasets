Revision of failed knee replacements using fixed-axis hinges.
 Forty failed hinged arthroplasties of the knee were revised by the insertion of another hinged implant.
 In 14 cases the prosthesis used at the revision operation was similar to the primary implant; in 26, a hinge with an elongated femoral stem was used, usually replacing part of the femoral shaft.
 In seven of these knees an elongated tibial stem was also required, though the tibial shaft was replaced in only two of them.
 There were many complications.
 Fracture of the femur at the tip of the femoral stem was the most frequent.
 Sixteen first revisions failed and were revised a second time; 12 required replacement of the distal femoral shaft and three required replacement of the proximal tibia.
 The incidence of complications in knees requiring a second revision was even higher.
 Four required a third revision after an average interval of three years.
 Failure of a hinged prosthesis results in bone loss mainly in the femur.
 Revision of a failed hinged prosthesis with another of the same design is unlikely to be successful and may cause fracture of the femur.
