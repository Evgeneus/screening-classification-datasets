The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the Peoples Republic of China.
 Meta-analysis on data from 16 (two volunteer and 14 endoscopic) studies ahs been performed to investigate the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in the stomachs of individuals within the Peoples Republic of China.
 In this survey covering 2216 cases (89 volunteers and 2127 endoscopy patients), the incidence of H.
 pylori infection in 15- to 22-yr-old healthy volunteers, and in 13- to 88-yr-old symptomatic patients undergoing gastroscopy was 49.4% and 64.5%, respectively.
 The frequency of H.
 pylori infection in chronic gastritis (63.6%), gastric ulcer (71.9%), and duodenal ulcer disease (73.1%) differed significantly from that in histologically normal individuals (8.2%), confirming the relationship of H.
 pylori infection with those disease states.
 We found no significant association between H.
 pylori infection and symptoms.
