Lysis of intraventricular hematoma with tissue plasminogen activator. Case report.
 A 42-year-old woman suffered a severe intracerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage from a ruptured anterior cerebral artery aneurysm.
 Evacuation of the frontal hematoma and clipping of the aneurysm was performed but the intraventricular blood clot persisted, causing ventricular dilatation and high intracranial pressure (ICP) 24 hours after surgery despite external ventricular drainage.
 Over this period of time the patient's clinical condition improved from Grade V to Grade IVb (World Federation of Neurological Surgeons classification).
 The intraventricular hematoma was lysed with a total of 8 mg recombinant tissue plasminogen activator injected directly into the ventricles on the 1st and 2nd postoperative days, resulting in rapid normalization of ventricular size and ICP.
 The patient has since made a substantial recovery and has been able to return home.
