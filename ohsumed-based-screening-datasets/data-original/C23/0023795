Endocapsular hematoma. Description and treatment of a unique form of postoperative hemorrhage.
 Endocapsular hematoma, to our knowledge, is a previously unreported type of postoperative hemorrhage.
 In this condition, blood collects in the narrow space between the anterior surface of the posterior capsule and the posterior optic surface of a posterior chamber intraocular lens.
 Endocapsular hematoma differs from anterior chamber hyphema in several ways: the location of the blood is in the endocapsular space, a small amount of endocapsular blood can cause visually disabling symptoms, the blood in the endocapsular space often fails to reabsorb, and neodymium-YAG laser capsulotomy can be used to drain the endocapsular blood into the vitreous cavity.
 We present six cases of endocapsular hematoma.
 Neodymium-YAG laser capsulotomy was successfully used to drain the endocapsular hematoma in three of these cases.
