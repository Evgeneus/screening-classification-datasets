Nocturnal sleep in Huntington's disease.
 Nocturnal sleep was studied in 16 inpatients with Huntington's disease.
 In comparison with healthy controls, patients exhibited a disturbed sleep pattern with increased sleep onset latency, reduced sleep efficiency, frequent nocturnal awakenings, more time spent awake and less slow wave sleep.
 These abnormalities correlated in part with duration of illness, severity of clinical symptoms, and degree of atrophy of the caudate nucleus.
 Patients showed an increased density of sleep spindles.
