Bone weakness after the removal of plates and screws. Cortical atrophy or screw holes?
 Bone weakness leading to refracture is a recognised complication of the removal of rigid fixation plates.
 We have used partially demineralised rabbit tibiae to simulate atrophic changes and to determine whether weakness is due to atrophy or to residual screw holes.
 Partial demineralisation and a screw hole each reduced maximum bending moment.
 However, energy absorbing capacity was little affected by demineralisation, but was reduced to 50% by a single drill hole.
 Residual screw holes are a considerably more important cause of bone weakness after plate removal than is cortical atrophy.
