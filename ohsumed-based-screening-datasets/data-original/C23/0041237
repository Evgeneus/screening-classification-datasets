Local toxicity with subcutaneous methadone. Experience of two centers.
 We report on 8 patients treated with subcutaneous methadone for cancer-related pain at 2 institutions.
 The success of other subcutaneous agents for pain control has been well demonstrated.
 It was felt that methadone would be useful due to its low cost.
 Unfortunately, 7 of the 8 patients experienced adverse reactions at the subcutaneous sites requiring cessation of subcutaneous methadone.
