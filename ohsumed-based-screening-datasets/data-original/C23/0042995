Analysis of morbidity and mortality rates in right hepatectomy with the preoperative APACHE II score.
 Morbidity and mortality rates in 70 patients who underwent major liver resection for liver tumors (primary and metastatic) were determined and correlated with the preoperative APACHE II score.
 Patients were divided into three groups according to their preoperative APACHE II score: low (0 to 3), mid (4 to 7), and high (8 and above).
 A higher score was closely correlated with increased postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates.
 The group with low scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 34% and a mortality rate of 0%, the group with mid scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 54% and a mortality rate of 3%, and the group with high scores had a postoperative morbidity rate of 80% and a mortality rate of 20%.
 Age did not correlate with morbidity.
 It was therefore postulated that morbidity and mortality rates were related to the combination of points for abnormal physiologic variables and points for chronic health, or APACHE II score minus points for age.
 As the combination of these points increases the postoperative morbidity and operative mortality rates increase significantly (from 24% in the 0-point group to 69% in the greater than or equal to 3-point group).
 Also the two deaths occurred in the group with 3 or more points.
 The preoperative APACHE II score may be used by clinicians to evaluate before surgery the risk of postoperative morbidity and death in elective major liver surgery.
