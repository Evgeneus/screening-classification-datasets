Ossified mucin-secreting choroid plexus adenoma: case report.
 This is the first report of a fully documented case of an ossified mucin-producing benign choroid plexus tumor.
 This was a chance finding in a man who complained only of posttraumatic low back discomfort.
 The ossification of the tumor appears to have been therapeutic.
 Mucin production may be a defense mechanism.
