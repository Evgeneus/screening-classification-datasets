Human orthotopic small intestine transplantation: radiologic assessment.
 The authors describe the postoperative anatomy and review the radiologic examinations of five patients who underwent orthotopic small intestine or combined orthotopic liver and small intestine transplantation.
 Mucosal thickening of the transplanted intestine was demonstrated on the first postoperative contrast material-enhanced images and was due to submucosal edema.
 This resolved within 2 weeks in the long-term survivors.
 Bowel peristalsis appeared normal as early as 31 days after transplantation.
 Contrast-enhanced examinations of the intestine were useful to exclude surgical complications such as anastomotic leaks or strictures, but were insensitive for biopsy-proved cytomegalovirus enteritis or rejection.
