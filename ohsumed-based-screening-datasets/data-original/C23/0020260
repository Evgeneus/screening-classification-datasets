Oral contraceptive therapy and the surgical management of ENT patients: a review of current clinical practice.
 The current policy of British Otolaryngologists with regard to the preoperative cessation of the oral contraceptive pill is reported.
 This is based on a confidential questionnaire sent to all members of the British Association of Otolaryngologists.
 The overall response rate was 66%, 91% of which were from practising otolaryngologists and forms the basis of this report, the remaining 9% being from respondents not engaged in active surgery.
 Although there is evidence to show an increased risk of developing thromboembolic complications after major abdominal, gynaecological and hip surgery in those patients taking the oestrogen-containing contraceptive pill, the risk following minor and intermediate surgery (which forms the bulk of the otolaryngologist's workload) is not known.
 Not surprisingly therefore the results of the survey show a varied policy across the country with 36.5% of respondents choosing to continue the pill and 25% always stopping the pill preoperatively.
 The remainder elect to stop the pill only in certain circumstances.
