Chronic osteomyelitis due to Clostridium clostridiiforme.
 We have reported a case of chronic osteomyelitis due to an unusual anaerobic organism, Clostridium clostridiiforme, a gram-positive rod that often stains gram-negative and that is frequently resistant to such drugs as cefoxitin and clindamycin.
 Clostridia other than those similar to C perfringens are generally not considered invasive pathogens, but our case and several similar ones show that they can be.
