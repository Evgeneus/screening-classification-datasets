The renal growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor I axis.
 Collecting duct is a major site of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) synthesis within kidney.
 Production of IGF-I at this site is stimulated by growth hormone (GH).
 IGF-I produced in collecting duct is likely to act on glomerulus and proximal tubule via IGF-I receptors present at these locations.
 Renal IGF-I may be causative of the glomerular and proximal tubular hypertrophy that occurs in hypersomatotropic states, of compensatory renal hypertrophy, and of renal regeneration following acute ischemic injury.
