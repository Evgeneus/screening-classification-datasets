Characteristics of a random sample of emergency food program users in New York: I. Food pantries.
 Food pantry users throughout New York State were studied and many demographic differences found between New York City and Upstate New York respondents.
 Seven percent of households had no income and median income as percent of the poverty level was 59 percent.
 Slightly more than 40 percent were spending over 60 percent of their incomes on housing.
 The data from this survey, the first in New York State to employ a random sampling design, demonstrate a sizable gap between household needs and available resources.
