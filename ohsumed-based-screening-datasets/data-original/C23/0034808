An autopsy study of the peritoneal cavity from patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 Sixteen autopsies were performed on patients aged 56 +/- 15 (SD) years who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 834 +/- 766 (SD) days.
 Lactate-buffered dialysate and povidone-iodine antiseptic were used in all cases.
 Multiple peritoneal sections were taken to evaluate peritoneal membrane thickening, inflammation, neovascularization, fibrosis, and adhesions.
 Peritoneal thickening, inflammation, or adhesions were not related to sex, race, or etiology of renal failure.
 Time on dialysis was also not a direct determinant of peritoneal adhesions or neovascularization.
 Peritonitis episodes correlated with chronic peritoneal serosal changes.
 This study supports the hypothesis that peritoneal alterations in patients on CAPD are related to episodes of peritonitis.
