Argon laser-assisted anastomoses in medium-size vessels: one-year follow-up.
 Laser-assisted anastomosis of medium-size vessels can be performed with satisfactory short-term patency.
 This study was undertaken to evaluate patency and structural integrity up to 1 year.
 An argon laser was used to make bilateral femoral arteriovenous anastomoses in 12 dogs compared to conventional suture method in another 8 dogs.
 These anastomoses were evaluated for patency and aneurysm formation at 1 hour; 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks; and 12 months after surgery.
 All anastomotic sites were patent and without aneurysmal change or luminal narrowing at all harvesting intervals.
 Histologic examination revealed that within 1 month laser anastomotic sites were almost completely healed and without intimal hyperplasia.
 In suture anastomoses, foreign-body reaction remained evident up to 1 year.
 Use of the argon laser for medium size vessel anastomoses resulted in excellent patency without aneurysm formation or intimal hyperplasia even in the long term.
 These data suggest promising clinical applications.
