Enteroscopic diagnosis of small bowel ulceration in patients receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
 15 patients with rheumatoid arthritis who were receiving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and who had chronic occult gastrointestinal bleeding underwent extended small bowel examination with a Sonde enteroscope.
 7 patients (47%) were found to have jejunal or ileal ulceration.
 Small bowel enteroscopy may be a valuable technique for the investigation of undiagnosed gastrointestinal bleeding.
