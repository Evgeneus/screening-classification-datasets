Five-year vascular audit from a district hospital.
 Vascular patients under the care of one surgeon over a 5-year period have been reviewed, from computer-based discharge records, with regard to in-hospital measures of outcome to determine whether or not surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard.
 Out of 466 procedures, 30 per cent of patients had at least one complication, 14 per cent had further surgery and 9 per cent died.
 Outcome was examined within the following treatment groups: aorto/iliac aneurysm, aortofemoral bypass, femoroproximal popliteal bypass, femorodistal popliteal bypass, femorocrural bypass, embolectomy and percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.
 Patients having below-knee bypass surgery were found to have an unacceptably high rate of complications, reoperations and amputations.
 An overall rate of reoperation for postoperative bleeding of 5 per cent was also considered to be high.
 With these exceptions, it was concluded that the surgery was being performed to an acceptable standard, but that comparative audit of this type remained difficult while there was a deficiency of national statistics against which the work of individual surgeons could be judged.
