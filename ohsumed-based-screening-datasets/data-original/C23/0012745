Intrahepatic arterioportal fistula after blunt hepatic trauma: case reports.
 Intrahepatic arterioportal fistula (APF) was found in five out of 65 consecutive patients following blunt hepatic trauma.
 In four patients the fistula was located peripherally and the blood flow was small.
 These fistulas closed spontaneously within 3 months.
 However, a centrally located fistula with early visualization of the trunk of the portal vein persisted in one patient and necessitated transcatheter embolization.
 The APF in this patient caused portal dilatation which was detectable by CT scan.
 We conclude that spontaneous closure can be expected when an APF is located peripherally and the shunt flow is small, while centrally located APF with large flow require active treatment, preferably by transcatheter embolization.
 An APF detectable by CT scan suggests the need of intervention.
