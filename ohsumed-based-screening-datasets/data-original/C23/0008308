Chancroid and the role of genital ulcer disease in the spread of human retroviruses.
 Chancroid is the most prevalent form of genital ulcer disease in developing countries and is undergoing a resurgence in industrialized countries.
 As a result of a nonspecificity of the clinical findings, the etiologic diagnosis of genital ulcer disease requires laboratory support.
 Genital ulcer disease is a risk factor for the transmission of human retroviral infections.
 An understanding of this interaction is emerging and will impact on the treatment and control programs for the agents causing genital ulcer disease.
