Intestinal and renal calcium-binding protein in rats with experimental short bowel syndrome.
 Intestinal calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D9K) and renal calcium-binding protein (calbindin-D28K) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assays in rats with short bowel syndrome induced by resection of about 85% of the small intestine.
 Rats with short bowel syndrome had significantly lower mucosal concentrations of calbindin-D9K (P less than 0.001) and a parallel reduction of both intestinal calcium absorption (P less than 0.001) and p-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (P less than 0.01) in spite of a general hypertrophy of the duodenal mucosa.
 Interestingly, the renal concentration of calbindin-D28K was significantly elevated (P less than 0.05) in rats with short bowel syndrome, a change apparently related to factors independent of vitamin D.
