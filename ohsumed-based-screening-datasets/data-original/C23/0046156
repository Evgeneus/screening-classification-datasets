Portal venous system after portosystemic shunts or endoscopic sclerotherapy: evaluation with Doppler sonography.
 We sought to determine the usefulness of duplex Doppler sonography in the assessment of blood flow and clot formation in the portal vein in 44 patients with portal hypertension and bleeding esophageal varices who had undergone either endoscopic sclerotherapy (28 cases) or portosystemic shunt procedures (16 cases).
 The main, left, and right portal veins (collectively referred to as intrahepatic portal veins), superior mesenteric vein, splenic vein, and shunt were assessed for flow direction, presence of thrombi, and collaterals.
 Patent shunts were visualized in 12 (75%) of the 16 cases.
 Clot was detected in 27 (69%) of 39 intrahepatic portal veins in patients with end-to-side shunts, in six (67%) of nine intrahepatic portal veins in patients with distal splenorenal shunts, and in five (5%) of 92 intrahepatic portal veins in patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy.
 Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in two (15%) of 13 patients with patent shunts (one end-to-side portacaval shunt and one distal splenorenal shunt).
 Flow in the main portal vein was hepatopetal in 26 (93%) of 28 patients who had had endoscopic sclerotherapy.
 Our data suggest endoscopic sclerotherapy preserves antegrade portal flow and results in fewer portal vein clots than surgical portosystemic shunts do.
 Patterns of thrombosis and flow direction vary unpredictably from patient to patient.
 Shunt patency should not be inferred without direct visualization of the shunt.
