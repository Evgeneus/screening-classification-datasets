Thyroidectomy under local anesthesia.
 Thyroidectomy for benign and malignant disease is most commonly performed with the patient under general anesthesia, although the literature is sprinkled with reports of series of operations performed using local anesthetic techniques.
 A retrospective review of 43 sequential thyroidectomies compares 21 performed using local anesthesia with 22 performed using general anesthesia.
 No significant difference was demonstrated in the incidence of major complications.
 All patients who required a second operation to remove the remaining hemithyroid after the final pathology reports were reviewed elected local anesthesia for their second procedure, attesting to patient satisfaction.
 Some hemithyroidectomies performed using local anesthesia were outpatient procedures.
 The indications, guidelines for patient selection, and operative technique of this effective alternative approach to thyroid surgery are presented.
