A six-amino acid deletion in basic fibroblast growth factor dissociates its mitogenic activity from its plasminogen activator-inducing capacity.
 A recombinant deletion mutant of the 155-amino acid form of human basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), lacking amino acid residues 27-32 (Lys-Asp-Pro-Lys-Arg-Leu), was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity by heparin-Sepharose affinity chromatography.
 When maintained in the presence of an equimolar concentration of soluble heparin, the bFGF mutant (M1-bFGF) is as potent as bFGF in stimulating cell proliferation in normal and transformed fetal bovine aortic endothelial cells, in adult bovine aortic endothelial cells, and in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts.
 However, under the same experimental conditions, M1-bFGF is at least 100 times less efficient than bFGF in stimulating plasminogen activator (PA) production in endothelial cells, as assayed by chromogenic PA assay, SDS/PAGE zymography, and Northern blot analysis of urokinase-type PA mRNA.
 In the presence of heparin, M1-bFGF binds to bFGF plasma membrane receptors present on endothelial cells in a manner undistinguishable from bFGF.
 It also induces the same tyrosine phosphorylation pattern when added to NIH 3T3 cells.
 The data suggest that the PA-inducing activity of bFGF may depend upon a functional domain that differs from those involved in the mitogenic activity of the growth factor and that the binding of bFGF to its plasma membrane receptor may not be sufficient to induce urokinase-type PA production in endothelial cells.
