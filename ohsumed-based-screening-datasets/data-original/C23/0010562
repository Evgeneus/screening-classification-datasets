Characterization of herpes simplex virus type 2 latency-associated transcription in human sacral ganglia and in cell culture.
 The ability of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) to establish latency in and reactivate from sacral dorsal root sensory ganglia is the basis for recurrent genital herpes.
 The expression of HSV-2 genes in latently infected human sacral ganglia was investigated by in situ hybridization.
 Hybridizations with a probe from the long repeat region of HSV-2 revealed strong nuclear signals overlying neurons in sacral ganglia from five of nine individuals.
 The RNA detected overlaps with the transcript for infected cell protein O but in the opposite, or "anti-sense," orientation.
 These observations mimic those made previously with HSV-1 in human trigeminal ganglia and confirm the recent findings during latency in HSV-2-infected mice and guinea pigs.
 Northern hybridization of RNA from infected Vero cells showed that an HSV-2 latency-associated transcript was similar in size to the larger (1.85 kb) latency transcript of HSV-1.
 Thus, HSV-1 and HSV-2 latency in human sensory ganglia are similar, if not identical, in terms of their cellular localization and pattern of transcription.
