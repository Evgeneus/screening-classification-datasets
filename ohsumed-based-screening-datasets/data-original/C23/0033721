Outpatient dacryocystorhinostomy.
 We report 105 dacryocystorhinostomy procedures in 87 patients performed on an outpatient basis.
 Seventy-six patients received local, and 29 received general, anesthesia.
 The patients left the hospital an average of 2.6 hours after surgery, but 14 were admitted after surgery--9 immediately, and 5 after some delay, primarily for epistaxis.
 There were no serious complications related to the outpatient nature of the surgery.
 The success rate was 94%.
 We conclude that outpatient dacryocystorhinostomy is successful, well accepted by patients, and safe, provided that inpatient care facilities are readily available should they be needed.
