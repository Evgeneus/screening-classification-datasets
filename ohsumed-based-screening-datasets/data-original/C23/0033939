Primary tracheojejunal shunt operation for voice restoration following pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy.
 A primary tracheojejunal shunt operation was performed for voice restoration following pharyngolaryngoesophagectomy with free jejunum reconstruction for advanced hypopharyngeal cancer.
 A fistula was created between the membranous part of the trachea and the lower part of the transplanted jejunum.
 The membranous part of the trachea was tubed to construct the tracheojejunal shunt.
 All three patients who had the tracheojejunal shunt operation retained phonatory function.
 Pitch formation was seen in the voice waveform with use of the tracheojejunal shunt.
 No leakage was seen at all during deglutition and a swallowing function was obtained in all patients who had the tracheojejunal shunt.
