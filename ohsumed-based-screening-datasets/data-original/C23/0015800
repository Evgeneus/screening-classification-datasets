Care of diabetic patients by optometrists in New York State.
 OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to learn about the involvement of optometrists in the eye care of diabetic patients in New York and to collect baseline data for planning intervention programs in diabetic eye disease.
 RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study was conducted by a mail survey being sent to all optometrists in New York whom we could identify through state sources (n = 2270).
 Three follow-up mailings were conducted.
 RESULTS: Eighty-six percent who received our mailing responded, 87% of whom reported that they see diabetic patients.
 Analysis was confined to this 87%.
 Routine retinal examinations were provided by 68% of the respondents who see diabetic patients, 62% of whom dilate the pupils.
 Sixty-eight percent who see diabetic patients diagnose retinopathy solely by their own examination, and 60% of these dilate.
 Follow-up of retinopathy was provided by 15% of optometrists who see diabetic patients, 90% of whom dilate the pupils of their diabetic patients.
 Twenty-five percent of respondents who see diabetic patients refer them to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis of retinopathy, and 67% refer all retinopathy patients to an ophthalmologist for follow-up.
 Although 91% of respondents recommended eye examinations at least annually for diabetic patients, only 68% specifically recommended annual examinations through dilated pupils.
 Those who dilate were significantly more likely to recommend annual dilated examinations than those who do not dilate, regardless of practice setting.
 CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that optometrists as a group see many diabetic patients.
 Intervention strategies should include increased emphasis on the use of dilation when examining diabetic patients and annual dilated retinal examinations.
