Combined study to assess the role of calcium alginate swabs and ligation of the inferior tonsillar pole in the control of intra-operative blood loss during tonsillectomy.
 Bleeding is the major source of morbidity and mortality of tonsillectomy and most operative time is spent securing haemostasis.
 Calcium alginate reduces experimental wound blood loss.
 This study assessed the efficacy of alginate swabs during tonsillectomy and inferior tonsillar pole ligation in the control of blood loss during tonsillectomy.
 Ninety-nine tonsillectomy patients were randomized to gauze or alginate swab use.
 A haemoglobinometer measured blood losses collected by suction during dissection and by swab until haemostasis was secured.
 Operative time, complications and healing were also assessed.
 Mean total blood losses and operative times were similar for the two groups.
 Swab blood loss was significantly lower for surgeons who ligated the lower tonsillar pole, compared with surgeons who used a snare.
 This finding was independent of swab type.
 Independent assessment showed no difference in the healing rate.
 Alginate swabs offer no advantage over gauze in terms of blood loss, operative time or complications of tonsillectomy.
 The results show that routine lower pole ligation significantly reduces post-dissection blood loss.
 We suggest that this technique should be more widely adopted.
