Cardiovascular collapse following orthoclone OKT3 administration: a case report.
 Orthoclone OKT3 has been described to have significant adverse effects on the cardiovascular system, including pulmonary edema, angina, dysrhythmias, hypertension, and hypotension, usually following the first or second doses of the drug.
 We describe a case of cardiopulmonary arrest in a patient 1 minute after the initial injection of OKT3.
 Two subsequent doses were successfully administered with the guidance of hemodynamic monitoring, which showed profound, immediate effects of OKT3 on the cardiovascular system.
 Potential mechanisms of these effects are discussed.
