Carotid artery resection and replacement in patients with head and neck malignant tumors.
 Tumor involvement of the carotid artery with head and neck cancers may be present either simultaneously with the primary lesion or more often appears at a later date following resection of the primary tumor.
 Management of the secondary tumor consists of its resection together with the involved carotid artery with or without carotid artery reconstruction.
 The Authors are convinced that the best chance for cure of patients with advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers involving the carotid artery is radical extirpation with ablative surgery in the form of en block resection of the primary lesion, the secondary tumor, and the involved carotid artery followed by immediate revascularization.
 This bold approach was carried out in two male patients, 48 and 61 years of age, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy in one and radiation therapy alone in the other, with excellent results.
 Dermal grafts were placed over the entire length of the arterialized veins to protect them from radiation injury.
 Based on this limited experience and excellent results, we recommend this one-stage surgical ablative procedure in well selected patients.
 However, cooperation between the ENT and vascular surgeons, strict adherence to the principles and techniques of vascular surgery, and coverage of the arterialized vein with a dermal graft is absolutely essential.
