Delayed presentation and treatment of popliteal artery embolism.
 In the course of reviewing a 10-year experience with popliteal artery embolism (PAE), two distinct patterns of clinical presentation were identified.
 In addition to those patients presenting with typical acute (symptom duration less than 7 days) arterial ischemia, a second group was identified who presented with more chronic symptoms.
 The present study was conducted to contrast the clinical factors and treatment of these two temporal patterns of presentation with PAE.
 Sixty PAEs in 58 patients were documented by the combination of angiography and/or exploration of the popliteal artery.
 Acute presentation (AP) was seen in 41 (68%) of these and delayed presentation (DP) was noted in 19 (32%) patients.
 Delayed presentation patients typically presented with a history of sudden onset of claudication or rest pain and a median symptom duration of 30 days.
 Eighty per cent of AP patients presented with immediately threatened limbs.
 Angiography was generally diagnostic of chronic popliteal embolism.
 In the acute group, 90% were treated with embolectomy alone, while 20% of the DP group required bypass grafting.
 However in two thirds of the DP group, embolectomy alone performed through a direct popliteal approach was possible.
 Current results with overall limb salvage (92%) and mortality (7%) represents a substantial improvement compared to the authors' previous experience with PAE.
 The current study suggests that as many as one third of patients with popliteal artery embolism may present in delayed fashion with chronic symptoms.
 Furthermore most of these patients can be treated with direct popliteal embolectomy alone with favorable results.
