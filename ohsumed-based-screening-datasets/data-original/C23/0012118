Recurrent laryngeal nerve avulsion for treatment of spastic dysphonia.
 Treatment of spastic dysphonia by recurrent laryngeal nerve section has resulted in reproducibly good results in the early postoperative period in most patients.
 However, critical long-term follow-up has shown a high recurrence rate of adductor spasms by the third year after initial nerve section.
 A patient who developed recurring adductor spasms 1 year after nerve section was reexplored, with identification of neural regrowth into the distal segment of the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
 The technique of neural avulsion removing the distal nerve up to its insertion into the laryngeal muscles is described.
 Neural regrowth, which is just one of the possible mechanisms for recurrence of spastic dysphonia, should be prevented by this surgical modification.
 Twelve patients who have undergone neural avulsion primarily for spastic dysphonia are being followed up without recurrence of symptoms thus far.
 Although these results appear promising, this short follow-up that averages 1.5 years must be extended to firmly support these concepts.
