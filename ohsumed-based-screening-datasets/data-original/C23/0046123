Surgical method for treatment of syndactyly with osseous fusion of the distal phalanges.
 For the interdigital space plasty to correct a syndactyly with fusion of the distal phalanges, we adopted a new operative procedure, covering the exposed distal bone with local rectangular flaps designed transversely on both dorsal and volar surfaces.
 A full-thickness skin graft from the groin region covers the remaining raw surface.
 The procedure was performed in six patients, and the flaps measured 6 mm (width) x 12 to 16 mm (length) in four patients, 5 x 15 mm in one patient, and 5 x 18 mm in one patient.
 Partial necrosis was observed in only one patient, in whom a narrow flap of 5 x 18 mm was used.
 In the other five patients, however, the results were satisfactory on both external appearance and function during the follow-up period of 3 to 6 years.
