Effect of chronic respiratory acidosis on urinary calcium excretion in the dog.
 It is currently believed that the two chronic acidemic disorders exert disparate effects on urinary calcium excretion: chronic metabolic acidosis induces consistent hypercalciuria, but no appreciable change or even a decrease in calcium excretion is reported to attend chronic respiratory acidosis.
 Whereas the effect of metabolic acidosis is well documented, little work has been carried out in chronic hypercapnia.
 In fact, most of the studies on chronic respiratory acidosis were short in duration, had employed only mild hypercapnia, or had failed to control carefully the prevailing metabolic conditions.
 We have carried out balance observations in nine dogs exposed to a 10% CO2 atmosphere in an environmental chamber for a period of two weeks.
 Chronic respiratory acidosis led to a significant increase in urinary calcium excretion from a mean control value of 0.4 +/- 0.1 mmol/day to 0.6 +/- 0.1 mmol/day during both week 1 and 2 of hypercapnia (P less than 0.05).
 Hypercalciuria occurred even though filtered load of calcium fell.
 Mean fractional excretion of calcium increased significantly during each week of hypercapnia averaging 0.60 +/- 0.12% during control, 1.05 +/- 0.13% during week 1, and 1.26 +/- 0.17% during week 2 of hypercapnic exposure (P less than 0.05).
 There were no changes in plasma levels of immunoreactive parathyroid hormone or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3.
 These findings suggest that chronic respiratory acidosis, just like chronic metabolic acidosis, augments urinary calcium excretion by a direct depressive effect on the tubular reabsorption of calcium.
