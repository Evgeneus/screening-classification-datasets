Premedication: an audit.
 A prospective study of routine premedication management was carried out at a large teaching hospital.
 Many patients received their premedication at times inappropriate for it to be effective.
 Several patients receiving regular medication had this suddenly stopped pre-operatively.
 Prolonged fasting occurred in both elective and emergency groups of patients.
 Benzodiazepines and opioids were prescribed most frequently and drying agents were used widely.
 Antacids, H2-blockers and agents to promote gastric emptying were used very little despite the potential of aspiration in many groups of patients.
 This audit of activity has revealed several areas of practice that can either be improved immediately or warrant detailed investigation.
