Correlation of the optic disc size to glaucoma susceptibility.
 Previous studies have suggested that a larger optic disc size in blacks as compared with whites is related to the increased glaucoma susceptibility in blacks.
 In an intraindividual bilateral comparison of 245 white patients with open-angle glaucoma, the authors evaluated whether the glaucomatous optic nerve damage was greater or less in the eye with the larger optic nerve head.
 Highly myopic eyes were excluded.
 The difference in optic disc area of one eye as compared with the contralateral eye was not significantly correlated to the differences in visibility of retinal nerve fiber bundles and mean visual field defect between the two eyes.
 Mean perimetric loss and the retinal nerve fiber layer index were not significantly higher in the eye with the larger or smaller optic nerve head.
 This indicates that in whites, high myopes excluded, the susceptibility to glaucomatous optic nerve fiber loss may be independent of the optic disc size.
