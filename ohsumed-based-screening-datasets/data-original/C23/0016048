Automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation without thoracotomy using an endocardial and submuscular patch system.
 The automatic cardioverter-defibrillator lead system is implanted by a thoracotomy procedure that may result in atelectasis, pleural effusion, cardiac tamponade and lengthy convalescence.
 A new defibrillator lead system that allows selection of different defibrillating current pathways is implanted without a thoracotomy.
 Ten patients requiring a cardioverter-defibrillator for recurrent sustained ventricular tachycardia (five patients) or aborted sudden cardiac death (five patients) were evaluated for implantation of this lead system.
 A lead configuration with a bidirectional defibrillating current pathway was implanted in nine patients.
 The defibrillation threshold with this lead configuration was 15 J in five patients, 20 J in three and 30 to 35 J in one patient.
 In the remaining patient the lead system had a 40 J defibrillation threshold and was not implanted.
 No perioperative complications occurred.
 Induced ventricular fibrillation was successfully terminated at the predischarge and intermediate follow-up (8 to 12 weeks) electrophysiologic studies.
 During the follow-up period, there were three deaths (one sudden, two due to heart failure) and two lead system failures (oversensing with inappropriate shocks in one patient and patch lead fracture in another).
 Implantation of the cardioverter-defibrillator lead system by a nonthoracotomy approach is feasible, has no significant perioperative complications and is well tolerated by patients.
 Effective defibrillation was demonstrated immediately as well as at intermediate follow-up study.
 The occurrence of patch lead fracture and oversensing requires improvement in the present (nonthoracotomy) lead system technology.
