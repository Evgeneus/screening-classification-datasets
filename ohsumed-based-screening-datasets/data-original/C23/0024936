Alcohol craving in rehabilitation: assessment of nutrition therapy.
 If untreated, alcohol abuse, which often results from alcohol craving, causes major metabolic abnormalities, altered life-styles, lost productivity, and eventually death.
 Biochemical mechanisms that may contribute to alcohol craving include the stress response of the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis, the endogenous opiate beta-endorphin system, neurotransmitter synthesis and release, hypoglycemia, and nutrient deficiencies.
 The macronutrient ratio of meals, the resulting insulin response, and nutrient blood levels can affect amino acid and nutrient transport across the blood-brain barrier.
 Researchers have reported that animals increase alcohol intake when fed nutrient-deficient diets or after stressful experience.
 A pilot study was designed to assess the effects of nutrition therapy added to a traditional rehabilitation program based on the 12-step program of Alcoholics Anonymous.
 One study group received traditional therapy; the other study group received traditional therapy and nutrition therapy consisting of modified menus and individualized nutrition counseling.
 Patients who received nutrition therapy reported significantly fewer hypoglycemic symptoms, lower sugar intake, less alcohol craving as well as significantly greater nutrient intakes; a greater number abstained from alcohol.
 These findings indicate that nutrition therapy can aid in the recovery from alcoholism.
