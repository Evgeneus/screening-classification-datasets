Laryngeal dystonia: a series with botulinum toxin therapy.
 Laryngeal dystonia is a syndrome characterized by action-induced, involuntary spasms of the laryngeal muscles.
 Most patients have involvement of the adductor laryngeal muscles producing uncontrolled spasms during phonation, and a "strain-strangle" speech pattern commonly termed "spastic dysphonia." Other patients have involvement of the abductor muscles producing "whispering dysphonia." Rare patients have paradoxical vocal cord motion during respiration with adductor spasms on inspiration.
 Over the past 5 years we have used botulinum toxin (BOTOX) to treat more than 200 patients with laryngeal dystonia.
 This group includes patients with adductor involvement (phonatory dystonia, recurrent laryngeal nerve section failure, respiratory dystonia) and those with abductor involvement (whispering dystonia).
 Patients received benefit within 24 to 72 hours, with sustained improvement for 2 to 9 months with an average of 4 months.
 Patients improved to an average of 90% of normal function.
 Clinically significant adverse effects included extended breathy dysphonia and mild choking on fluids.
 BOTOX has become our treatment of choice for dystonic conditions of the larynx.
