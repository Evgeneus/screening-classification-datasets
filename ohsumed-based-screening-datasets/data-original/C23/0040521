Single-center comparison of results of 1000 prenatal diagnoses with chorionic villus sampling and 1000 diagnoses with amniocentesis.
 Large multicenter studies have confirmed the safety and accuracy of chorionic villus sampling as a prenatal genetic diagnostic procedure, but there have been few single-center evaluations.
 We report our experience with 1000 consecutive chorionic villus sampling procedures compared with 1000 consecutive amniocentesis procedures during the same period.
 The procedures were performed by the same genetic counselors, sonographers, obstetricians, and laboratory personnel.
 Indications for referral, demographic characteristics of patients, numbers of attempts per patient, fetal loss rates, laboratory results, and evaluation of accuracy are included.
 Analysis of all data suggests that chorionic villus sampling is a safe and accurate alternative to amniocentesis in our community-based teaching hospital.
