Prospective analysis of sperm-oocyte fusion and reactive oxygen species generation as criteria for the diagnosis of infertility.
 We have undertaken a prospective analysis of the diagnostic significance of three different criteria of human sperm function including the conventional semen profile, measurements of hamster-oocyte fusion, and determinations of reactive oxygen species generation in 139 couples.
 The latter, who were characterized by a lack of detectable abnormalities in the female partner, were followed up for a maximum of 4 years to determine the incidence of spontaneous pregnancy in the absence of therapeutic intervention.
 Assessments of monthly fecundity with life table analysis techniques revealed a highly significant, positive relationship between fertility and hamster-oocyte fusion rates that were measured in the presence of the ionophore, A23187.
 Conversely, reactive oxygen species generation was shown to be negatively associated with both the outcome of the sperm-oocyte fusion assay and fertility in vivo.
 The clinical significance of these diagnostic techniques was emphasized by the fact that within the same data set, the conventional semen profile was of no significant diagnostic value.
