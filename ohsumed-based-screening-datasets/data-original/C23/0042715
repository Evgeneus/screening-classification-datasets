A technique for control of hypertrophic scarring in the central region of the face.
 Various methods are available for applying pressure to the central portion of the face to reduce hypertrophic scarring after burn injury.
 Our center uses an elastomer insert with a thermoplastic backing, which is formed over a plaster mold of the patient's face.
 The insert is worn under a traditional anti-burn scar face mask.
 We reviewed the records of 26 patients with hypertrophic scarring to the central portion of the face to assess the effectiveness of the insert.
 Seventeen (65%) of these patients wore the insert until scar maturation.
 Three of these 17 patients later required reconstructive surgery of the central face.
 Our findings suggest that pressure to this part of the face may be effective in decreasing hypertrophic scar formation.
 The insert described in this article is inexpensive and relatively easy to fabricate.
