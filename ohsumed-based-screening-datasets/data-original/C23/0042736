Augmentation of reverse arthus reaction by mast cells in mice.
 Immune complex-induced injury is an important pathogenic factor in antibody-mediated nephritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other diseases.
 In this study we investigated the role mast cells in immune complex-mediated injury in mouse skin.
 Reverse Arthus reaction was induced in mast cell-deficient WBB6F1-W/Wv mice and their congenic controls (WBB6F1(-)+/+).
 Serial skin sections were evaluated for neutrophil infiltration, edema, and hemorrhage.
 In WBB6F1-W/Wv mice the neutrophil influx was only 40% and edema 60% of that in congenic controls.
 Hemorrhage was also significantly reduced in the mast cell-deficient mice.
 After mast cell reconstitution, the magnitude of the reaction in WBB6F1-W/Wv was equivalent to that in WBB6F1(-)+/+ mice.
 Mast cell release in reverse Arthus reaction was evaluated by measuring fluorescence intensity after avidin-FITC staining of mast cell granules.
 There was a 70% decrease in fluorescence intensity.
 The 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor A-63162 significantly decreased neutrophil accumulation (40%), edema (60%), and hemorrhage in WBB6F1(-)+/+, but not in mast cell-deficient mice.
 Mast cell reconstitution of WBB6F1-W/Wv mice restored the effect of A-63162.
 The results indicate that mast cells and their mediators, including leukotrienes, make an important contribution to reverse Arthus reaction.
