The failed ulnar nerve transposition. Etiology and treatment.
 Various procedures have been recommended for the treatment of cubital tunnel syndrome.
 Simple decompression in situ, medial epicondylectomy, subcutaneous transposition, intramuscular transposition, and submuscular transposition all have their advocates.
 The results of the surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome are related to the severity of the compressive neuropathy at the time of diagnosis and to the adequate decompression of the nerve at all sites of potential compression at the time of surgical treatment.
 Fourteen patients who had previously undergone surgical treatment for cubital tunnel syndrome were evaluated because of persistent pain, paresthesia, numbness, and motor weakness.
 All patients had documented persistent compression of the ulnar nerve on clinical and electromyographic evaluation.
 The indication for repeat surgical exploration in all patients was unremitting pain despite nonoperative treatment.
 All patients had been treated by neurolysis and submuscular transposition of the ulnar nerve as described by Learmonth.
 The causes of continued pain after initial surgery included retention of the medial intermuscular septum, dense perineural fibrosis of the nerve after intramuscular and subcutaneous transposition, adhesions of the nerve to the medial epicondylectomy site, and recurrent subluxation of the nerve over the medial epicondyle after subcutaneous transposition.
 Revision surgery was found to be highly successful for relief of pain and paresthesias; however, the recovery of motor function and return of sensibility were variable and unpredictable.
