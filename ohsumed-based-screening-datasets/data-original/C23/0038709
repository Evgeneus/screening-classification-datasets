Laser-assisted angioplasty in the treatment of prosthetic graft stenosis.
 Late failure of peripheral bypass grafts has been treated primarily by secondary reconstruction.
 Laser-assisted angioplasty is an optional therapy that the authors investigated in 28 prosthetic grafts over a two-year period.
 Twenty-five symptomatic patients with 28 peripheral prosthetic arterial bypass grafts (25 polytetrafluoroethylene [PTFE] grafts and 1 each of knitted Dacron, Teflon, and umbilical vein) demonstrated graft occlusion (25) or high-grade stenoses (3).
 All patients underwent standard laser-assisted angioplasty using a continuous wave Nd:YAG laser source and hybrid probe.
 Twenty-one grafts (75%) were successfully recanalized with adequate restoration of flow through the conduit.
 All 7 failures were in occluded PTFE grafts that presented with either recalcitrant lesions (5) or perforations (2) at the distal anastomoses.
 There have been 3 long-term failures (14%) to date in the successfully treated group, all in PTFE grafts.
 Two patients suffered recurrent thrombosis and 1 developed an inexplicable graft infection five months after laser treatment.
 Laser-assisted angioplasty appears to be a clinically viable alternative treatment for prosthetic graft stenosis and recanalization of grafts occluded at their distal anastomosis.
