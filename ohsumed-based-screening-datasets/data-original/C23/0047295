Altered density of glomerular binding sites for atrial natriuretic factor in bile duct-ligated rats with ascites.
 The renal response to atrial natriuretic factor is blunted in cirrhosis with ascites.
 This might be due to alterations of renal receptors for atrial natriuretic factor.
 Therefore density and affinity of glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites of bile duct-ligated rats with ascites (n = 10) and of sham-operated controls (n = 10) were determined.
 Glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites were identified to be of the B-("biologically active") and C-("clearance") receptor type.
 Discrimination and quantitative determination of B and C receptors for atrial natriuretic factor were achieved by displacement experiments with atrial natriuretic factor(99-126) or des(18-22)atrial natriuretic factor(4-23), an analogue binding to C receptors only.
 Density of total glomerular atrial natriuretic factor binding sites was significantly increased in bile duct-ligated rats (3,518 +/- 864 vs.
 1,648 +/- 358 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05).
 This was due to a significant increase of C-receptor density (3,460 +/- 866 vs.
 1,486 +/- 363 fmol/mg protein; p less than 0.05), whereas density of B receptors was not significantly different in bile duct-ligated rats (58 +/- 11 vs.
 162 +/- 63 fmol/mg protein).
 Affinity of atrial natriuretic factor to its glomerular binding sites did not differ significantly between both groups.
 These data suggest that an altered glomerular atrial natriuretic factor receptor density could be involved in the renal resistance to atrial natriuretic factor in cirrhosis with ascites.
