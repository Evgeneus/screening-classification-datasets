Cost and benefit of secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 OBJECTIVE--To determine the relative cost and benefit of aerosolized pentamidine and the combination product of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim sulfate as secondary prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.
 DESIGN--A Markov-based cost-benefit analysis was performed.
 Drug efficacies, toxicities, and mortality rates were drawn from the current literature.
 SETTING--Hypothetical.
 PATIENT POPULATION--Patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus who had had at least one episode of P carinii pneumonia.
 INTERVENTIONS--Regimen 1 required the use of aerosolized pentamidine as the sole first-line prophylactic agent in all patients.
 Regimen 2 required the use of sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim in all patients who had no history of a toxic reaction to the drug; only patients with a history of toxic effects and those who developed toxic effects while receiving the drug would receive aerosolized pentamidine.
 Regimen 3 required that no secondary prophylaxis be given.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--Net cost, median patient survival, and 5-year survival for each regimen and for regimens 1 and 2 compared with regimen 3.
 MAIN RESULTS--Regimen 2 was dominant, with a net cost of $6332 per patient and a median survival of 2.050 years.
 Compared with no prophylaxis, regimen 2 resulted in a savings of $16,503 per patient and a 0.696-year increase in median survival.
 Compared with regimen 1, regimen 2 resulted in a savings of $2904 and a 0.067-year increase in median survival.
 CONCLUSIONS--Secondary prophylaxis for P carinii saves money and extends survival.
 Current data suggest that sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim should be given whenever it can be tolerated.
 Use of aerosolized pentamidine as a first-line agent would result in a modest increase in cost and a decrease in life expectancy.
