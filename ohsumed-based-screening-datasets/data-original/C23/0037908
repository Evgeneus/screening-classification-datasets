Epidemiology of encephalitis in children: a 20-year survey.
 Four hundred five children from the Helsinki area who were 1 month to 16 years old were treated for acute encephalitis at the Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, from January 1968 through December 1987.
 Encephalitis occurred most commonly in children 1 to 1.9 years of age, among whom the incidence was 16.7 per 100,000 child-years.
 The incidence remained quite high until the age of 10 years, and then gradually declined to 1.0 per 100,000 child-years at the age of 15 years.
 Since 1983, when mumps, measles, and rubella vaccination eradicated the encephalitides associated with these microbes, the major associated agents have been varicella-zoster, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and respiratory and enteroviruses.
 In infants younger than 1 year of age, the major agents were enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, and the group of "others," whereas in older children, respiratory viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, as well as varicella-zoster virus, dominated.
 In children aged 1 to 11 months, the causal agent could not be identified in one-half of all cases, whereas in children who were at least 10 years old, the etiology remained unknown in only one-fourth of cases.
 Male dominance was most evident in the 4- to 9-year age group.
 The difference in etiology between males and females was significant (p = 0.02); mumps and varicella were more common in boys, and adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were more common in girls.
 The overall male-to-female ratio was 1.4:1.
 Characteristic seasonal variation occurred in encephalitides associated with mumps, measles, and entero- and respiratory viruses.
