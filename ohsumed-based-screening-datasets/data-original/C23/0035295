Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver causing biliary obstruction. Treatment by biliary stenting with 5-year follow-up.
 Inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are rare lesions that are becoming increasingly recognized, possibly because of frequent use of abdominal computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography.
 Most previously reported cases have been treated by hepatic resection.
 For this reason, we describe a patient with obstructive jaundice secondary to an inflammatory hepatic pseudotumor in the porta hepatis.
 Bilateral internal biliary stents were inserted, and the patient remains well 5 years later.
 The clinicopathologic features of inflammatory pseudotumors of the liver are described, as are the implications of accurate diagnosis.
 There have been no previous reports of biliary stenting in management of inflammatory hepatic pseudotumors.
