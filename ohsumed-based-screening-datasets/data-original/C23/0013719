Rectal strictures: treatment with fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation.
 The authors performed 25 fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation procedures in nine patients with rectal strictures.
 In all cases, the stricture developed after rectal surgery.
 Four patients underwent ileoanal anastomosis after total colectomy for various conditions; five patients underwent rectosigmoid end-to-end anastomosis after resection of a tumor or as treatment for diverticulitis.
 Maximal stricture dilatation was attained in 20 instances with a single 15-30-mm balloon.
 In five procedures, two balloons (20 or 15 mm) were inflated simultaneously ("kissing balloons" technique) to dilate the strictures.
 In five patients, only one dilation procedure was required for effective treatment of the strictures, with no clinical evidence of strictures after follow-up of 1.5-56 months (mean, 29.5 months).
 In the other four patients, multiple procedures were performed: nine in one patient, five in one patient, and three in two patients.
 In these patients, no recurrent symptoms developed during follow-up of 1.25-18 months (mean, 8.1 months) after the last dilation.
 Complicating leaks, infection, or hemorrhage did not occur after any of the procedures.
 Fluoroscopically guided balloon dilation is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of rectal strictures.
