Histologic and ultrastructural findings of tissue ingrowth. The Leeds-Keio prosthetic anterior cruciate ligament.
 A light and electron microscopy investigation was performed on a Leeds-Keio ligament removed because of rupture 18 months after implantation to repair an anterior cruciate ligament.
 The investigation showed fibrous connective tissue on the plane of the main stress force.
 There was elastin and adequate vascularization interspersed with Type I collagen fibrils in the area most distant from the ligament.
 The tissue near the Dacron fibers was highly cellular with a matrix of infrequent, thin collagen fibrils and abundant fine granular material.
 The growth of the host tissue occurred in and around a Leeds-Keio ligament in response to tensile stresses.
