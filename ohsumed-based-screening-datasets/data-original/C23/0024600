Introducing an acute pain service.
 An acute pain service in a new district general hospital is described.
 We have reported incidence of severe pain, common postoperative anaesthetic problems and patient satisfaction in relation to the analgesic technique.
 Over half the patients were treated by intermittent intramuscular injection of opioid, but increase in the use of continuous intravenous therapy and in particular patient-controlled analgesia, was welcomed by both medical and nursing staff.
