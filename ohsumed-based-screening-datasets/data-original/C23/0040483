Ridogrel in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty.
 The safety of the combination of heparin and ridogrel therapy and its antiplatelet efficacy was examined in the setting of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA).
 In 32 patients without known aspirin intake for 10 days before PTCA, therapy with ridogrel (300-mg intravenous bolus) was begun just before PTCA and continued orally at a dose of 300 mg twice daily until discharge.
 Heparin was administered as a 10,000 IU bolus dose before PTCA and followed by an intravenous infusion at a rate of 1,000 IU/hour for 24 hours.
 Bleeding problems at the arterial entry site occurred in 13 patients, which required a blood transfusion in only 2 patients.
 One patient underwent emergency bypass surgery without specific problems of hemostasis.
 Ridogrel virtually eliminated thromboxane B2 from the serum (29,990 +/- 6,555 pg/0.1 ml before vs 63 +/- 7 pg/0.1 ml at 2 hours after ridogrel), with a concomitant increase in serum 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (511 +/- 34 pg/0.1 ml before vs 1,190 +/- 146 pg/0.1 ml at 24 hours after ridogrel).
 There were no acute reocclusions in the ridogrel-treated patients, whereas acute reocclusions occurred in 5.6% of the patients taking the standard aspirin + heparin regimen during the same period.
 Furthermore, at 6-month clinical follow-up patients treated with ridogrel compared favorably with those receiving standard treatment.
