Correction of subclavian artery stenosis by percutaneous angioplasty.
 Subclavian artery stenosis is an infrequently recognized cause of left-sided chest and arm pain that can mimic the signs and symptoms of angina pectoris.
 In addition, more proximal subclavian artery stenoses can be associated with cerebrovascular symptoms in the "subclavian steal syndrome." This article reviews the clinical experience in four patients who presented with different manifestations of subclavian artery stenosis and who were all successfully treated by percutaneous angioplasty.
 Their clinical presentation, angiographic findings, and post-angioplasty results are documented.
 In conclusion, it is felt that nonsurgical correction of critical subclavian artery stenosis, using current angioplasty techniques, is the preferred method of treatment.
