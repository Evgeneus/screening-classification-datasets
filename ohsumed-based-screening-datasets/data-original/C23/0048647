Endoscopic surgery for lacrimal obstruction.
 Intranasal access to the lacrimal drainage system has been greatly enhanced with the advent of endoscopic nasal surgery.
 This technique has been used for the treatment of recurrent lacrimal obstruction after failed external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) in 12 patients.
 Improved intranasal visualization with the endoscope allowed easy identification and opening of the lacrimal sac, with no need for a skin incision.
 Obstructing intranasal pathology, including adhesions from previous DCR, an enlarged middle turbinate, and ethmoid sinus disease, was readily identified and corrected.
 There were no intraoperative complications.
 Lacrimal obstruction was completely relieved in nine of 12 patients (75%), with a followup of 7 to 25 months.
 Endoscopic revision DCR should be considered in patients with recurrent epiphora after external DCR.
