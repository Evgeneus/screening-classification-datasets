Electromyographic activity of selected leg musculature in subjects with normal and chronically sprained ankles performing on a BAPS board.
 The purpose of this study was to evaluate the magnitude and temporal features of tibialis anterior, peroneus longus, and gastrocnemius muscle activity during exercises performed on a Biomechanical Ankle Platform System (BAPS) board by subjects with normal and chronically sprained ankles.
 Fourteen participants in each of the two groups rotated the platform in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions at self-selected velocities.
 Trials were completed with both medium- and large-sized hemispheres under the platform while electromyographic surface recordings were made from the three muscles of interest.
 Electromyographic values, normalized within individuals as a percentage of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), ranged from 20% to 80% of MVIC.
 An analysis of variance for the average myoelectric signals from all three muscles revealed no differences between the two groups.
 Effects of direction and hemisphere size were shown for all muscles.
 The large hemisphere produced significantly greater average activity and a more pronounced effect on the tibialis anterior muscle.
 The data provide information on the level of muscle activity required for conditions used in this study and may assist the physical therapist with making judgments about the use of this device in rehabilitation programs.
