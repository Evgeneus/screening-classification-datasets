Adrenal hemangioma: an unusual adrenal mass delineated with magnetic resonance imaging.
 Adrenal hemangioma should be included in the differential diagnosis of any large calcified adrenal mass.
 We report to our knowledge the eighth surgically removed lesion and describe its appearance on magnetic resonance imaging.
 This imaging includes features seen in hemangiomas elsewhere, in particular a heterogeneous mass with enhancing peripheral high intensity foci on T1 images.
