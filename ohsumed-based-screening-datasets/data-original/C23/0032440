Effect of irreversible dermal necrosis on phagocytic activity of reticuloendothelial system.
 A model of full-thickness dermal necrosis was produced in rats by the application of liquid nitrogen to a 20% total body surface area of the dorsal skin surface.
 In this model there was an alteration of reticuloendothelial system phagocytic activity of the lung and spleen as measured by the uptake of technetium 99m-labeled sulfur colloid in vivo.
 The present results suggest that marked alterations in reticuloendothelial system phagocytic activity can be produced by full-thickness dermal necrosis in the absence of heat.
