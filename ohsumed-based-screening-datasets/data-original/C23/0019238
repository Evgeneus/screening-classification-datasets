Geriatric constipation: brief update on a common problem.
 Constipation occurs frequently in the elderly and is often multifactorial in origin.
 A search for an underlying cause is necessary, and can often be found by taking an adequate history and performing a thorough physical examination.
 A minority of patients require further investigation, guided by the clinical setting.
 Management should be directed at correcting the underlying cause and providing dietary advice and, less commonly, medication to allow restoration of a normal bowel habit.
