Practical approach to the diagnosis of unexplained chest pain.
 Chest pain is a frequent medical problem causing concern for both patients and physicians.
 A multidisciplinary meeting recently developed algorithms for evaluating these patients in the two most common scenarios for the presentation of chest pain: (1) new onset of chest pain in the primary care setting, and (2) recurrent chest pain in the the referral setting.
 In both situations, the primary care physician, rather than specialists, should direct the evaluation and treatment of patients with chest pain and normal coronary angiograms.
