Irreversible drop of systemic vascular resistances in patients implanted with a Jarvik total artificial heart.
 Maintenance of the body's perfusion by a total artificial heart (TAH) may result in physiological alterations to the circulatory system.
 Little has been said about modifications to systemic vascular resistances (SVR) during TAH assistance.
 This paper reports on two patients implanted with a Jarvik - 70 cc TAH, who died after 1 and 3 days, both with an irreversible drop of SVR related to a complete loss of vascular tone but not related to sepsis.
 Activation of multiple cascades of inflammation, triggered by the extracorporeal circulation (ECC), is maintained during TAH support.
 Desperately sick patients might not be able to face the vaso-active situations created by the inflammatory response.
