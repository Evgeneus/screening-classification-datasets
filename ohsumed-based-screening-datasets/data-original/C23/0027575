Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome. Clinical course, therapy, and long-term visual outcome.
 We reviewed data from 26 patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome who presented at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between March 1969 and February 1990.
 Visual outcomes were good, with final visual acuity of better than 20/30 in 29 (66%) of 44 eyes and of worse than 20/400 in only three (7%) of 44 eyes.
 A poor prognosis was associated with the development of choroidal neovascular membranes or chronic uveitis.
 All patients were treated with systemic corticosteroids.
 Corticosteroid therapy averaged 6 months, but was prolonged (48 months) in patients who developed chronic uveitis.
 Disease recurred in nine (43%) of 21 patients in the first 3 months, usually in association with a rapid tapering of steroid dosage.
 We recommend the early, aggressive use of systemic corticosteroids in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and a gradual tapering of drug dosage for 6 months after presentation.
