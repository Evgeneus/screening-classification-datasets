Acute fulminant hepatic failure.
 Fulminant hepatic failure is the rapid onset of life-threatening hepatic decompensation in patients who have no previous history of liver disease.
 This condition has a multifactorial etiology, including viral hepatitis and drug toxicity.
 At this time there is no specific therapy for FHF.
 However, early diagnosis and treatment of the complications--in particular, cerebral edema--may prolong survival and prevent irreversible neurologic complications.
 Once the diagnosis has been made, patients with FHF should promptly be transferred to a specialized liver care unit where liver transplantation is available.
 Liver transplantation is now the treatment of choice for patients with clinical characteristics suggesting a poor chance of survival.
