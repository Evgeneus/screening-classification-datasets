Anterior capsule adherence to iris leading to pseudophakic pupillary block.
 We present a rare case of anterior capsule adherence to the iris following extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation and leading to pseudophakic pupillary block.
 There were no synechiae at the pupillary margins associated with the capsule/iris adherence, but aqueous was entrapped behind the iris and intraocular pressure rose.
 Laser iridotomy was temporarily beneficial, but it had to be repeated several times.
