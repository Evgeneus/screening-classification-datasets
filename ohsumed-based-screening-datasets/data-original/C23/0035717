US-guided venipuncture for venography in the edematous leg.
 A technique for sonographic-guided venipuncture was developed especially for venography made difficult by gross leg edema.
 Five patients were evaluated in whom venography had been attempted but was initially unsuccessful because of difficult venous access.
 All five underwent successful venipuncture after sonographic localization of a vein.
 Ultrasound-guided venipuncture is simple and useful when venous access by palpation is difficult.
