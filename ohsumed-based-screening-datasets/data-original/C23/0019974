Safe performance of difficult laparoscopic cholecystectomies.
 Laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been advocated for the treatment of uncomplicated symptomatic gallstone disease, but has not been widely advocated for the management of more complicated gallbladder disease such as acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct stones.
 During the last 9 months, 360 patients underwent laparoscopic removal of their gallbladder.
 A total of 138 had a complicated presentation, making surgery more difficult.
 This article discusses the management of these patients with acute cholecystitis, previous surgery, or common duct disease.
 Using the described techniques, there were no complications or mortality.
 Laparoscopic management of difficult gallbladder problems is safe and effective.
