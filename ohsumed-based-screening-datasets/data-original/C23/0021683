Necrotizing angiopathy presenting with multifocal conduction blocks.
 We describe conduction block as an unusual electrophysiologic manifestation in a patient with necrotizing angiopathy.
 The patient developed subacute symptoms over a 1-month period consisting of progressive pain, tingling, and weakness of the lower extremities.
 Physical examination revealed a pattern consistent with a polyneuropathy.
 Electrodiagnostic studies provided evidence of a conduction block in the left ulnar nerve.
 Pathologic studies confirmed the process to be a necrotizing angiopathy.
 This report establishes the role of conduction block in human nerve ischemia.
