Transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy: a 25-year experience.
 We reviewed 67 patients who underwent transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy for benign (32) and malignant (35) disease in regard to the indications for and complications of the procedure.
 The most common complications included urine leakage at the ureteroureterostomy, stomal stenosis and calculus formation.
 Renal function improved or remained stable in 75% of the patients.
 Transureteroureterostomy with cutaneous ureterostomy is a viable alternative diversion technique in a select group of patients.
