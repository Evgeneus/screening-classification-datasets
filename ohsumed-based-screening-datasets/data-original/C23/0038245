Damage to tissue defenses by EMLA cream.
 EMLA is a new topical agent that safely anesthetizes intact skin.
 The purpose of this study was to determine if this cream could be safely used for anesthetizing wounds.
 This investigation evaluated the potential toxicity of EMLA cream in wounds by measuring its effect on host defenses and on the biology of wound repair.
 In contaminated wounds, EMLA cream elicited an exaggerated inflammatory response that damaged host defenses, inviting the development of infection.
 As a result of these investigations, we do not recommend the use of EMLA cream in wounds.
