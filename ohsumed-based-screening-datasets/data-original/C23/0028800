Endoscopic balloon dilatation as a therapeutic option in the management of intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease.
 Endoscopic balloon dilatation was undertaken in seven patients who presented with obstructive symptoms resulting from Crohn's disease.
 Five patients had strictures from recurrent disease at the site of an ileotransverse anastomosis, one had duodenal stenosis and one a colonic stricture.
 The procedures were performed under intravenous sedation on one to four occasions (median 2) and were uncomplicated.
 Sustained improvement over an 18-24-month follow-up period was achieved in five patients, but dilatation was unsuccessful in two cases.
 Endoscopic balloon dilatation is a safe and effective option in selected patients with intestinal strictures resulting from Crohn's disease and may overcome the need for surgery.
