Spontaneous renal rupture during pregnancy.
 Spontaneous rupture of the renal parenchyma or renal pelvis during pregnancy has been previously reported in 16 cases.
 In the case we describe in this report, the patient initially had right flank pain and nausea for 48 hours, which progressed to severe abdominal symptoms that necessitated exploratory laparotomy.
 Cystoscopic placement of a ureteral stent relieved the obstruction and allowed spontaneous healing of the renal pelvis.
 Dilatation of the urinary collecting system commonly occurs during pregnancy.
 Spontaneous rupture of the renal parenchyma or renal pelvis, however, is unusual and often associated with diseased kidneys.
 Our case is the 8th one of spontaneous rupture of the renal collecting system with no identifiable underlying pathologic condition and the 17th case of spontaneous renal rupture overall.
