Nutrition and metabolism in sepsis and multisystem organ failure.
 Sepsis and organ failure produce profound metabolic changes that contribute to hepatic and musculoskeletal failure.
 When multiple organ failure develops, the mortality rate is high, and therapy is unlikely to be effective unless the causative process (e.g., infection, low cardiac output) can be eliminated.
 Thus, the prevention of multiple organ failure and the prevention or early treatment of infection are paramount.
 Organ and nutritional support to prevent complications is necessary.
 The gastrointestinal tract should be used for nutrition whenever possible with a blenderized regular diet with fiber, glutamine, and short-chain fatty acids to protect and preserve the gut.
 If parenteral nutrition is necessary, special solutions may be necessary for the liver, kidneys, or lungs.
 If not, protein with 45% branched-chain amino acid, medium- and short-chain triglycerides, glutamine supplementation, and carbohydrates seem best.
 Other substances are being evaluated that may be helpful in nutrition and organ support, including arginine, xylitol, growth hormone, and anabolic steroids.
 Multiple organ failure should be prevented, if at all possible, by stopping or controlling the injury, removing as much necrotic tissue as possible, improving blood flow and oxygen consumption, supporting metabolism, and preventing infection or treating it early and adequately.
 Nutritional support plays a key role in preventing metabolic failure.
