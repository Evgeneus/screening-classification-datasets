Peptide inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.
 Angiopeptin, a novel synthetic octapeptide, was evaluated as a new approach toward the inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia in vein grafts.
 Male New Zealand white rabbits (n = 22) underwent carotid artery interposition bypass grafting with autologous reversed jugular vein.
 Nine rabbits were in the treatment group, and 13 were in the control group.
 The treatment group received angiopeptin 20 micrograms/kg/day by subcutaneous injection beginning 1 day before operation and continuing for 3 weeks until they were killed.
 At death the vein grafts were fixed in situ with 10% buffered formalyn at 80 mm Hg perfusion pressure.
 Histologic sections through each vein graft were analyzed by computerized morphometric analysis for area of neointimal hyperplasia (mm2).
 Neointimal hyperplasia in the control animals was 0.080 + 0.017 mm2 (mean + SEM), whereas neointimal hyperplasia in the group treated with angiopeptin was 0.022 + 0.006 mm2 (mean + SEM) (p = 0.02).
 This is the first time that peptide inhibition of neointimal hyperplasia has been demonstrated in vein grafts and may have significant implications for future use in vascular surgery.
