Detection of pancreatic fluid and urine leakage after pancreas transplantation: value of CT and cystography.
 Leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of the graft is difficult to diagnose clinically.
 We retrospectively reviewed our experience with fluoroscopic cystography and CT to determine their relative merit in the diagnosis of pancreatic fluid and urine leakage as documented by surgical exploration in pancreas transplant recipients.
 Thirteen leaks were diagnosed by fluoroscopic cystography or by CT in 11 patients after pancreas transplantation with urinary bladder drainage of pancreatic fluid.
 Conventional retrograde fluoroscopic cystography showed 11 leaks; CT with retrograde bladder opacification showed three leaks.
 Of the five CT studies that did not show a leak and that also were done within 7 days of a cystogram with abnormal findings, failure to use retrograde bladder opacification accounted for the majority (three cases) of missed diagnoses.
 Focal or free peritoneal abdominal fluid was seen in all CT examinations, with extravasation of contrast material seen into both walled-off collections and free ascites.
 Our experience suggests that retrograde bladder and duodenal stump opacification should be a routine part of the CT evaluation performed to detect leakage from the urinary bladder or duodenal stump after pancreas transplantation.
