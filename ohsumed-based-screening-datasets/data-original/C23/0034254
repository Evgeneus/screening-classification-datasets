Overwhelming necrotizing tracheobronchitis due to inadequate humidification during high-frequency jet ventilation.
 Necrotizing tracheobronchitis (NT) associated with conventional mechanical ventilation or high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) is a lesion reported most often in neonates.
 In most cases, a specific cause is not identified.
 We describe a case of NT in an adult that occurred during HFJV and was attributable to inadequate humidification.
