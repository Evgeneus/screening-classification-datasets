Neuro-imaging and positron emission tomography of congenital homonymous hemianopsia.
 Congenital homonymous hemianopsia is an uncommon asymptomatic visual field defect discovered typically in young adult life that is caused by a diverse group of insults to the retrochiasmal afferent visual system occurring prenatally, at birth, or during early childhood.
 We treated eight patients with congenital homonymous hemianopsia; seven with damage involving the optic radiations and one with an abnormality of the optic tract.
 We performed positron emission tomography using 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose on two patients with dense homonymous hemianopsias, lesions of the contralateral optic radiations, and largely intact occipital cortex.
 These studies showed minimal abnormalities in resting visual cortex glucose metabolism of the affected visual cortex.
