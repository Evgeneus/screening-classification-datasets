A method for allocation of hearing handicap.
 A three-stage method is proposed for allocation of hearing handicap.
 First, for a given injury or noise exposure period, the percentage of loss allocable for each ear is calculated as a simple ratio of hearing change (after age correction) to final hearing level.
 Second, final hearing handicap is divided between the two ears using a formula derived from the 1979 AAO-HNS/AMA standard.
 The percentage of hearing handicap allocable to a given period for each ear is simply the product of that ear's scores from the first two steps.
