Reversible brain death. A manifestation of amitriptyline overdose.
 Tricyclic antidepressants are known to cause central nervous system depression.
 However, a generalized depression of brainstem functions is rarely reported.
 We report a patient in deep coma with complete absence of brain-stem reflexes after she had taken a large quantity of amitriptyline.
 With continuous supportive treatment, she eventually regained all neurologic function and made a full recovery.
