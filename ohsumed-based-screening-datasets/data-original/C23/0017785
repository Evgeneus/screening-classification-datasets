Rate-related left bundle branch block as a cause of non-ischemic chest pain.
 A case is presented of rate-dependent left bundle branch block associated with chest pain in a patient with angiographically normal coronary arteries.
 Lactate extraction showed no evidence of myocardial ischemia.
 It appears that in this case, chest pain was associated with sudden ventricular asynergy rather than myocardial ischemia.
