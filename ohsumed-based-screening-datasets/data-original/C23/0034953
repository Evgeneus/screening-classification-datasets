Tinnitus suppression by cochlear implants.
 The beneficial effects of cochlear implants on tinnitus have been noted in several studies, but few detailed appraisals of the phenomenon have been made.
 Six patients fitted with the UCSF/Storz cochlear implant device were studied.
 The effects of use of the implant device on tinnitus were monitored, and suppression of tinnitus was tracked throughout periods of stimulation and poststimulation.
 Tinnitus was effectively suppressed in five of six patients with the device on and with noise input, and reduction of perceived tinnitus loudness occurred in four of six with the device on but without acoustic input to the speech processor.
 Unilateral stimulation frequently resulted in bilateral tinnitus suppression.
 These studies reveal that profound tinnitus suppression is obtained by patients using their cochlear implants.
 Further work is required to quantify the optimal mode of stimulation, but these findings suggest that tinnitus sufferers may ultimately benefit from development of electrical stimulation tinnitus suppression devices.
