Discontinuation of neuroleptic medication in older, outpatient schizophrenics. A placebo-controlled, double-blind trial.
 Thirty-five schizophrenic outpatients over the age of 52 who had been stable on neuroleptic medication were all switched to haloperidol.
 Ten patients were unable to tolerate the haloperidol and two dropped out of the study.
 The remaining 23 patients were randomly and blindly assigned to haloperidol or placebo and then followed for 6 months.
 Five patients did not complete the study due to medical or administrative reasons.
 Among the patients who completed the study, five of 10 randomized to placebo relapsed compared with only one of eight randomized to haloperidol.
 However, three of 10 patients randomized to placebo have remained stable without medication for 2.5 years.
