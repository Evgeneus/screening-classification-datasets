Pregnancy outcome among native Indians in Saskatchewan.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine the difference in pregnancy outcome between native Indians and the provincial population in Saskatchewan.
 DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of data collected from all birth and death registration forms.
 SETTING: Saskatchewan.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of low birth weight and rates of stillbirth and of neonatal and infant death.
 RESULTS: The neonatal death rate was higher in the Indian population than in the provincial population during the study period; the difference between the two groups in the rate decreased markedly after 1982.
 The rates of stillbirth and infant death were also higher among the Indians, and the difference persisted during the study period.
 The incidence of low birth weight and the rate of stillbirth were highest in the youngest and oldest maternal groups in the provincial population; however, the pattern was markedly different among the Indians, teenaged mothers having the best outcomes.
 CONCLUSION: Further studies are needed to determine the relation between maternal age and fetal outcome among native Indians.
