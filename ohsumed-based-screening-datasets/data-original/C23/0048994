Stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions and total parenteral nutrition in critically ill patients: frequency, complications, and the value of prophylactic treatment. A prospective, randomized study.
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the frequency, complications, and value of prophylactic treatment of stress-induced gastroduodenal lesions.
 DESIGNS: Patients were prospectively randomized to treatment with total parenteral nutrition, either alone, with sucralfate, or with ranitidine.
 SETTING: A multidisciplinary ICU from a tertiary care referral center.
 PATIENTS: Ninety-seven patients submitted to prolonged mechanical ventilation, with normal hepatic and renal function, in metabolic stress, and receiving total parenteral nutrition.
 INTERVENTIONS: On admission, we determined the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score and the catabolic index score.
 We also performed an endoscopic examination on day 3, every 7 days subsequently, and whenever needed.
 Thirty patients received total parenteral nutrition alone.
 Twenty-four patients received total parenteral nutrition and sucralfate (1 g by nasogastric tube every 4 hrs).
 Nineteen patients received total parenteral nutrition and ranitidine (50 mg iv every 6 hrs).
 MAIN RESULTS: The overall occurrence rate of gastroduodenal mucosal damage was 29.6%.
 The overall frequency rate for stress ulcerations was 15.6% and was 6.2% for stress hemorrhage.
 There were no deaths secondary to stress hemorrhage.
 The difference in the frequency of stress-induced mucosal lesions and stress hemorrhage between the studied groups was not statistically significant.
 CONCLUSIONS: Additional prophylaxis to total parenteral nutrition in the form of sucralfate and ranitidine to prevent acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding is not required in this group of ICU patients.
