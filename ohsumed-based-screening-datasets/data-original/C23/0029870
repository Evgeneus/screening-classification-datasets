Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation support in the high-risk cardiac patient undergoing urgent noncardiac surgery.
 Patients with a recent myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, sever angina, or uncorrected multivessel coronary artery disease are at increased risk of cardiac complications after major noncardiac surgery.
 Although invasive hemodynamic monitoring and preoperative optimization of cardiac status may lead to some reduction in the rate of perioperative cardiac events, the mortality from such events remains high.
 We report our experience with the use of perioperative intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation in eight patients with unstable coronary syndromes or severe coronary artery disease who underwent urgent noncardiac surgery.
 There were no perioperative cardiac events while the intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) was in place.
 There were two postoperative cardiac events (non-fatal myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure) in the first postoperative week after the IABP was removed.
 One patient required emergent femoral thrombectomy as a result of intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation and subsequently died of a gastrointestinal hemorrhage.
 Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be considered as an adjunct to maintain hemodynamic stability for the high-risk cardiac patient about to undergo urgent or emergent noncardiac surgery.
