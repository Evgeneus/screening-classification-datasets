5-lipoxygenase inhibitory activity of zileuton.
 Zileuton [N-(1-benzo[b]thien-2-ylethyl)-N-hydroxyure] inhibited 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid synthesis by rat basophilic leukemia cell 20,000 x g supernatant and rat polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) (IC50 = 0.5 and 0.3 microM) respectively.
 It also inhibited leukotriene (LT)B4 biosynthesis by rat PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM), human PMNL (IC50 = 0.4 microM) and human whole blood (IC50 = 0.9 microM).
 Inhibition of human PMNL LTB4 biosynthesis was removed readily by a simple wash procedure.
 At concentrations up to 100 microM, the compound produced little or no inhibition of several related enzymes, such as platelet 12-lipoxygenase, soybean and rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase and sheep seminal vesicle cyclooxygenase.
 At p.o.
 doses from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg in the dog, zileuton produced a rapid and sustained inhibition of ex vivo blood LTB4 biosynthesis which correlated with the pharmacokinetic behavior of the compound.
 In a similar ex vivo study in the rat, the compound displayed an p.o.
 ED50 of 2 mg/kg.
 Zileuton was highly effective in preventing 6-sulfidopeptide LT formation in the rat peritoneal cavity triggered by an antigen-antibody reaction with an ED50 of 3 mg/kg.
 In experimental models of inflammation, zileuton significantly reduced arachidonic-acid induced mouse ear edema (ED50 = 31 mg/kg) and also attenuated inflammatory cell accumulation in the rat pleural Arthus reaction.
 The effectiveness of this compound for preventing LT formation in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo suggests its utility for preventing the pathophysiological effects of the LTs and other 5-lipoxygenase products in animals and in humans.
