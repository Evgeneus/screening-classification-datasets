Suture length to wound length ratio and the integrity of midline and lateral paramedian incisions.
 A total of 349 patients were randomized to undergo laparotomy through a lateral paramedian incision with layered closure (n = 137), a midline incision with mass closure (n = 104) or a midline incision using layered closure (n = 108), endeavouring to close the latter two incisions with a measured suture length to wound length ratio of greater than 4:1.
 After 18 months follow-up, no patient in the lateral paramedian group had developed an incisional hernia whereas 7 of 104 patients undergoing a midline incision with mass closure and 7 of 108 patients undergoing a midline incision with layered closure had incisional hernias (P less than 0.01).
 The mean suture length to wound length ratios for the three groups were 2.6 (range 1.3-6.2), 5.0 (range 3.0-8.7) and 3.7 (range 2.0-6.3) respectively (P less than 0.0001).
 The lateral paramedian incision remains superior to the midline incision closed with the mass technique and its integrity is independent of the suture length to wound length ratio.
