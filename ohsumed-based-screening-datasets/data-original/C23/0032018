A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to assess the side effects of medroxyprogesterone acetate in hormone replacement therapy.
 Cyclic progestin therapy has been widely advocated as an adjunct to postmenopausal estrogen replacement therapy to reduce the risk of endometrial carcinoma.
 Acceptance of this approach, however, appears to have preceded detailed evaluation of possible adverse side effects of progestins that could result in patient noncompliance.
 We evaluated the nonmenstrual physical and psychological side effects of oral medroxyprogesterone acetate given in conjunction with transdermal estrogen in two groups of women with previous hysterectomy and oophorectomy.
 Twenty-four women with prospectively documented severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) before surgery and 24 women with no such history of adverse premenstrual changes received transdermal estrogen 100 micrograms on days 1-25 and either oral medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg daily or an identical placebo (days 12-25) in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design.
 Mood and physical symptoms were monitored prospectively, using daily self-ratings on the Daily Symptoms Checklist.
 The Beck Depression Inventory and Premenstrual Tension Self-Rating Scale were completed on day 24.
 At the study's completion, the patients were asked which treatment period they preferred.
 Paired comparisons did not reveal any significant differences, and preference for treatment was equally divided between medroxyprogesterone acetate and placebo.
 We conclude that addition of medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg/day for 14 days to cyclic transdermal estrogen therapy (days 1-25) produces no consistent adverse physical or psychological effects on women for one cycle of treatment, regardless of their PMS history.
