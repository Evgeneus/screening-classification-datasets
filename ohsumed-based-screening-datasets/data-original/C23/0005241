Aortic replacement with composite grafts created with a sutureless intraluminal ringed prosthesis.
 From 1980 to 1988, 30 patients from a total population of 123 recipients of sutureless grafts (24%) have required aortic reconstruction with a composite ringed graft.
 Replacement of the ascending aorta was required in 12 patients, of the aortic arch in six patients, of the descending aorta in two patients, of the thoracoabdominal aorta in two patients, and of the abdominal aorta in eight patients.
 Eight patients (27%) needed an emergency operation at the time of admission.
 No patients had permanent neurologic or renal deficits.
 There was no evidence of pseudoaneurysm formation, graft erosion, graft migration, or aortic bleeding in the postoperative period.
 Two operative deaths (7%) occurred, both in patients undergoing arch reconstruction.
 Composite grafts can be created that vary in length and shape, incorporate different graft materials, and accommodate the aorta and its branches.
 The ability to modify the sutureless prosthesis to suit the disease encountered at operation allows the quickest repair with the least chance of anastomotic complication.
