Cochlear implants as a contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging.
 Magnetic resonance imaging poses little risk to the majority of patients undergoing scanning.
 However, cochlear implantation should pose a contraindication to this imaging process.
 This conclusion is based on several findings of in vitro testing of three cochlear implants: the 3M/House and 3M/Vienna designs and the Nucleus device.
 Specifically, tremendous torques are generated by each of these devices when they are introduced into the coil of a magnetic resonance imager; in addition, the 3M products not only were noted to induce an electrical current, but also were significantly magnetized and rendered afunctional.
 The clinical implications are discussed.
