Stereographic and stereometric study of sebaceous gland hyperplasia in rabbit pinnas induced by topically applied substances.
 Tetradecane (TD), testosterone (TS), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were separately inuncted on rabbit pinnas once a day; the pinnas were biopsied on days 1, 3, 7, and 28.
 Untreated pinnas and squalane-treated pinnas were used as controls.
 Three-dimensional images of sebaceous glands were reconstructed from their serial histologic sections using a computer-image analysis system.
 By stereometry, the sebaceous gland volumes gradually increased during the course of treatments with TS and DMSO, whereas the volumes of TD-treated sebaceous glands increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased.
 The acinus number was increased by all the substances, the DMSO-treated sebaceous glands on day 28 showing the largest number of acini.
 The volumes of individual acini increased until day 28 with TS treatment, whereas with TD and DMSO treatments they increased, reached the maximum on day 7, and then decreased.
 Stereographically, each untreated control sebaceous gland was composed of 20-30 pear-shaped acini.
 On day 28, acini of TS-treated sebaceous glands were swollen and ovoid in shape, DMSO-treated sebaceous glands resembled a bunch of grapes, and acini of TD-treated sebaceous glands were widely scattered and showed globular swelling arising from an elongated tube.
 Hyperplastic responses of sebaceous glands are quite different according to substances applied topically.
