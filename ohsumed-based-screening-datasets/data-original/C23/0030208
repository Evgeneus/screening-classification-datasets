Granulomatous renal mass during endovesical BCG therapy for bladder carcinoma. Diagnosis by fine-needle aspiration.
 One case of pseudotumoral granulomatous renal mass during endovesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy for superficial bladder neoplasm is reported.
 Such an adverse effect is exceptional and is clearly related to a vesicorenal reflux in our patient.
 In this case ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration was able to settle the diagnosis and avoid surgery.
 The patient responded to triple antituberculous therapy.
