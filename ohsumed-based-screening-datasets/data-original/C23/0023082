A prospective study of aspirin's effect on red blood cell loss in cardiac surgery.
 The effect of aspirin on red blood cell (RBC) loss and blood transfusions was evaluated prospectively in 100 consecutive patients, with normal bleeding times, undergoing elective coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery.
 Patients taking 85-325 mgm of aspirin daily up to or within 48 hours of surgery (the "aspirin" group) were compared to patients not taking aspirin or those who had discontinued aspirin at least 4 days before surgery (the "no-aspirin" group).
 RBC loss was determined by measuring preoperative and postoperative RBC volume using RISA and 51Cr techniques.
 There were no significant differences, respectively, between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups for: RBC loss (1158 +/- 67 ml vs 1129 +/- 47 ml, p = 0.737), chest tube drainage (925 +/- 31 ml vs 844 +/- 70 ml, p = 0.553), and gm% discharge Hemoglobin (Hgb) (9.94 +/- 0.32 vs 9.49 +/- 1.4, p = 0.0148).
 Strict criteria for blood transfusions were employed: (1) intraoperative hematocrit of less than 21%, (2) postoperative Hgb of less than 7 gm% for patients less than 70 years old and (3) postoperative Hgb of less than 8 gm% for patients greater than 70 years old.
 There were no significant differences, respectively, between the aspirin and no-aspirin groups for units of blood transfused (1.32 +/- vs 1.21 +/- 0.20, p = 0.843) and patients not receiving transfusions during the entire hospitalization (44% vs 50%).
 Patients taking 85-325 mgm of aspirin with a normal bleeding time undergoing elective CABG did not have increased RBC loss or increased transfusion requirements.
 These results indicate it is not necessary to delay elective CABG surgery for the purpose of discontinuing aspirin.
