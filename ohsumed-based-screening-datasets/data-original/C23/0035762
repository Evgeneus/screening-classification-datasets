Hemorrhagic cardioembolic stroke: is anticoagulation absolutely contraindicated?
 Hemorrhagic cerebral embolism should not be considered an absolute contraindication to immediate low-dose systemic anticoagulation.
 Low levels of anticoagulation may give some protection from recurrent embolism while minimizing the risks of intracranial bleeding.
 Until further studies are available, these decisions must be made on a case-by-case basis, supported by limited scientific information.
