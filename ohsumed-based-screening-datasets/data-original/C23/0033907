Nonoperative management of splenic injuries.
 The traditional management of splenic trauma has undergone major revision in recent years.
 Given the physiological importance of the spleen, certain controversy has arisen regarding the most appropriate method of managing this type of trauma.
 Nonoperative therapy in children has proven to be successful not only in the case of kidney lesions but also for splenic lesions.
 Nonoperative management carried out in the authors' hospital on a group of 56 patients (49 adults and seven children over the age of 7 years) has proved successful in 37 cases.
 The success of this technique requires a well-formulated protocol, diagnostic methods (ultrasound and computed tomography), rigorous patient control in the emergency room during the initial phase (first 48 hours), the availability of a medical team if surgical intervention becomes necessary (persistent or recurrent hemorrhage), and complementary measures which facilitate the cicatrization of the splenic injury (bed rest, antibiotic therapy).
