Use of hearing aids by patients with closed mastoid cavity.
 Twenty-five patients who had undergone a closed-cavity tympanomastoidectomy in our Unit and wore a hearing aid in the operated ear were reviewed, and information was recorded on the use of the aid, and the patients' impression about it.
 The information obtained was analysed and compared with similar data from 39 hearing aid users of similar age with no history of ear surgery.
 Eighty per cent of the patients with a closed mastoid cavity were satisfied with the aid, and no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding the impression about the aid (chi square 3.06, p = 0.08), or the problems with it, which, in most of the cases, were related to several changes of mould (chi square 2.19, p = 0.13).
 The various recorded parameters are discussed, and it is concluded that the patients with a closed mastoid cavity can tolerate a hearing aid in the operated ear at least as well as the control subjects with no ear surgery.
