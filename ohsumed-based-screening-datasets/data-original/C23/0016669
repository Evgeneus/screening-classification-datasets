Umbilical cord ulceration and intestinal atresia: a new association?
 In three fetuses, congenital intestinal atresia was associated with linear ulcerations of the umbilical cord.
 In two cases, hemorrhage was seen from the cord ulcer.
 Both fetuses required emergency cesarean section for fetal distress and were born anemic.
 The third fetus was mildly hydropic, attributed to hemorrhage, and was stillborn.
 The mechanism of the association could not be determined.
 These cases suggest a risk of prenatal umbilical cord hemorrhage in infants with intestinal atresia.
