Mycobacterial infections after renal transplantation.
 Mycobacterial infections occurred in 11 of 633 (1.7 per cent) recipients of successful renal transplants.
 There were no cases of tuberculosis in patients receiving chemoprophylaxis, but amongst those who did not receive prophylaxis disease occurred in six of the 27 (22 per cent) high-risk patients.
 The major cause of morbidity during treatment was renal allograft rejection, largely due to reduction in immunosuppressive drug therapy.
