Biliobiliary fistula: preoperative diagnosis and management implications.
 Experience with cholecystohepaticodochal and cholecystocholedochal fistulas as a result of an erosion of gallstones from the gallbladder into the adjacent common duct in five patients is presented.
 The incidence was 1.4% in a population of 350 patients undergoing cholecystectomy.
 The condition was indicated clinically on the basis of a symptom triad of jaundice, fever, and pain with cholelithiasis in a small contracted gallbladder.
 In addition, proximal intra- and extrahepatic ductal dilatation, calculus in the common duct, and normal-caliber (or unprofiled) distal common duct on ultrasound scan were present in all the patients.
 Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography proved to be the most useful means of investigation, and it confirmed the diagnosis in four patients before surgery.
 A modified antegrade cholecystectomy was performed with the gallbladder opened inferiorly at the fundus, and the stones were evacuated.
 A partial cholecystectomy and choledochoplasty were accomplished with gallbladder flaps whenever feasible.
 Other useful operative procedures are side-to-side hepaticodochojejunostomy and hepaticodochoduodenostomy.
 In the presence of high benign bile duct stricture, an approach to the left hepatic duct is now preferred for biliary bypass.
