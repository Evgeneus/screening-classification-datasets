Corpus callosotomy for intractable seizures in the pediatric age group.
 The results of corpus callosotomy in 18 patients 16 years old and younger are presented.
 Eighty-three percent of our patients have had a significant improvement from the surgery (a decrease in seizure frequency of greater than 80% or no longer having generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic seizures).
 The procedure seems to be well tolerated in young patients, and we have not noted a postoperative deterioration in behavior, memory, or language function in our patients.
 One of our patients died in status epilepticus 3 months after surgery.
 Nevertheless, we have not encountered any serious morbidity in our other patients.
 Corpus callosotomy can be considered for children with intractable seizures, especially when generalized atonic, tonic, or tonic-clonic (whether primary or secondary) seizures are the major seizure type.
