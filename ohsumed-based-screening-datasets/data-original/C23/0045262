Comparison of coronary and myocardial morphologic findings in patients with and without thrombolytic therapy during fatal first acute myocardial infarction. The TIMI Investigators.
 The hearts of 61 patients (39 men aged 64 +/- 11 years) who died from 5 hours to 42 days (median 3 days) after a fatal first acute myocardial infarction without having undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty or coronary bypass surgery were studied to compare clinical and cardiac morphologic features of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy with tissue-plasminogen activator (t-PA) to those not receiving thrombolytic therapy.
 Comparison of findings in the 23 patients who received t-PA intravenously 3 +/- 1 hours after onset of symptoms, with the 38 patients who did not, showed similar baseline characteristics with respect to: age, gender, history of hypertension; location of the infarct; heart weight; severity and numbers of coronary arteries narrowed; and frequencies of plaque rupture, plaque hemorrhage and coronary thrombi.
 Among the patients receiving t-PA, however, there was a greater frequency of platelet-rich (fibrin-poor) thrombi in the infarct-related coronary arteries (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), more nonocclusive than occlusive thrombi (6 of 11 vs 4 of 25 thrombi; p = 0.02), and a lower frequency of myocardial rupture (left ventricular free wall or ventricular septum) (5 of 23 [22%] vs 18 of 38 [46%]; p = 0.045).
