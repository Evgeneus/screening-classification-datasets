Intraoral-extramaxillary sinus approach for ligation of the maxillary artery: an anatomic study with clinical correlates.
 Surgical control of severe epistaxis is usually reserved for cases refractory to more conservative techniques.
 We present our experience with intraoral ligation of the maxillary artery as it courses through the buccal fat pad before it enters the pterygopalatine fossa and branches posterior to the maxilla.
 This technique has been found useful in the control of nasal hemorrhage as well as an adjunct to other surgical procedures, such as removal of benign and malignant neoplasms involving the maxilla and paranasal sinuses.
 This technique was used for ligation of the maxillary artery in 20 patients.
 The artery was readily identified in some cases, but required more extensive dissection in others; therefore, an anatomic study in 18 preserved and fresh cadaver specimens was undertaken to investigate the variability of the maxillary artery in the region of the buccal fat pad.
 There appeared to be significant variation in the distance from the buccal mucosal incision site, as well as variation in the relationship to the pterygoid muscles.
 This relationship to the pterygoids explains the occasional difficulty in locating the artery for ligation.
 This technique represents a reasonable alternative to the more traditional transantral approach to ligation of the maxillary artery, as long as the surgeon understands the anatomy of the region, its variations, and where the artery may be located if not immediately apparent.
 No major complications have been experienced.
