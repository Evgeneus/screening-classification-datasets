DNA damage in cultured human skin fibroblasts exposed to excimer laser radiation.
 Ultraviolet excimer lasers are being considered for use in a variety of refractive and therapeutic procedures, the long-term biologic consequences of which are unknown.
 The effect of sublethal doses of 193-nm laser radiation on cellular DNA was examined in cultured human skin fibroblasts.
 In contrast to 248 nm, treatments with the 193-nm laser radiation below 70 J/m2 did not cause significant pyrimidine dimer formation in the skin cells.
 This was indicated by the lack of excision repair activities (unscheduled DNA synthesis assay), and further demonstrated by direct analysis of pyrimidine dimers in DNA from irradiated cells.
 However, a low level of unscheduled DNA synthesis could be detected following irradiation at 193 nm with 70 J/m2.
 Both the 193-nm and 248-nm radiation were able to induce chromosomal aberrations, as indicated by a micronucleus assay.
 A dose-dependent increase in micronuclei frequency was observed 48 and 72 h after laser irradiation.
 These results indicate that exposure of actively replicating human skin fibroblasts to sublethal doses of either 193- or 248-nm laser radiation can result in genotoxicity.
