Choleriform syndrome and production of labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen by species of Salmonella infantis and Salmonella haardt isolated from the same patient.
 Isolates of Salmonella infantis from the stool and blood and an isolate of Salmonella haardt from the stool of a patient with choleriform diarrhea produced labile enterotoxin (CT/LT1)-like antigen.
 Genetic and molecular experiments indicated that the production of CT/LT1-like antigen was chromosomally encoded.
