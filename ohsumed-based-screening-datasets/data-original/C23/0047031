A clinical perspective on common forms of acquired heterotopic ossification.
 The clinical courses of heterotopic ossification (HO) as a consequence of trauma and central nervous system insults have many similarities as well as dissimilarities.
 Detection is commonly noted at two months.
 The incidence of clinically significant HO is 10%-20%.
 Approximately 10% of the HO is massive and causes severe restriction in joint motion or ankylosis.
 The most common sign and symptom are decreased range of motion and pain.
 The locations are the proximal limbs and joints.
 Sites of HO about a joint may vary according to the etiology of the HO.
 Roentgenographic evolution of HO occurs during a six-month period in the majority of patients.
 Treatment modalities include diphosphonates, indomethacin, radiation, range of motion exercises, and surgical excision.
 Surgical timing differs according to etiology: traumatic HO may be resected at six months; spinal cord injury HO is excised at one year; and traumatic brain injury HO is removed at 1.5 years.
 A small number of patients have progression of HO with medicinal treatment and recurrence after resection.
 The patients seem recalcitrant to present treatment methods regardless of the HO etiology.
