Chest infection following head and neck surgery: a pilot study.
 This paper reports the results of a pilot study which examined factors associated with chest infection following head and neck surgery.
 The overall rate of chest infection was 11%, but was 20% in those patients having a tracheotomy.
 No infection developed in patients with an intact airway.
 Other factors which emerged as possibly important were the duration of surgery and heavy regular alcohol intake.
 We recommend that prophylactic antibiotics be continued for at least 48 h in patients requiring a tracheotomy as part of their head and neck surgery.
 This is against the trend of shorter antibiotic regimens recommended for prevention of wound infections.
