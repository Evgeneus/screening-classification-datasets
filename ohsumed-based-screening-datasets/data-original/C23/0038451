Emergency medical services and the pediatric patient. III: Resources of ambulatory care centers.
 Ambulatory care centers have emerged as a new health care resource in many communities.
 Little information is available about the services that these centers offer to pediatric patients.
 A national survey of 254 ambulatory care centers was undertaken to determine their characteristics, including the number of pediatric patients seen, staffing patterns, and pediatric equipment and supplies available.
 Most clinics were located in urban areas and were within 5 miles of a hospital.
 They were staffed primarily by physicians who were board certified in emergency medicine, internal medicine, or family medicine.
 Not all centers had registered nurses on duty and few used extended-role nurses or physicians's assistants.
 The centers saw an average of 18 patients younger than 18 years of age per day.
 Some ambulatory care centers received emergency medical service and private ambulance calls and encountered serious illness such as chest pain, seizures, and anaphylaxis; the majority, however, handled mainly minor injuries and illnesses.
 Although most had pediatric equipment and supplies, some did not have a complete set of pediatric resuscitation equipment even though they were part of the emergency system offering care to the pediatric population.
