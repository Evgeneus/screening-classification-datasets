Postexposure prophylaxis with zidovudine suppresses human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection in SCID-hu mice in a time-dependent manner.
 Occupational exposure to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has led to a low but finite incidence of infection among health care providers.
 In such circumstances, postexposure administration of 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine; AZT) might be beneficial.
 To test this possibility, the SCID-hu mouse (the immunodeficient C.B-17 scid/scid mouse engrafted with human hematolymphoid organs) was treated with AZT at different times after intravenous infection with a standard dose of HIV (known to infect 100% of animals).
 If given within 2 h, AZT suppressed infection in all animals; if given after 2 days, no suppression was observed.
 At least in some animals, an AZT-sensitive phase lasted for as long as 36 h.
 These data support the hypothesis that prompt administration of AZT might be efficacious in suppressing acute HIV infection in humans.
 Further studies in the SCID-hu mouse might provide insight into treatment protocols of even greater efficacy.
