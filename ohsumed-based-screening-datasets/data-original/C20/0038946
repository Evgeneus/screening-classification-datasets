Measurement of maximal static respiratory pressures at the mouth with different air leaks.
 The effect of two different circuit leaks on the measurement of maximal static inspiratory and expiratory pressures at the mouth (Pimax, Pemax) was assessed in 70 patients with respiratory disease.
 Patients were divided into three groups with similar anthropometric and spirometric characteristics.
 The first group (30 patients) had their Pmax measured with a leak of 2.0 mm internal diameter (ID) and 37 mm length (as proposed by T.
 Ringqvist) and repeated with a second leak of 1.0 mm ID and 15 mm length (as recommended by J.
 L.
 Clausen).
 The two measurements were done in random order.
 Measurements for the other two groups (20 patients each) were taken with one or another, the two leaks randomly alternated with no leak.
 Pimax measurements obtained with Ringqvist's leak were 17 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with Clausen's leak and 22 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with no leak.
 Pemax measurements performed with Ringqvist's leak in place were 11 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those with Clausen's leak and 11 percent (p less than 0.005) lower than those obtained with no leak.
 The comparison between Clausen's leak and no leak showed no statistically significant difference.
 We conclude that whenever the effect of pressure generated in the mouth is to be avoided in the measurement of respiratory Pmax, a leak of the size proposed by Ringqvist is to be preferred.
