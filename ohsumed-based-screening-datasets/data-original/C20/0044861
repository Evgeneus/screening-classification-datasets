Utilizing lung sounds analysis for the evaluation of acute asthma in small children.
 One of the most difficult aspects of management of acute asthma in the small child is the clinician's inability to quantitate the response or lack of response to bronchodilator agents because of the inability of a child this age to perform objective lung measurements in the acute state.
 The present study was designed to evaluate bronchodilator responsiveness in children between 2 and 6 years of age with wheezing by means of a computerized lung sound analysis, computer digitized airway phonopneumonography.
 Children between ages 2 and 6 who were experiencing acute exacerbations of asthma were included in this study population.
 The 43 children were evaluated by physical examination, pulmonary function testing, if possible, by use of (spirometry or peak flow meter) and transmission of lung sounds to a computer using an electronic stethoscope to obtain a phonopneumograph with sound intensity level determinations during tidal breathing.
 A control group of 20 known asthmatic patients between the ages of 8 and 52 years who also presented to the office with acute asthma were evaluated similarly.
 In each of these individuals, a physical examination was followed by complete spirometry as well as computer digitized airway phonopneumonography recordings.
 Following initial measurements, all patients were treated with nebulized albuterol (0.25 mL in 2 mL of saline).
 Five minutes after completion of the nebulization all patients were reexamined and repeat pulmonary function tests were performed followed by CDAP recordings.
 In the study group of children, the mean pretreatment sound intensity level was 1,694 (range 557 to 4,950 SD +/- 745).
