Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: a pathologically documented case report.
 We report a patient with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in whom the acute onset of neurologic disorders and renal failure could be attributed to thrombotic microangiopathy.
 Clinical, biological, and pathological features were compatible with the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
 Such cases have been previously described, but histologically documented case reports are uncommon.
