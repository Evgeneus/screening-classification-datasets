Asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria in children.
 The clinical features, renal biopsy findings, and subsequent course in 53 children with asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria were studied retrospectively (1) to determine the prevalence of renal pathologic abnormalities among these children, (2) to identify those clinical characteristics that may enable recognition of children with an increased likelihood of having renal pathologic abnormalities, and (3) to assess the clinical course.
 All biopsy specimens were examined by light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy.
 Twenty-five patients (47%) had significant glomerular changes (15 had focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, 4 IgA nephropathy, 3 diffuse mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis without IgA deposition, and 3 membranous glomerulonephritis), and 28 had minimal glomerular changes.
 There were no differences between the patients with significant glomerular changes and those with minimal glomerular changes with regard to clinical and laboratory findings except for a predominance of boys in the former group.
 At the latest follow-up, seven patients with significant glomerular changes, but none with minimal glomerular changes, had chronic renal impairment.
 Because of the high incidence of significant glomerular changes and the high rate of progression to chronic renal impairment, we believe that a renal biopsy is indicated for a child with asymptomatic constant isolated proteinuria.
