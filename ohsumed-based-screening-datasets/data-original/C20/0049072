Prevalence of HIV-1 p24 antigenemia in African and North American populations and correlation with clinical status.
 Sera from 622 individuals and culture supernatants from three HIV-1 viral isolates were assayed for HIV-1 p24 antigen to investigate the frequency of p24 antigenemia in African and North American populations using three commercial HIV-1 p24 antigen assays (Coulter, Du Pont, and Abbott).
 The prevalence of p24 antigenemia in 89 hospitalized Zairian AIDS patients was significantly lower than in 47 clinically comparable AIDS patients in the USA (17 versus 48%, P less than 0.0001).
 Prevalence of p24 antigenemia in sera from 200 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected individuals was also lower in individuals from Zaire compared with 83 individuals in the USA (3.5 versus 7%).
 In African individuals, antigenemia prevalence increased with advanced clinical status: 8% in ambulatory AIDS patients, 17% in hospitalized AIDS patients and 18% in postmortem AIDS patients.
 Acid hydrolysis treatment of sera from 63 Zairian AIDS patients initially negative for p24 antigen showed an 11% positivity rate confirmed by neutralization, suggesting that immune complexing of p24 antigen may play a role in the observed lower p24 antigenemia rates reported for African individuals.
