Finnish type of familial amyloidosis: cosegregation of Asp187----Asn mutation of gelsolin with the disease in three large families 
 Familial amyloidosis of Finnish type (FAF) is one of the familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) syndromes, a group of inherited disorders characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid and by clinical symptoms and signs of polyneuropathy.
 FAF, an autosomal dominant trait, belongs to those rare monogenic disorders which occur with increased frequency in the Finnish population: only single FAF cases have been reported from other populations.
 In most types of FAP syndromes the accumulating protein is a transthyretin variant.
 However, recent evidence has suggested that the amyloid peptides in FAF are related to gelsolin, an actin modulating protein.
 The gelsolin fragments isolated from at least one patient with amyloidosis have been reported to have an amino acid substitution, with asparagine replacing aspartic acid at position 187 of the plasma gelsolin.
 In this study allele-specific oligonucleotides were used to analyze three large FAF families with multiple affected individuals as well as healthy family members.
 We found the corresponding G-A mutation in nucleotide 654 of the plasma gelsolin gene to cosegregate with the disease.
 The result was confirmed by sequencing and strongly suggests that the mutation has caused all the FAF cases of these families.
 Since the disease is clustered in restricted areas on the southern coast of Finland, this mutation most probably causes the majority, if not all, of FAF cases in Finland.
