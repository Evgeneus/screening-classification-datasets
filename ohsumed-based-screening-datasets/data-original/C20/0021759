Normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells manifest differential sensitivity to inhibitory effects of c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides: an in vitro study relevant to bone marrow purging.
 The c-myb protooncogene is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells, and its encoded protein, Myb, is required for hematopoietic cell proliferation.
 To analyze the relative Myb dependence of normal and leukemic human hematopoietic progenitor cells, normal bone marrow cells, several types of leukemic blast cells, and 1:1 mixtures of normal and leukemic cells were cultured in the presence of c-myb sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides; cell viability and cloning efficiency were then assessed.
 c-myb sense oligomers had negligible effects on normal and leukemic cells.
 In contrast, c-myb antisense oligomers strongly inhibited or completely abolished clonogenic growth of a T-cell leukemia line, 78% (18 of 23) of primary acute myelogenous leukemia cases examined, and 4 of 5 primary chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cases in blast crisis.
 In three of the latter patients, polymerase chain reaction analysis of a 1:1 mixture of c-myb antisense-treated normal and CML cells revealed a complete absence of bcr-abl expression, suggesting that the CML clonogenic units had been completely eliminated from the cultures.
 At antisense doses that inhibited leukemic cell growth, normal hematopoietic progenitor cells survived.
 Thus, normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells show differential sensitivity to the toxic effects of c-myb antisense DNA.
 Perturbation of c-myb function with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides might eventually form the basis for a molecular approach to leukemia therapy, perhaps most immediately as ex vivo bone marrow purging agents.
