Human immunodeficiency virus infection of enterocytes and mononuclear cells in human jejunal mucosa.
 Intestinal malabsorption is a recognized cause of malnutrition in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
 However, the relationships among human immunodeficiency virus infection, morphological changes in the intestine, and development of intestinal malabsorption are not well established.
 Nine patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus underwent tests of intestinal absorption and jejunal biopsies for morphometric measurements, enzyme assays, and virus detection by in situ hybridization.
 Steatorrhea and low lactase activities were found in more than 85% of the patients.
 All biopsy specimens were abnormal with reversal of the ratio of villus length to crypt depth in seven and enlarged enterocyte nuclear size in nine.
 Human immunodeficiency virus was detected in five jejunal biopsy specimens, within villus enterocytes of one patient who had the most severe malabsorption of the group and in four other biopsy specimens in mononuclear infiltrating cells of the lamina propria.
 These results suggest that human immunodeficiency virus infection of the small intestinal mucosa is an early event that is associated with altered enterocyte differentiation and function.
