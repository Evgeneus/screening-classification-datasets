Cells secreting anti-MAG antibody occur in cerebrospinal fluid and bone marrow in patients with polyneuropathy associated with M component.
 Occurrence and distribution of cells secreting antibodies against myelin associated glycoprotein (MAG) were studied in 9 patients with polyneuropathy associated with the monoclonal (M) component in serum.
 Utilizing an immunospot assay, we found that 4 of 7 patients with polyneuropathy associated with an IgM M component had cells secreting anti-MAG IgM antibody in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) numbering between 1 per 212 and 1 per 3333 mononuclear cells.
 All 7 patients had cells secreting anti-MAG IgM antibody in bone marrow (median value 1 per 2000 cells).
 In contrast, peripheral blood from only 2 of these patients contained low numbers of such cells.
 One patient with polyneuropathy associated with an IgA M component had cells secreting anti-MAG IgA antibody in CSF, and 1 with an IgG M component had cells secreting anti-MAG IgG antibody in CSF; both patients also had anti-MAG IgM antibodies detectable in CSF only by ELISA.
 These 2 patients may thus have concurrent intrathecal production of antibodies of 2 different isotypes which are directed against the same or different epitopes of MAG.
 The production of antibodies directed against a component of myelin occurring in the immediate vicinity of the peripheral nervous system might be involved in the pathogenesis of the polyneuropathy.
