Fifth disease and other parvovirus B19 infections.
 Parvovirus B19 is the etiologic agent in three diseases with clinically different presentations and implications.
 The first and most common disease is erythema infectiosum or fifth disease.
 Symptoms may vary somewhat between affected children and adults.
 A second type of presentation occurs in infected people who require a greater than normal replacement of red blood cells, and a third infection may affect a developing fetus.
 Because there is no effective treatment or vaccine, physicians and nurses should conscientiously observe universal precautions to avoid acquisition of B19 infection from patients.
