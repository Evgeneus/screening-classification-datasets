Transepithelial transport of HIV-1 by intestinal M cells: a mechanism for transmission of AIDS.
 This study was designed to determine whether human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) might enter the host by penetrating epithelial barriers through antigen-transporting M cells in lymphoid follicle-associated epithelia.
 Interaction of HIV-1 with epithelial cells was examined using mucosal explants from Peyer's patches of mice and rabbits.
 HIV-1 adhered to the luminal membranes of M cells of both species, and was endocytosed and delivered to intraepithelial spaces containing lymphocytes and macrophages.
 These observations suggest that M cells, which are numerous in the human rectal mucosa, may efficiently deliver HIV-1 to target cells in mucosal lymphoid tissue, and that such transport may contribute to sexual transmission of AIDS.
