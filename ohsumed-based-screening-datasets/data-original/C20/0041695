Perinatal human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Infection with HIV is rarely clinically apparent in the newborn period.
 At present, there is no satisfactorily sensitive and specific test to diagnose infection in the newborn nursery.
 Identification of women at risk for transmission of HIV to their infants and of infants at risk for vertically transmitted HIV infection, so that early diagnosis and treatment can be instituted, is the currently recommended approach.
