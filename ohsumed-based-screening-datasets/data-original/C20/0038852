Selection of primers of optimal sensitivity for the detection of HIV-1 from Africa and Europe by polymerase chain reaction.
 In order to facilitate the detection of integrated HIV-1 proviral DNA from African as well as European patients, four new primer pairs for use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), localised in the gag, pol, vif and env genes of HIV-1, were constructed.
 The primer pairs were compared to all accessible HIV-1 sequences from African and European isolates and to some of the earlier published and most commonly used primer pairs.
 HIV-1 DNA was detected in blood drawn from 13 out of 13 individuals infected in Africa, in three out of three Tanzanian HIV-1 isolates and in three out of three asymptomatic Swedes infected in Europe.
 The new selection of primer pairs can be used as an alternative to enhance the detection of HIV-1 of different origins.
