Formoterol, a new inhaled beta-2 adrenergic agonist, has a longer blocking effect than albuterol on hyperventilation-induced bronchoconstriction.
 The duration of effect of inhaled formoterol (24 micrograms) was compared with that of a placebo and that of inhaled albuterol (200 micrograms) in 12 adult asthmatic subjects who underwent hyperventilation tests with cold dry air (-20 degrees C) on 4 study days.
 On the control day, they were subjected to four hyperventilation tests to ensure functional stability.
 On the 3 remaining days, after a first hyperventilation test, they inhaled placebo, albuterol, or formoterol in randomized, double-blind fashion.
 The hyperventilation test was repeated 1, 4, and 8 h and, if the blocking effect was still present, 12 and 24 h after the drug had been administered.
 The dose of hyperventilation of cold air causing a 20% fall in FEV1 (PD20) was interpolated on the dose-response curve.
 The magnitude of the blocking effect at each time interval on each study day was assessed by comparing the changes in PD20 from baseline with the within-day variability of PD20 (standardized change in PD20).
 The acute bronchodilator effect was not significantly different as assessed 15 min (21 +/- 14% for albuterol and 18 +/- 18% for formoterol) and 1 h (20 +/- 13% for albuterol and 18 +/- 17% for formoterol) after administering the medication.
 The duration of the blocking effect, defined as the return to 2 SD from the standardized change in PD20, was significantly more prolonged for formoterol (8.0 +/- 3.4 h) than for albuterol (3.0 +/- 1.7 h) (t = 4.2, p less than 0.0001).
