The release of platelet-activating factor into plasma during allergen-induced bronchoconstriction.
 Plasma histamine and platelet-activating factor (PAF) were measured in six subjects with mild seasonal asthma before and after allergen-induced bronchoconstriction, and in six other patients with asthma before and after methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction.
 A significant increase in plasma histamine and PAF levels was found in patients with mild seasonal asthma after allergen-induced bronchoconstriction but not in patients with asthma after bronchoconstriction induced by methacholine.
 There was a significant correlation between the baseline plasma PAF levels and the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine.
 These findings suggests that PAF may be an important mediator in the pathogenesis of asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
