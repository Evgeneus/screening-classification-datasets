B-cell activation during HIV-1 infection. III. Down-regulating effect of mitogens.
 Spontaneous in vitro production of HIV-1-specific antibodies, a hallmark of infected subjects, is often down-regulated by the addition of pokeweed mitogen.
 We observed that a decrease in such ongoing anti-HIV-1 antibody synthesis could also be induced in cultures from most patients by addition of phytohemagglutinin and Concanavalin A, but not by Epstein-Barr virus, a selective B-cell mitogen.
 In most cases, this down-regulatory effect of mitogens was evident within the first 24 h of culture.
 The observed mitogen-associated decrease in spontaneous antibody synthesis was prevented by treating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with agents inhibiting non-major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic activity or by adding third-party cells to the cultures.
 In most cases, the mitogen-induced effect was also counteracted by removal of T lymphocytes or CD8+ T-cell sub-population.
 These findings recall a similar phenomenon observed in normal subjects following intentional immunization, and indicate that mitogen-induced down-regulation of spontaneous in vitro anti-HIV-1-antibody production most probably occurs through a lectin-dependent cytotoxic effect on activated B cells.
