Cryptococcal pleural effusion preceding cryptococcal meningitis in AIDS.
 The authors report a case in which a small cryptococcal pleural effusion preceded the development of severe cryptococcal meningitis in an HIV-positive patient.
 The appearance of an isolated transient pleural effusion is a very unusual presentation for AIDS-related complications.
 The authors suggest that cryptococcal infection be considered in this setting.
