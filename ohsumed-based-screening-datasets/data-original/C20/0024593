The AIDS epidemic in New York State.
 New York State has reported more AIDS cases (26,576) through November 1989 than any other state, accounting for 23 percent of all reported cases in the nation at the time.
 New York City has reported 22,231 (84 percent) of the statewide cases.
 The epidemiology of AIDS in New York State has been easily influenced by the large number of cases among IVDUs.
 Whereas intravenous drug use accounts for 16 percent of adult/adolescent cases in the rest of the nation, it accounts for 39 percent of the cases in New York State.
 Intravenous drug use is the leading exposure category among racial minorities, with a disproportionately high rate of cases among Blacks and Hispanics.
 The epidemic among women and children has also been severe, resulting from intravenous drug use by women, heterosexual transmission from drug users to women, and perinatal transmission to their children.
