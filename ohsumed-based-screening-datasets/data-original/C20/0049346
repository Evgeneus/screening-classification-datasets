Enteral feeding and infection in the immunocompromised patient.
 Evidence is accumulating that immunocompromised individuals are at an increased risk of infection from foodborne pathogens including Campylobacter jejuni, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp.
 Normal bacterial flora and contaminants of foods and enteral feeds can also result in nosocomial infection in susceptible individuals.
 Safe food handling, low-microbial diets, and measures to reduce bacterial contamination of enteral foods can reduce exposure to potential pathogens in the food supply.
