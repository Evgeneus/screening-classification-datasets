Retinoic acid enhances IL-1 beta expression in myeloid leukemia cells and in human monocytes.
 We have examined the role of retinoic acid (RA), the biologically active metabolite of vitamin A, in expression of the IL-1 beta gene in the human myeloid leukemia cell line THP-1 and in human monocytes.
 Both protein kinase C-activating phorbol esters, e.g., PMA, and LPS induce IL-1 beta expression in these cells.
 Physiologic RA concentrations alone were not able to induce any IL-1 beta production, but they strongly enhanced the PMA-induced IL-1 beta protein production and mRNA accumulation in both human monocytes and in THP-1 cells.
 Nuclear run-off analysis revealed that the enhancing effect was at the transcriptional level.
 RA also slightly potentiated LPS-induced IL-1 beta expression in THP-1 cells but not in human monocytes.
 These data suggest that RA can be a strong up-regulator of IL-1 production, but its strength varies depending on the nature of the activating signal.
