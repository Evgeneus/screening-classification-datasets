Mortality trends in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, 1983-1988.
 To assess changes in mortality in Abidjan since the development of the AIDS epidemic, we compared official city mortality statistics and hospital fatality rates in 1983, before AIDS was recognized in Abidjan, with those in 1988.
 Review of records in the city's major hospitals showed that fatality rates (deaths per 1000 admissions) in adult medical patients increased by 54% between 1983 and 1988, with increases of 106 and 98% in men 20-29 and 30-39 years of age, respectively, and 199 and 42% in women of the same age ranges.
 Mortality rates in surgical patients showed little change, while in children they declined.
 Over the same period, official mortality statistics for the city showed reduced mortality rates in children and women 20-29 years of age, but an increase in mortality rates of 54% in men 20 years of age and older, and of 28% in women aged 30 years and older.
 HIV infection may be a major cause of the increased adult mortality documented in hospital and city records, and jeopardizes improved survival from preventive measures such as maternal and child health services.
