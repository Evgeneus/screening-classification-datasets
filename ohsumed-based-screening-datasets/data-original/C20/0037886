Dissimilarity in methacholine and adenosine 5'-monophosphate responsiveness 3 and 24 h after allergen challenge.
 Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine and adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) was studied in 15 allergic asthmatic patients before and 3 and 24 h after allergen challenge with house dust mite (HDM).
 Subjects attended the clinic on 3 consecutive days.
 On the first day a control solution was inhaled, and methacholine or AMP challenge was performed 3 h later.
 The next day HDM was inhaled, and 3 and 24 h later methacholine or AMP challenge was performed again.
 There were no significant difference in FEV1 baseline value between any of the study days.
 PD20 HDM, percentage decrease in FEV1, and AUC for both the EAR and LAR were not significantly different in the methacholine and AMP studies.
 After HDM challenge, PC20 methacholine decreased significantly from a geometric mean (+/- SEM) starting value of 1.39 +/- 0.63 mg/ml to 0.30 +/- 0.78 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) at 3 h and to 0.22 +/- 0.75 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) at 24 h.
 The magnitude of the decrease in PC20 methacholine at 3 h correlated with the severity of the late asthmatic reaction (LAR) as measured by the percentage fall in FEV1 and area under the curve (AUC) (r = -0.60 and r = 0.55; p less than 0.05).
 A significant decrease was observed in the PC20 AMP at 3 h, from a geometric mean value of 12.2 +/- 0.96 mg/ml after challenge with the control solution to 4.47 +/- 0.99 mg/ml (p less than 0.05) after HDM challenge.
