Brain growth and cognitive improvement in children with human immunodeficiency virus-induced encephalopathy after 6 months of continuous infusion zidovudine therapy.
 The ventricular area at the level of the foramen of Monro was measured from axial x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans obtained prior to and 6 months after the initiation of continuous infusion of zidovudine (ZDV) in eight children with human immunodeficiency virus-induced encephalopathy.
 Evidence of moderate to severe central atrophy was present on initial CT scans (p less than 0.05).
 Ventricular area and ventricular brain area ratio (VBR) decreased after ZDV therapy in seven of eight children (mean decrease of 21.5 and 20%, respectively, p less than 0.05).
 The degree of decrease in VBR correlated with reductions in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration (r = 0.93, p less than 0.01), but not lymphocyte T4 or T8 counts.
 Intelligence quotients (IQs) improved in all seven children tested (mean improvement of 17.7%, p less than 0.01) and correlated significantly with reductions in CSF protein concentration (r = -0.85, p = 0.003).
 The magnitude of IQ changes was not significantly correlated with the magnitude of changes in ventricular area.
 We conclude that the cognitive improvement of HIV encephalopathy seen after 6 months of continuous infusion of ZDV is accompanied by reduction in brain atrophy and decreased CSF protein, suggesting an ameliorating effect of ZDV on the pathogenesis of AIDS encephalopathy in children.
