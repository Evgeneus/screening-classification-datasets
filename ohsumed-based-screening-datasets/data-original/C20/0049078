Recognition of poliovirus/HIV chimaeras by antisera from individuals with HIV infection.
 The neutralization of five poliovirus/HIV chimaeras by serum from HIV-infected individuals was examined to evaluate the presentation of HIV envelope sequences, to assess the immune response of individuals to specific epitopes, and to relate it to the stage of disease.
 The sera were unable to differentiate between four of the chimaeras and the Sabin vaccine strain.
 With a fifth construct containing an immunodominant gp41 sequence, significant differential recognition was observed in approximately 67% of individuals with asymptomatic HIV infection [groups II and III of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) classification of HIV infection] and 37% of patients with symptomatic disease (CDC group IV).
 Furthermore, among patients with CDC stage IV disease antibody levels against this construct and the titre achieved decreased with progression to further disease from approximately 40% in AIDS-related complex (ARC) patients (CDC group IVA and IVC-2 to 14% in those with AIDS (other group IV diseases).
 Loss of antibody to this construct did not result from a reduction in the anti-polio or anti-envelope response, but from a decline in antibody levels to the HIV sequence inserted in antigenic site 1.
