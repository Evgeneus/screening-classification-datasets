Cytokeratin expression and vimentin content in large cell anaplastic lymphomas and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
 The immunophenotypes of 74 malignant lymphomas (9 Hodgkin's disease, 19 low-grade B-cell, 20 high-grade B-cell, 8 T-cell, and 18 large cell anaplastic lymphomas [LCAL]) have been characterized with antibodies against leucocyte differentiation antigens, keratin, and vimentin.
 All the non-LCAL were CD45 positive and keratin negative.
 The LCALs had a more varied immunophenotype, with CD45 present only in 11 of 18 cases and keratin present in 5 of 18 of these rare lymphomas.
 The lymphoid origin of these latter cases was proven by gene rearrangement studies.
 All LCALs were CD30+, and, where tested, vimentin positive.
 Of four different vimentin monoclonal antibodies tested, V9 and MVI stained the highest number of lymphomas.
 Positive staining of tumor cells was seen in 61 of 71 cases.
 Vimentin-negative cases included Burkitt's as well as some follicular lymphomas.
