Large cell orbital lymphoma in a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Case report and review 
 Despite the protean ocular manifestations of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), orbital involvement is rare and only one previous case of orbital non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) has been documented.
 We report a second case of NHL (large cell) of the orbit in a 28-year-old patient with a 4-year history of AIDS and review the context in which this lesion presented.
