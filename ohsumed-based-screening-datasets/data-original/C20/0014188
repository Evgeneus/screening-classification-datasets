Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis in two neutropenic patients.
 Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is an uncommon, self-limited dermatosis with a variable clinical presentation.
 It seems to be due to chemotherapeutic drugs in most cases.
 Necrosis of the eccrine gland associated with a neutrophilic infiltrate is the histologic hallmark of this disease.
 We report two additional cases in neutropenic patients with acute myelogenous leukemia in which there was a striking lack of neutrophil infiltration.
 A new term, drug-associated eccrine hidradenitis, is suggested.
