The safety and pharmacokinetics of GLQ223 in subjects with AIDS and AIDS-related complex: a phase I study 
 A phase I dose-escalation study was performed to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of a single intravenous infusion of GLQ223 in subjects with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC).
 The active ingredient in GLQ223 is trichosanthin.
 Trichosanthin, imported from China, is the active drug in community-initiated treatment programs for patients with HIV infection.
 Eighteen subjects were enrolled, 10 with AIDS and eight with ARC.
 All subjects were monitored for tolerance and toxicity.
 Immunological and virological parameters were also followed.
 GLQ223 administration was not associated with notable toxicity with the exception of one subject who experienced a severe neurological adverse reaction.
 No consistent or sustained changes in CD4+ lymphocyte populations or HIV antigen levels were observed.
 Serum concentrations of GLQ223 that were comparable to concentrations shown to have antiviral activity in vitro were achieved transiently but may not have been maintained for a sufficient duration to exert antiretroviral effects.
 Further studies are indicated to determine pharmacodynamic properties of GLQ223, its optimal dosing schedule, and whether GLQ223 or related molecules will be useful in the treatment of HIV infection.
