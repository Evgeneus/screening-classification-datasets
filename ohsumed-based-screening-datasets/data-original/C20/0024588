Projection of AIDS incidence in women in New York State.
 The results of the Newborn HIV Seroprevalence Study in New York State for 1988 were used to estimate the number of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women of childbearing age in 1988.
 The estimate was accomplished for each of 80 age, racial/ethnic, and geographic strata by dividing the number of seropositive newborns by the 1988 estimated fertility rate.
 Summing across strata yielded a total of 23,430 infected women age 15 to 44 years in 1988.
 From this estimate a tree model was used to estimate the number of women infected during 1981-88.
 Back calculation was used to distribute these infections over time, and the selected incubation distribution was used to estimate future AIDS cases for this population: 8,295 cases by 1993.
