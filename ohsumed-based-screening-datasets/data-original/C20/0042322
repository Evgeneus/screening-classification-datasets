Evidence for molecular subtypes of HIV-associated lymphoma: division into peripheral monoclonal, polyclonal and central nervous system lymphoma.
 The pathogenesis of the HIV-associated lymphomas is not well understood.
 In order to begin characterizing this class of lymphoma, we initiated a molecular genetic study of DNA extracted from 31 diagnostic biopsy specimens from patients diagnosed with AIDS-associated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Analysis of 25 peripheral lymphomas showed that 14 were monoclonal B-cell processes, while 11 appeared to be of polyclonal origin.
 Five of the 14 monoclonal lymphomas were found to have rearrangements of the c-myc gene.
 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) genomes were found in seven out of 14 monoclonal samples, but only two out of nine polyclonal samples.
 The six primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma samples were more homogeneous than the peripheral samples and all were monoclonal, positive for EBV and lacked detectable c-myc gene rearrangements.
 This study allows us to subdivide the HIV-associated lymphomas into three major molecular subtypes: (1) monoclonal B-cell process frequently associated with c-myc rearrangement or detectable EBV genomes, (2) polyclonal B-cell process typically without evidence of EBV, and (3) monoclonal primary CNS process associated with EBV genomes and lacking detectable c-myc rearrangement.
