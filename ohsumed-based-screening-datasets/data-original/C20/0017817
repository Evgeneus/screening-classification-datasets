Pulmonary tolerance of prophylactic aerosolized pentamidine in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.
 The effects of primary and secondary long-term prophylaxis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia with aerosolized pentamidine on pulmonary function in HIV+ patients were evaluated.
 Eighty-one patients, none of whom were drug addicts or had pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma, were studied.
 Fifty patients were receiving AP as secondary prophylaxis, 36 monthly and 14 twice-monthly; eight patients with a history of PCP served as control subjects.
 Twenty-three patients were receiving AP as primary prophylaxis, 12 monthly and 11 twice-monthly.
 Pulmonary function tests, including spirometry, lung transfer capacity for carbon monoxide (Tlco) and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient (P[A-a]O2) were evaluated at M1, ie, one month after the diagnosis of PCP, or at the beginning of the AP prophylaxis, and then at three-month intervals (M4 to M13).
 No differences were observed in the results of spirometry or P(A-a)O2.
 Among the patients receiving secondary prophylaxis, a significant increase (paired Student's t-test) in Tlco occurred at M7 compared to M1 in the group receiving monthly administrations (p less than 0.01) and in the untreated control group (p less than 0.05); there was no significant difference in Tlco at M13 compared to M1 in the 12 patients who received monthly administrations for this period or at M7 in the 14 patients receiving AP twice-monthly.
 No significant difference in Tlco was observed at M7 in the primary prophylaxis groups.
 These results indicate that pulmonary tolerance of AP, as reflected by pulmonary function tests, is good.
