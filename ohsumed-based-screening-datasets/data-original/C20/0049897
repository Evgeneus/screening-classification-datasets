The infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy.
 The otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon is frequently consulted to evaluate patients before the administration of myelosuppressive cancer chemotherapy.
 Fifty consecutive patients treated at the University of Pennsylvania Oncology Center were studied before and during chemotherapy for adult leukemia or bone marrow transplantation.
 Otolaryngic history, physical examination, radiographic studies, and hematologic surveys were analyzed for the duration of therapy in an attempt to identify risk factors for infectious and hematologic otolaryngic complications.
 Two-thirds of the patient studied experienced untoward effects that required the further attention of an otolaryngologist-head and neck surgeon.
 The various complications and associated correlations with the study parameters before and during chemotherapy are discussed.
