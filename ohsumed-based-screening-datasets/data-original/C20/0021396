The naive repertoire of human T helper cells specific for gp120, the envelope glycoprotein of HIV.
 The envelope glycoprotein of HIV gp120 is a T cell Ag in experimental animals and in humans infected with HIV or deliberately immunized with gp120 in various forms.
 Inasmuch as T cell responses result from the interaction of Ag processed and presented by APC with the unprimed T cell repertoire, we have investigated the human T cell repertoire specific for gp120 in seronegative, normal individuals.
 T cell lines and clones specific for HIV gp120 were generated by repeated in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes with gp120-pulsed APC, followed by IL-2 expansion.
 We observed that the T cell response to whole gp120 involved single restricted immunodominant epitopes in gp120 that differ between responding individuals.
 Focusing of the response to limited regions of gp120 when the whole Ag is used for priming suggests that one or more adjacent epitopes are immunodominant and mask responses to "immunorecessive" epitopes.
 We have been able to generate primary in vitro responses to recessive epitopes by stimulation in vitro with synthetic peptides of gp120.
 The results indicate that a much broader T repertoire can be detected when individual peptides are used for priming in vitro rather than gp120.
 This information has important implications for the development of vaccination protocols aimed at eliciting diverse immune responses to "immunorecessive" regions of envelope glycoprotein.
