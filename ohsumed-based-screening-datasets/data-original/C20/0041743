Bee venom anti-idiotypic antibody is associated with protection in beekeepers and bee sting-sensitive patients receiving immunotherapy against allergic reactions.
 Bee venom (BV) anti-idiotypic (anti-Id) antibodies (Abs) were studied in nonreactive beekeepers, patients receiving BV immunotherapy (IT), and in patients with bee-sting hypersensitivity.
 Detection of serum anti-BV was determined either by the Phadebas RAST test for IgE and IgG concentrations or by isoelectric focusing followed by capillary blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes.
 Clonotypic analyses of Ab were made with specific probes for BV or BV anti-Id; 13/14 nonreactive multiple-sting beekeepers (93%; p = 0.00006) and 3/3 patients receiving BV IT (100%; p = 0.0026) had detectable amounts of BV anti-Id in serum, whereas five BV-sensitive patients (0%) and four ragweed-sensitive control patients (0%) did not.
 Beekeeper's serum containing BV anti-Id was found to recognize and bind to IgE anti-BV idiotype from two different patient sources and inhibit their reactions in a Phadebas RAST test in a dose-dependent manner.
 Nonreactive beekeepers generally had BV-specific IgE levels less than 0.35 PRU/ml in serum with detectable BV anti-Id.
 BV-allergic patients before IT had elevated BV-specific serum IgE levels, even in the presence of BV-specific IgG greater than 136 U/ml with no BV anti-Id present.
 These findings provide strong support for a protective role of BV anti-Id against bee sting--allergic reactions.
