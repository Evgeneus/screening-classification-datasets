T-lymphocyte dysfunctions occurring together with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies.
 Gut epithelial cell autoantibodies have been considered a hallmark of autoimmune enteropathy, a disorder occurring in children with protracted diarrhea of unknown etiology.
 Four patients (two male and two female) with such autoantibodies were studied.
 Immunofluorescence analysis showed two different disjunctive staining patterns: complement-fixing apical (three of four) and cytoplasmic (the remaining fourth one), which are shown to be directed against different structures.
 All three patients positive for complement-fixing apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies had abnormal T-cell responses in vitro, one of them with an immunoglobulin G2 immunoglobulin deficiency and another with an immunoglobulin A deficiency.
 An immunoglobulin A deficiency without T-cell alterations was also diagnosed in the cytoplasmic gut epithelial cell autoantibody-positive patient.
 These findings suggest that different immunologic alterations (either a T-cell abnormality or immunoglobulin deficiency) may favor the appearance of gut epithelial cell autoantibodies (complement-fixing apical or cytoplasmic, respectively).
 Furthermore, these autoantibodies should not be considered a specific marker of autoimmune enteropathy, because they may not always be associated with such a disease: two patients with apical gut epithelial cell autoantibodies showed no signs of intestinal lesion or diarrhea.
