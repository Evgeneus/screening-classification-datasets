Oral melanotic macules in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
 A group of 217 patients seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were studied for 2 years, during which time pigmented lesions of the oral mucosa developed in 14 (6.4%) of them.
 The lesions were well circumscribed in some cases and diffuse in others.
 In some patients the macules enlarged or recurred after surgical excision.
 In two patients the macules appeared during the administration of zidovudine.
 Clinical and laboratory evidence of adrenal insufficiency was not detected in any of the patients examined.
 The histologic appearances were those of melanotic macules.
 No ultrastructural alterations of the melanocytes were observed.
 Two of these macules also contained Epstein-Barr virus, and in one case normal oral mucosa was examined and also contained Epstein-Barr virus in the epithelial cells.
 As a control group we examined 180 health care workers who did not belong to any risk category, and 30 intravenous drug abusers who tested seronegative to HIV.
 Oral melanotic pigmentation was found in eight of the control subjects (3.6%).
 The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.3097).
 Our study shows that oral macules do not occur more frequently in HIV-infected patients.
 However, the clinical behavior of these lesions appears to be different during the course of HIV infection.
 In some HIV-infected patients the cause of the macules might relate to the administration of zidovudine and antifungal or antibacterial drugs.
 In others the cause remains unknown and could be due to multiple factors.
