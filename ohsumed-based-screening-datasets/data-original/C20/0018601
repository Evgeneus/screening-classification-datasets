Fibromyalgia in human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Tenderness was assessed by point count and by scored palpation in 51 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as well as 51 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 50 patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
 Fifteen of 51 (29%) patients with HIV infection met criteria for fibromyalgia, based on the presence of 10 tender (of 14) "fibrositic" points.
 Similar results were observed among patients with PsA (24%).
 The prevalence of fibromyalgia was higher among patients with RA (57%).
 Patients with HIV and PsA were less tender than patients with RA.
 Fibromyalgia in patients with HIV was significantly associated with myalgia and arthralgia, but not with age, duration of HIV infection, stage of HIV disease, or zidovudine therapy.
