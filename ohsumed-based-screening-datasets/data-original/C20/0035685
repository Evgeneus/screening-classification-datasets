Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma in patients with AIDS: scintigraphic diagnosis with sequential thallium and gallium scanning.
 Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is difficult to diagnose because the clinical presentations and radiographic findings are nonspecific.
 The authors report three proved cases of AIDS-associated pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma diagnosed with sequential thallium and gallium scans.
 These scans demonstrated abnormal increase of pulmonary thallium uptake, whereas the gallium uptake was negative.
 In the authors' experience and in reports in the radiology literature, infected areas of the chest are generally thallium-negative on the delayed (3-hour) scans but are gallium-avid, whereas lymphomas are both thallium- and gallium-avid.
 The authors conclude that sequential thallium and gallium scans can be used to help diagnose pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma and distinguish it from other common AIDS-associated chest complications such as lymphoma and infections.
