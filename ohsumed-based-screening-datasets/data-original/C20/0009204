The course of the HIV epidemic among intravenous drug users in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
 To determine if behavioral changes in intravenous drug users in Amsterdam have retarded the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) epidemic in this group in recent years, we report that: HIV-antibody seroprevalence in annual samples of injectors has been constant over the years 1986-89; HIV-antibody incidence in a cohort of injectors appears to have decreased from 1986 to 1987 and stabilized after that until 1989; acute hepatitis B incidence in all drug users in Amsterdam declined rapidly between 1985-89.
 It is concluded that changes in drug use behavior so far appear to have resulted in a stabilization of the epidemic among injectors, at a level with a still disturbingly high incidence rate of 5-6 per 100 person-years.
