In vitro maturation of mononuclear phagocytes and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection.
 In the present report, we have studied the in vitro transition of normal blood monocytes to macrophages by changes in cell morphology, and the expression of surface antigens with a panel of monoclonal antibodies.
 The maturation process was accompanied by notable changes in cell-surface markers in a time-dependent manner.
 The percentage of cells expressing CD11c, ICAM-1, HLA-DR, and Fc receptor class III increased while the CD4 and CD35 expression was markedly decreased.
 After demonstrating that in vitro monocytes mature to macrophages in a recognizable manner, we studied the susceptibility to HIV-1 infection at time points representing different stages of cell maturation.
 The results show that monocyte/macrophages are susceptible to HIV-1 infection at all stages of differentiation.
 However, the kinetics of virus replication depends on the degree of maturation at the time of infection.
 Two major patterns of replication were observed: Infection of monocytes resulted in efficient virus production measurable by reverse transcriptase activity in culture supernatant, whereas infection of fully differentiated macrophages yielded low but sustained virus release only demonstrable by p24 antigen assay.
 We were not able to detect differences in the capacity of the virus to infect and replicate in monocyte/macrophages with respect to cellular origin of the virus isolate and whether the viruses were laboratory-adapted strains or low-passaged patient isolates.
