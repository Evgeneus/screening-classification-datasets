Autoantibodies to nucleolar antigens in systemic scleroderma: clinical correlations.
 Indirect immunofluorescence(IIF) and double immunodiffusion (DID) were performed on the sera of 64 patients who had a nucleolar immunofluorescence pattern on HEp-2 cells.
 Forty-nine of the sera were from 296 patients with systemic scleroderma (SSc) and 15 sera were from 214 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
 A homogeneous nucleolar staining pattern was found in 45 of the 64 sera (70.3%), a clumpy fluorescence associated with fibrillarin antibody in 14 (21.8%) and a speckled pattern was found in five of the sera (7.8%).
 There was a clear correlation between the sera which showed a homogeneous nucleolar staining pattern with symptoms of the polymyositis/scleroderma overlap syndrome that differed from SSc with concomitant myositis.
 The clumpy pattern was mainly associated with diffuse scleroderma and the speckled pattern with limited scleroderma (previously called acrosclerosis).
