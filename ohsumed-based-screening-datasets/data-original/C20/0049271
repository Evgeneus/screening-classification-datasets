Gene rearrangement in B- and T-lymphoproliferative disease detected by the polymerase chain reaction.
 Gene rearrangement and monoclonality have been detected in normal cells and in lymphoproliferative disease by using the polymerase chain reaction and primers for the V and J regions of the Ig heavy chain gene or T-cell receptor gamma-chain gene.
 Using the Ig primers monoclonality was detected in 20 of 20 normal B-lymphocyte clones and in 39 of 52 cases of various types of B-lymphoproliferative disease, but not in 11 cases of T-lymphoproliferative disease.
 Using the T-cell receptor primers, monoclonality was detected in 186 of 192 normal T-lymphocyte clones, in 11 of 11 cases of T-lymphoproliferative disease, in 9 of 12 cases of B-acute lymphocytic leukemia, and in 1 of 21 cases of B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, but not in nine cases of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia nor in 10 cases of myeloma.
 Monoclonality was detected in material obtained by lymph node aspiration in four of six additional cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 It was not detected in 10 cases of acute myeloid leukemia nor in four cases of reactive lymphadenopathy.
 Detection of gene rearrangement by the polymerase chain reaction has a number of advantages over Southern blotting and is likely to become the initial diagnostic technique of choice to detect monoclonality.
