Edematous pancreatitis associated with intravenous pentamidine.
 A 37-year-old black man with presumed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who was treated with systemic IV pentamidine had fatal pancreatitis and massive hepatomegaly.
 Fatal pancreatitis can occur with no hemorrhagic changes seen at autopsy.
 Awareness of the relationship between pentamidine and pancreatitis should be emphasized.
 With current clinical trials testing other routes of administration, fatal complications associated with IV pentamidine therapy will be minimized.
