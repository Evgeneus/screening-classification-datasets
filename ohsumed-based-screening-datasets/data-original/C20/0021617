Possible health care professional-to-patient HIV transmission. Dentists' reactions to a Centers for Disease Control report.
 On July 27, 1990, the Centers for Disease Control reported possible transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from a dentist to a patient as a result of patient care.
 We surveyed a random national probability sample of 300 dentists with a 26-item survey in August and September 1990 to assess reactions to the report (response rate, 59%).
 Respondents tended not to believe the report (mean was 3.2, median 3.0, where 1 indicated "do not believe" and 7 indicated "believe").
 Our sample also tended to believe that transmission of HIV from dentists to patients was unlikely in the future (mean was 2.0, median 2.0, where 1 indicated "not at all likely" and 7 indicated "very likely").
 Fifty-one percent of our sample recommended that dentists infected with HIV should discontinue practice, while 38% recommended continuing practice with changes in procedures.
 Seventy-four percent believed patients should be told if their dentist was infected with HIV.
 In summary, dentists doubted the possibility of dentist-to-patient transmission of HIV and did not believe the Centers for Disease Control case report, but they did believe infected dentists should refrain from clinical work or modify their practice.
