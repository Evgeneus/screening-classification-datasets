Chronic Cryptosporidium parvum infections in congenitally immunodeficient SCID and nude mice.
 Severe combined immune deficient (SCID) and athymic National Institutes of Health (NIH)-III (bg/nu/xid) mice were evaluated for susceptibility to Cryptosporidium parvum infections as neonates and as adults after challenge with inocula of 5 x 10(4) and 1 x 10(6) oocysts/mouse, respectively.
 SCID and NIH-III nude mice developed chronic infections that persisted over 12 weeks.
 Cryptosporidial organisms were observed in the small and large intestines of all mice.
 Colonization of the gallbladder and hepatobiliary duct epithelium occurred in a majority of the NIH-III nude mice and a smaller number of the SCID mice.
 Severe infections in both mouse strains were associated with clinical deterioration followed by death.
 Signs in these mice included dehydration, icterus, and emaciation.
 Deaths apparently resulted from hepatic dysfunction.
 Control mice experienced transient infections with no clinical signs.
 Immunodeficient mice should prove useful in studies of disease pathogenesis and in evaluating potential anticryptosporidial agents.
