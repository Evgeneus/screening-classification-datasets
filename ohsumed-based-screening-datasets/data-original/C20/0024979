Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is exacerbated by IL-1 alpha and suppressed by soluble IL-1 receptor.
 To assess the role of IL-1 in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the effects of in vivo treatment with IL-1 alpha or an IL-1 antagonist on the clinical course of EAE were evaluated.
 First, Lewis rats were immunized with guinea pig myelin in CFA and treated for 19 consecutive days with i.p.
 injections of recombinant human IL-1 alpha.
 Clinical signs of paralysis in the IL-1 alpha-treated groups were of longer duration and of greater severity compared to placebo injected controls.
 In addition, more weight loss was observed in the IL-1 alpha-treated groups compared to controls.
 This enhanced weight loss was not due to IL-1 alpha injections alone as CFA-treated rats injected with IL-1 alpha did not lose weight when compared to placebo injected, CFA-treated controls.
 Second, soluble mouse rIL-1R (sIL-1R), which binds both IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta, was given as an IL-1 antagonist.
 Treatment of guinea pig myelin/CFA immunized rats with sIL-1R for 13 consecutive days significantly delayed the onset of EAE, reduced the severity of paralysis and weight loss, and shortened the duration of disease.
 Treatment with sIL-1R was most effective in reducing EAE if administered for 15 consecutive days immediately after immunization.
 Shortened 5-day treatment regimens spanning days 1 to 5, days 6 to 10, or days 11 to 15 after immunization were less effective in reducing EAE.
 These data suggest that IL-1 may initiate or promote inflammation within the central nervous system.
 In addition, specifically blocking the biological activity of IL-1 in vivo by soluble receptors may prove beneficial for the treatment of autoimmune or inflammatory diseases.
