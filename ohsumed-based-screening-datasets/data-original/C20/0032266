Approaches to immunotoxicologic studies with emphasis on chemical-induced immunomodulation.
 Immunotoxicology has developed into a subdiscipline of toxicology in a tradition similar to other subdisciplines of toxicology.
 The use of experimental animals to determine the potential for chemicals to alter the structure and function of the immune system represents a significant part of this subdiscipline.
 This manuscript describes approaches to assessment of chemical-induced modification of immune status and key issues in interpreting the data for risk assessment.
