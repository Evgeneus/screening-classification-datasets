A case of classical mycosis fungoides associated with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I.
 A 72-year-old male patient from north-eastern Iran developed the typical clinical and histopathological features of mycosis fungoides with lymphadenopathy, but without any other systemic involvement.
 Human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV-I) antibodies were detected in the patient's serum by two different ELISAs and by Western blot using purified viral particles from MT-2 culture supernatants.
 Cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes were positive for labelling with anti-HTLV-I serum.
 Southern blot hybridization of DNA extracted from a skin tumour and from an involved lymph node revealed integrated proviral DNA with identical restriction patterns.
 This case supports a relationship between mycosis fungoides and HTLV-I and may indicate a new region of endemic HTLV-I infection.
