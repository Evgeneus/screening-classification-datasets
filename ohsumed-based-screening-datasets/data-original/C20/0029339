Virus burden in human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected children: relationship to disease status and effect of antiviral therapy.
 The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) was isolated from the plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from each of 21 infected children.
 The mean titers in plasma were 7 and 165 tissue culture-infective doses per milliliter in 9 children with asymptomatic (P-1) and 12 with symptomatic (P-2) infection, respectively (P = .0013).
 Significantly higher viral titers were found in PBMCs obtained from P-2 compared with P-1 children: 1920 vs 25 tissue culture-infective doses per 10(6) PBMC (P = .0018).
 In symptomatic patients at least 1 in 520 circulating mononuclear cells harbored HIV-1.
 No correlation was found between the viral burden and CD4+ lymphocyte counts.
 A decrease in the HIV-1 titers was noted both in PBMCs and plasma of symptomatic patients treated with zidovudine for 2 to 7 months.
 It is concluded that symptomatic children harbor a higher amount of the virus in plasma and PBMCs than asymptomatic children.
 Zidovudine treatment for 2 months or more decreased the amount of HIV-1 in PBMCs and plasma.
