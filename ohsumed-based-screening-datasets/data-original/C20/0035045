Vaccine protection against HIV-2 infection in cynomolgus monkeys.
 The aim of this study was to determine if protection against an infectious human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) challenge could be obtained in cynomolgus macaques by active immunization using whole killed virus vaccine.
 Four monkeys were immunized with killed HIV-2SBL-6669, two of them with five intramuscular (im) injections of viral preparation containing 100 or 300 micrograms protein emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) and the two remaining received four im injections of 25-50 micrograms viral protein in iscoms.
 Each of the four vaccinated cynomolgus monkeys, along with four unvaccinated controls, were challenged intravenously two weeks after the last booster with approximately 100 animal infectious doses (ID50) of live HIV-2SBL-6669.
 All four immunized monkeys developed antibodies to HIV-2 envelope and core proteins before challenge exposure to HIV-2, but only the two animals vaccinated with virus in IFA developed detectable neutralizing antibodies.
 The two monkeys immunized with killed virus in IFA have shown no evidence of infection nine months after challenge with live virus.
 When blood and lymph node cells from these animals were transfused into naive cynomolgus monkeys, the recipients remained free of infection.
 In contrast, virus was recovered repeatedly in all nonimmunized animals and in the two animals immunized with iscom-associated viral antigens, which had a low content of envelope gp125 antigen.
 The demonstration of vaccine-induced protection against HIV-2 in a nonhuman primate raises hope for effective immunization against HIV infections in humans as well.
