Rapidly progressive calcific periarthritis occurring in a patient with lupus nephritis receiving chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 We present a patient who developed rapidly progressive calcific periarthritis while receiving chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.
 She developed chronic renal failure on the basis of lupus nephritis.
 Hydroxyapatite crystals were isolated from periarticular deposits and identified using phase contrast light microscopy and electron microscopy.
 Conservative management using phosphate binding agents and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs was unsuccessful and lesions were excised surgically.
