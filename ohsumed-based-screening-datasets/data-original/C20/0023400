Public knowledge about AIDS: a survey of dental school patients. Part II.
 Responses to a questionnaire on acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) returned by patients of the Louisiana State University School of Dentistry were compared with responses to an AIDS questionnaire administered by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
 Although the questionnaire in this study was not patterned after that used by NCHS, some of the questions were either similar or directly opposite in content.
 Response patterns were compared and contrasted.
 In addition, those response patterns in Part I which are significantly different on the basis of demographic characteristics were compared with their counterparts in the NCHS survey.
