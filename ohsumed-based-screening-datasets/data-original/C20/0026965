Danazol therapy in autoimmune hemolytic anemia associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 We describe a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) complicated by severe autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
 Therapy with corticosteroids, splenectomy, azathioprine, chlorambucil, and intravenous immunoglobulin was unsuccessful.
 She responded to danazol, however, with maintenance of her hemoglobin and reductions in her transfusion and corticosteroid requirement.
 Thus, danazol may represent an important therapeutic option in the treatment of autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
