Immunosuppressive drugs in immune and inflammatory ocular disease [published erratum appears in Surv Ophthalmol 1991 May-Jun;35(6):475]
 Advances in immunology, particularly ocular immunology, have been accompanied by the emergence of safer, more specific immunosuppressive drugs, notably, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine A, bromocriptine, dapsone, and colchicine.
 These drugs have become an important, and often essential, part of the ophthalmologist's armamentarium against inflammatory and immune-mediated ocular diseases.
 In order to better acquaint the ophthalmologist with the properties of the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs, we review the literature and relate our own experience with these agents.
