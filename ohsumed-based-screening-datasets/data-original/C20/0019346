A syndrome characterized by nodular eosinophilic infiltration of the skin and immunoglobulin isotype imbalance.
 A 9-year-old boy had recurrent acute, plaquelike, nodular infiltrations with overlying vesicles and bullae of the face and right hand.
 Histologically, the lesions consisted of a perivascular and periadnexal lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with many eosinophils.
 The lesions responded to dapsone therapy.
 Laboratory studies revealed blood eosinophilia, hyperimmunoglobulinemias E and G4, and hypoimmunoglobulinemias M and G1-3, which normalized after treatment.
 The patient's immune deviation is consistent with a transient imbalance of lymphokine production in helper T cells.
