Rehabilitation of a patient with asthma in the outpatient setting.
 Although traditional rehabilitation medicine approaches are necessary in patients with the most severe asthma, principles of rehabilitation described in this article are useful for almost all patients.
 These principles are perhaps most useful early in a patient's course when the setting of appropriate expectations is important in minimizing restrictions from both disease and its treatment.
 Once a patient has developed restrictions, prompt institution of rehabilitation is essential to prevent significant disability, which can be avoided or even reversed.
 Once rehabilitation has been instituted, progress with rehabilitation goals should be monitored in visits to the physician so that communication with the appropriate health care professional can be established to readjust therapy.
 Physician interest in the process of rehabilitation can stimulate motivation of the patient.
