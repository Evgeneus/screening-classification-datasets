P-31 spectroscopy study of response of superficial human tumors to therapy.
 Studies were performed to characterize phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance (MR) spectra obtained from 10 superficial human tumors outside the brain and to determine whether P-31 MR spectroscopy could allow detection of a response to therapy before a change in tumor size was measured.
 The ratio of phosphomonoester to adenosine triphosphate peak intensities (PME/ATP) was unusually large in all tumors studied.
 The average PME/ATP in lymphomas (1.8 +/- 0.5) was greater than in nonlymphoma cancers (1.1 +/- 0.15).
 The average PME/ATP for all tumors studied (1.4 +/- 0.5) was much greater than that of underlying skeletal muscle (0.23 +/- .09).
 Eight of the tumors were studied before and after therapy.
 Responders were distinguished from nonresponders on the basis of changes in tumor size.
 PME/ATP decreased during therapy in three lymphomas that responded to therapy.
 In an adenocarcinoma and Ewing sarcoma that did not respond to therapy, PME/ATP increased.
 PME/ATP remained constant in two squamous cell carcinomas that responded to therapy and decreased in one squamous cell carcinoma that decreased in size by 40% but was classified as a nonresponder.
 Changes in PME/ATP did not always parallel changes in tumor size during therapy.
 In two patients, a decrease in PME/ATP preceded a decrease in tumor size.
 In four patients, PME/ATP increased transiently during periods when tumor size remained constant.
