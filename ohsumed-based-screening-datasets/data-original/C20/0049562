HIV-1 seropositivity and mortality at University Hospital, Kinshasa, Zaire, 1987.
 This study examines the impact of HIV-1 infection and AIDS on 500 of 563 consecutive deaths at University Hospital, Kinshasa, Zaire, in late 1987.
 HIV-1 seroprevalence was 31% for the entire population and 43% for the 247 adults.
 Forty-two (38%) of the 110 HIV-1-seropositive adult deaths occurred in those between the ages of 25 and 34 years.
 The mean age of death for seropositives was 36 years, 7.5 years less than seronegative deaths.
 AIDS and AIDS-associated diagnoses such as cryptococcal meningitis, chronic diarrhea and pneumonia accounted for 42% of all adult deaths and 74% of all HIV-1-seropositive adult deaths.
 Seventeen per cent of 50 sera initially negative by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were ultimately found to be HIV-1-seropositive by Western blot or p24 antigen testing.
 The data indicate that HIV-1 infection and AIDS contribute significantly to adult mortality in Kinshasa population and that sensitivity of ELISA tests decreases in terminal HIV-1 infection.
