Gamma-interferon induction in patients with chronic progressive MS.
 Although gamma interferon (gamma-IFN) may be involved in the pathogenesis of exacerbations of multiple sclerosis (MS), whether it plays a role in chronic progressive MS is not known.
 To investigate this, we retrospectively analyzed serum samples from nine chronic progressive MS patients who were treated with monthly intravenous infusions of the interferon inducer polyinosinic acid polycytidylic acid polylysine in carboxymethylcellulose (poly ICLC).
 Using a bioassay we found that the mean peak total interferon level was 177 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, and using a radioimmunoassay we found that the mean peak gamma-IFN level was 15.9 U/ml 12 hours after infusion, so that gamma-IFN made up approximately 10% of the total.
 Greater gamma-IFN induction did not correlate with clinical worsening; induced gamma-IFN levels were not higher in two patients who worsened on treatment, and the highest levels were found in a patient who remained stable.
 Either chronic progressive MS is not sensitive to gamma-IFN or the effects of gamma-IFN are masked by other mediators induced by poly ICLC.
