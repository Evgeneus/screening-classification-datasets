Comparative hypersensitivity in intravenous lipid emulsions.
 We report a case of hypersensitivity to Intra-lipid but not to Liposyn II lipid emulsion.
 The patient had mild allergies to soybean protein, egg yolk, and egg whites by radioallergosorbent testing (RAST).
 Because protein contamination of the phospholipid binder during the emulsion manufacture may rarely occur, such contamination should be considered as a cause for urticarial eruptions associated with lipid emulsions.
