Immunocytochemical determination of antigen and epitope specificity of HIV-1-specific B cells in lymph-node biopsies from HIV-1-infected individuals.
 Knowledge about B-cell dysfunction and HIV-specific antibody production is necessary for the understanding of both HIV-1-related immunopathology and the (vaccine-induced) humoral immunity involved in protection against AIDS.
 This paper describes the application of recently developed methods to detect epitope specificity of B cells in lymph-node biopsies with antigen-enzyme conjugates.
 Cryosections of five lymph-node biopsies from HIV-1-infected individuals and four control tissues were stained with a panel of HIV-1 antigen-enzyme conjugates: recombinant HIV-1 proteins (gp 160, gp 120 and p24), labelled with peroxidase, and synthetic peptides representing neutralizing epitopes from gp120 and gp41, labelled with alkaline phosphatase.
 Antibody-forming cells (AFCs) were detected in all the HIV-1-infected biopsies with gp160, gp120 and/or p24, in numbers up to 350 per section.
 AFCs producing specific antibodies against peptide 101 (SP 101), representing the neutralizing epitope 586-608 of gp41, were detected in one patient.
 These techniques allow correlation of in vivo function of B cells with lymph-node pathology, clinical stage of the disease and serological data.
 Their potential for the elucidation of HIV-related immunopathogenesis and the development of vaccines is discussed.
