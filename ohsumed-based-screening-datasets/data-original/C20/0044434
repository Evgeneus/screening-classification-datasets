Naproxen induced pseudoporphyria in juvenile chronic arthritis.
 We report 6 cases of porphyria-like skin reactions in children taking naproxen for juvenile chronic arthritis.
 The lesions mimicked either erythropoietic protoporphyria or porphyria cutanea tarda, with both forms occurring in 2 patients.
 Biochemical studies excluded abnormal porphyrin metabolism.
