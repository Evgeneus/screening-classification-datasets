Magnetic resonance imaging of central nervous system lesions in patients with lupus erythematosus. Correlation with clinical remission and antineurofilament and anticardiolipin antibody titers.
 Clinical, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and serologic studies were performed on 11 patients with diffuse central nervous system (CNS) systemic lupus erythematosus and 8 patients with focal CNS lupus.
 MRI of patients with diffuse clinical disease showed symmetrically distributed areas of increased signal intensity in the subcortical white matter; these resolved after treatment with high-dose methylprednisolone.
 These patients' sera contained elevated levels of antineurofilament antibodies.
 Patients with focal CNS lupus had areas of increased signal intensity and atrophic changes in regions corresponding to the major cerebral vessels.
 These MRI abnormalities did not improve after treatment with high-dose steroids.
 The sera of patients with focal CNS lupus had elevated levels of cardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant but normal levels of antineurofilament antibody.
 Our findings suggest that results of a combined clinical, MRI, and serologic evaluation of patients with CNS lupus may predict the response of patients to high-dose steroid therapy.
