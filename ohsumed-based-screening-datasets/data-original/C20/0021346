Allergenic structures in cockroach hypersensitivity.
 The tissues from which cockroach allergens were derived were identified by use of serum IgE of five patients with allergic rhinitis and bronchial asthma as a result of hypersensitivity to German cockroach.
 RAST and skin test results demonstrated four of five patients to be positive to cockroach only, and one patient was tested positive to house dust mite as well.
 Allergen-specific IgE binding to German cockroach was investigated by cryostat sections by means of immunofluorescent test.
 In all patients with cockroach hypersensitivity, we found IgE bound to the gastrointestinal epithelium and contents of the intestinal tract.
 In four cases, IgE was also bound to the Malpighian vessels (equivalent in function to kidneys).
 In three cases, IgE was also bound to the ovarian cells.
 All cases revealed cytoplasmic staining.
