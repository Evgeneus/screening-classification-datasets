Immediate contact reactions to chemicals in the fragrance mix and a study of the quenching action of eugenol.
 In this study, the nature of non-immune immediate contact reactions (NIICR) produced by cinnamic aldehyde, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were investigated, with particular interest in the 'quenching' ability of eugenol.
 Three groups of human subjects were studied, and the guinea-pig ear was also used as a model of NIICR.
 Cinnamic aldehyde, benzoic acid and sorbic acid were all able to produce NIICR in the majority of subjects studied.
 There was a strong correlation between the susceptibility of each subject to each urticant, but no correlation between the susceptibility to NIICR and age, atopic status or tanning ability.
 Eugenol caused a reduction in NIICR induced by all three urticants.
 This 'quenching' effect was apparent even when the eugenol was applied up to 60 min prior to application of cinnamic aldehyde, and its effect was not eliminated by washing.
 In the guinea-pig-ear model, ear thickening was induced by all three urticants, and this response was inhibited by eugenol.
