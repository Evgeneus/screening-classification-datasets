Tumor necrosis factor downregulates granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor receptor expression on human acute myeloid leukemia cells and granulocytes.
 Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibits granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-induced human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) growth in vitro.
 Incubation of blasts from three patients with AML in serum-free medium with TNF (10(3) U/ml), and subsequent binding studies using 125I-G-CSF reveal that TNF downregulates the numbers of G-CSF receptors by approximately 70%.
 G-CSF receptor numbers on purified blood granulocytes are also downmodulated by TNF.
 Downregulation of G-CSF receptor expression becomes evident within 10 min after incubation of the cells with TNF at 37 degrees C and is not associated with an apparent change of the dissociation constant (Kd).
 The TNF effect does not occur at 0 degrees C and cannot be induced by IL-2, IL-6, or GM-CSF.
 TNF probably exerts its effect through activation of protein kinase C (PKC) as the TNF effect on G-CSF receptor levels can be mimicked by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13- acetate.
 The PKC inhibitor Staurosporine (Sigma Chemical Co., St.
 Louis, MO) as well as protease inhibitors can completely prevent G-CSF receptor downmodulation.
 Thus, it appears TNF may act as a regulator of G-CSF receptor expression in myeloid cells and shut off G-CSF dependent hematopoiesis.
 The regulatory ability of TNF may explain the antagonism between TNF and G-CSF stimulation.
