The sensitivity of transcranial cortical magnetic stimulation in detecting pyramidal tract lesions in clinically definite multiple sclerosis.
 We determined central motor conduction time (CMCT) (motor cortex to root C-8 and motor cortex to root S-1) as well as the amplitude of the compound muscle action potentials in the hypothenar and the abductor hallucis muscles on both sides in 44 patients with definite MS.
 We compared the values with standards obtained from 86 healthy controls and correlated them with the degree of clinical deficit of the limbs examined.
 Thirty-nine patients (88.6%) showed a prolonged CMCT.
 By comparison, only 74.4% of patients had abnormal visual evoked potentials.
