Lack of evidence for HIV-2 infection among at-risk individuals in Brazil.
 Recent reports have indicated the possibility that HIV-2 has been introduced into groups at risk for AIDS in Brazil.
 We studied sera collected in 1987 and 1988 from 1,821 at-risk individuals from diverse regions in Brazil.
 Of the 1,821 sera, 367 (20%) were confirmed as being positive for HIV-1 antibodies by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunofluorescence (IF), and Western blot.
 An additional 33 (2%) sera displayed some reactivity to HIV-2-infected cells by IF.
 All 33 sera were subsequently tested in HIV-1 and HIV-2 Western blots as well as an ELISA using HIV-1- or HIV-2-specific peptides.
 All sera were confirmed as positive for HIV-1 and negative for HIV-2 antibodies in both assays.
 We conclude that caution should be used in the interpretation of serologic cross-reactivity between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and that there is no evidence that HIV-2 has entered groups at risk for HIV infection in Brazil.
