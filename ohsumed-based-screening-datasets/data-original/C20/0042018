Rehabilitation of asthmatic patients. Motivating your patients to improve their life-style.
 Complete rehabilitation of asthmatic patients requires consideration of their medication use, psychological adjustment, and quality of life and their family's adaptation to chronic disease.
 Physicians can significantly improve their patients' well-being by encouraging them to achieve and maintain a maximal level of fitness and to stop smoking.
 Motivation and support for smoking cessation should be available through office-based programs and follow-up.
 With pretreatment for vigorous sports, asthmatic patients should be able to participate in nearly any activity.
