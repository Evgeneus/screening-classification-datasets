Antiinflammatory-antioxidant treatment with a methane sulfonanilide in allergen-induced asthma.
 Two groups of six asthmatic patients with biphasic bronchospastic response to inhaled Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen extract were studied in a double-blind fashion.
 Early and late asthmatic reactions to allergen inhalation challenge were determined before and at the end of a 2-week treatment period with nimesulide (100 mg bid orally), a sulfonanilide with antioxidant properties, or placebo.
 Bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was evaluated 24 hours before and after allergen inhalation challenges.
 The dose of allergen causing EAR (15% decrease in FEV1) and the severity of LAR (maximum FEV1 fall) were similar before and at the end of the treatment period in both groups.
 In patients treated with nimesulide, bronchial responsiveness to methacholine was significantly increased after allergen inhalation challenge both before and at the end of the treatment period.
 These results do not support the hypothesis that the production of oxygen-free radicals plays a significant role in the development of bronchial hyperresponsiveness and late phase reaction to allergen in asthma.
