A study of HTLV-I and its associated risk factors in Trinidad and Tobago.
 Seroprevalence of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-I) among a sample of persons selected from a government register of businesses in Trinidad was 3.2% in 1,025 persons of African descent compared to 0.2% among 487 persons of Asian descent and 0% among 46 persons of European-descent.
 In Tobago, from a coastal village, among persons of African ancestry ascertained as part of a cardiovascular survey, the rate was 11.4%, which was significantly higher when corrected for age and race than the rate in Trinidad.
 The seroprevalence rate of antibodies to hepatitis A and B was also significantly elevated in Tobago compared to Trinidad.
 HTLV-I seroprevalence rates were higher in females than males while hepatitis A and B rates were not significantly different in the two sexes.
 For males, age was a significant determinant of HTLV-I seropositivity, while for females, age, markers of poor sanitation, and hepatitis B were each independently linked to HTLV-I seropositivity.
 The frequent occurrence of multiple infectious exposures in persons of lower socioeconomic circumstances in this tropical environment may result in immune activation that heightens susceptibility to HTLV-I infection.
