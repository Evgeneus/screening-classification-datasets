CSF changes in a longitudinal study of 124 neurologically normal HIV-1-infected U.S. Air Force personnel.
 Over a 2 year period, 124 neurologically normal HIV-1-infected patients had three successive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations approximately 1 year apart.
 Immunological status as measured by absolute CD4 counts in the blood identified two groups of patients over time: (a) a group with progressive CD4 decline (66 patients), and (b) a group with stable CD4 counts (58 patients).
 These two study groups provided us the opportunity to compare CSF changes (cells, protein, albumin index, IgG, IgG index, and IgG synthesis rate) in neurologically normal individuals with respect to immunological status over time.
 We found significantly increased intrathecal cellular response and IgG production over time independent of CD4 group.
 We conclude that any clinical study comparing CSF findings in neurologically symptomatic HIV-infected individuals must recognize and control for these CSF changes in neurologically asymptomatic patients.
