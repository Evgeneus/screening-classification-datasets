Anterior granulomatous uveitis in patients with multiple sclerosis.
 Granulomatous uveitis has infrequently been described as a manifestation of the autoimmune phenomena of multiple sclerosis (MS).
 The authors describe six cases of anterior granulomatous uveitis in patients with MS.
 All six patients had features of iridocyclitis and three patients had features of periphlebitis, which were suggestive of granulomatous disease.
 However, each patient had neurologic symptoms and signs consistent with MS and a negative laboratory workup for sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and syphilis.
 Testing for MS in a subgroup of patients with granulomatous uveitis of unknown etiology and neurologic symptoms may result in a diagnosis.
