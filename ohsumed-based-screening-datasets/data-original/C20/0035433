Selective removal of anti-DNA and anticardiolipin antibodies by adsorbent plasmapheresis using dextran sulfate columns in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 The effect of adsorbent plasmapheresis using dextran sulfate columns on anti-DNA and/or anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) in 6 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was studied by multicenter clinical trials.
 The titers of anti-DNA (RI assay), IgG anti-dsDNA (ELISA), IgG and/or IgM anti-ssDNA, (ELISA), and IgG aCL (ELISA) significantly decreased or normalized after 4 treatments of plasmapheresis during a 2 to 4 week period.
 A patient with SLE with recurrent abortion and aCL who was successfully treated by adsorbent plasmapheresis is reported.
 We expect that adsorbent plasmapheresis will be an influential treatment for patients with not only SLE but aCL syndrome.
