HIV proteins absent from placentas of 75 HIV-1-positive women studied by immunohistochemistry.
 Recent epidemiological and virological data suggest that the incidence of maternofetal transmission of HIV-1 infection is between 20 and 30%.
 The available evidence points to a possible role of peri- and postnatal contamination, but the isolation of HIV from fetuses shows that transplacental transmission also occurs.
 We attempted to detect, by means of an immunohistochemical method, HIV proteins in frozen placentas from 75 HIV-1-positive women (30 at term, 45 induced abortions).
 In addition, in situ hybridization using HIV-specific probes was performed in three cases.
 Neither HIV proteins nor nucleic acid sequences were detected, but CD4+ mononuclear cells were present in the chorion and villi, regardless of the clinical and biological status of the mother (particularly in the nine cases in which the infants were infected).
 There are several possible mechanisms involving the placenta in the maternofetal transmission of HIV, including active transport of the HIV-immunoglobulin G complex via Fc receptors on trophoblastic cells, passive transplacental passage of HIV during a viraemic episode, the passage of infected maternal cells, and infection of the placenta itself.
 The methods we used could not rule out the presence of HIV DNA provirus within the genome of placental cells.
 In any event, immunohistochemical detection of HIV proteins in the placenta is not a technique suitable for the prenatal diagnosis of HIV infection or for identifying newborns likely to develop HIV infection.
