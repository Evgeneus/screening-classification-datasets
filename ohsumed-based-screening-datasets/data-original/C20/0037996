Constitutive production of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha from spontaneously proliferating T cells in patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-I/II.
 The human T-cell lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) type I and type II are capable of inducing a variety of cellular genes, including many of the cytokines that regulate cell proliferation.
 To determine if the spontaneous proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients infected with HTLV-I and HTLV-II was related to coordinate expression of cytokines, we analyzed the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-tau (IFN-tau) in culture supernatants derived from spontaneously proliferating cells.
 Significantly elevated levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha were present in culture supernatants from HTLV-I/II-infected individuals when compared with normal controls (P less than .01).
 Kinetic experiments showed that both IL-6 and TNF-alpha were elevated by day 5.
 None of the other cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, and IFN-tau) were detectable in any of the culture.
 These data suggest that release of IL-6 and TNF-alpha may regulate lymphocyte proliferation in HTLV-I/II-infected individuals.
