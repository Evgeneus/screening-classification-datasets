Effect of injected long-acting epinephrine in addition to aerosolized albuterol in the treatment of acute asthma in children.
 The additional effect, if any, of subcutaneous, long-acting epinephrine (Sus-Phrine) to aerosolized albuterol for acute pediatric asthma was studied.
 Over an eight-month period, patients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.
 All patients were recruited and studied in a pediatric emergency department.
 Forty-three children between the ages of three and 12 years, with a mean age of 8.9 years, presenting with acute asthma were enrolled.
 Group 1 received Sus-Phrine, 0.005 ml per kg before albuterol aerosols, as appropriate.
 Group 2 only received albuterol aerosols.
 There was no significant difference in the extent of improvement between the two groups at either 20 minutes or two hours for clinical score, peak flow, or respiratory rate.
 Subcutaneous, long-acting epinephrine provides no additional benefit to a beta-2 agonist by nebulization for children with acute asthma.
