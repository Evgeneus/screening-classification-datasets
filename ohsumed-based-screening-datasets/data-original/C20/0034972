Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection 
 The development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is unusual in individuals with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.
 We present four patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection.
 Immunophenotyping of lymph node tissue in three of these patients revealed a predominance of T-suppressor cells.
 Possible causes for the development of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in the presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection are discussed.
