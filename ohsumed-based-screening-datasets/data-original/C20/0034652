Identification of type-specific linear epitopes in the glycoproteins gp46 and gp21 of human T-cell leukemia viruses type I and type II using synthetic peptides.
 Synthetic peptides of 20-25 amino acids were employed in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to identify linear epitopes in the external glycoprotein gp46 and the transmembrane glycoprotein gp21 of human T-cell leukemia/lymphotropic viruses type I (HTLV-I) and II (HTLV-II).
 Ten linear epitopes were identified in the HTLV-I glycoproteins, seven in gp46 and three in gp21.
 Three major linear epitopes were identified in the gp46 of HTLV-II.
 Peptides representing linear epitopes of gp46 were found to be sensitive and specific for the detection of antibody and permit serological identification and differentiation of HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections.
