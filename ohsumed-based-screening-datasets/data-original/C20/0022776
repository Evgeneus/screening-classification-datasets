Epstein-Barr virus in benign lymph node biopsies from individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus is associated with concurrent or subsequent development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have an increased incidence of high-grade B-cell lymphoma.
 In many instances, these lymphomas contain Epstein-Barr viral (EBV) genomes.
 To investigate the role of EBV in development of HIV-related lymphoma, benign fixed lymph node biopsies from normal individuals and HIV-infected individuals with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL) were analyzed for EBV sequences by polymerase chain reaction and in situ DNA hybridization techniques.
 EBV DNA was not detected in any of 16 benign lymph node biopsies from normal individuals, but could be detected from 13 of 35 PGL biopsies.
 The EBV-infected cells were present in both follicular and interfollicular areas and in both small and large lymphoid cells.
 The presence of detectable amounts of EBV DNA in the 13 PGL biopsies was associated with an increased incidence of concurrent lymphoma at another site (n = 3) or development of lymphoma in time (n = 2).
 In contrast, only 1 of 22 individuals with EBV-negative PGL biopsies developed lymphoma in time (P less than .05).
 EBV was detected in all five lymphomas in which tissue was available for subsequent analysis, including the lymphoma that developed in the individual without EBV in his previous PGL biopsy.
 These findings support the hypothesis that EBV plays a role in development of some HIV-related lymphomas.
 Detectable EBV lymphoproliferations occur in a few PGL biopsies and are associated with a significant risk of EBV DNA-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
