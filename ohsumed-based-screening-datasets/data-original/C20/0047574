Multiple patterns of alloantigen presenting/stimulating cell dysfunction in patients with AIDS.
 The APC/stimulating cell (APC/SC) potential of PBMC from Walter Reed stage 1 and 2 patients and patients with AIDS was tested by using these PBMC as stimulators in an allogeneic MLR.
 The responding cells were PBMC from unrelated, HIV- donors that were either unfractionated or depleted of APC by plastic and nylon wool adherence.
 Using this approach, we observed no defect in the APC/SC potential of PBMC from Walter Reed stage 1 and 2 patients.
 However, PBMC from AIDS patients used as allogeneic stimulators exhibited three different patterns of APC/SC function: 1) no defect in alloantigen (ALLO) APC/SC potential; 2) a defect in ALLO APC/SC function that was detected only if the responder cells were depleted of APC (presenting cell defect); and 3) a defect in ALLO APC/SC function, irrespective of whether the responder cells were depleted of APC (stimulating cell defect).
 These results indicate that in addition to Th cell defects associated with AIDS, the PBMC from AIDS patients can also exhibit a defect in APC/SC function.
 This study provides an approach that permits the testing of Ag-presenting function in all AIDS patients, and is therefore not limited to testing patients for whom HIV-, HLA-identical T cells and APC are available.
