Systemic lupus erythematosus and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone.
 The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) has been reported rarely in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with central nervous system disease.
 Previous case reports linking SIADH with lupus have either not documented clearly that SLE was the sole cause of the problem, or have not demonstrated a correlation between indicators of lupus activity and the onset and resolution of antidiuretic hormone secretion.
 We describe a case in which SLE was the sole contributor to the initiation of SIADH and where other evidence of lupus activity correlated temporally with inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion.
