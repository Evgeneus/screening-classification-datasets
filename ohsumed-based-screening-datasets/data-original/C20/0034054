HIV-2 infection in hospitalized patients in Bissau, Guinea-Bissau.
 During 11 months in 1989-1990, 1009 consecutive hospitalized adult patients admitted to the medical wards of the National Hospital in Bissau were interviewed, examined clinically, and tested for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2.
 The prevalence of HIV-2 infection was 20.4% (206 out of 1009) and of HIV-2-associated AIDS 4.4% (44 out of 1009).
 HIV-2 infection was more frequent in women (25%, 110 out of 440) than in men (16.9%, 96 out of 569).
 HIV-1 infection was diagnosed in one patient only, and one patient (with AIDS) had reactivity to both HIV-1 and HIV-2.
 Among HIV-2-seropositive patients, AIDS was demonstrated in 21.3% and AIDS-related symptoms (not fulfilling the AIDS criteria) in 19.4%.
 The frequency of AIDS-associated symptoms was significantly higher in HIV-2-seropositive patients than in seronegative patients.
 The clinical profile of the HIV-2-associated AIDS cases was very similar to that described in HIV-1-associated AIDS cases in Africa.
 Seven out of 51 patients fulfilling the clinical criteria for AIDS were HIV-seronegative.
 The World Health Organization (WHO) clinical case definition for AIDS in Africa had a specificity of 99% and a positive predictive value of 86%.
 Tuberculosis was more common in HIV-2-seropositive patients (6.3%) than in HIV-2-seronegative patients (2.2%).
 A history of blood transfusion was a significant risk factor for HIV-2 infection.
 HIV-2 infection and AIDS are public health problems in Guinea-Bissau.
