Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) circulating immune complexes in infected children.
 Circulating immune complexes (CIC) were studied for the presence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antigens (HIV-Ag) in 55 children infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
 CIC were elevated in 85% of patients.
 In 33 of 55 patients CIC included at least one HIV-Ag (HIV-Ag-CIC).
 Sixty percent of patients had p17 antigen, 50% had p24 antigen, and 16% had gp120 associated with CIC.
 Levels of HIV-Ag-CIC did not correlate with free serum HIV antigens.
 Patients with high HIV-Ag-CIC had a more severe clinical course and 90% of those with markedly elevated HIV-Ag-CIC (greater than 3+) have died within 6 to 24 months.
 HIV-Ag-CIC were also present in some patients including neonates and young infants in whom free HIV-Ag was undetectable.
 Monitoring of HIV-Ag in isolated CIC may be of value for early detection of HIV infection and for monitoring of disease outcome.
