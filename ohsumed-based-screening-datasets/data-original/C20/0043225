Use of TAO without methylprednisolone in the treatment of severe asthma.
 The antimicrobial agent troleandomycin (TAO) has been shown to be effective in reducing corticosteroid requirements in patients with corticosteroid-dependent asthma.
 To our knowledge, the efficacy of TAO without concomitant use of corticosteroids has never been documented.
 We report the case of a 12-year-old patient with corticosteroid-dependent asthma who has remained asymptomatic and without any evidence of pulmonary deterioration during treatment with TAO without concomitant use of corticosteroids.
