Epidemiology of infection by nontuberculous mycobacteria IX. Evidence for two DNA homology groups among small plasmids in Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium intracellulare, and Mycobacterium scrofulaceum.
 A 12.9 kb plasmid, pVT2, from a clinical Mycobacterium avium isolate, MD1, was cloned and radiolabeled for use as a DNA probe to examine the relatedness of plasmids in M.
 avium complex.
 That probe hybridized with plasmids isolated from M.
 avium complex strains from the environment (7 of 16) and from non-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (10 of 17) and AIDS (5 of 6) clinical isolates.
 The similarity of plasmids from the environment with those from patients supports the hypothesis that the environment is a source of human M.
 avium complex infection.
 More striking was the observation that pVT2 hybridized with every plasmid (13 of 13 clinical and 5 of 5 environmental isolates) of 13.5 kb or smaller.
 A second probe, consisting of a 15.3 kb plasmid (pLR7) from another clinical isolate of the M.
 avium complex, hybridized with plasmids of 15.3 to 25 kb from environmental and clinical (AIDS and non-AIDS) isolates.
 There was no hybridization between pVT2 and pLR7.
 Thus, these two probes define two different groups of small mycobacterial plasmids.
