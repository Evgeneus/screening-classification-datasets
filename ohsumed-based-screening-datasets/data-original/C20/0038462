Comparison of albuterol and metaproterenol syrup in the treatment of childhood asthma.
 This study compared the acute and chronic effects of albuterol syrup (2 mg) and metaproterenol syrup (10 mg) three times a day over 28 days in 65 children, aged 6 to 9 years, with mild to moderate asthma.
 Wright peak flow, symptom scores, and rescue medication use were recorded twice daily during the 28 days; the acute cardiopulmonary effects of these syrups were compared over 8 hours on treatment days 1 and 28.
 Albuterol syrup produced a significantly greater peak magnitude of bronchodilation than metaproterenol, 29% vs 20% above baseline, respectively, on treatment day 1.
 Albuterol syrup had a duration of action of at least 8 hours and produced greater bronchodilation than metaproterenol syrup from 2 to 8 hours on both treatment days 1 and 28.
 The chronotropic effect of metaproterenol was greater than that of albuterol at 1 to 1 1/2 hours postdose on treatment days 1 and 28.
 There was a trend toward higher morning and evening Wright peak flow measurements during 28 days of treatment in the albuterol group.
 Side effects of both drugs were comparable.
 These findings imply therapeutic advantages of albuterol syrup over metaproterenol syrup in currently recommended doses with respect to improvement in pulmonary function, chronotropic effects, and frequency of dosing required to maintain optimum bronchodilation over a 24-hour period.
