The chest radiograph appearances seen following high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation for resistant malignant lymphoma.
 The objective of this study was to review and analyse the chest radiograph (CXR) appearances seen following high dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT), and to identify any characteristic patterns.
 Thirty-one patients underwent ABMT between 1984 and 1989 for high grade lymphoma resistant to conventional chemotherapy.
 Their case notes and CXRs were reviewed in conjunction with the clinicians.
 In this small sample of patients, an acute interstitial pattern was seen with pulmonary oedema following bone marrow reinfusion in two cases of the 13 patients showing CXR changes (15%).
 Otherwise, the CXR changes following ABMT were not specific, although they did alert the clinician to the possibilities of recurrent lymphoma or opportunistic infection, enabling appropriate investigations and treatment to be instituted at an early stage.
 The complications and CXR changes did not differ greatly from those seen following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
