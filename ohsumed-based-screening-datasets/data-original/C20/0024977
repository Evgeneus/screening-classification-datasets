Culture and properties of cells derived from Kaposi sarcoma.
 We describe the establishment of four continuous cell cultures isolated from pleural or peritoneal fluid of patients with Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and show evidence that these cells are derived from vascular endothelium.
 Although provision of an extracellular matrix (fibronectin, laminin, or matrigel) was essential, the cell cultures were not dependent on exogenously added growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor with or without heparin) for continuous culture.
 Specific staining for endothelial cell (EC) markers (factor VIII, Ulex europaeus type 1 lectin) and the secretion of endothelin, a vascular EC product, were demonstrated.
 The KS cells secreted large amounts of cytokines (granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, and especially IL-6).
 Conditioned media from the KS cells caused normal capillary EC to proliferate.
 The KS cells synthesized fibroblast growth activity in amounts sufficient to induce the proliferation of normal EC and fibroblasts.
 These data support the existence of a paracrine pathway of EC proliferation in KS and suggest that KS cells could sustain their own growth via an autocrine mechanism.
