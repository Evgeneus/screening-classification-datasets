Population-based estimates of zidovudine and aerosol pentamidine use in San Francisco: 1987-1989.
 From the San Francisco Men's Health Study (SFMHS) and the San Francisco General Hospital Cohort we derived partially population-based estimates of zidovudine (ZDV) use in San Francisco from 1987 to 1989.
 Data from the SFMHS alone were used to make estimates of aerosol pentamidine (AP) use in 1989.
 From 1987 to 1989, zidovudine use increased from 36 to 68% in participants with AIDS.
 In participants with symptomatic HIV infection without AIDS and in those with less than 200 CD4 cells, ZDV use increased initially but then leveled off (from 6 to 25% and 24 to 55%, respectively).
 Zidovudine use with more than 500 CD4 cells increased from 0.5 to 4%.
 In 1989 AP use with less than 200 CD4 cells was 42% and with AIDS was 44%.
 Whereas 50% of participants with AIDS and less than 200 CD4 were using both ZDV and AP, only 14% of those without AIDS but with less than 200 CD4 cells were using both.
 Surprisingly few members of these cohorts are using therapies proven effective in reducing the morbidity and mortality of HIV infection.
