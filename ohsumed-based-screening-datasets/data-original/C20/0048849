Selective elimination of HIV-1-infected cells with an interleukin-2 receptor-specific cytotoxin.
 Infection by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is associated with cellular activation and expression of the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor.
 A genetically engineered fusion toxin, DAB486 IL-2, that contains the enzymatic site and translocation domain of diphtheria toxin and the receptor binding domain of IL-2 specifically kills cells that express high-affinity IL-2 receptors.
 This toxin selectively eliminated the HIV-1-infected cells from mixed cultures of infected and uninfected cells and inhibited production of viral proteins and infectious virus.
 Thus, cellular activation antigens present a target for early antiviral intervention.
