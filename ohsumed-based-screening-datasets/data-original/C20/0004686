Serum immunoglobulins E and G anti-Aspergillus fumigatus antibody in patients with cystic fibrosis who have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
 Patients with cystic fibrosis frequently have pulmonary colonization with Aspergillus fumigatus (Af) and develop anti-Af immunoglobulin E (IgE) and IgG antibodies.
 The diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in subjects with cystic fibrosis is difficult because of the high incidence of Af colonization, with development of humoral antibody responses.
 In this study, we sequentially measured serum anti-Af IgE (Af-E) and IgG (Af-G) antibodies by ELISA in subjects with cystic fibrosis.
 In subjects with cystic fibrosis who have allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, Af-E and Af-G antibodies were significantly increased when compared with other groups of patients with cystic fibrosis who had positive skin tests or precipitins to Af (or both) (p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01, respectively).
 In addition, increased Af-E and Af-G levels were sometimes seen in other groups, especially subjects with cystic fibrosis who had positive Af skin tests or precipitin tests, two of whom later developed criteria diagnostic of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.
 Thus, serum Af-E and Af-G levels were quantitatively increased in subjects with cystic fibrosis who had allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and thus adjunctive data in diagnosis.
 However, it also suggested that subclinical pulmonary inflammation may also occur.
