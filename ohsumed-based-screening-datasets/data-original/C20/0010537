Photochemotherapy alone or combined with interferon alpha-2a in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
 Eighty-two patients with either mycosis fungoides (MF) or parapsoriasis en plaques were treated with psoralens ultraviolet A light (PUVA).
 Clinical and histologic parameters were followed for a period from 6 months to 10 years.
 Complete clinical clearing of lesions was observed in 51 patients (62%) and most of them were in limited-plaque MF group or parapsoriasis en plaque.
 The mean total dose of PUVA for complete clearing was less for early MF.
 Thirty-one patients (38%) relapsed and responded to additional PUVA.
 Patients in early stages of the disease remained clear for up to 68 months after the first course of PUVA.
 Post-treatment skin biopsies with early MF showed histologic clearing.
 A new combination therapy for MF is presented in 15 patients.
 Recombinant interferon alpha-2a (Roferon-A), administered intramuscularly combined with PUVA were tested in a phase I trial.
 Interferon doses were from 6-30 million units three times weekly.
 Disease stages ranged from I-B to IV-B.
 Complete responses were obtained in 12 of 15 patients, and partial responses seen in 2 of 15 patients, for an overall response rate of 93%.
 The median duration of response exceeded 23 months (range, 3 to 25 months).
 All responding patients have been maintained on therapy.
 The dose-limiting toxicities were constitutional symptoms such as fevers and malaise (93.3%), leukopenias (40.0%), mental status changes consisting of depression and confusion (33.3%), and photosensitivity (26.6%).
 Interferon plus PUVA appear to be highly effective regimens for the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas.
