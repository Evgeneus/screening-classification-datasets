Effectiveness of an acaricide in management of house dust mite allergy.
 The effects of treating the environment of 25 dust mite-allergic patients with an acaracide are reported.
 Remarkable symptomatic improvements in asthma, eczema, or rhinitis were observed.
 Many patients could reduce or stop medication, and these benefits have persisted for up to a year after using Acarosan once only.
 Relapse of symptoms following exposure to untreated dusty environments was observed on many occasions confirming that the improvements were due to removal of the mite allergen.
