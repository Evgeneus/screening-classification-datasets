T cell receptor peptide therapy triggers autoregulation of experimental encephalomyelitis.
 Encephalitogenic T cells specific for myelin basic protein share common V beta 8 peptide sequences in their T cell receptor (TCR) that can induce autoregulatory T cells and antibodies that prevent clinical signs of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).
 It is not known, however, if TCR peptides can treat established disease.
 To test its therapeutic value, TCR-V beta 8-39-59 peptide was injected into rats with clinical signs of EAE.
 This treatment reduced disease severity and speeded recovery, apparently by boosting anti-V beta 8 T cells and antibodies raised naturally in response to encephalitogenic V beta 8+ T cells.
 These results demonstrate that synthetic TCR peptides can be used therapeutically, and implicate the TCR-V beta 8-39-59 sequence as a natural idiotope involved in EAE recovery.
 Similarly, human TCR peptides may be effective in enhancing natural regulation of autoreactive T cells that share common V genes.
