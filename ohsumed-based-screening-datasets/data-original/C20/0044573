Publicly funded HIV counseling and testing--United States, 1990.
 A critical component of CDC's national human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-prevention program is support for HIV counseling and testing (CT) services.
 Sixty-five HIV-prevention programs are in health departments in 50 states, the District of Columbia, six cities, and eight territories.
 Each calendar quarter, the programs report to CDC aggregate or client record data about the number of 1) pretest counseling sessions, HIV-antibody tests, positive tests, and posttest counseling sessions, by CT site; 2) HIV-antibody tests and positive tests, by self-reported risk category; and 3) HIV-antibody tests and positive tests, by age group, sex, and race/ethnicity.
 This report summarizes data reported for 1990.
