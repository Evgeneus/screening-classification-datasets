Distal interphalangeal joint abnormalities in children with polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 Involvement of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints was noted radiographically in 24 (43.6%) of 55 patients with polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 DIP changes were apparent later in the course of the disease and were less severe than in other affected joints.
 Soft tissue swelling and joint space narrowing were the most frequent abnormalities in the DIP joints.
 Erosive changes and angular deformities were uncommon.
 There was no significant correlation between DIP joint involvement and sex, age at presentation, involvement of the hands and wrists at presentation, or positivity of either rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibody.
 There was a strong correlation between the presence of extraarticular signs and symptoms and involvement of the DIP joints; however, this may reflect the greater severity of the disease in these patients generally.
