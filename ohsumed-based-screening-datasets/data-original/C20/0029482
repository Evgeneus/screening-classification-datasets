The reappearance of abdominal tuberculosis.
 Seventeen patients with abdominal tuberculosis were recently treated at our institution.
 Two distinct patient populations were identified--immigrants and individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
 Abdominal pain, weight loss and fever were the most common complaints, with abdominal tenderness and pyrexia the most frequent physical findings.
 Only five of 17 patients had concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis.
 A typical computed tomographic scan was helpful in the diagnosis.
 Diagnosis was made at emergency (five patients) or elective (six patients) laparotomy, by endoscopic (two patients) or percutaneous (three patients) biopsy or on the basis of roentgenologic and clinical evidence (one patient).
 All responded to antituberculous chemotherapy.
 With the spread of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), tuberculosis has become increasingly frequent in urban areas and it must be suspected in all immigrants and patients with AIDS presenting with abdominal complaints.
