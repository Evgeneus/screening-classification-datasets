Seroprevalence of retroviral infection in women with different fertility statuses in Gabon, western equatorial Africa.
 Seroprevalence of retroviral infection (HIV-1, HTLV-1) in women with different fertility statuses was studied in Gabon (Western Equatorial Africa).
 The overall prevalence rate of HIV-1 was 1.4% and of HTLV-1, 6.8%.
 In the primary infertile women the age-adjusted prevalence rate of HIV-1 was significantly higher than in the fertile women (9.3% versus 0.7%) and in secondary infertile women (9.3% versus 2.1%).
 There was no difference in sero-prevalence of HTLV-1 among women with different fertility statuses, but a steady increase with age was seen.
 Concomitant infection with HTLV-1 and HIV-1 was observed in two women.
 In Gabon primary infertile women could be considered a risk group for HIV-1 infection.
