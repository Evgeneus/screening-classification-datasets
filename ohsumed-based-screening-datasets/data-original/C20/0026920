Candida albicans septic arthritis and osteomyelitis of the sternoclavicular joint in a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 A 52-year-old intravenous drug user, seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus, developed Candida albicans fungemia and septic phlebitis due to an infected peripheral plastic intravenous catheter.
 Amphotericin B produced quick resolution of fungemia and systemic toxicity, but in the midst of treatment, after 647 mg of amphotericin B, he developed sternoclavicular osteomyelitis and arthritis due to Candida albicans.
 He responded well to surgical debridement and continuance of antifungal therapy.
 This is the only case to our knowledge of Candida albicans arthritis and osteomyelitis occurring either in a patient infected with human immunodeficiency virus or in the sternoclavicular joint.
