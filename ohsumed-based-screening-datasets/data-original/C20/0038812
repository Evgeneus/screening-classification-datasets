HMB-45-positive malignant lymphoma. A case report with literature review of aberrant HMB-45 reactivity.
 The monoclonal antibody HMB-45 is a highly specific and sensitive marker of malignant melanoma.
 Rarely, however, aberrant reactivity to nonmelanocytic tumors has been observed.
 We report an immunoblastic lymphoma of B-cell phenotype that reacted with HMB-45 in a 70-year-old white woman.
 To our knowledge, this is the first report of HMB-45-positive malignant lymphoma (excluding plasmacytoma).
 Of an additional 13 cases of benign and malignant lymphoid tissue, only benign plasma cells in one case reacted with HMB-45.
