Granulocytic sarcoma of the ovary. An unusual case presentation.
 We report an unusual occurrence of granulocytic sarcoma presenting as an ovarian mass in a 46-year-old woman with a history of dysplastic nevus syndrome.
 During workup of the ovarian mass, the diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia was made.
 A fine-needle aspirate of the ovarian mass showed granulocytic sarcoma.
 The patient died of complications of the acute leukemia a short time later.
 A postmortem examination was performed, which confirmed the nature of the ovarian mass as a granulocytic sarcoma.
 Material was obtained for flow cytometry, immunohistochemical and histochemical studies, and electron microscopy.
 Ploidy analysis of the tumor showed it to be diploid with an S phase of 4.8% and a G2 + M ratio of 0.5%.
 To our knowledge, there is only one previous report of a primary ovarian presentation of granulocytic sarcoma, and only four cases in which granulocytic sarcoma was diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration cytology.
 The association between dysplastic nevus syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia in this case is discussed with reference to a review of the metachronous association between melanoma and leukemia as described in the literature.
