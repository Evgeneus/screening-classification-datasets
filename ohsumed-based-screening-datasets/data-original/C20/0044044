Cross-reactivity on western blots in HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections.
 To examine cross-reactivity of antibodies to heterologous antigens, on HIV-1 and HIV-2 Western blots, we tested sera from 1362 consecutive tuberculosis (TB) patients and 2127 consecutive blood donors.
 Specimens positive on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for HIV-1 or HIV-2 were further characterized by synthetic peptide-based tests, and tested by HIV-1- and HIV-2-specific Western blots.
 Dual serologic reactivity on synthetic peptide tests was proportionately more frequent in HIV-positive TB patients than in blood donors, and HIV-2 reactivity less frequent.
 Positive HIV-1 Western blots were seen in 73-83% of specimens specifically characterized as positive for HIV-2 on synthetic peptide tests.
 Cross-reactivity to HIV-2 Western blots by HIV-1-positive specimens was significantly more frequent in TB patients (35%) than in asymptomatic donors (9%; P less than 0.001).
 Using recently recommended criteria for HIV-2 Western blot interpretation (presence of two env bands) reduced the overall proportion of HIV-1-positive specimens having a positive HIV-2 Western blot from 27.5 to 16.4%, suggesting minimal effect on sensitivity in the diagnosis of HIV-2 reactivity on specimens positive on synthetic peptide tests.
