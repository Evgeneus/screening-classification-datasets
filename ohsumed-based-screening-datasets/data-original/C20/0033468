Uptake and metabolism of iodine is crucial for the development of thyroiditis in obese strain chickens.
 To assess the importance of the role of thyroidal iodine in the pathogenesis of thyroiditis in the obese strain (OS) chicken, a model of spontaneous and severe disease, we studied the effect of antithyroid drugs that reduce thyroidal iodine or prevent its metabolism.
 Reduction of thyroidal iodine was achieved with KClO4, an inhibitor of iodine transport and mononitrotyrosine (MNT), a drug that promotes loss of thyroidal iodine as iodotyrosines.
 A regimen consisting of KClO4 and MNT administration beginning in ovo and continuing after hatching reduced thyroidal infiltration to 2% of control values and decreased thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) production for as long as 9 wk.
 Untreated birds had severe disease by 5 wk of age.
 The suppression of disease was independent of TSH, not mediated by generalized immunosuppression and reversed by excess dietary iodine.
 Two drugs that inhibit the metabolism of iodine, propylthiouracil (PTU) and aminotriazole, reduced thyroidal infiltration and TgAb levels, although to a lesser extent.
 When splenocytes from OS chickens with thyroiditis were transferred to Cornell strain (CS) chickens, a related strain that develops late onset mild disease, only the recipients that were iodine supplemented developed thyroiditis.
 In conclusion, autoimmune thyroiditis in an animal model can be prevented by reducing thyroidal iodine or its metabolism and optimal effects require intervention at the embryonic stage.
