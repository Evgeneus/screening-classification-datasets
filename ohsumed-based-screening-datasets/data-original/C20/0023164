Prevalence of resistance in patients receiving ganciclovir for serious cytomegalovirus infection.
 Seventy-two AIDS patients treated with ganciclovir for cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease were prospectively monitored for the development of drug-resistant virus.
 No resistant strains were found in 31 patients before therapy or among seven culture-positive patients treated for less than or equal to 3 months.
 Of 13 culture-positive patients treated for greater than or equal to 3 months, 5 excreted virus resistant (ED50, greater than 12 microM, or ED90, greater than 30 microM) to ganciclovir.
 Thus, 38% of patients and receiving ganciclovir for greater than 3 months and excreting virus or, overall, 7.6% of the patients were excreting CMV resistant to the drug.
