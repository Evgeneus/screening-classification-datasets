Anal ulcerations due to cytomegalovirus in patients with AIDS. Report of six cases.
 Lesions due to cytomegalovirus (CMV) are frequent in the immunocompromised patient.
 This is particularly the case in patients with AIDS, where the colon and rectum are the regions most often involved.
 The authors report six cases of anal ulcerations due to CMV in patients with AIDS.
 These lesions, confirmed histologically, were either isolated or associated with other localizations.
 Treatment is based on specific antiviral agents but resistance and recurrence can occur.
 The current report underlines the importance of histologic examination of anal lesions in HIV-infected subjects.
