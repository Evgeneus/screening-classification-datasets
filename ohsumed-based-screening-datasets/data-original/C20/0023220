The prevalence of multiple sclerosis in the Southampton and South West Hampshire Health Authority.
 A first survey of the Southampton and South West Hampshire Health Authority showed an overall prevalence of multiple sclerosis of 99/100,000 in a population of 417,000 on 1 January 1987.
 This finding is similar to other recent first surveys in the South of the United Kingdom and only repeat surveys will show if case only repeat surveys will show if case ascertainment has been more complete in these than earlier first studies in Scotland.
