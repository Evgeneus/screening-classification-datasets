Identification of a major peanut allergen, Ara h I, in patients with atopic dermatitis and positive peanut challenges.
 Peanuts are among the most common causes of immediate hypersensitivity reactions to foods.
 Serum from nine patients with atopic dermatitis and a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled, food challenge to peanut were used to begin the process of identification and purification of the major peanut allergens.
 Identification of a major peanut allergen was accomplished by use of anion-exchange column chromatography, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, ELISA, thin-layer isoelectric focusing, and IgE-specific immunoblotting.
 Anion-exchange chromatography revealed several fractions that bound IgE from the serum of the challenge-positive patient pool.
 By measuring antipeanut-specific IgE in the ELISA and in IgE-specific immunoblotting, we identified an allergenic component with two Coomassie brilliant blue staining bands by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with a mean molecular weight of 63.5 kd.
 Examination of this fraction by the IgE antipeanut ELISA with individual serum and by the ELISA-inhibition assay with pooled serum, we identified this fraction as a major allergen.
 Thin-layer isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting of this 63.5 kd fraction revealed it to have an isoelectric point of 4.55.
 Based on allergen nomenclature of the IUIS Subcommittee for Allergen Nomenclature, this allergen is designated, Ara h I (Arachis hypogaea).
