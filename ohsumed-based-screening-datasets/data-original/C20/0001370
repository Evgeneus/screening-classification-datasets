Systemic lupus erythematosus presenting as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.
 We describe a 10-year-old girl, who presented with thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and shortly thereafter developed systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
 The association between TTP and SLE is known, but this is the first report of SLE presenting as TTP.
