Treatment of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma with bleomycin as a single agent.
 A nonrandomized trial was conducted to assess the efficiency and toxicity of bleomycin as a single agent in treatment of non-life-threatening AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).
 Sixty patients were enrolled in this study.
 They all had a disseminated and progressive non-life-threatening AIDS-related KS associated with systemic symptoms and/or CD4 lymphocyte count less than 400/mm3.
 Thirty patients were treated with intramuscular bleomycin (5 mg/d for 3 days every 2 or 3 weeks) and 30 others with a slow continuous intravenous infusion of bleomycin (6 mg/m3/d for 4 days every 4 weeks).
 The mean duration of therapy was 5 months (range, 2 to 24 months).
 A partial response was observed in 29 patients (48.3%) and the disease was stabilized in 18 additional patients (30%).
 Bleomycin failed in 21.6% of patients.
 Therapy had to be discontinued in two patients because of side effects.
 Thus bleomycin as a single agent is a good alternative therapy for AIDS-related KS.
