Middle meatus anstrostomy: patency rates and risk factors.
 Two hundred patients with chronic sinusitis were operated on using functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) techniques.
 These patients were followed closely over 3 years.
 Patency of the endoscopic middle meatotomy was recorded using actuarial life-table methods.
 The overall patency rate of the endoscopic middle meatotomy was 93.55%, and the actuarial patency rate at 36 months was 87.47%.
 The presence of seasonal allergy with nasal polyps was the most important variable in predicting closure.
 Middle turbinectomy was the most important variable in predicting patency.
 Symptoms were evaluated by questionnaire at 1 year.
 Questionnaire data indicate that 96% of these patients are improved or asymptomatic.
