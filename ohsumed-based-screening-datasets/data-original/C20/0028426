Listeria meningitis and pate.
 Listeria meningitis occurred in a 63 year old man who was in complete haematological remission following chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia.
 The patient had followed Department of Health advice to immunocompromised patients and had avoided soft cheeses, cook-chill meals, and salads.
 He had, however, recently eaten pate produced in Belgium.
 This was no longer available for examination but a coincidental survey of pate in the Cardiff area found Listeria monocytogenes in 16 out of 73 samples.
 Pate should be included in the list of foods to be avoided by immunocompromised patients.
