Case report: serendipitous Gaucher's disease presenting as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate due to monoclonal gammopathy.
 Immunoglobulin abnormalities have not been previously noted in totally asymptomatic patients with Gaucher's disease.
 We report a 40-year-old woman in whom Gaucher's disease was diagnosed during investigation for incidentally discovered elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
 Further studies revealed IgG(lambda) monoclonal gammopathy.
 Physical examination and a bone survey disclosed none of the features of Gaucher's disease or multiple myeloma.
 We conclude that in contrast with previous observations, paraproteinemia may occur with Gaucher's disease even in the absence of splenomegaly or any one of the other features of the disease.
