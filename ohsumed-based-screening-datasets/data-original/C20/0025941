Orthotopic liver transplantation, Epstein-Barr virus, cyclosporine, and lymphoproliferative disease: a growing concern.
 Lymphoproliferative disease (LPD) is a well-recognized complication of both solid organ and bone marrow transplantations.
 The occurrence of LPD in these settings is related in part to the use of the immunosuppressive agent cyclosporine.
 We report 12 cases of LPD after orthotopic liver transplantations in 132 pediatric patients.
 Lymphoproliferative disease occurred as one of three clinical syndromes: (1) lymphadenopathic, (2) systemic, and (3) lymphomatous.
 Effective management of LPD with excisional therapy or reduction of immunosuppressive medications or both resulted in the survival of 7 of 12 patients.
 In an alarming and increasing percentage of patients after orthotopic liver transplantation, progressive LPD develops with lethal outcome (5/12 patients).
 Early recognition of LPD and aggressive intervention may improve outcome in this group.
