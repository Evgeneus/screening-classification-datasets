Multiple site avascular necrosis in HIV infected patients.
 We describe avascular necrosis at multiple sites in 2 young adults.
 This is a condition rarely seen except in hypercortisonism or hemoglobinopathies.
 In one case, it occurred in the first trimester of pregnancy.
 No obvious cause of osteonecrosis could be found but both patients were infected by the HIV.
 The role of the latter in the bone necrosis is questionable.
