Non-A, non-B hepatitis specific antibodies directed at host-derived epitope: implication for an autoimmune process [published erratum appears in Lancet 1990 Jan 26;337(8735):252] 
 A cDNA clone (GOR47-1) bearing an epitope with an aminoacid sequence GRRGQKAKSNPNRPL (GOR epitope) was isolated from the plasma of a laboratory chimpanzee infected with human non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) agent.
 The epitope was not encoded by reported sequences of hepatitis C virus (HCV) but instead was coded for by a host cellular sequence.
 An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed for antibodies to the GOR epitope (anti-GOR).
 A patient with acute NANBH produced both IgM and IgG classes of anti-GOR in the acute phase of the illness, with concentrations of IgG class anti-GOR rising when anti-HCV became detectable.
 Anti-GOR was detected in serum from 59 (81%) of 73 patients with chronic NANBH, 40 (65%) of 62 with NANB liver cirrhosis, and 25 (63%) of 40 NANB patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma, but in only less than 10% of patients with chronic liver diseases due to hepatitis B virus, alcohol, or an autoimmune disorder, and in only 2% of voluntary blood donors.
 Circulating HCV-RNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in most patients seropositive for anti-GOR but negative for anti-HCV.
 Detection of anti-GOR would therefore help in the diagnosis of NANBH and in reducing the occurrence of post-transfusion hepatitis.
