Release of the cytokines colony-stimulating factor-1, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and IL-6 by cloned murine vascular smooth muscle cells.
 Vascular smooth muscle cells were cultured from the mesenteric arteries of MRL lpr/lpr, MRL +/+, CBA/J, or C3H/HeJ mice and evaluated for their ability to synthesize a range of cytokines.
 Vascular smooth muscle cells of MRL +/+, MRL lpr/lpr, and CBA/J origin released biologically significant amounts of CSF-1 and IL-6 and relatively low but detectable amounts of granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF) but not IL-2, IL-3, or IL-4.
 Vascular smooth muscle cells of C3H/HeJ origin produced lower amounts of CSF-1 and IL-6, and GM-CSF was barely detectable.
 Production of these cytokines did not require the exogenous growth factors present in FCS and occurred, although at lower levels, in serum-free medium supplemented with insulin, transferrin, and albumin.
 Cloned lines of MRL +/+ vascular smooth muscle cells, with electron microscopic and immunochemical properties of vascular smooth muscle cells, produced CSF-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF, establishing that vascular smooth muscle cells were a direct source of CSF-1, IL-6, and GM-CSF.
 These observations highlight the need for experiments to directly address the question of whether vascular smooth muscle cells constitutively produce these cytokines under physiologic conditions in vivo and suggest that vascular smooth muscle cells may participate actively in inflammation by releasing cytokines that are active on lympho-hemopoietic and other cells.
