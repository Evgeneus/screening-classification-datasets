In vitro tests for the diagnosis of aspirin-sensitive asthma.
 In patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma, no significant changes in plasma beta-thromboglobulin or bicyclic prostaglandin (PG) E2 were observed during aspirin challenge.
 The addition of aspirin to platelet suspensions from patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma produced no detectable chemiluminescence.
 Small concentrations of aspirin generated PGF2 alpha but not PGE2 or PGD2 from plasma in vitro.
 PGF2 alpha levels were significantly higher in plasma from aspirin-sensitive patients and distinguished aspirin-sensitive from aspirin-tolerant patients with asthma.
 The results of this study suggest that the displacement of protein-bound PGF2 alpha may be of importance in the pathogenesis of aspirin-induced asthma.
