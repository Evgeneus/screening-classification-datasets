Skin exudate levels of interleukin 6, interleukin 1 and other cytokines in mycosis fungoides.
 The role of locally released cytokines in inducing lymphocyte activation and infiltration in the skin lesions of mycosis fungoides has been investigated.
 The levels of selected cytokines were measured in chamber fluid samples from lesional and control skin.
 Biologically active interleukin 6 was significantly elevated in lesional samples and a recombinant form of this cytokine was shown to induce lymphocyte migration in an in vitro assay.
 Biologically active interleukin 1 was detected in all control chamber fluid samples.
 Significantly reduced levels of this cytokine were present in lesional samples, which may be the result of the release of preformed material.
 Interleukin 2 and tumour necrosis factor activity, and gamma interferon and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor immunoreactivity, were not detectable in any of the samples.
 Interleukins 1 and 6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of the lesional lymphocyte infiltrates in mycosis fungoides.
