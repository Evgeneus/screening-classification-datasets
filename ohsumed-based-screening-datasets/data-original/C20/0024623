Asthmatic patients with panic disorders: report of three cases with management and outcome.
 Panic disorders, a subgroup of the primary anxiety disorders, have an estimated worldwide prevalence of 2.5% to 5%.
 Although the causes of these disorders have not been completely elucidated, it seems that environmental and genetic factors in addition to central nervous system biochemical abnormalities play important roles.
 Mild to moderate anxiety levels may prove advantageous in the management of asthmatics but when their anxiety level becomes maladaptive, as in the case of panic attacks, their medical care is placed in jeopardy.
 Herein are three case reports of asthmatics who also exhibited panic disorders and their clinical outcome.
 It is concluded that a team approach, involving the primary physician and psychologist or psychiatrist, is beneficial in the long-term management of these patients.
