Nasal lymphoma. A retrospective analysis of 60 cases.
 Sixty cases of nasal lymphomas were reviewed.
 There were 42 men and 18 women.
 The median age was 49 years.
 The histologic types were low grade in four cases, intermediate grade in 33, high grade in seven, and unclassifiable in 16.
 Thirteen cases had features of polymorphic reticulosis.
 The immunophenotype was available in 18 cases and a majority of 67% of them were T-cell.
 Forty-one of them (68%) had clinically localized (Stage I and II) disease which often spread locally to neighboring tissues and they presented predominantly with nasal symptoms.
 Nasal lymphoma appeared to carry a poor prognosis.
 Although our patients with clinically localized disease had significantly better prognosis than those with advanced disease, the 5-year survival of Stage I and II patients was only 55%.
 Chemotherapy did not appear to be more effective than radiotherapy alone in preventing relapses but the patient number was too small to allow a firm conclusion to be made.
 Patients with advanced disease had even poorer prognosis with a 5-year survival of only 17%.
 Innovative therapy has to be developed for these patients.
