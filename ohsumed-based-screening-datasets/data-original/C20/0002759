Oral gold therapy in steroid-dependent asthma, nasal polyposis, and aspirin hypersensitivity.
 Eight patients are described who fulfill the criteria for the triad of asthma, nasal polyposis, and aspirin hypersensitivity who have been treated with oral chrysotherapy from 7 to 17 months.
 Patient diary and symptom scores reflect an overall improvement in global symptoms.
 Monthly pulmonary assessment (spirometry) does not indicate a significant change (improvement or deterioration) but average daily oral prednisone requirements have decreased.
 One of eight patients experienced a minor side effect of treatment but did not require discontinuation of therapy.
 Oral gold therapy may prove to be an alternative therapy in a select population of patients and permit a reduction or discontinuation of oral corticosteroid therapy.
