Epitopes of the p70 and p80 (Ku) lupus autoantigens.
 High titer autoantibodies to the Ku Ag, a DNA-protein complex containing 70- and approximately 80-kDa protein subunits (p70 and p80, respectively), are found in sera of certain patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and related disorders.
 Autoepitopes of the Ku Ag were identified and partially characterized by expressing fragments of the p70 and p80 cDNA as fusion proteins in bacteria.
 Systemic lupus erythematosus sera reacted on immunoblots with at least three epitopes of p70 (amino acids 560-609, 506-535, and 115-467), and three epitopes of p80 (amino acids 682-732, 558-681, and 1-374).
 These six antigenic regions had distinct amino acid sequences, and were also immunologically distinct, as determined by using immunoaffinity-purified auto-antibodies to particular epitopes.
 Detailed mapping of the strongly antigenic region near the C terminus of p70 revealed a complex conformational or discontinuous epitope, the antigenicity of which was abolished by deleting either amino acids 560-571 or 601-609.
 The C terminus of p80 may also contain a discontinuous or conformational epitope(s).
 Although only some sera reacted with p70 or p80 on immunoblots, all sera that immunoprecipitated the native Ku complex reacted with native Ku by ELISA, and inhibited the binding of mAb directed at epitopes of native Ku.
 Taken together, these studies indicate that anti-Ku autoantibodies target a diversity of independent epitopes located on p70, p80, and the intact Ku complex, and that a significant portion of the autoantibodies in most patients' sera is directed against conformational/discontinuous epitopes.
