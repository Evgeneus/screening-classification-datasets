Curdlan sulfate and HIV-1. I. In vitro inhibitory effects of curdlan sulfate on HIV-1 infection.
 Action mechanisms of a newly synthesized polysaccharide, curdlan sulfate (CRDS), on human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection were investigated in vitro using syncytium formation microassay and p24 antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
 These assays measured the titer of infectious virions and the amounts of HIV-1 core antigen p24 in soluble, intraviral, and intracellular forms.
 CRDS treatments were performed for 1 h at 37 degrees C.
 H9 cells pretreated with 0.1 to 100.0 micrograms/ml of CRDS appreciably inhibited HIV-1 infection.
 CRDS-treated HIV-1 virions were less able to infect H9 cells than untreated virions.
 The simultaneous treatment of H9 cells and HIV-1 virions with CRDS induced a significant inhibition of HIV-1 infection, resulting in the temporary disappearance of virions at the highest dose of CRDS.
 In contrast, CRDS treatment of newly HIV-1-infected H9 cells caused a significant decrease in the titer of infectious HIV-1 and the p24 amounts of all three forms, but no absolute elimination.
 Taken together, these results indicate that CRDS may block the binding of the HIV-1 envelope to the H9 cell surface, with emphasis on the high affinity of CRDS to the HIV-1 envelope.
