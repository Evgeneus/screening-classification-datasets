A cross-sectional study of a program for HIV infection control among public house workers.
 We report results of a cross-sectional study of a program for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection control among public house workers in Dar es Salaam.
 Forty percent of the 605 workers sampled had been part of this program, which included behavioral counseling and provision of condoms, for 1 year.
 The remaining 60% were new recruits.
 Program participation was associated with both enhanced condom use (p less than 0.001) and behavioral modification (p less than 0.001).
 Females, and specifically barmaids, were more likely to be condom users but were less likely to have changed their behavior in other respects.
 Seropositivity to both HIV and Treponema pallidum tended to be higher among females, especially the barmaids.
 Since barmaids and waitresses in public houses in Dar es Salaam often engage in prostitution, it is felt that to effect a reduction of numbers of their sexual partners, there is a need to address the social and economic factors underlying high-risk sexual behavior.
