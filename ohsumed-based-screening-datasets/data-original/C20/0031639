Cough-variant asthma in children and adults: case reports and review.
 Two cases of cough-variant asthma are presented, one in an adult and one in a child.
 We discuss the diagnosis, treatment, and course of this common, yet often unrecognized entity.
 The keys to diagnosis are a typical history, clinical suspicion, and subsequent response to bronchodilator therapy.
 Treatment of cough-variant asthma is no different from that of classic asthma.
