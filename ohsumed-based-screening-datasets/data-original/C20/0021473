Caring for women at risk of HIV infection.
 HIV infection and AIDS are having a major and growing impact on women's lives.
 In addition to the usually described risk behaviors, many other medical or behavioral factors should prompt physicians to offer HIV counseling and testing.
 These include unusual or difficult-to-treat gynecologic conditions, unexplained vague systemic symptoms, and most sexually transmitted diseases.
 Use of alcohol and crack cocaine can be associated with a higher risk of HIV infection because of decreased risk reduction behaviors.
 The authors discuss the barriers to risk reduction among women deriving from their unequal social roles in relation to men and provide specific and detailed guidelines for counseling and educating women about HIV infection.
