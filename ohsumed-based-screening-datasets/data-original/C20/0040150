Opportunistic non-Hodgkin's lymphomas among severely immunocompromised HIV-infected patients surviving for prolonged periods on antiretroviral therapy--United States.
 Since 1982, high-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) have been reported among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (1); in 1985, CDC revised the surveillance case definition for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) to include certain high-grade NHLs.
 Recent surveillance findings indicate that NHLs occur among approximately 3% of all adults with AIDS reported to CDC.
 This report characterizes the occurrence of NHLs in a cohort of persons with AIDS or severe HIV infection who have received long-term zidovudine (AZT)-based therapy.
