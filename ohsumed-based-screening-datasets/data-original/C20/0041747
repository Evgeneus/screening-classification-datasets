Identification of the major activity derived from cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which enhances eosinophil viability, as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).
 Eosinophils (EOSs) cultured in the presence of 50% peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-derived culture supernatants remained 67% +/- 7% (mean +/- SEM; n = 5) viable for 7 days.
 In the absence of PBMC supernatant, only 15% +/- 7% of cells remained viable for 7 days.
 PBMC supernatants from six atopic individuals, with eosinophilia, and six normal subjects, with no eosinophilia, were compared for EOS viability-enhancing activity with the same target EOSs.
 Optimal conditions for the production of viability-enhancing activity by mononuclear cells were established as a 24-hour culture period, with a concentration of 2 x 10(6) cells per milliliter.
 Comparison of monocyte-enriched and lymphocyte-enriched culture supernatants for the production of the EOS viability-enhancing activity indicated that both cell types released the factor.
 C-18 Sep-Pak separation of the PBMC culture supernatant yielded a major EOS viability-enhancing activity in the aqueous eluent, suggesting a hydrophilic molecule.
 This major activity was neutralized by a specific antibody to granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor but was unaffected by specific antibodies to interleukin-3 and interleukin-5.
 A second, minor viability-enhancing activity was observed in the 100% methanol fraction, indicating the presence of a more hydrophobic molecule.
 The supernatants from the PBMCs of the atopic individuals consistently enhanced EOS survival to a greater extent than supernatants from the PBMCs of the normal, nonatopic individuals.
