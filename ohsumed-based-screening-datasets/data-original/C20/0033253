Subretinal neovascularization in systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Choroidal involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) occurs infrequently.
 We describe a patient with unusual manifestations of lupus oculopathy: prominent choroidal vasculopathy associated with multiple chorioretinal scars and subretinal neovascularization in the macular area.
 Choroidal disease was the primary feature of ocular involvement.
 SLE should be considered in the differential diagnosis in patients with inflammatory choroidal lesions.
