Complications of central venous catheters in pediatric patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Medical records of 18 pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients with 24 central venous catheters (CVCs) were reviewed to determine the rates and types of CVC complications and to evaluate the influence of selected social factors, absolute granulocyte counts and CD4+ T cell counts on the rate of CVC infections.
 CVCs were in place for a total of 4233 days.
 CVCs were used for blood sampling, administration of blood products and infusions of intravenous immune globulin, parenteral nutrition and medications.
 Complications included catheter-related infections (8 episodes; with a rate of 1.9/1000 CVC days), occlusions (15 episodes) and unplanned catheter removals (9 episodes).
 Reduced CD4+ T cell counts were not predictive of CVC infection.
 The CVC infection rate in our pediatric acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients was similar to rates reported in children with cancer and adults with cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
