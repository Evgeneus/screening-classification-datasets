Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Kaposi's sarcoma of the male genitalia: management with radiation therapy.
 Kaposi's sarcoma of the genitalia is an infrequent complication of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but it often is difficult to manage.
 A total of 19 men (mean age 39 years) with penile and/or scrotal lesions underwent radiotherapy at dosages of 600 to 3,000 cGy.
 in fractions of 150 to 800 cGy.
 Of the patients 6 achieved a complete and 10 a partial response, while 2 had no response and 1 died too soon after treatment to be evaluated.
 Recurrences were noted in 8 patients, 7 of whom received additional radiation (1 patient had 2 recurrences and both responded).
 Of the retreatments 3 effected complete and 4 partial responses.
 Over-all, of 25 evaluable treatment courses 9 complete (36%) and 14 partial (56%) responses yielded a total response rate of 92%.
 There was 1 complication, a skin ulceration.
 Radiation therapy is well tolerated and will result in effective palliation in the majority of patients with Kaposi's sarcoma of the genitalia.
