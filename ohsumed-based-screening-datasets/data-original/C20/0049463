Capsaicin inhibits airway hyperresponsiveness but not lipoxygenase activity or eosinophilia after repeated aerosolized antigen in guinea pigs.
 To evaluate the role of tachykinins in airway hyperresponsiveness following repeated aerosolized antigen challenge in guinea pigs, we treated 12 guinea pigs with capsaicin (105.6 mg cumulative dose given subcutaneously over 5 days) after sensitization to ovalbumin (OA) and before three repeated OA aerosol challenges per wk for 4 to 5 wk.
 Ten guinea pigs received identical OA sensitization and challenges without capsaicin treatment, and four of eight nonsensitized controls received capsaicin followed by saline challenges.
 Capsaicin treatment did not alter antibody responses to OA as assessed by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis, nor did it alter lipoxygenase products from OA-stimulated bronchial tissue in vitro.
 Capsaicin completely inhibited the increased pulmonary resistance (RL) to acetylcholine produced by repeated aerosolized OA, whereas it did not alter baseline RL or acetylcholine responses of controls.
 Capsaicin did not alter airway eosinophilia induced by repeated aerosolized OA.
 We conclude that neuropeptides play an important role in antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness without altering antibody levels, lipoxygenase mediator production, or airway eosinophilia.
