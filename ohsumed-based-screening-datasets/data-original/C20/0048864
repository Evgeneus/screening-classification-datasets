Nutritional support of patients with AIDS.
 Investigators are now predicting that nearly 100% of the estimated 12 million HIV-positive persons in the world will develop AIDS.
 Most persons with AIDS will experience progressive weight loss and malnutrition prior to death.
 Because nutritional therapy clearly has a beneficial effect on the clinical course and immunologic status of the critically ill general population, one must not disregard its potential for benefits in the treatment of persons with AIDS.
 As a result of the escalating cost of medical therapy and the inevitable AIDS epidemic, the nutritional management of persons with AIDS must be simple to administer and cost effective.
 The author has developed nutritional screening criteria to identify those patients who would most benefit from nutritional therapy.
 Because these patients differ in their nutritional requirements, diet tolerance, and degree of gut dysfunction, there is no single nutritional therapy that can be used routinely to treat all malnourished persons with AIDS.
