Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma in a patient with adrenal insufficiency.
 Angiotropic large-cell lymphoma is a rare disorder characterized by a proliferation of malignant lymphoid cells within the lumina of small vessels.
 The skin and central nervous system are typically affected; however, involvement of other organs has been described.
 We document an unusual case of this disorder in a patient who suffered clinically significant adrenal insufficiency and subsequently died.
 Autopsy disclosed angiotropic large-cell lymphoma involving both adrenal glands.
