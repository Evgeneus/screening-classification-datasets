An evaluation of the use of the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System of New York State as a resource planning tool for HIV infection.
 Hospital discharge records of patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in New York State were studied to determine whether cases of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were identified.
 We estimate that as many as 13 percent of hospitalizations of patients with PCP in 1987 and 10 percent of those in 1988 were not appropriately identified as HIV related.
 Identification of PCP as HIV related was a function of a hospital's volume of PCP admissions.
