Detection of infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 in infants by an anti-HIV immunoglobulin A assay using recombinant proteins.
 To diagnose infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) soon after birth in infants born to HIV type 1-infected women, we developed antiviral IgA Western blot and dot blot assays with recombinant HIV-1 proteins.
 Thirty-three infants born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and nine infants born to HIV-1-seronegative intravenous drug-abusing mothers were followed prospectively.
 Infection was documented by positive virus culture.
 Results with the polymerase chain reaction were used for comparison.
 Twelve infants were found infected with HIV-1; the earliest age at which cultures became positive ranged from birth to 31 weeks of age.
 Of the 12 culture-positive infants, 10 had anti-HIV IgA antibodies detectable initially between birth (cord blood) and 27 weeks of age.
 Anti-HIV IgA was not present in the uninfected infants or in the control subjects, either by Western blot or dot blot assays.
 Testing for anti-HIV IgA antibodies with recombinant HIV-1 proteins is an effective method for detecting viral infection in newborn and young infants.
