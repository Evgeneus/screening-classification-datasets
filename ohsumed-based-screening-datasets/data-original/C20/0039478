Survival and disinfectant inactivation of the human immunodeficiency virus: a critical review.
 The possibility of contracting acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) through accidental or inapparent parenteral exposure to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has raised concerns among recipients of blood products, health-care professionals, and others who have contact either with HIV or with AIDS patients.
 Along with these concerns has come an increasing interest in the physical and chemical methods that may be used to inactivate HIV in blood products and other contaminated fluids as well as on contaminated objects and surfaces.
 This review critically examines the available information on the survival of HIV and the methods used for its inactivation, particularly those that rely on chemical disinfection.
 Although the risk of acquiring HIV from contaminated materials may be slight compared with that of acquiring other blood-borne pathogens, such as hepatitis B virus, the effectiveness of disinfectants used under clinical conditions may have been overestimated.
