CT of AIDS-related lymphoma.
 A spectrum of CT findings in patients with AIDS-related lymphoma (ARL) is illustrated herein.
 When a solid mass anywhere in the body is encountered in a patient with AIDS, lymphoma must be considered in the differential diagnosis.
 Although the CT findings alone generally are not enough for a specific diagnosis of lymphoma, this frequently will be suggested as the most likely diagnosis, facilitating further workup.
 CT-guided biopsy is useful in providing tissue diagnosis in many cases.
