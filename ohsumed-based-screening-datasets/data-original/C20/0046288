Successful use of pooled sera to determine HIV-1 seroprevalence in Zaire with development of cost-efficiency models.
 To determine the accuracy and cost efficiency of pooling sera prior to HIV-1 testing, sera from 8,000 Kinshasa factory workers and their spouses were screened individually (2.44% seropositive) and in 800 pools of 10 sera each.
 There were no false-negative or false-positive pools, resulting in a calculated seroprevalence estimate of 2.42%.
 Further testing of all sera in positive pools can identify HIV-positive individuals.
 These applications were modeled to compare the cost-efficiency of pooling with individual testing under different conditions.
 The results suggest that pooling provides an alternative test format for use in both developing and industrialized countries when the seroprevalence and/or the marginal cost of obtaining a sample are sufficiently low.
 For our cohort, testing only the pools for seroprevalence estimation resulted in a 78% cost saving compared with individual testing; pooling with subsequent identification of individual seropositives represented a 56% cost reduction.
