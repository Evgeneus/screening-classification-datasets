Large-cell lymphoma presenting with hepatic sinusoidal infiltration.
 We describe a case of large-cell lymphoma of B-cell phenotype with clinicopathologic features resembling malignant histiocytosis.
 The clinical presentation was characterized by fever, anemia, thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and elevated liver enzyme levels.
 These features and the finding of a predominantly sinusoidal infiltrate of neoplastic cells on liver biopsy raised the suspicion of malignant histiocytosis.
 The patient subsequently developed supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, which proved to be due to a diffuse large-cell lymphoma.
 Immunophenotypic studies performed on the lymph node and the original liver biopsy specimen established the B-cell nature of neoplastic cells at both sites.
 This case highlights a rare pattern of hepatic involvement by large-cell lymphoma, and contrasts the latter with other hematologic disorders associated with hepatic sinusoidal infiltrates.
