Shedding of the soluble form of the CD8 complex by CD8+/HLA-DR+ cells in HIV-1-infected patients.
 High levels of the soluble form of the CD8 molecule (sCD8) are detectable in the serum of HIV-1-infected patients.
 To investigate the mechanisms accountable for the release of this molecule we evaluated the presence of sCD8 in the supernatants obtained from in vitro cultures of highly purified CD8 cells isolated from 20 HIV-1-infected patients.
 At resting conditions cultured CD8 cells from HIV-1-infected patients released low amounts of sCD8; no statistically significant differences were observed between unstimulated cultures from HIV-1-seropositive patients and from HIV-1-seronegative subjects at risk for HIV-1 infection or normal healthy controls.
 Following in vitro activation of highly purified CD8 cells with a series of stimulatory agents, including phorbol myristate acetate, phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and recombinant interleukin-2, CD8 cells of HIV-1-infected patients significantly increased the shedding of sCD8.
 By expressing the results of activation-related release index (ARRI = sCD8 levels detected in the cultures with stimulatory agent/sCD8 levels detected in the unstimulated cultures), significantly higher values were observed upon PHA stimulation in HIV-1-infected patients than in control subjects.
 In order to identify the cell subset responsible for the enhanced release of sCD8 by PHA-stimulated cultures, we correlated the amounts of sCD8 detected in the supernatants with the phenotypic profile of CD8+ cells recovered from the cultures.
 A significant relationship was demonstrated between the percentage of CD8+/HLA-DR+ lymphocytes and sCD8 levels.
