Alveolar macrophages from patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex constitutively synthesize and release tumor necrosis factor alpha.
 To verify the hypothesis that alveolar macrophages (AMs) from patients infected with HIV-1 could synthesize and release TNF alpha, AMs recovered from the BAL fluid of 11 patients with seropositive HIV-1 (six with AIDS and five with ARC) were tested in vitro for their ability to destroy TNF alpha-susceptible targets.
 Furthermore, the presence of TNF alpha was assessed in AM-conditioned supernatants on the basis of their cytotoxic activity and by using an immunoenzymatic test and immunoblotting.
 Transcription of the TNF alpha gene in AMs was also studied by means of the Northern blot analysis.
 AMs freshly recovered from patients infected with HIV-1 exhibited high levels of cell-mediated cytotoxicity against U937 targets, and the addition of a polyclonal anti-TNF alpha antibody resulted in a significant inhibition of the target lysis.
 Cell-free supernatants conditioned by unstimulated AMs exerted high levels of cytotoxic activity against TNF alpha-sensitive targets, whereas duplicate, neutralization experiments performed in the presence of an anti-TNF alpha antibody proved that the observed cytotoxic activity was mostly mediated by TNF alpha.
 The presence of high amounts of TNF alpha in the conditioned media was confirmed by the immunoenzymatic test.
 In addition, the immunoblot analysis showed that the TNF alpha released by AMs has a Mr 17,000 band, identical to a standard preparation of recombinant TNF alpha.
 The Northern blot demonstrated that unstimulated AMs express detectable levels of mRNA transcripts for TNF alpha.
 Taken together, our data support the concept that AMs from patients with HIV-1 infection constitutively release TNF alpha.
