Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia: effect of corticosteroid treatment on radiographic appearance in a patient with AIDS.
 Dramatic radiographic and clinical resolution of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia occurred in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome after corticosteroids were added to his standard antimicrobial treatment regimen.
 No cause other than P carinii infection could be demonstrated for the patient's pulmonary disease, and his clinical and radiographic abnormalities waxed and waned in synchrony with decreases and increases in his dose of corticosteroids.
