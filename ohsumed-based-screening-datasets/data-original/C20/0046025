Pure red cell aplasia due to parvovirus B19 infection in a man with HIV infection.
 Infection by parvovirus B19 is common and may become chronic if the patient is immunocompromised, leading to persistent erythroid hypoplasia.
 Parvovirus should be added to the list of pathogens that can complicate the course of HIV infection and should be considered in the evaluation of severe anemia or red cell aplasia in any immunocompromised patient.
