Rate of CD4 decline and neuropsychological performance in HIV infection.
 This study examined the relationship between performance on a battery of neuropsychologic tasks and rate of CD4 lymphocyte decline in 47 gay or bisexual men infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1.
 Subjects were volunteers for a longitudinal study of the human immunodeficiency virus infection and were not selected because of neuropsychiatric symptoms.
 Subjects were at all stages of illness, although most were asymptomatic.
 Faster rates of decline in percent CD4 lymphocyte were related to poorer performance on measures of memory and reaction time.
 This relationship was independent of stage of illness and CD4 level at the time of neuropsychologic examination, and was not due to medication effects.
 The rate of percent CD4 lymphocyte cell loss is associated with and may represent a risk factor for the development of the human immunodeficiency virus-related neurobehavioral deficit.
