Pharmacist advice to asthmatics regarding antihistamine use.
 Due to the frequency of asthmatics having concurrent allergic symptoms, patients may seek relief from antihistamines, which are currently labeled with warnings against their use in asthmatics.
 A survey was conducted in the Chicago area to evaluate the advice rendered by pharmacists regarding the use of antihistamines in asthmatics and their opinions about the current product labeling.
 Thirty percent of the surveys were returned.
 Nearly half (48%) of the surveyed pharmacists advise their asthmatic customers to avoid antihistamines and 75% of this group recommend avoidance because they believe antihistamines worsen asthmatic symptoms, despite the lack of sufficient clinical data to support this concern.
 Only 17% of pharmacists advise that antihistamines pose no problems for asthmatics.
 The latter group is the most aware that there is controversy surrounding the current labeling.
 Overall, half the pharmacists surveyed believe the current labeling is not appropriate for patients with asthma.
 Until the labeling is revised, physicians should be aware that pharmacists may advise their asthmatics against using antihistamines even though antihistamines should be only contraindicated in cases of proven adverse reactions.
