Inpatients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex: economic inpact on hospitals in North Carolina.
 To determine the economic impact of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or AIDS-related complex (ARC) cases on North Carolina hospitals, we collected inpatient data from all North Carolina hospitals on charges and number of patients discharged with these diagnoses.
 More than 97% of the state's hospitals responded to the survey for the study year (1987-1988).
 There were 540 AIDS/ARC discharges from 58 North Carolina general hospitals and 125 AIDS/ARC discharges from 13 other types of hospitals, for a statewide total of 665 patients.
 The total general hospital charges for AIDS/ARC inpatients in North Carolina were approximately $7.7 million per year, and almost $2 million of these charges were uncompensated by any insurance.
 The greatest burden of cost for this care was borne disproportionately by 15 of the 58 general hospitals, accounting for 82% of the discharges.
