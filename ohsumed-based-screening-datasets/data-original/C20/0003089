Amyloidosis in Behcet's syndrome.
 We investigated the frequency of amyloidosis in 99 consecutive patients (65 men and 34 women) with Behcet's syndrome.
 Rectal biopsies performed on all patients showed no amyloidosis by polarizing microscopy.
 The results of urinalyses were normal in all patients.
 Among 1,130 patients registered in our Behcet's syndrome outpatient clinic, 5 were found to have systemic amyloidosis, all of the AA type.
