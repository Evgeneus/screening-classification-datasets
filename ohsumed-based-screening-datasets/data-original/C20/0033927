Response to treatment with the leukocyte-derived immunomodulator IMREG-1 in immunocompromised patients with AIDS-related complex. A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
 OBJECTIVE: To determine if a 6-month course of therapy with IMREG-1, a leukocyte-derived immunomodulator, slows disease progression in patients with AIDS-related complex.
 DESIGN: Randomized, double-blind trial.
 SETTING: Five academic- and three community-based clinics.
 PATIENTS: Immunocompromised patients (143) with HIV.
 INTERVENTIONS: IMREG-1 or placebo every 2 weeks (13 doses).
 MAIN RESULTS: Twelve of forty-eight patients on placebo and 5 of 95 patients on IMREG-1 experienced adverse events (AIDS-defining opportunistic infection or neoplasm, wasting syndrome, HIV-associated encephalopathy, or peripheral sensory neuropathy).
 Based on an intention-to-treat analysis, Kaplan-Meier event probabilities were 26% for the placebo group and 6% for the IMREG-1 group (P less than 0.001); based on the Cox proportional hazards model, the relative risk for patients on placebo compared with patients on IMREG-1 was 5.1 (95% CI, 1.8 to 14.8).
 The frequency of symptoms significantly increased from baseline in patients receiving placebo.
 The mean decrease in CD4+ cells from baseline was 80 x 10(6) cells/L in the placebo group and 29 x 10(6) cells/L in patients on IMREG-1, with 20% (8) and 38% (32) of patients, respectively, showing a trend toward an increase (P = 0.04).
 In patients receiving IMREG-1, the size and rate of delayed hypersensitivity responses were larger than in the placebo group.
 CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AIDS-related complex experienced fewer adverse events and constitutional symptoms after IMREG-1 treatment.
 The slower loss of CD4+ cells and increased size and rate of delayed hypersensitivity responses most likely reflect the effect of IMREG-1 on the immune system.
 No toxicity related to IMREG-1 administration was observed.
