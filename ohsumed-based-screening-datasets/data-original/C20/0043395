The usefulness of routine screening for salivary secretory component.
 Secretory IgA is a dimeric immunoglobulin found in association with the J chain and secretory component (SC).
 It is secreted into saliva and other mucosal fluids and is involved in mucosal immunity.
 The absence of either SC or secretory IgA may be associated with recurrent sinopulmonary infections, diarrhea, and failure to thrive.
 We present a retrospective study of 1262 samples from 877 patients who were screened for salivary IgA, SC, and serum immunoglobulin levels.
 Forty-six patients (5.2%) of those tested were found to have absent salivary SC.
 Although only 19 of these patients (41.3%) could be retested, all were found to have SC on repeated testing.
 Of the patients whose initial samples of saliva exhibited no SC, 15% (6/46) had low or absent serum IGA (less than 10 mg/dl) in contrast to 8.6% (66/769) of patients whose saliva contained detectable SC, but this was not statistically significant (chi 2 = 1.93; p greater than 0.1).
 There was also no correlation between serum immunoglobulin levels and the absence of SC.
 Because of the rarity of salivary SC deficiency, routine screening is not valuable.
