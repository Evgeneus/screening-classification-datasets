Aberrant MT2 positivity distinguishes follicular lymphoma from reactive follicular hyperplasia in B5- and formalin-fixed paraffin sections.
 Often, it is difficult to distinguish follicular lymphoma from reactive follicular hyperplasia histologically.
 Immunotypic evidence of monoclonality cannot be demonstrated routinely or reliably in routine paraffin-embedded sections.
 To determine whether a panel of monoclonal antibodies reactive with lymphoid cells in paraffin-embedded sections might be useful in distinguishing these confusing proliferations, the authors examined 45 follicular lymphomas and 30 follicular hyperplasia with the following antibodies; L26, B2, MT1, MT2, and UCHL-I.
 All sections were routine paraffin preparations from formalin- or B5-fixed tissue and were immunostained with the avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique.
 Ninety-two percent of the B5-fixed and 77% of the formalin-fixed lymphomas were MT2 positive.
 None of the reactive hyperplasias stained positively, and none of the other antibodies demonstrated consistent differences between these benign and malignant proliferations.
 MT2 marks interfollicular T cells and mantle-zone B cells in normal lymph nodes but does not mark normal germinal centers; this staining pattern is retained in reactive hyperplasia.
 However, paradoxically, in most follicular lymphomas the neoplastic germinal centers show aberrant MT2 positively.
 The authors conclude that MT2 may be useful in distinguishing follicular lymphoma from follicular hyperplasia in paraffin sections.
