Sequential autonomic function tests in HIV infection.
 Cardiovascular autonomic function tests were carried out on 22 men at varying stages of HIV infection.
 Thirteen were asymptomatic, seven had persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, and two had Kaposi's sarcoma.
 Pupil cycle times were also measured.
 Except for one subject with definite autonomic abnormalities, all the rest had almost normal test results.
 There were no correlations between individual tests of immune function and the autonomic test results.
 The tests were repeated 9-18 months later in 12 men, four of whom were taking zidovudine at that time.
 Although there was evidence of progression of HIV-associated immune dysfunction, there was no significant deterioration in autonomic function.
 In the single patient with abnormal autonomic function, these changes appeared to reverse on treatment with zidovudine.
