Characteristics of, and HIV infection among, women served by publicly funded HIV counseling and testing services--United States, 1989-1990.
 In 1990, the number of reported acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) cases among women in the United States exceeded 15,000, an increase of 34% from 1989 (1).
 Public health surveillance of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS epidemic has included monitoring of publicly funded voluntary counseling and testing (CT) programs, such as the voluntary client record system (representing 43% of all reported CT visits) that collects detailed information for each CT visit.
 This report summarizes findings based on information from the client record system for women who received public CT services during 1989 and 1990.
