Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia: a case report.
 The authors report a case of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, in whom massive pulmonary embolism occurred in spite of heparin anticoagulation.
 Successful pulmonary thrombectomy was carried out under cardiopulmonary bypass, with limitation of platelet clumping during bypass by aggregation inhibitors.
 This report is a comprehensive contribution to a better understanding of this rare immunoallergic complication of heparin administration, with a high incidence of serious thromboembolic events.
 The optimal management for cases of unavoidable reexposure to heparin is discussed.
