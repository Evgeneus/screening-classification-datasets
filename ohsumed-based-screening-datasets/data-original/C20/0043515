Medicaid eligibility patterns for persons with AIDS in California and New York, 1982-1987.
 An analysis of Medicaid eligibility patterns for persons with AIDS (PWAs) was conducted, based on the longitudinal Medicaid eligibility histories of 1,314 AIDS decedents in California and 6,273 AIDS decedents in New York between 1982 and 1987.
 The study analyzed what eligibility groups or categories and which financial standards PWAs were using to qualify for Medicaid.
 States have many options with regard to the categories of people they cover under Medicaid and where they set their financial thresholds.
 The study findings are useful in showing how these policy decisions affect PWAs.
 A major conclusion of the study is the importance of medically needy coverage for PWAs.
 Medically needy coverage, which is optional to states, opens up Medicaid to persons of any income level, assuming their medical expenses are high enough.
 The study also found that PWAs who qualify only through the medically needy provisions have much shorter enrollment and lower lifetime Medicaid expenditures than other PWAs on Medicaid.
 Presumably, most medically needy only enrollees have other sources of health care coverage in the early stages of the illness.
 Study data also suggested significant administrative obstacles for PWAs in dealing with the Medicaid eligibility process.
 Finally, an unexpected study result was that all states may not be aggressively utilizing federal Medicaid financing options for covering the medical assistance expenditures for a significant proportion of the low-income AIDS population.
