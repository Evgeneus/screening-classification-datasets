Hashimoto's encephalopathy: a steroid-responsive disorder associated with high anti-thyroid antibody titers--report of 5 cases.
 We describe 5 patients with a relapsing encephalopathy in association with Hashimoto's disease and high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies.
 The presentation is usually with a subacute onset of confusion, alteration in conscious level, and focal or generalized seizures.
 The relapsing course, association with myoclonus or tremulousness, and episodes of stroke-like deterioration are characteristic features.
 The long-term prognosis is favorable with steroid therapy, though additional immunosuppressive therapy may be required.
 Neurologic investigation typically shows a diffusely abnormal EEG, high CSF protein level without pleocytosis, and normal brain CT and cerebral angiogram.
 Isotope brain scan may show patchy abnormal uptake.
 Hashimoto's encephalopathy should be recognized as a definite neurologic entity and added to the list of CNS complications of thyroid disease.
