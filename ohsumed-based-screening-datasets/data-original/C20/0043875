The role of gene rearrangements for antigen receptors in the diagnosis of lymphoma obtained by fine-needle aspiration. A study of 63 cases with concomitant immunophenotyping.
 To assess the efficacy of performing genotyping in addition to immunophenotyping as an adjunct to cytologic diagnosis, 63 consecutive patients with fine-needle aspirates of lymphoproliferative lesions who had concurrent immunophenotyping and genotyping performed on fine-needle aspirate cell suspensions were studied.
 Thirty-nine of 63 specimens (62%) that appeared to contain non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and that proved to be of B-cell lineage by genotyping were accurately phenotyped and shown to be monotypic for immunoglobulin light chains by cell suspension immunocytochemistry.
 Genotyping facilitated lineage assignment and/or confirmed clonality in 17 of 63 specimens (27%) that were difficult to determine based on morphologic data.
 These include cases of atypical lymphoid proliferations with polyclonal or inconclusive markers (n = 6), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (n = 3), extracutaneous mycosis fungoides (n = 1), lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 4), null cell lymphoma (n = 1), and specimens with equivocal or technically unsatisfactory markers (n = 2).
 Based on these results, it is proposed that genotyping for lineage assignment and/or clonality be performed to include cases of atypical lymphoid proliferations, T-cell malignant neoplasms, lymphoid malignant neoplasms with equivocal markers, and differentiation of lymphoid from nonlymphoid neoplasms.
 Genotyping by antigen-receptor gene rearrangement appears to be redundant in cases with mature B-cell phenotypes that demonstrate monoclonality by immunophenotyping.
