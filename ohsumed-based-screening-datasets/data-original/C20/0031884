Long-term survival of patients with AIDS, Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, and respiratory failure.
 OBJECTIVE.--To evaluate the long-term survival of patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit, Cook County Hospital, Chicago, Ill, with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.
 DESIGN.--Cohort study over a 4-year period.
 SETTING.--Municipal teaching hospital.
 PATIENTS.--Seventy-three consecutive patients who had 75 episodes of P carinii pneumonia and acute respiratory failure were followed up from the time of hospital admission until their deaths or the termination of the study.
 OUTCOME MEASURES.--Duration of survival from the time of initial hospital admission with diagnoses of P carinii pneumonia and acute respiratory failure.
 RESULTS.--Consistent with recent reports of improved short-term outcome, the immediate hospital survival was 47% (35/75).
 The 1-year survival was 37% (95% confidence interval, 26% to 49%).
 Two patients have survived for 40 months.
 Almost three quarters of the patients who survived hospitalization lived for at least 1 year.
 CONCLUSIONS.--The long-term prognosis for patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, P carinii pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure is now substantially better than anticipated.
 Respiratory failure due to P carinii pneumonia does not necessarily signify the terminal phase of human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 Accordingly, patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, P carinii pneumonia, and acute respiratory failure can be appropriate candidates for life support in medical intensive care units.
