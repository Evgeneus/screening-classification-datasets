Aberrant expression of cytokine genes in peritoneal macrophages from mice infected with LP-BM5 MuLV, a murine model of AIDS.
 Mice infected with LP-BM5 murine leukemia virus (MuLV) develop a syndrome denoted as murine AIDS.
 Macrophages harvested from the peritoneal cavities of these mice at 4 or 9 wk postinoculation with LP-BM5 MuLV were analyzed by Northern hybridization for the presence of the defective LP-BM5 virus and their ability to synthesize various cytokines upon induction with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) or (LPS).
 Neither IFN-alpha or IFN-beta was found to be constitutively expressed in LP-BM5-infected macrophages and in NDV induction studies, and the levels of biologically active IFN-alpha and its mRNA were found to be lower in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages than in the macrophages from uninfected controls.
 Similarly, after NDV or LPS induction, the levels of TNF mRNA and TNF protein were significantly lower in LP-BM5-infected macrophages than in macrophages from uninfected mice.
 The LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages constitutively expressed low levels of IL-1 beta, and when induced with LPS, the relative levels of IL-1 beta were significantly higher in infected than in uninfected macrophages.
 Although no constitutive expression of IL-6 was detected, the levels of IL-6 mRNA induced with NDV were higher in LP-BM5 MuLV-infected macrophages than in controls.
 Thus, we found alterations in the expression of selected cytokines in macrophages from mice inoculated with LP-BM5 MuLV rather than a general deregulation of all cytokine expression.
 These results show that macrophages infected with the defective LP-BM5 virus respond differently to NDV- or LPS-stimulation and suggest that aberrant expression of certain cytokine genes may play a role in the immunopathologic condition in mice with murine AIDS.
