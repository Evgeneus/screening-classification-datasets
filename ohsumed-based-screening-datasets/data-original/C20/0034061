The reliability of self-reported sexual behaviour.
 The quality of data collected by surveys of sexual behaviour may be subject to sources of error involving reliability, validity, and non-participation bias.
 A preliminary study of sexual behaviour, including perception of risk for HIV infection, knowledge of HIV transmission and attitudes towards AIDS, was conducted in a genitourinary medicine clinic.
 The sample comprised 767 patients attending clinic over a 3-month period; comparisons were made between different methods of data collection (questionnaires and interviews) and between responders and non-responders.
 High levels of agreement were found between questionnaire and interview.
 Some sexual behaviours were more frequently reported at interview.
 No significant differences were found between responders and non-responders to either questionnaire or interview.
