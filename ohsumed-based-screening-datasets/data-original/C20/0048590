HIV-1 infection complicated by food allergy and allergic gastroenteritis: a case report.
 A 34-year-old female with HIV-1 infection detected by positive serology in 1983 subsequently developed acute granulomatous interstitial pneumonitis, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, and angioedema associated with the ingestion of vanilla ice cream and tangerines.
 The enteritis and angioedema symptoms appeared to respond to large doses of oral sodium cromoglycate.
 Sera collected over several years before clinical symptoms revealed a sharp rise of IgE antibody in 1985 and a subsequent decline to baseline values followed by markedly increased levels of IgE antibodies to a number of inhalant and food allergens.
 The findings suggest disordered IgE antibody regulation as a consequence of HIV-1 infection and as a cause of allergic manifestations including eosinophilic gastroenteritis and food-induced angioedema.
