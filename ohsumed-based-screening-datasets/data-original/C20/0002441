Protein-losing enteropathy in systemic lupus erythematosus associated with intestinal lymphangiectasia.
 This case report concerns a young woman with systemic lupus erythematosus who presented with a protein-losing enteropathy.
 Intestinal biopsy revealed lymphangiectasia.
 Mesenteric lymph nodes showed paracortical lymphoid depletion and multiple small sinusoids.
 Elevated cholesterol levels and normal lymphocyte counts characterized the peripheral blood samples.
 Lymph nodes, though enlarged, showed no evidence of obstructive pathology.
 No secondary cause of lymphangiectasia could be identified.
 The patient exhibited antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to dsDNA at the onset, and then, 5 yr later, the classic features of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
 The lymphocytopenia and hypolipidemia that characterizes lymphangiectasia is not a feature of the SLE cases reported to date.
 Furthermore, the mechanism for the dilated lymphatics and villous edema is more likely immunological than mechanical disruption of lymphatics.
