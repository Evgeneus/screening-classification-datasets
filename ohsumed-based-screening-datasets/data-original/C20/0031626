Abnormal response to a human B cell growth factor in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI).
 Patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVI) generally fail to produce antigen-specific IgG.
 We have identified a lymphokine called high molecular weight B cell growth factor (HMW BCGF) that expands an IgG-producing subpopulation of B cells.
 The B cells from 15 of 16 patients with CVI evaluated in this study failed to proliferate to HMW BCGF, although they proliferated normally to another BCGF, low molecular weight BCGF (LMW BCGF).
 Nevertheless, 11 patients had more than normal numbers of B cells expressing HMW BCGF receptors.
 The HMW BCGF receptors on the B cells of three patients with CVI studied were the same molecular weight as the normal HMW BCGF receptor.
 Examination of B cells from four patients with CVI for intracellular signals produced in normal B cells after stimulation with HMW BCGF revealed that B cells from patients with CVI failed to developed significant increases in cyclic adenosine monophosphate or phosphoinositides after HMW BCGF stimulation.
 However, cytoplasmic phosphoinositides in the B cells from all four patients with CVI were already increased above what is observed in normal B cells before stimulation with HMW BCGF (either freshly isolated or Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I-activated B cell).
 Thus, the failure of B cells from patients with CVI to respond to HMW BCGF may be related to their abnormal activation in vivo.
 Since HMW BCGF expands a subpopulation of memory B cells, the inability of CVI B cells to respond to HMW BCGF may contribute to their abnormal secondary responses to antigens.
