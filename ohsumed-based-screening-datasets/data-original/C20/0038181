Interferon-induced chronic active hepatitis?
 A 54-year-old man with chronic B hepatitis was treated with interferon alfa.
 Despite resolution of the hepatitis B viral infection, he experienced severe jaundice, ascites, and encephalopathy.
 Further work-up showed hyperglobulinemia, chiefly immunoglobulin G, and positive smooth muscle and anti-nuclear antibodies.
 Because of these "autoimmune" features, the patient was treated with prednisone.
 One month later, a significant clinical and biochemical improvement was observed.
 A possible autoimmune mechanism induced by interferon alfa is proposed as the cause for the perpetuation of the necroinflammatory activity.
