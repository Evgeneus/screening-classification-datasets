Autosomal dominant inheritance of autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin--studies in families not selected for autoimmune thyroid disease.
 Recently the tendency to produce autoantibodies to thyroid peroxidase (TPO Ab) and thyroglobulin (Tg Ab) was shown to be inherited as an autosomal dominant characteristic in women but not in men.
 Because of potential bias in this study which was carried out in families with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), the inheritance of thyroid autoantibodies has been evaluated in 49 families unselected for autoimmune thyroid disease.
 Among these families (24 with facioscapulohumeral disease, 10 with Friedreich's ataxia, and 15 with schizophrenia) the prevalences of TPO Ab and Tg Ab were 27.8% and 26.7%, respectively, in women and 9.2% and 11.7%, respectively, in men.
 In 40 families where one or more individual had TPO Ab and/or Tg Ab, segregation analysis showed that the tendency to make antibodies was consistent with a Mendelian dominant trait in women but not in men.
 In young women, however, the prevalence of both TPO Ab and Tg Ab increased with age, rising from 14% and 10%, respectively, at age 15-24 to 35% and 40% at age 35-44.
 As this is inconsistent with a simple dominant hypothesis, a further segregation analysis by age was carried out in the families unselected for thyroid disease together with 16 pedigrees with AITD previously studied and two additional large AITD families.
 The results of the combined analysis provided strong support for the hypothesis of dominant inheritance but also showed significant reduction in gene expression among women aged 15-24 yr.
