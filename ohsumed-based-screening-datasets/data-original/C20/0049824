Designing an AIDS information campaign to reach intravenous drug users and sex partners.
 Intravenous drug users are currently the second largest group to have developed the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in the United States and Europe.
 Clearly, health communication plays an important role in the development of AIDS prevention programs directed at IV drug users.
 However, few public information campaigns have been developed to reach IV drug users or their sexual partners.
 In a recent campaign directed at these groups, the selection of messages to be used was based both on theory and on research into multi-media public information campaigns.
 The attempt was made to communicate basic facts about AIDS etiology and prevention.
 This included information that needle sharing and unprotected sex could spread the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, while bleaching needles and using condoms properly could reduce the risk of infection.
 A step-by-step diagram on how to bleach needles was provided.
 Posters, pamphlets, billboards, and out-reach workers were used to spread the word in inner-city neighbors, and coverage of the campaign was sought in the news media.
 Strategies incorporating practical and theory-based suggestions for future campaigns on IV drug use and AIDS are discussed.
