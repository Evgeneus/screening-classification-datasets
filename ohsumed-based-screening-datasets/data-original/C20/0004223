Susceptibility to thyroid autoimmune disease: molecular analysis of HLA-D region genes identifies new markers for goitrous Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
 Hashimoto's thyroiditis has been shown to be associated with the HLA-specificities DR4 and DR5.
 Since former association studies yielded variable results, we used novel molecular typing methods to assess predisposing immunogenetic factors.
 Gene analysis of the HLA-DR-DQ and tumor necrosis factor region was performed in a group of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients and randomly chosen controls using standards and nomenclature of the 10th International Histocompatibility Workshop.
 Genomic DNA of patients and controls was analyzed using a cDNA probe of the DQB1 gene.
 The resulting restriction fragment patterns allowed the determination of newly defined DQw-types 1-9.
 We find the strongest relative risk conferred by DQw7 (RR = 4.7), that is observed in 36 of 64 patients (56%) and only 21 of 98 controls (21%) (P corr less than 0.002).
 Comparison of DNA sequence variation in the DQB1 gene, that is found predominantly in Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients, indicates that codons 45 and 57 are critical features in DQw7 which distinguish it from other DQw specificities.
 The adjacent DQA1 genes also display a significant association with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (DQA1*0201/*0301 heterozygotes were found in 37% of patients and 15% controls, P less than 0.03).
 No significant association could be found with polymorphisms of the tumor necrosis factor gene.
 These results provide a new basis for the concept of genetic susceptibility in Hashimoto's thyroiditis and will help to elucidate the underlying autoimmune mechanisms that lead to disease at the functional level.
