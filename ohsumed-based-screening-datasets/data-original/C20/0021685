Multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy: possible similar genetic susceptibility.
 We have studied 2 patients with multiple sclerosis and narcolepsy.
 In both patients, the DR 2 histocompatibility antigen was positive.
 In each of the patients, the diagnosis of narcolepsy was confirmed by polygraphic testing.
