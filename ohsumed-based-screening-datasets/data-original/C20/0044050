An inhibition enzyme immunoassay using a human monoclonal antibody (K14) reactive with gp41 of HIV-1 for the serology of HIV-1 infections.
 An inhibition enzyme immunoassay (IEIA), using a human monoclonal antibody (K14) reactive with gp41 of HIV-1, was evaluated for its applicability to the serology of HIV-1 infections.
 Using panels of serum samples from seronegative and confirmed HIV-1-seropositive individuals, it was shown that all the HIV-1-positive samples in a panel from The Netherlands and 97% of the HIV-1-positive samples from Tanzania were identified by this IEIA.
 Six per cent of the IEIA-positive samples from Tanzania could not be confirmed in other assays.
 Testing of serial dilutions of serum samples from African individuals with confirmed HIV-1, HIV-2 or HIV(ANI70) infections in the K14 IEIA, indicated that a HIV-1-specific assay based on this principle may be developed.
