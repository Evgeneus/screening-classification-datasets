Rehabilitation dimensions of AIDS: a review.
 With the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), many rehabilitation professionals are faced with new challenges.
 This report covers two basic problems that are becoming common in rehabilitation practice: the management of the patient who suffers from disability resulting from HIV infection or AIDS, and the management of the traditional rehabilitation patient who may coincidentally be infected with HIV.
 Common manifestations of HIV infection and associated secondary infections and neoplasms are discussed, as well as are the complications of current medical treatments.
 This report also explores specific neurologic and musculoskeletal disorders and the fatigue associated with AIDS.
 In addition, potential approaches to rehabilitation management are evaluated, and consideration is given to the management of the asymptomatic HIV carrier.
 The differences between HIV infection in adults and children are explored, and the social implications of HIV rehabilitation are discussed.
 After consideration of the basic pathophysiology of infection and the modes of transmission, the significance and ethics of serologic testing are examined, and the concept of universal precautions is described.
 The paper concludes with a discussion of the use of safe sex practices by the disabled population.
