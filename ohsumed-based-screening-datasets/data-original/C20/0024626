Improved stability in oral delivery of albuterol provides less variability in bronchodilation in adults with asthma.
 The objective of this randomized, single-blind, parallel group study was to determine whether a more constant rate of albuterol delivery from tablets provides less variability in bronchodilation.
 Thirty-eight adult patients were enrolled with FEV1 between 40% to 80% of predicted normal and greater than or equal to 15% reversibility.
 Eighteen patients received Volmax, 8 mg bid, and 20 patients received Proventil Repetabs, 8 mg (as two 4-mg tablets) bid.
 The magnitude and duration of bronchodilation were determined after the first dose and at steady state on treatment day 7 by measuring serial values of pulmonary function for 12 hours on each day.
 Interpatient variability in bronchodilation was calculated for each study day did not differ significantly between treatments, the interpatient variability in bronchodilation with Volmax was, on average, one-half of that experienced with Proventil Repetabs.
 Adverse events, mainly headache and tremor, were comparable between Volmax and Proventil Repetabs.
 This study demonstrates that Volmax achieves less variable bronchodilation through a more constant rate of drug delivery from the onset of therapy.
