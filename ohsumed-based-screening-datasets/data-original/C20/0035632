Evidence for non-V3-specific neutralizing antibodies that interfere with gp120/CD4 binding in human immunodeficiency virus 1-infected humans.
 Total anti-gp120 antibodies (total anti-gp120 Abs) were purified from a pool of four human immunodeficiency virus-positive (HIV+) sera by affinity chromatography on a gp120SF2-Sepharose column and exhibited both type- and group-specific neutralizing activities.
 To dissect the epitope specificity of the group-specific neutralizing antibodies, CD4 attachment site-specific antibodies (CD4-site Abs) were isolated from total anti-gp120 Abs by using a CD4-blocked gp120SF2-Sepharose column.
 The CD4-site Abs exhibited group-specific neutralizing activities.
 Another approach to dissecting type- and group-specific neutralizing activities of total anti-gp120 Abs was to separate the third variable region (V3)-specific antibodies (V3-region Abs) from non-V3-region-specific antibodies (non-V3 Abs).
 The results indicated that V3-region Abs exhibited type-specific neutralizing activities, whereas non-V3 Abs exhibited group-specific neutralizing activities.
 By comparing the neutralizing activities of V3-region Abs to those of non-V3 Abs, we concluded that V3-region Abs are more effective than non-V3 Abs in neutralizing a specific HIV isolate.
 Collectively, this study indicates that group-specific neutralizing anti-gp120 antibodies are specific for the CD4 attachment site.
