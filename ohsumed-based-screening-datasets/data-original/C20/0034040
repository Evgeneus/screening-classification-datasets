Differences in clinical course in zidovudine-treated asymptomatic HIV-infected men associated with T-cell function at intake.
 Declining CD4+ T-cell numbers and anti-CD3-induced T-cell responsiveness are prognostic markers for progression of HIV infection.
 We investigated the effect of long-term (2-year) zidovudine treatment on these immunological markers in a group of nine asymptomatic p24-antigenaemic men, five of whom progressed to AIDS.
 A group of 10 untreated HIV-infected men, five of whom progressed to AIDS, was studied as a control.
 At intake, 1 year before the start of treatment, CD4+ T-cell numbers in the groups were not significantly different.
 However, at that time progressors already exhibited an extremely low anti-CD3-induced T-cell responsiveness compared with non-progressors.
 In all people T-cell responsiveness and the number of CD4+ T-cells had improved 6 months after the start of zidovudine treatment.
 However, CD4+ T-cell numbers were not persistently elevated, and restoration of T-cell responsiveness was of only short duration.
 Our results show that zidovudine treatment in the asymptomatic phase of HIV infection did not result in a sustained improvement in T-cell function.
 Furthermore, they suggest that differences in clinical course among zidovudine-treated asymptomatics may be caused by heterogeneity of this group with respect to T-cell functional capacity at the start of treatment.
