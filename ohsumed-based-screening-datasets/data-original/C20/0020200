13-cis-retinoic acid in the treatment of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia. A phase II pilot study of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group.
 The management of acute myeloid leukemia in the elderly (65 years and older) is unsatisfactory because of poor patient tolerance of standard myeloablative chemotherapy.
 The authors conducted a Phase II study to evaluate the effectiveness and toxicity of 13-cis-retinoic acid (CRA) in the therapy of elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).
 Patients presenting with leukocyte counts less than 20,000/microliters were treated with CRA alone.
 Those with leukocyte counts of 20,000/microliters or greater were pretreated with hydroxyurea, followed by CRA.
 Twelve of 18 patients received at least 4 weeks of CRA and were thus considered evaluable for toxicity and response.
 No objective responses were observed.
 Cis-retinoic acid administration was well tolerated; only modest dermatologic, musculoskeletal, and gastrointestinal toxicity was observed.
 Alternative therapeutic strategies should be investigated in this subpopulation of AML patients.
