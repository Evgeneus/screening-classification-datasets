Possible association between mutant frequency in peripheral lymphocytes and domestic radon concentrations 
 To investigate whether previously found geographical correlations between leukaemia incidence and exposure to radon are reflected in a detectable mutagenic effect on individuals, the frequency of mutations in the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase gene (hprt) in peripheral blood T lymphocytes was measured in subjects with known domestic radon concentrations.
 These concentrations were measured in December, 1989, in houses in Street, Somerset, UK, by passive alpha-track radon detectors.
 20 non-smoking subjects aged 36-55 years were selected from the patient list at the local health centre on the basis of the radon concentrations in their homes--the range selected varied by a factor of ten.
 Blood samples for preparation of T lymphocytes were taken in July, 1990.
 There was a significant association between the log mutant frequency and radon concentration (t = 3.47, p less than 0.01).
 A second analysis of a further set of radon measurements (October, 1990, to January, 1991), in both living rooms and bedrooms, and repeated mutant frequency determinations also showed a significant relation, which remained significant even after exclusion of the highest frequency and adjustment for subject's age and cloning efficiency.
 These data must be regarded as preliminary and further more extensive studies should be done to determine whether the observed association is causal.
