A B cell-deficient mouse by targeted disruption of the membrane exon of the immunoglobulin mu chain gene.
 Of the various classes of antibodies that B lymphocytes can produce, class M (IgM) is the first to be expressed on the membrane of the developing cells.
 Pre-B cells, the precursors of B-lymphocytes, produce the heavy chain of IgM (mu chain), but not light chains.
 Recent data suggest that pre-B cells express mu chains on the membrane together with the 'surrogate' light chains lambda 5 and V pre B (refs 2-7).
 This complex could control pre-B-cell differentiation, in particular the rearrangement of the light-chain genes.
 We have now assessed the importance of the membrane form of the mu chain in B-cell development by generating mice lacking this chain.
 We disrupted one of the membrane exons of the gene encoding the mu-chain constant region by gene targeting in mouse embryonic stem cells.
 From these cells we derived mice heterozygous or homozygous for the mutation.
 B-cell development in the heterozygous mice seemed to be normal, but in homozygous animals B cells were absent, their development already being arrested at the stage of pre-B-cell maturation.
