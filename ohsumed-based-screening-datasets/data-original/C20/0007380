Ocular syphilis.
 The ability of syphilis to mimic different ocular disorders can lead to misdiagnosis and delay in appropriate antimicrobial therapy.
 The authors describe their experience over the past 5 years with the ocular manifestations of syphilis in 25 patients who comprised 2.45% of 1020 new patients.
 Uveitis was the most common ocular manifestation seen.
 All patients had positive results from FTA-ABS tests, whereas only 68% had reactive serum VDRLs.
 Two of five patients tested for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody were reactive.
 The authors recommend routine FTA-ABS and VDRL screening in patients with uveitis or unexplained ocular inflammation.
 They also recommend testing for HIV antibody in luetics and aggressive treatment with high-dose aqueous penicillin for syphilis.
