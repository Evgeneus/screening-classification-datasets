Selective cytotoxicity of low-density lipoprotein to helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma after photoperoxidation with 8-methoxypsoralen.
 Lymphocyte-containing plasma subjected to photolysis in the presence of 8-methoxypsoralen (methoxsalen, 8-MOP) has previously been shown to be effective against cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and the AIDS-related complex.
 The mechanism of this effect was thought to involve photoreaction of 8-MOP with DNA, based on certain in vitro experiments.
 The results of this study suggest a different mechanism.
 Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from fresh human plasma was photosensitized by addition of 8-MOP and exposure to UV light (mp-LDL), and the reactions of the LDL lipids and the chemical actions induced by these reactions were monitored.
 In a separate procedure, LDL was peroxidized with hydrogen peroxide and peroxidase (p-LDL).
 mp-LDL and p-LDL were then tested in cytotoxicity assays on HuT-78 helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
 These results indicate that (a) LDL in plasma in the presence of very low concentrations of 8-MOP (200 ng/mL) can be peroxidized by UV light; (b) this photoperoxidized LDL is cytotoxic to helper T cells of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in a dose-dependent manner; but (c) it does not kill normal lymphocytes under similar conditions.
 The findings also suggest alternative therapeutic strategies for treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as direct utilization of peroxidized LDL.
