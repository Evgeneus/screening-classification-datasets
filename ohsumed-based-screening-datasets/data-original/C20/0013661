Pathology of childhood AIDS.
 Pathologic lesions in children with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can be classified into three broad categories: (1) primary lesions related directly to infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (e.g., in the lymphoreticular system and brain); (2) associated lesions related to direct or indirect sequelae of HIV infection (e.g., opportunistic infections, lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis, and so forth); and (3) lesions of undetermined pathogenesis (e.g., cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, and so forth).
 The pathologic features of the various lesions in these three categories are described.
 Clinical relevance of the pathologic study of AIDS is discussed.
 Data on perinatal pathology of AIDS is reviewed.
