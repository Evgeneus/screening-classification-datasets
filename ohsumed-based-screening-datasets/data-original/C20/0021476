Recent advances in the medical management of early HIV disease.
 The management of patients who have HIV disease, particularly those in early, asymptomatic disease stages, has recently improved.
 Clinical trials with zidovudine have demonstrated efficacy and greatly reduced toxicity when the drug is used for asymptomatic HIV-infected persons who have fewer than 500 CD4+ cells/mm3.
 Also, the optimum dose of zidovudine is lower than previously believed, probably in the range of 300-500 mg daily in oral divided doses.
 The use of antibiotics to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) is also of clear value for HIV-infected asymptomatic or symptomatic persons with fewer than 200 CD4+ cells/mm3.
 While aerosolized pentamidine is the only regimen approved for PCP prophylaxis, oral drugs, such as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or dapsone, also appear effective.
 Together, these and similar advances argue for the widespread use of voluntary HIV testing to enable optimum medical monitoring and appropriate intervention.
 These issues and recommendations for laboratory and clinical monitoring are provided in this review.
