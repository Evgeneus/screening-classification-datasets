Retroviral sequences related to human T-lymphotropic virus type II in patients with chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome.
 Chronic fatigue immune dysfunction syndrome (CFIDS) is a recently recognized illness characterized by debilitating fatigue as well as immunological and neurological abnormalities [Straus, S.E.
 (1988) J.
 Inf.
 Dis.
 157, 405-412].
 Once thought to be caused by Epstein-Barr virus, it is now thought to have a different but unknown etiology.
 We evaluated 30 adult and pediatric CFIDS patients from six eastern states for the presence of human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) types I and II by Western immunoblotting, polymearse chain reaction, and in situ hybridization of blood samples.
 The majority of patients were positive for HTLV antibodies by Western blotting and for HTLV-II gag sequences by polymerase chain reaction and in situ hybridization.
 Twenty nonexposure healthy controls were negative in all assays.
 These data support an association between an HTLV-II-like virus and CFIDS.
