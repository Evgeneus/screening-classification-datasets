Cholestasis in patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome: comparison between ultrasonographic and cholangiographic findings.
 Cholestasis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome was systematically investigated by ultrasonography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
 The two procedures were found to be complementary, and showed similar results in 56.2% of the cases.
 Ultrasonography was superior in detecting common bile duct wall thickening, whereas endoscopic retrograde cholangiography was superior in demonstrating intrahepatic narrowing of the biliary tract.
