The significance of experimental animal studies in otitis media.
 Animal models have been instrumental in investigating otitis media.
 Experimental models have allowed for focused research on how such factors as eustachian tube dysfunction and microbial infection contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media.
 Antibacterial therapy and immunologic prophylaxis have been developed using these models.
 Current research is aimed at generating an objective index of middle ear inflammation for guiding patient management.
