Successful treatment of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-related Mycobacterium avium complex disease with a multiple drug regimen including amikacin.
 Disease due to Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) typically occurs late in the course of AIDS and is usually disseminated with evidence of multiorgan involvement.
 Most patients are persistently bacteremic.
 Previously published studies have noted a poor response to antimycobacterial chemotherapy.
 We describe successful treatment of MAC disease in an AIDS patient with a multiple drug regimen, including amikacin, clofazimine, rifampin, ethambutol, and ciprofloxacin.
 This patient, whose presentation and MAC disease course distinctly differ from most published experience, remains clinically and microbiologically MAC-disease free 25 months after initiation of therapy.
 We describe four additional AIDS patients with MAC disease who had a favorable clinical and microbiological response to this regimen without developing serious adverse effects after periods ranging from 4 to 12 months.
 We suggest a prospective, controlled clinical trial using this regimen for treatment of MAC disease in patients with AIDS may be warranted.
