Update: transmission of HIV infection during invasive dental procedures--Florida.
 Previous reports from an epidemiologic investigation in Florida strongly suggested that three patients (patients A, B, and C) became infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) while receiving dental care from a dentist with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (1,2).
 This report describes findings that suggest HIV was transmitted to two additional patients (patients E and G).
 These two patients had no other confirmed exposures to HIV, had invasive procedures performed by the dentist, and are infected with HIV strains that are closely related genetically to the strains from the three previously reported patients and from the dentist (Table 1).
 In addition, this report describes the epidemiologic and laboratory investigation of another HIV-infected patient of the dentist (patient F).
