Infection of human monocytes with HIV-1Ba-L. Effect on accessory cell function for T-cell proliferation in vitro.
 Major laboratory manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) include altered levels of circulating CD4+ lymphocytes and decreased in vitro T-cell mitogenic responses.
 Since T-cell proliferation is regulated by monocytes (M phi), studies were undertaken to determine whether defective M phi function contributes to these poor mitogenic responses.
 M phi were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of normal donors by adherence to plastic.
 After 5 days in culture, the adherent cells were inoculated with the HIV-1 M phi-tropic strain, Ba-L.
 Under these conditions HIV infection in M phi can be detected 5-7 days after inoculation.
 Ten to fourteen days postinoculation, the adherent cells were harvested with lidocaine and cocultured with fresh autologous T cells and T-cell mitogens in a 3-day assay.
 We found decreased proliferative anti-CD3 responses to Leu4 and OKT3 and variable responses to concanavalin A (Con A) by T cells cultured with HIV-infected monocytes compared with T cells cultured with uninfected M phi.
 Supernatants from HIV-infected M phi cultures decreased proliferative responses of normal PBMC to anti-CD3 monoclonal antibodies.
 Heat-activated supernatants had the same effect.
 Inhibitors of HIV binding did not restore proliferative responses of HIV-infected cultures to normal levels.
 These results indicate that HIV infection of M phi causes the release of soluble factor(s) that suppress anti-CD3-induced T-cell proliferative responses.
