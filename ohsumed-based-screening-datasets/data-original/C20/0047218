Common T-cell receptor V beta usage in oligoclonal T lymphocytes derived from cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with multiple sclerosis.
 T-cell populations were investigated in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurological diseases.
 Individual T cells were directly cloned from the cerebrospinal fluid and blood before in vitro expansion, and their clonotypes were compared by Southern blot analysis of the rearrangement patterns of their T-cell receptor beta chain and gamma chain genes.
 This allowed the determination of whether two T cell clones shared the same T-cell receptor and thus arose from identical, clonally expanded (oligoclonal) progenitor T cells.
 As an extension of previous studies, oligoclonal T-cell clones were identified in both cerebrospinal fluid and blood populations in 5 of 9 patients with inflammatory demyelinating disease among a total of 486 blood and cerebrospinal fluid T-cell clones.
 In contrast, no clonally expanded T-cell populations were found among a total of 424 clones derived from either blood of 4 normal control subjects or blood and cerebrospinal fluid of 8 patients with other neurological diseases.
 Analysis of T-cell receptor V beta genes among 4 oligoclonal T-cell populations derived from 3 patients with multiple sclerosis demonstrated common usage of the V beta 12 gene segment.
 These data suggest that oligoclonal T cells share similar specificities and that clonal expansion may have resulted from specific stimulation by an antigen.
 Moreover, identical clones between blood and cerebrospinal fluid were observed in 3 of 9 patients with demyelinating disease, thus providing further evidence of an equilibrium between peripheral and central nervous system immune compartments.
