Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis in autoimmune thyroid disease.
 Four patients are described who were found to have autoimmune thyroid disease associated with lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis.
 The patients were not receiving any medications known to cause lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis.
 Their response to steroid therapy and the relapse of their clinical symptoms after steroid withdrawal support an underlying immunologic dysfunction.
 It is proposed that lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis may be yet another manifestation of immune dysfunction in autoimmune thyroid disease.
