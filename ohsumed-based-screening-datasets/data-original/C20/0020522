Platelet activating factor receptor blockade ameliorates murine systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Untreated 16-week-old MRL/MpJ-lpr/lpr (lpr) mice, when compared to congenic MRL/MpJ-+/+ (+/+) mice, are characterized by a systemic lupus erythematosus syndrome, including severe glomerulonephritis, proteinuria and reduction of renal function.
 We hypothesized that platelet activating factor (PAF), a potent chemotactic and proinflammatory phospholipid mediator synthesized and released by circulating cells, glomerular mesangial and renal medullary interstitial cells, may play a role in the development of renal injury in lupus mice.
 We assessed renal PAF synthesis in lpr as well as +/+ mice and the effect of treatment with a PAF receptor blocking agent.
 Treatment with the PAF receptor antagonist L659,989 for four weeks, starting at 12 weeks of age, significantly reduced acute glomerular infiltration and proliferation, and prevented chronic glomerular histological changes; proteinuria and serum creatinine levels were also significantly reduced in treated mice.
 Renal PAF production was increased in lpr when compared to +/+ mice, and treatment with L659,989 restored renal PAF synthesis to the control levels.
 Our results support the hypothesis that PAF can be one of the mediators of glomerular injury characteristic of murine lupus nephritis, and indicate the possible therapeutic utility of PAF receptor antagonists in immunologic renal diseases.
