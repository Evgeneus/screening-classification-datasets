Detection of Epstein-Barr virus-DNA in tongue epithelium of human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients.
 Oral hairy leukoplakia is a lesion on the lateral part of the tongue that contains replicating Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and presages progression from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection to AIDS.
 To clarify the role of EBV in the development of the lesions, we used filter in situ DNA hybridization to determine the prevalence of EBV and of human papillomavirus (HPV) in epithelial cells obtained on swabs from the tongue of HIV-infected patients who had hairy leukoplakia, HIV-infected patients who did not have hairy leukoplakia, and healthy uninfected control persons.
 In samples collected from the 35 uninfected control persons, EBV DNA could not be detected except at low concentrations in three people.
 In contrast, all but one of the samples from 11 HIV-infected patients who had hairy leukoplakia contained EBV DNA.
 Of greatest interest, in 19 of 32 HIV-infected patients who had no signs of hairy leukoplakia, EBV DNA was also detected on the epithelium of the tongue.
 DNA filter in situ hybridization for the detection of HPV serotypes 6, 11, 16, and 18 in all cases yielded negative results.
 Statistical analysis showed that the presence of EBV DNA was significantly correlated with the clinical status of the HIV-infected persons, as determined by Walter Reed staging classification, whereas hairy leukoplakia was not.
 It is concluded that detection of EBV DNA in oral epithelium may be an earlier and more powerful predictor of progression to AIDS than is hairy leukoplakia.
