Transplantation of wheat germ agglutinin-positive hematopoietic cells to prevent or induce systemic autoimmune disease.
 Hematopoietic stem cell defects are thought to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of systemic autoimmune disease.
 Positively selected, stem cell-enriched populations of wheat germ agglutinin-positive (WGA+) low-density bone marrow and fetal liver cells from normal and autoimmune-prone mice were used to determine whether reciprocal transplantation of stem cells between normal and autoimmune-prone mice inhibits or causes development of autoimmune disease.
 NZB recipients of DBA/2 stem cell populations analyzed greater than 100 days after bone marrow or fetal liver cell transplantation showed decreased levels of anti-DNA antibodies and decreased glomerular lesions when compared with nontreated NZB mice or NZB recipients of NZB stem cell preparations.
 Female DBA/2 recipients of WGA+ NZB bone marrow cell or fetal liver cell transplants exhibited elevated serum autoantibody levels and developed glomerular lesions characteristic of NZB mice when analyzed greater than 100 days after transplantation.
 These pathological disturbances were not observed in DBA/2 recipients of DBA/2 stem cell preparations.
 The data indicate that WGA+ stem cells from autoimmune-prone NZB mice contain the genetic defects responsible for the development of systemic autoimmune disease.
