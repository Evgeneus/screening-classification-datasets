Staphylococcal sepsis in HIV antibody seropositive psoriasis patients.
 The cases of three HIV-positive men with generalized psoriasis and staphylococcal sepsis are reported.
 In each case the skin appeared to be the source of infection.
 While the patients received antibiotic therapy, the psoriatic plaques resolved despite minimal or no topical treatment.
