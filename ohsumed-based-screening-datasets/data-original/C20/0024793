Primary anterior mediastinal B-cell lymphoma. A clinicopathologic and immunohistochemical study of 16 cases.
 Sixteen cases of primary anterior mediastinal B-cell lymphoma were characterized by morphologic, immunophenotypic, and clinical profiles.
 Twelve were men and four were women.
 The median age was 42 years.
 Virtually all tumors were of large cell type.
 Three main morphologic categories were identified, with one rare exception.
 In some tumors, the cells were compatible with centrocytes and centroblasts (four).
 Others had cells readily identifiable as centroblasts (six).
 Both these groups had a variable proportion of cells with multilobed nuclei.
 A third group was composed mainly of unclassifiable cells with multilobed nuclei (five).
 All had discernible sclerosis of varying intensity.
 A wider range of morphologic features and different sex distribution was noticed in comparison with previously reported clear cell features and younger women.
 The dominant phenotype of these B-cell lymphomas was CD19+, CD22+, CD37+, CD21-, CD30-, CD10-, CD5-, and Ig-negative.
 The finding of CD21-, Ig-negative phenotype, as observed by the authors and others, overlaps with some high-grade lymphomas of follicular center cell origin but is thought to bear similarity to a noncirculating population of thymic medullary B-cells.
 The tumors attained large size without peripheral dissemination and responded to chemotherapy as well as radiotherapy.
