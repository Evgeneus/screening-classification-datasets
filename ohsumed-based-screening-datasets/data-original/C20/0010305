Asthma and pregnancy: responsibility of physicians and patients 
 The successful management of asthma during pregnancy requires a cooperative approach between the obstetrician, the physician managing the asthma, and the patient.
 This is emphasized by a case report describing a patient with uncontrolled asthma subsequently managed with appropriate medical and obstetrical care.
 Concern for maternal and fetal health and reassurance of patients are primary concerns.
 Guidelines for physicians and patients are outlined as are the safety of drugs and therapy in pregnant patients.
 Physicians must have knowledge of appropriate use of medications during pregnancy.
