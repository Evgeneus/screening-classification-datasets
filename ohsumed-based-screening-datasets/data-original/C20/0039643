Antibody indications of secondary and superimposed retinal hypersensitivity in retinitis pigmentosa.
 Antibody reactions with recognized retinopathy-inducing retinal antigens may be interpreted to reflect ongoing autoimmune events responsible for some forms of vision loss.
 We sought evidence of secondary and superimposed retinal hypersensitivity indicated by such antibody reactivity in a random group of patients with retinitis pigmentosa.
 We identified patterns of immunologic reactivity within members of a group of 52 patients with retinitis pigmentosa, which suggests some patients with retinitis pigmentosa may experience consequential superimposed retinal hypersensitivity.
 Identifying subgroups of patients with retinitis pigmentosa who exhibit indications of retinal hypersensitivity to known uveitopathogenic retinal proteins may permit the reduction of their rate of retinal degradation by immunomodulation.
