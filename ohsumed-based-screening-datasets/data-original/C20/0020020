Effects of zymosan-activated human granulocytes on isolated human airways.
 In asthma a temporal association exists between the late allergic reaction (LAR), the influx of granulocytes into the airway wall, and an increase in bronchial responsiveness.
 We therefore tested the hypothesis that activated human granulocytes constrict isolated human airways and increase their sensitivity to cholinergic stimuli.
 Bronchial rings were dissected from 23 lung tissue specimens collected at thoracotomy and studied isotonically in organ baths.
 Airways were incubated with 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 x 10(6) granulocytes from normal or atopic donors.
 Activation of the cells with serum-treated zymosan (STZ, 0.2 mg/ml), which itself did not alter baseline airway caliber, resulted in a bronchoconstriction proportional to the number of zymosan-activated granulocytes (ZAG) present (rs = 0.79, p less than 0.001).
 This contraction was reduced by about 70% with the leukotriene C4/D4 receptor antagonist FPL 55712 (11.5 microM; p less than 0.001) or with the lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (10 microM; p less than 0.001).
 The scavengers of activated oxygen molecules superoxide dismutase (300 U/ml) and bovine catalase (5,000 U/ml), the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM), or the histamine (H1) receptor antagonist mepyramine (2.8 microM) had no effect.
 Granulocyte suspensions from atopic donors contained more eosinophils (p less than 0.001), and the magnitude of the contraction to 10 x 10(6) ZAG was related to the proportion of eosinophils (rs = 0.66, p less than 0.01).
 The sensitivity of the airways to methacholine was unchanged in the presence of 1, 2, or 5 x 10(6) ZAG and decreased with 10 or 20 x 10(6) ZAG (p less than 0.05).
