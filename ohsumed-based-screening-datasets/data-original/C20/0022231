Cryptosporidium infection in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: not always a poor prognosis.
 Chronic diarrhea and malabsorption accompanied by simultaneous infection with the protozoa Giardia lamblia and Cryptosporidium occurred in a 22-year-old homosexual man with antibody to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 Small bowel biopsy demonstrated total villous atrophy and marked mononuclear infiltration in the lamina propria simulating celiac disease.
 Treatment with metronidazole resulted in resolution of diarrhea, clearance of parasites, and marked improvement in small bowel histology.
 Although diarrhea and malabsorption in immunocompromised patients with cryptosporidiosis are regarded as ominous, our patient remained disease free for the next 3 years.
 Thus, infection with Cryptosporidium in patients with HIV does not always lead to intractable diarrhea or death.
