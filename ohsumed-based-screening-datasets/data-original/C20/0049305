Abnormal thymocyte development and production of autoreactive T cells in T cell receptor transgenic autoimmune mice.
 Development of a C57BL/6-+/+ TCR transgenic mouse containing the rearranged TCR alpha- and beta-chain specific for the Db + HY male Ag results in production of a nearly monoclonal population of early thymocytes expressing the Db + HY reactive TCR.
 These thymocytes are autoreactive in H-2Db male mice and undergo clonal deletion and down-regulation of CD8.
 To study the effect of the lpr gene on development of autoreactive T cells, these transgenic mice were backcrossed with C57BL/6-lpr/lpr mice.
 T cell populations in the thymus and spleen were analyzed by three-color flow cytometry for expression of CD4, CD8, and TCR.
 The thymus of TCR transgenic H-2b/b lpr/lpr male mice had an increase in percent and absolute number of CD8dull thymocytes compared to TCR transgenic H-2b/b +/+ male mice.
 However, there was not a complete defect in clonal deletion, because clonal deletion and down-regulation of CD8 was apparent in both +/+ and lpr/lpr H-2Db HY+ male mice compared to H-2Db HY- female mice.
 The phenotype of splenic T cells was almost identical in TCR transgenic +/+ and lpr/lpr males with about 50% CD4-CD8- T cells and 50% CD8+ T cells.
 However, there was a dramatic increase in the SMLR proliferative response of splenic T cells from TCR transgenic lpr/lpr males compared to TCR transgenic +/+ males.
 To determine the specificity of this response, spleen cells from TCR transgenic lpr/lpr and +/+ mice were cultured with irradiated H-2b/b and H-2k/k male and female spleen cells.
 T cells from TCR transgenic C57BL/6-lpr/lpr male mice had an increased proliferative response to H-2b/b male spleen cells compared to T cells from TCR transgenic C57BL/6(-)+/+ male mice, but both lpr/lpr and +/+ mice had a minimal response to irradiated H-2b/b female or H-2k/k male or female stimulator cells.
 The splenic T cells from TCR transgenic lpr/lpr mice also had an increased specific cytotoxic activity against H-2b/b male target cells compared to TCR transgenic +/+ mice.
 These results demonstrate that there is a defect in negative selection of self-reactive T cells in the thymus of lpr/lpr mice and a defect in induction or maintenance of clonal anergy of self-reactive T cells in the periphery of lpr/lpr mice.
