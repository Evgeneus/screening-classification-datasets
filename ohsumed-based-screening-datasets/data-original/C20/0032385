Neurotoxicity of intraventricularly administered alpha-interferon for leptomeningeal disease.
 Nine patients with leptomeningeal disease are reported who were treated with intraventricular alpha-interferon (alpha-IFN).
 In seven of these patients, a progressive vegetative state developed during treatment.
 The patients became unresponsive to verbal commands but opened their eyes with auditory or tactile stimulation.
 It took an average of 3 weeks for these patients to become verbally responsive after treatment was discontinued.
 Electroencephalographic findings showed evidence of irritative involvement of the deep midline nuclei in 80% of patients.
 Periventricular white matter changes developed during treatment in three of six patients who underwent computed tomographic scans.
 All patients with this severe neurotoxicity received whole-brain irradiation before treatment.
 Possible mechanisms for the development of this neurotoxic syndrome are discussed.
 The neurotoxicity of alpha-IFN and brain irradiation may be additive, suggesting a cautious approach when using this combination for treatment.
