Intensity of in-hospital care for persons with AIDS.
 We evaluated the intensity of medical care for 30 consecutive AIDS patients at one hospital, using methodology based on the Delay Tool of Selker et al.
 Of 25 AIDS patients who survived hospitalization, 15 had at least one delay day in the hospital.
 Major factors associated with care that could have been provided at an alternative site included difficulty with skilled nursing facility placement in 20% of the patients, difficulty coordinating out-of-hospital care in 28%, and scheduling of outpatient surgical procedures in 12%.
 For the 15 patients who could have received some of their care at a lower intensity setting, a median of 7 hospital days could have been potentially saved with better coordination of outpatient care and increased availability of skilled nursing facilities.
 The five patients who died in hospital also used large amounts of resources and had long lengths of stay.
 Prior studies of non-AIDS patients revealed similar results, suggesting that, for reasons of quality of care, quality of life, and economics, policy-makers must develop managed care programs, skilled nursing facilities that accept AIDS patients, inpatient psychiatry facilities, and increased hospice availability.
