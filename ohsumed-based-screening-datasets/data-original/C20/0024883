Reversibility of cardiac abnormalities in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals: a serial echocardiographic study.
 Seventy adults who tested positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were prospectively studied with serial echocardiography to better define the prevalence and progression of cardiac disease in such patients.
 Fifty outpatients (Group A), including 44 with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and 6 with AIDS-related complex, and 20 additional patients (Group B) with asymptomatic HIV infection had baseline echocardiographic studies at a time when no patient had symptomatic heart disease.
 Follow-up studies were performed at 9 +/- 3 months in 52 patients (74%) and again at 15 +/- 3 months after baseline studies in 29 patients (41%).
 During the study, 22 patients (44%) in Group A and 1 patient (5%) in Group B died.
 Cardiac abnormalities were noted in 26 patients (52%) in Group A and 8 patients (40%) in Group B (p = NS) on initial or follow-up study.
 An abnormal left ventricular ejection fraction (less than 45%) or fractional shortening (less than 28%) was seen in seven patients in Group A; of these, three had normal left ventricular function on a later echocardiogram.
 One patient in Group B had persistent left ventricular dysfunction.
 All patients in Group A with left ventricular dysfunction on two serial studies died within 1 year after the initial echocardiogram.
 Ejection fraction did not change between baseline and two follow-up studies in either group (A: 52 +/- 9 vs.
 56 +/- 9 vs.
 55 +/- 5%, p = NS; B: 58 +/- 6 vs.
 58 +/- 5 vs.
 59 +/- 6%, p = NS).
 Right-sided cardiac enlargement resolved in 18 patients (44%), including 5 of 10 in Group A and 3 of 8 in Group B.
