Use of methotrexate in the treatment of steroid-dependent adolescent asthmatics.
 Five children 10 to 16 years of age with steroid-dependent asthma were treated with methotrexate.
 All were able to reduce their doses of prednisone and all had improvement in their clinical status.
 No significant side effects were noted in patients treated 1 to 3 years.
 This open study suggests that methotrexate should be considered in the treatment of older children with severe asthma and morbidity from their steroid therapy.
