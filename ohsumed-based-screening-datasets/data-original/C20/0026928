Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of HLA-DR, DQ, DP and C4 alleles in Caucasians with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 HLA-DR, DQ, DP and C4 null alleles were determined by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis in 60 Caucasian patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and 66 controls.
 DR3 (DRw17) and DQw2.1 were increased in frequency in the patients with SLE associated with the presence of C4A null genes.
 HLA-DP alleles determined by RFLP analysis of genomic DNA as well as of PCR amplified DNA were not associated with SLE or any clinical or autoantibody subset thereof.
 No DR, DQ, or C4 null gene association was found with renal or neuropsychiatric involvement or nDNA antibodies (or levels thereof).
 These data suggest that the primary predisposition to SLE lies with HLA-DR or C4 null alleles, and not with HLA-DP.
