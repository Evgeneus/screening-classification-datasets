Acute ventilatory response to green coffee dust extract.
 The lung function response to inhalation of an extract of green coffee was studied in ten healthy subjects who were prescreened for airway hyperresponsiveness to an aerosol of green coffee extract.
 The effects of this provocation were evaluated at rest and following moderate exercise as well as with and without pretreatment with 80 mg of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG).
 There was a statistically significant decrement in lung function over time (P less than .001) following coffee provocation both at rest and following exercise.
 No significant protection against this response was observed with DSCG pretreatment.
 While the majority of these "healthy" coffee reactors exhibited baseline nonspecific airway hyperresponsiveness to methacholine (PC20 FEV1 less than 25 mg/mL in 7/10), there was no correlation in these ten subjects between baseline responsiveness to methacholine and the degree of lung function decrement following coffee (P greater than .05).
 Also, no correlation was observed between skin prick and lung function response to coffee extract.
 We conclude that inhalation of green coffee extract causes significant bronchoconstriction in selected healthy volunteers and that this response is not prevented by pretreatment with DSCG.
