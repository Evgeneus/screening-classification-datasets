Historic aspects of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy.
 The earliest preparations of immunoglobulins (Ig) decreased the susceptibility of agammaglobulinemic patients to infections caused by pneumococci, Haemophilus influenzae, meningococci, streptococci, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
 Intramuscular administration of such preparations was painful and traumatic, especially for children.
 Ethanol-fractionated Ig could not be administered intravenously (IV) because the IgG molecules tended to aggregate and thus were more likely to produce anaphylactoid reactions.
 New Ig preparations, isolated at low pH (e.g., pH 4) in the presence of traces of pepsin to inhibit reaggregation, were well tolerated when administered IV.
 Thus a new era of treatment and prophylaxis of disease using IV Ig (IVIG) was launched.
 The IVIG preparations revolutionized the management of virtually all immunodeficiency syndromes characterized by failure of antibody responses.
 Amelioration of antibody deficiency secondary to certain chronic diseases or surgical trauma can be achieved with these preparations.
 Newer uses of IVIG include treatment of some autoimmune diseases; in some conditions, the beneficial influences may be attributable to antiidiotype antibodies present in the IVIG.
 Another likely explanation is that IVIG inhibits damage to cells and tissues by antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity or blocks phagocytosis that is facilitated by Fc receptor mechanisms.
 The value of IVIG in preventing infection in patients undergoing bone marrow or organ transplantation and in the treatment and prophylaxis of life-threatening infections in neonates and premature infants also is reviewed.
