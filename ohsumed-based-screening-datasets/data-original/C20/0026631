Anaphylactic reaction because of intrauterine 32% dextran-70 instillation.
 Anaphylactic reaction associated with hysteroscopy using 32% dextran-70 as a distending medium is a rare phenomenon.
 We report anaphylactic reaction associated with hysteroscopy using dextran that was delivered manually in three otherwise healthy women occurring within a 6-month period.
 The rapidity and pressure of dextran administered might facilitate intravascular absorption and predispose patients to this phenomenon.
