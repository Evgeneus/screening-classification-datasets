Fluconazole in the treatment of candidiasis in immunocompromised children.
 Fluconazole, a new triazole derivative, was evaluated in a pilot study of 34 episodes of candidiasis in 24 children.
 All the patients had predisposing conditions, such as human immunodeficiency virus infection, cancer, organ or bone marrow transplantation, neonatal age and malnutrition, and obstructive uropathy.
 The drug was administered at 6 mg/kg (body weight) once daily either orally or intravenously.
 Two patients with fungemia due to Candida parapsilosis required an increased dosage of 12 mg/kg.
 Clinical and microbiological success was achieved in 30 of 34 cases (88%).
 Drug-related transaminase increases were observed in two cases (6%).
 Fluconazole may represent an effective alternative to amphotericin B in the treatment of candidiasis in children.
 Comparative trials are necessary to assess optimal dosages and efficacy.
