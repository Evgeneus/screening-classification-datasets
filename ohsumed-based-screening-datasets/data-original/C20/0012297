Angiotropic B-cell lymphoma (malignant angioendotheliomatosis): failure of systemic chemotherapy.
 A 65-year-old female with angiotropic B-cell lymphoma is reported.
 Despite the absence of systemic involvement on formal staging and the favourable response of the cutaneous lesions to triple systemic chemotherapy with prednisolone, vincristine and cyclophosphamide, postmortem findings showed that death was due to widespread disease dissemination.
