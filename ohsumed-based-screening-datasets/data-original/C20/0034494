HIV-infection prevention messages for injecting drug users: sources of information and use of mass media--Baltimore, 1989.
 In many urban areas in the United States, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) seroprevalence rates for injecting drug users (IDUs) range from 10% to 65% (1).
 To examine whether the mass media could contribute to IDU-targeted HIV-infection prevention measures, CDC collaborated with investigators at Johns Hopkins University in studying 1) media use by and sources of HIV information for IDUs, 2) the airing of public service announcements (PSAs) that address acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 3) the acceptability by broadcast media executives of various PSA prevention messages related to HIV and AIDS.
 This report summarizes findings of these studies.
