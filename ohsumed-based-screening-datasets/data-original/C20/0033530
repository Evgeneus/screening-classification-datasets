Detection of human immunodeficiency virus-DNA and RNA in the skin of HIV-infected patients using the polymerase chain reaction.
 The presence of HIV genomic-associated nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) within biopsies of normal-appearing skin and various skin lesions obtained from a group of 33 HIV-infected patients was investigated by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
 In order to define the localization (dermal vs.
 epidermal) of HIV, the PCR was carried out separately on the dermis and the epidermis in 21 of the specimens.
 Altogether, HIV-DNA and HIV-RNA were detected, respectively, in 89% and 47% of the specimens included in this study; both DNA and RNA were detected more frequently in the dermis (90% and 43%, respectively) than in the epidermis (62% and 5%, respectively).
 No correlation could be established between the presence of HIV genomic material, the nature (normal-appearing vs.
 diseased) of the skin specimen studied, and the clinical or biologic severity of HIV infection, as evidenced by the CDC stage classification and the number of peripheral CD4+ cells.
 It seems, therefore, that the HIV is very frequently present within the skin during the course of HIV infection; however, its precise cellular localization and pathologic significance await further investigation.
