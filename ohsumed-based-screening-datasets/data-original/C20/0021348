Clinical and immunologic evaluations of reactive dye-exposed workers.
 To evaluate type 1 hypersensitivity to reactive dyes, its prevalence, and its relationship to respiratory dysfunction, we studied clinical and immunologic features, including skin prick tests.
 RAST, and bronchoprovocation tests, of 309 employees working in a reactive-dye industry.
 Our survey revealed that 78 (25.2%) employees had work-related lower respiratory symptoms associated with or without nasal, skin, or eye symptoms.
 Among these employees, 38 (48.7%) had nonspecific bronchial reactivity.
 Thirteen demonstrated immediate (6), dual (6), or late only (1) asthmatic responses after inhalation of four kinds of reactive-dye solutions.
 Twenty-five employees demonstrated immediate skin responses to black GR dye, and 21 reacted to orange 3R.
 Fifty-three employees (17%) had specific serum IgE antibody against black GR and orange 3R-human serum albumin conjugate.
 Specific IgE was detected more frequently in symptomatic employees (30%) and smokers (100%).
 No association was found between atopy and specific IgE binding.
 The RAST-inhibition tests of black GR revealed significant inhibitions by black GR-human serum albumin conjugate and minimal inhibitions by unconjugated black GR.
 Orange 3R RAST-inhibition tests revealed significant inhibitions by conjugated forms of black GR and orange 3R and some inhibitions by two unconjugated dyes, suggesting an immunologic cross-reactivity between these dyes.
 These findings suggested that reactive dyes could induce immunologic responses, most likely IgE-mediated.
