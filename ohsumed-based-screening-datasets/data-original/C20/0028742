Negative correlation between blood cell counts and serum neopterin concentration in patients with HIV-1 infection.
 Hematopoietic disturbances are common in patients with HIV-1 infection.
 Recent studies on immune activation markers such as neopterin demonstrate that HIV-1 infection is associated with chronic immune activation.
 We investigated a possible association between serum neopterin concentrations and blood cell counts (CD4+ T cells, white blood cells, platelets, red blood cells) and hemoglobin and hematocrit in 94 HIV-1-seropositive individuals [52 Walter Reed (WR) stage 1, 31 WR2, one WR5, and 10 WR6].
 There were significant negative correlations between neopterin concentrations and CD4+ T cells, hemoglobin, hematocrit and platelets.
 These correlations were also significant if either only WR1 and WR2 patients or the entire set of data were considered for calculations.
 Thus, hematological abnormalities are associated with chronic immune activation in patients with HIV-1 infection.
 Large amounts of neopterin are released by human macrophages on stimulation with interferon-gamma (IFN gamma), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) further enhances the effect of IFN gamma.
 Therefore, our data suggest that activated immune cells and specific cytokines such as IFN gamma and TNF alpha are involved inhibiting hematopoiesis.
