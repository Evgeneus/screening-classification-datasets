Autoantibodies to nucleolin in systemic lupus erythematosus and other diseases.
 The 110-kDa intracellular phosphoprotein (110K) described previously by this laboratory as a common IgM autoantigen in SLE and certain other systemic autoimmune disorders and viral infections is identified as nucleolin in the present investigation.
 Using rabbit antiserum to rat nucleolin as a probe, IgM autoantibody-reactive 110K co-migrated with human lymphocyte nucleolin in one- and two-dimensional immunoblots.
 Rabbit anti-nucleolin also specifically depleted autoreactive 110K from detergent lysates of human cells.
 Because nucleolin shares amino acid sequence similarity and/or forms dynamic particles with other prominent autoantigens, the present observation raises the possibility that the nucleolin/anti-nucleolin system may be of special significance for the development of humoral autoreactivity to nuclear Ag.
