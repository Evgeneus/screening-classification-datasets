Ranitidine improves certain cellular immune responses in asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals.
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is characterized by a progressive impairment in immunocompetence leading to severe opportunistic infections and malignancies.
 In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the potential impact of immunomodulation by oral ranitidine, 600 mg daily, for 28 days was studied in 18 HIV-positive patients (CDC group II).
 All were without clinical signs of infections and were not treated with other known immunomodulating agents.
 Several immunological parameters related to HIV infection were studied and confirmed to be impaired early in HIV infection.
 Spontaneous and in vitro interleukin-2- and interferon-alpha-stimulated natural killer cell activity improved in the ranitidine-treated patients in contrast to a decrease in nontreated patients (#p less than 0.03, #p less than 0.01, #p less than 0.02 between groups, respectively).
 Furthermore, T-cell blastogenesis to phytohemagglutinin stimulation and soluble interleukin-2 receptors in serum increased in ranitidine-treated patients compared with nontreated patients (#p less than 0.01).
 However, ranitidine treatment did not change CD4+ cell counts.
 Although the significant improvement in immunocompetence shown in this study is small, the present result indicates the need for further trials with immunomodulation by ranitidine in HIV-infected individuals.
