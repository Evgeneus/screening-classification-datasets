Large vessel occlusion with vasculitis in systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Patients with SLE may have acute large vessel occlusion due to vasculitis and/or circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, as illustrated by the case we have reported.
 Unfortunately, delayed medical attention led to gangrene of the foot and amputation.
 Early recognition and appropriate treatment may significantly decrease morbidity and mortality.
 Medical treatment may include corticosteroids, thrombolysis, anticoagulation, or immunosuppression.
