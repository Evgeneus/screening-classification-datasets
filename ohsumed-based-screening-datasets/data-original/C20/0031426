Medical students knowledge of HIV infection and AIDS. Members of the Association of University Teachers in General Practice.
 To evaluate the knowledge on infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) a questionnaire survey was carried out in West German medical students attending general practice courses.
 Lecturers of 19 medical schools agreed to participate and 1665 completed questionnaires were returned.
 The analysis of students' answers showed some remarkable deficiencies.
 The data suggest that teaching of this subject in medical school may be insufficient.
 General practitioners could possibly contribute to reaching a higher level of knowledge.
