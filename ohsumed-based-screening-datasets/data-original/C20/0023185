Detection and quantification of human immunodeficiency virus RNA in patient serum by use of the polymerase chain reaction.
 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA was detected and quantified in the serum of HIV-seropositive individuals using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and a nonisotopic enzyme-linked affinity assay.
 Of 55 HIV-infected patients who were not receiving therapy, serum HIV RNA was detected in 9 of 19 who were asymptomatic, 11 of 16 with AIDS-related complex (ARC), and 18 of 20 with AIDS, with copy numbers ranging from 10(2) to greater than or equal to 5 x 10(4) 200 microliters of serum based on a relationship between absorbance and known copy number of gag gene RNA.
 Linear regression analysis demonstrated a correlation between infectious titer in 42 patient sera cocultured with donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and PCR product absorbance (r = .70, P less than .01).
 Serum HIV RNA detected by PCR also correlated with serum p24 antigen positivity, CD4 counts less than 400/mm3, and the presence of HIV-related symptoms or disease.
 Quantification of infectious HIV RNA in cell-free serum by PCR may be useful as a marker for for disease progression or in monitoring antiviral therapy.
