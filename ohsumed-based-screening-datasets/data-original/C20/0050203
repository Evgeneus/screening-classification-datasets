Drug use and sexual behavior of indigent African American men.
 A total of 108 African American men in a free lunch program with histories of drug abuse were surveyed to determine the relationships among drug use, sexual activity, AIDS prevention practices, and perceived risk of AIDS.
 Of the 108, 69.5 percent were homeless and only 12 percent were currently receiving drug abuse treatment.
 More than half of the participants had injected drugs, and 38 percent had shared needles.
 Among the 80 percent who were sexually active, 40 percent reported using condoms every time they had sex.
 Respondents in monogamous relationships tended to use condoms less frequently.
 Those who shared needles were more likely to have sex with IV drug users and had more sexual partners.
 Respondents who used crack used condoms less frequently.
 Those with multiple partners were more likely to engage in anal intercourse.
 Three-quarters perceived themselves at risk of AIDS.
