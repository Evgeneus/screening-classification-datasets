Successful treatment of adult Henoch-Schonlein purpura with factor XIII concentrate.
 We report the cases of three adult patients with severe abdominal complications of Henoch-Schonlein purpura who had low activity of factor XIII during the acute phase of the disease.
 In all three cases, abdominal symptoms and purpura immediately responded to heat-treated, placenta-derived factor XIII concentrate.
 No adverse effects were experienced.
 Factor XIII concentrate replacement should be considered as the initial treatment for severe abdominal symptoms in adult Henoch-Schonlein purpura associated with a decreased level of factor XIII activity.
