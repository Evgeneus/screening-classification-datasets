A case of Rhodococcus equi brain abscess.
 We treated a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome for a brain abscess caused by Rhodococcus equi, an actinomycete that usually infects the lung in immunosuppressed hosts.
 Rhodococcus equi brain abscess is an extremely rare lesion that has never been reported in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 The infection was cured by lengthy therapy with multiple antibiotics after aspiration of the lesion to identify the infective organism and determine its sensitivity to antibiotics.
