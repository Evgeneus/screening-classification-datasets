Purified protein derivative (PPD)-tuberculin anergy and HIV infection: guidelines for anergy testing and management of anergic persons at risk of tuberculosis.
 The occurrence of tuberculosis among persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has prompted the development of guidelines for the management of those who may have both tuberculous and HIV infections (1).
 These guidelines include the recommendation that all persons who are known to be infected with HIV, or are at increased risk of HIV infection, receive a tuberculin skin test (Mantoux test with tuberculin units 5 [TU] of purified protein derivative [PPD]-tuberculin).
 Those persons who have at least a 5 mm reaction to PPD should be considered for 1 year of isoniazid preventive therapy, unless otherwise contraindicated.
