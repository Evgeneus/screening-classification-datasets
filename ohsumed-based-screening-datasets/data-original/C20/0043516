Lifetime Medicaid service utilization and expenditures for AIDS in New York and California.
 Several important gaps exists in information on the health care resources used by people with AIDS, including patterns of outpatient care, differences between populations at risk of the disease, and services paid for by Medicaid.
 To address the shortage of information in these areas, this study examined average Medicaid expenditures and service use for the time period a person has AIDS.
 The study population was Medicaid enrollees with AIDS in New York and California who died between October 1985 and September 1986.
 The study focused on the differences between the two states and between four groups that were proxies for at-risk populations: children, women, drug-using men, and non-drug-using men.
 Mean lifetime Medicaid expenditures were about $30,000 in New York and $20,000 in California.
 Inpatient use was higher and outpatient service use was lower in New York than in California after controlling for risk group, diagnosis, and Medicaid eligibility group (a proxy for income level).
 In California, women had higher expenditures and inpatient use than men.
 In New York, women and drug-using men had higher expenditures and use of inpatient and outpatient services (except home health care) than the non-drug-using men.
 Children in New York had higher expenditures and hospital use than adults but similar outpatient service use.
 Multivariate analyses suggest that differences between risk groups were largely attributable to differences in diagnosis and income level (as measured by Medicaid eligibility group).
