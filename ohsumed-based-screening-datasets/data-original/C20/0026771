Generation and analysis of clonal IgM- and IgG-producing human B cell lines expressing an anti-DNA-associated idiotype.
 This study describes a methodology for generating stable, cloned, EBV-transformed IgG- and IgM-producing human B cell lines.
 Using these lines we have characterized immunoglobulin V gene utilization in an anti-DNA-associated idiotypic system.
 The 31 anti-DNA-associated idiotype is encoded preferentially by the VK1 gene family, and, in all probability, reflects a germ line gene-encoded framework determinant.
 Analysis of these lines indicates that the DNA-binding antibodies produced by B cell lines from SLE patients may differ from DNA binding myeloma proteins and from natural autoantibodies.
