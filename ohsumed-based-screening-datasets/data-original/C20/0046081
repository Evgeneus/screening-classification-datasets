Association between a T cell receptor restriction fragment length polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus.
 The present study was designed to test the possibility that T cell receptor genes are associated/linked to those involved in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
 Genomic DNA was isolated from 31 unrelated Caucasian SLE patients, 34 unrelated Caucasian normals, 5 multiplex American Caucasian SLE families, 9 multiplex Mexican SLE families, and 13 unrelated Mexican normals.
 The DNA was digested with Pst I, electrophoresed, and transferred to membranes by the Southern blot method.
 The blots were probed with a cDNA probe for the alpha chain of the T cell receptor.
 13 polymorphic RFLP patterns were recognized.
 1.3- and 3.0-kb band pairs were observed in 15 of 31 of American Caucasian patients and 4 of 34 American Caucasian controls (chi square, 8.81; P less than 0.002; relative risk, 7); there was no association of any RFLP pattern with Mexican SLE.
 The cDNA probe was cut with Rsa I, EcoR I, and Ava II into fragments corresponding to the V, J, C, and 3'UT regions.
 Only the fragment corresponding to the constant region reacted with the 1.3/3.0-kb band pair.
 These observations suggest that a genetic marker of the constant region of the alpha chain of the T cell receptor is associated with genes involved in SLE.
