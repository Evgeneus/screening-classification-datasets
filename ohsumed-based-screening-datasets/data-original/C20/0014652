Visceral leishmaniasis in HIV infection and AIDS: clinical features and response to therapy.
 The development of visceral leishmaniasis with atypical features in an AIDS patient, and the recent flurry of reports of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected individuals prompted the review of its manifestations in the 47 reported cases.
 Splenomegaly, which is almost always a feature of visceral leishmaniasis in the immunocompetent host, was absent in eight.
 Antibodies to Leishmania donovani, which are present in approximately 95 per cent of immunocompetent patients with visceral leishmaniasis, were absent in 29 of 45 (66 per cent) of HIV-infected patients tested.
 Nine HIV-positive patients with visceral leishmaniasis did not exhibit a primary clinical response to therapy with antimonials and of those who did show a response, relapse occurred in 13, at a mean 4.5 months after stopping therapy.
 Seventeen patients are known to have died often in association with respiratory disease; Leishmania was seen in one bronchial lavage specimen and in lung tissue in one post-mortem performed.
 In order to improve the prognosis of visceral leishmaniasis in HIV-infected patients diagnosis will have to be made earlier, taking account of the atypical features, and treatment will need to be improved, both initially and perhaps also by the use of long-term maintenance therapy.
