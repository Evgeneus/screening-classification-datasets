Multiple sclerosis, retroviruses, and PCR. The HTLV-MS Working Group.
 Previously reported serologic and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based findings have suggested an association between the human retrovirus, HTLV-I, and multiple sclerosis (MS).
 Due to the inherent ability of PCR to produce false-positive results, we developed a set of physical and procedural safeguards to minimize the possibility of molecular carryover.
 These were applied as part of a blinded, large-scale, multipopulation, multiplex PCR-based study designed to examine this issue of association.
 Our results do not support the hypothesis that HTLV-I, which plays a role in the pathogenesis of an encephalomyeloneuropathy, HTLV-II, or closely related agents are associated with MS.
 A concomitant review of the current literature supports this view.
