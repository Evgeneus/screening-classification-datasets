Safety and immunogenicity of multiple conventional immunizations administered during early HIV infection.
 Twenty-one asymptomatic adults who had recently received multiple polysaccharide, live viral, and protein-derived vaccines were identified as being infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
 The mean subject age was 24 years (range 18-33); 20 of 21 (95%) were male.
 The mean T4 count was 523/mm3 with a mean T4/T8 ratio of 0.6.
 Serologic responses to immunization with meningococcus group C, adenovirus types 4 and 7, tetanus, and diphtheria were evaluated for the HIV seropositive subjects and were compared with the responses of similarly vaccinated age-, sex-, and race-matched HIV-seronegative controls.
 Significantly fewer (p less than 0.03) HIV subjects responded to meningococcus C (bactericidal antibody) and adenovirus 4 (neutralizing antibody) vaccines than did normals; the HIV-infected subjects who did respond produced functional antibody comparable to that of normals.
 Booster responses of HIV subjects to tetanus and diphtheria were comparable to those of normals.
 HIV-infected vaccine nonresponders did not differ from HIV-infected responders in total white blood cell, T4, T4/T8, total serum IgG, or delayed-type hypersensitivity skin test reactivity.
 All HIV subjects had negative cultures for live vaccine viruses (rubella, measles, adenovirus, and poliovirus).
 Postimmunization, no clinically apparent adverse reactions to vaccination were detected.
