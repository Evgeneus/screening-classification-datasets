Hypersensitivity pneumonitis.
 Hypersensitivity pneumonitis or extrinsic allergic alveolitis is an immunologically mediated lung disease caused by repeated inhalations of organic antigens.
 The basic histologic lesion consists of a diffuse mononuclear cell infiltration of alveolar wall, alveoli, terminal bronchioles, and neighboring interstitium.
 The inflammation is often followed by granulomas, which then may progress to fibrosis.
 Although there is no single radiologic, physiologic, or immunologic test specific for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, the diagnosis can often be suspected on the basis of a compatible temporal relationship of pulmonary symptoms to the history of environmental or occupational exposure.
 Once the diagnosis is suspected, the presence of serum precipitating antibodies (IgG), suppressor cytotoxic lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and granulomatous alveolitis in lung biopsy specimens are extremely helpful in confirming the diagnosis.
 In patients where the diagnosis is confirmed, avoidance of the causative antigen is the best therapy, although corticosteroids are used to suppress inflammation.
 Once the fibrosis is set in, the patient may gradually slide into respiratory failure, cor pulmonale, and death.
