Quality of life as a function of HIV classification.
 The purpose of this research was to identify variables related to life quality for persons with Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection and to ascertain if life quality differs according to the classifications of a positive serologic test for HIV antibodies (HIV+), AIDS-related complex (ARC), and Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
 A convenience sampling technique was used to obtain subjects from AIDS support groups and affiliated agencies in a major southwest urban area.
 Ninety-five HIV-infected subjects completed a demographic data sheet, the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP), and the Symptom Distress Scale (SDS).
 The majority of subjects (59%) listed AIDS as their category of diagnosis, 25% were HIV+ only and 16% identified ARC as their disease classification.
 Subjects had SIP and SDS scores which indicated HIV-infection significantly affected their quality of life.
 Multivariate results indicated that quality of life indicators varied as a function of HIV classification.
 HIV-infection had the greatest disruption in psychosocial aspects of life.
 The impact of HIV-infection (both physical and psychosocial) was greatest in subjects with ARC and least among subjects who were HIV+ only.
