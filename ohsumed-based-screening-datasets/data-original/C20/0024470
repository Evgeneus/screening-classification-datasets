Role of urologist in diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.
 This report presents 7 patients with confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in whom the diagnosis of MS was first suspected by the urologist.
 Review of these 7 cases identifies three factors that increased the suspicion of MS at the time of urologic evaluation: a history of neurologic symptoms, abnormalities on a brief neurologic examination, and abnormal basic urodynamic evaluation.
 Urologists attuned to the possible diagnosis of MS in patients who present with symptoms of voiding dysfunction can facilitate the proper diagnosis with a basic office evaluation.
