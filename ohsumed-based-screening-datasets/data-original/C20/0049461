Nasal provocation test with lysine acetylsalicylate in aspirin-sensitive patients.
 The authors have studied nasal provocation testing (NPT) with aspirin in 45 aspirin-sensitive patients (40 affected by nasal polyposis) and in 38 aspirin-tolerant patients (27 affected by nasal polyposis).
 The test was positive in 37.7% of aspirin-intolerant subjects, but only in 7.9% of subjects in the control group (P less than .01).
