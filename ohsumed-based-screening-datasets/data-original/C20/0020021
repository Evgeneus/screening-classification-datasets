Inhaled furosemide prevents both the bronchoconstriction and the increase in neutrophil chemotactic activity induced by ultrasonic "fog" of distilled water in asthmatics.
 Inhaled furosemide has been shown to prevent bronchoconstriction induced by inhalation of ultrasonic nebulization of distilled water (UNDW) in bronchial asthma.
 To evaluate whether inhaled furosemide also prevents the increase in serum neutrophil chemotactic activity (NCA) observed during UNDW bronchoconstriction, we measured NCA during UNDW challenge without (control) and immediately after inhalation of furosemide (40 mg) or placebo (saline) in 10 asthmatics responsive to UNDW, in a randomized, double-blind study.
 NCA was assessed by measuring the maximal distance reached by neutrophils in a filter when challenged with the subject serum in a Boyden chamber ("leading front").
 UNDW inhalation produced a significant increase in NCA in each subject.
 Gel filtration chromatography on S400 column indicated that the NCA released were 600 to 700 kD.
 Saline had no effect on bronchoconstriction nor on NCA increase induced by UNDW in nine patients.
 Furosemide did not change baseline FEV1, but it prevented bronchoconstriction and NCA increase in nine patients.
 In the whole group the maximal decrease in FEV1 after UNDW was -31.1%, SEM 4.7 after saline and -7.5%, SEM 5.2 after furosemide, p less than 0.001, the maximal increase in NCA after UNDW was +52.9%, SEM 9.2 after saline and +3.8%, SEM 3.1 after furosemide, p = 0.001.
 These results indicate that inhaled furosemide prevents both the bronchoconstriction and the NCA increase induced by UNDW inhalation in most asthmatic patients.
 This finding adds support to the suggestion that furosemide acts on mast cells.
