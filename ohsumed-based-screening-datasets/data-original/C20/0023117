Gelsolin-related amyloidosis. Identification of the amyloid protein in Finnish hereditary amyloidosis as a fragment of variant gelsolin.
 The Finnish type of familial amyloidosis is a systemic disease characterized by progressive cranial neuropathy, corneal lattice dystrophy, and distal sensimotor neuropathy.
 Amyloid fibrils were isolated from the kidney and heart of a patient with Finnish amyloidosis.
 After solubilization, the amyloid proteins were fractionated by gel filtration and purified by reverse-phase HPLC.
 Complete amino acid sequence analyses show that the two amyloid components obtained are fragments of gelsolin, an actin-modulating protein occurring in plasma and the cytoskeleton.
 The larger component represents residues 173-243 and the minor component residues 173-225, respectively, of mature gelsolin.
 When compared with the predicted primary structure of human gelsolin a single amino acid substitution is present in amyloid: at position 15 of the amyloid proteins an asparagine is found instead of an aspartic acid residue at the corresponding position (187) in gelsolin.
 Antibodies to a dodecapeptide of the amyloidogenic region of gelsolin specifically stain the tissue amyloid deposits in Finnish hereditary amyloidosis.
 The results show that the amyloid subunit protein in Finnish hereditary amyloidosis represents a new type of amyloid that is derived from an actin filament-binding region of a variant gelsolin molecule by limited proteolysis.
