Improving the cost-effectiveness of AIDS health care in San Juan, Puerto Rico.
 In an era of decreasing availability of funds and increasing demand, the AIDS epidemic threatens to overwhelm health-care services in some countries.
 We describe a comprehensive model for the treatment of AIDS in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and compare it with traditional hospital-based services.
 Given the existing allocation of funds, the comprehensive model emphasised prevention, education, surveillance, early detection, and outpatient care to reduce hospital care.
 In 1987, the last year of the traditional system, there were 95 admissions of AIDS patients to hospital, and in 1988, the first year of the comprehensive model, there were 100 admissions.
 The mean length of stay of AIDS inpatients was reduced from 22.3 days in 1987 to 11.3 days in 1988, a 46.8% reduction (p = 0.001).
 The annual mean (SE) cost of inpatient care per AIDS patient fell from $15,118 (1699) in 1987 to $3869 (659) in 1988.
 Savings were used to improve non-hospital services, including outreach, education, emergency and outpatient care, laboratory and epidemiological services, and research, and to introduce an employee incentive scheme.
 Management strategies that reduce the length of inpatient care and provide less costly treatment alternatives can improve AIDS health care in developing nations.
