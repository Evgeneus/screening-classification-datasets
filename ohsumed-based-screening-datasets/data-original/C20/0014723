Thalidomide: treatment of severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis in patients with AIDS.
 An increasing number of AIDS patients have been noted to suffer severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), a condition often associated with high morbidity that remains unresponsive to conventional therapeutic interventions.
 In two cases thalidomide was administered to successfully treat AIDS patients with RAS.
 Both patients experienced complete abatement of pain shortly after therapy was initiated.
 Ulcerations that were present for months resolved after three or four weeks of thalidomide therapy without any adverse effects.
 Thalidomide appears to be an effective agent for the treatment of severe RAS unresponsive to traditional therapies.
