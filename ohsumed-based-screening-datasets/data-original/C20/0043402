Anaphylactic reactions to a psyllium-containing cereal.
 Historical data were obtained by questionnaire and telephone survey on 20 of 24 women with reported allergic reactions to a psyllium-containing cereal, Heartwise.
 Protein fractions from this new cereal, as well as from psyllium mucilloid and a psyllium-containing laxative, Metamucil, were extracted, quantitated, and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
 Patients' sera were collected, and specific IgE and IgG antibodies to these psyllium antigens were detected by immunoblotting techniques.
 Of the 20 women evaluated, all but six were nurses.
 Eighteen (90%) of the women had historical and/or laboratory evidence of atopy.
 Exposures included ingestion or dispensing of psyllium-containing products.
 Only three women denied prior exposure to psyllium.
 Symptoms developed shortly after small amounts of the cereal were ingested and most commonly included moderate to severe wheezing, throat and chest tightness, and urticaria.
 All the women required medical therapy, 11 (55%) in an emergency room.
 Specific IgE and IgG antibodies to various psyllium protein fractions were documented in all the subjects.
 It was concluded that individuals sensitized by occupational exposure to psyllium dust are at high risk for allergic reactions to ingested psyllium-containing products.
