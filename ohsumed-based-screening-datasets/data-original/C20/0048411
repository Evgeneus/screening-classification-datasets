Diagnostic efficacy of in vitro methods vs. skin testing in patients with inhalant allergies.
 The purpose of our study was to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of two selected methods of in vitro allergy testing.
 Specifically, the PRIST/modified RAST I125 isotope systems and the Quantizyme/modified EAST alkaline phosphatase method were compared.
 The time, expense, convenience, and diagnostic efficacy of the two procedures are discussed.
 Special attention is given to the practicality of each method for the practicing physician.
