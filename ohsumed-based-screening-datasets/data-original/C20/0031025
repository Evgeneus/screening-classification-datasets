The challenge of caring for indigent children with rheumatologic diseases.
 Poverty and lack of insurance prevent complete access to tertiary care for many children with rheumatologic diseases.
 Long-term solutions to provide community based support for local teams and other services are needed.
 Physicians need to work with colleagues in health care systems and government to make the health care system fully available to all families.
 Medical schools can act as catalysts in helping government agencies redefine policies to support outreach and other health care programs for the indigent.
 Governmental agencies must collaborate with insurance companies to change policies so as to cover all aspects of service, including those provided by arthritis health professionals.
 With coordinated effort, the goal of adequate services to indigent children with rheumatologic and other chronic illnesses can become reality.
