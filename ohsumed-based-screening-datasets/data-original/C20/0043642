4-Aminopyridine in multiple sclerosis: prolonged administration.
 In an earlier study, we demonstrated efficacy of single oral doses of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) in improving motor and visual signs in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients for a mean of 4.97 hours.
 We attempted to determine whether efficacy could safely be prolonged using multiple daily doses over several days by administering 7.5 to 52.5 mg 4-AP to 17 temperature-sensitive MS patients in one to three daily doses at 3- to 4-hour intervals over 1 to 5 days in a double-blind study.
 Nine of these patients were also tested with identically appearing placebo.
 Thirteen of the 17 patients (76%) given 4-AP showed clinically important motor and visual improvements compared with three of nine in the placebo group.
 Average peak improvement scores were 0.40 for 4-AP and 0.12 for placebo.
 Seventy percent of the daily 4-AP improvements lasted 7 to 10 hours.
 The improvements for two consecutive doses of 4-AP lasted a mean of 7.07 hours (83% of the average 8.53-hour treatment-observation period) compared with 2.36 hours for placebo (26% of the average 9.06-hour treatment-observation period).
 No serious side effects occurred.
 4-AP is a promising drug for the symptomatic treatment of MS.
