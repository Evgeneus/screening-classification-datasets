Source of the aeroallergen of soybean dust: a low molecular mass glycopeptide from the soybean tela.
 Airborne soybean allergens in the dust generated during the unloading of soybeans in the harbor caused asthma epidemics in Barcelona, Spain.
 The major allergen causing the epidemics was a glycopeptide less than 14 kd molecular mass abundant in soybean dust.
 This allergen occurs in all parts of the soybean plant at all stages of growth, but the telae (hulls) and pods are by far the richest source.
 Small amounts of a similar cross-reacting allergen are found in some other grain dusts.
 The botanical function and significance of this soybean plant component is not known nor is the potential for airborne dispersion of this allergen at other grain-handling sites.
