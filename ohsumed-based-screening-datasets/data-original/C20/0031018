Stereotactic brain biopsy in the diagnosis of malignant lymphoma.
 Fifteen patients with cerebral involvement by malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were identified, among more than 200 patients who underwent stereotactic biopsy at The Johns Hopkins Hospital.
 All but one of these cases were diagnosed accurately by the stereotactic biopsy procedure.
 In 12 of 14 patients, the material was adequate to classify the lymphoma according to the Working Formulation.
 Because all but one of the lesions were intermediate or high-grade neoplasms, a diagnosis of lymphoma was often possible by conventional light microscopic examination alone.
 Monotypic light chain expression was demonstrated by immunohistochemical techniques in six patients, and positivity for B-cell markers was observed in an additional case.
 In one instance, two stereotactic biopsy specimens were interpreted as being suggestive of lymphoma, but necrosis and inflammation prevented a definitive diagnosis.
 Nine patients had no known risk factors for cerebral lymphoma, and the diagnosis often was unsuspected clinically.
