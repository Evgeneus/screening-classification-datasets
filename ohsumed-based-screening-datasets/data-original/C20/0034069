High antibody titres in mice with polymethylmethacrylate nanoparticles as adjuvant for HIV vaccines.
 The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) nanoparticles as adjuvants for an HIV-2 whole-virus vaccine in mice.
 The data clearly revealed that PMMA nanoparticles induced 10-100-fold higher antibody titres than aluminium hydroxide or an aqueous vaccine control preparation as measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
 Moreover, the high antibody titres obtained with PMMA as adjuvant appeared to be stable for between 10 and 20 weeks after immunization.
 In contrast, the titres of the control preparations, fluid or aluminium hydroxide formulations, decreased after 10 weeks.
