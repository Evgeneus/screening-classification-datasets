Psychological functioning in a cohort of gay men at risk for AIDS. A three-year descriptive study.
 This study describes the mental health of a large cohort of gay men participating in the Chicago Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/Coping and Change Study.
 Six biannual questionnaires were self-administered between 1984 and 1988.
 General mental health was determined by the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL).
 An abbreviated version of the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale (CESD-5) and an adapted Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS) question also measured depression.
 Suicidal ideation was assessed by one question in the HSCL.
 AIDS-specific distress was determined by three subscales specifically developed for this study.
 While mean HSCL and CESD-5 scores were stable during the observational period, AIDS-specific distress increased over time.
 The HSCL scores for the cohort were somewhat elevated above general population norms but considerably below psychiatric outpatient norms.
 Fewer than 12% of the men reported elevated HSCL or CESD-5 scores three or more times.
 A self-reported episode of depression of two weeks or more, measured by the DIS screening question, was experienced by 40.1% of the sample.
 Suicidal ideation was reported on three or more visits by 18.8% of the men.
 The younger members of this cohort exhibit greater general and AIDS-specific distress.
 Income was inversely associated with general distress.
 HIV-seropositive participants had generally higher AIDS-specific distress scores than those who were seronegative, but their scores were equivalent on the HSCL and CESD-5.
