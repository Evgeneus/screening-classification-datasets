Determination of N-methylhistamine in urine as an indicator of histamine release in immediate allergic reactions.
 The use of the urine histamine metabolite, N-methylhistamine (N-MH), as a parameter of histamine release in immediate allergic reactions was investigated.
 Baseline levels were determined in 34 normal control subjects and 29 atopic patients.
 Increases of urine N-MH values were measured during histamine infusions and in venom-allergic patients receiving bee-sting challenges.
 N-MH was determined by a newly developed radioimmunoassay.
 Baseline levels in control subjects and atopic patients demonstrated no significant differences.
 With regard to challenge tests, fluctuation of N-MH levels during a 6-hour period was measured.
 Random 6-hour increases in healthy and atopic subjects ranged from 5% to 41%.
 Before infusion of histamine (0.25 micrograms/kg/min for 30 minutes), baseline values were 137 +/- 11.4 micrograms N-MH per gram of creatinine and 9 +/- 1.1 micrograms N-MH per hour (n = 9).
 Levels peaked 1 hour after infusion at 275 +/- 45 micrograms/gm of creatinine and 44 +/- 5.6 micrograms/hr and decreased to resting levels after 2 hours.
 Metabolization by N-MH accounted for 9.5% +/- 4.9% (range, 2.4% to 18.4%) of infused histamine in the urine of the nine subjects.
 Bee-sting challenges were performed in 12 patients and three control subjects.
 Only in three patients experiencing generalized urticaria, nausea, dyspnea, and hypotension were significant increases of urine N-MH levels (138%, 144%, and 238%) observed.
 All other patients and three normal control subjects demonstrated normal local reactions without increase of N-MH values.
