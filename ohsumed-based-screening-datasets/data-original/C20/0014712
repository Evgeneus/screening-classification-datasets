When do optic disc edema and peripheral neuropathy constitute poetry? [clinical conference]
 A patient with chronic, bilateral optic disc edema developed multiple systemic manifestations of POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, skin changes).
 A serum immunoelectrophoresis showed an abnormal serum IgG lambda protein, and urine immunoelectrophoresis revealed a monoclonal lambda protein plus an IgG lambda fragment.
 Bone survey and MRI scan revealed a sclerotic lesion of the first lumbar vertebra, and lymph node biopsy showed changes consistent with Castleman's disease.
 Thus, his optic disc edema was the presenting feature of the POEMS syndrome and osteosclerotic myeloma.
