Frequent identification of HIV-1 DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage cells obtained from individuals with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 Tissue macrophages are recognized as a cellular target for infection with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).
 To characterize the nature of this cell-retrovirus interaction within the lower respiratory tract we analyzed fluid and cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) of eight individuals with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) who were undergoing diagnostic fiberoptic bronchoscopy.
 Of these eight individuals, seven had active infection with Pneumocystis carinii; one had suspected cytomegalovirus pneumonitis.
 At the time of study two were receiving the antiretroviral drug zidovudine (azidothymidine [AZT]).
 HIV-1 could not be isolated from any of the eight samples of BAL fluid concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose.
 HIV-1 antigen (p24) was detected in one of eight samples of concentrated BAL fluid but could not be found in eight samples of media conditioned by overnight incubation with adherent BAL cells.
 Despite the infrequent detection of HIV-1 antigen it was possible to identify HIV-1 genomic sequences by the use of a DNA amplification technique, the polymerase chain reaction, in all eight BAL cell preparations.
 In BAL cells adherent for up to 5 days in culture this method detected retroviral DNA that hybridized to a complementary pair of primers located in the env and gag gene regions of HIV-1.
 These studies demonstrate the uniform presence of HIV-1 harboring cells within the airways of the lung in individuals with AIDS and active respiratory infection and may have implications for local organ defense.
