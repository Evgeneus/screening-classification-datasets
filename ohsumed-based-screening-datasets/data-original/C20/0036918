 A manic syndrome in eight patients with AIDS is described.
 On the basis of clinical, neuropsychological, laboratory, magnetic resonance imaging, and epidemiological evidence, the authors suggest that the manic syndrome was secondary to HIV infection.
 The patients also developed concomitant cognitive impairment.
