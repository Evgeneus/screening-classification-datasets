Infection of CD8+ T lymphocytes with HIV. Requirement for interaction with infected CD4+ cells and induction of infectious virus from chronically infected CD8+ cells.
 In this study, we have investigated the basic requirements for HIV-1 infection of CD8+ lymphocytes in vitro.
 Unfractionated PBL obtained from healthy HIV-1 seronegative donors were activated with PHA and infected in vitro with HIV-1LAV.
 Based on immunofluorescent labeling, the vast majority of cells (85 to 97%) surviving peak virus replication belonged to the CD8+ subset and only a small percentage (0.5 to 1.5%) were CD4+.
 Amplification of HIV-1 proviral sequences by polymerase chain reaction performed on the sorted surviving CD8+ cells demonstrated that CD8+ cells harbored HIV-1 proviral DNA.
 In addition, stimulation of these HIV-1-infected, CD8(+)-sorted cells either with PHA or anti-CD2 mAb resulted in induction of virus replication, as measured by reverse transcriptase activity.
 Electron microscopic analysis of CD8+ cells chronically infected with HIV-1 and stimulated with PHA showed typical virions budding from, and associated with, the surface of cells immunolabeled with gold beads directed toward the CD8 molecule.
 Infection of CD8+ cells with HIV-1 occurred only when CD4+ cells were present in the PHA-activated lymphocyte population exposed to HIV-1 at the beginning of the culture or when sorted CD8+CD4- lymphocytes were cocultured with autologous sorted CD8-CD4+ cells that had been previously infected with HIV-1.
 Coculture of these cells with PHA-blasts and incubation of their supernatants with a CD4+ cell line showed that these chronically infected CD8+ cells could spread HIV-1 infection to uninfected CD4+ cells after stimulation with PHA or anti-CD2 mAb.
 Therefore, these results suggest that the minimal requirement for in vitro infection of CD3+CD8+CD4- lymphocytes is the presence of infected CD4+ cells and that infected CD8+ T lymphocytes can further spread the infection to CD4+ cells.
