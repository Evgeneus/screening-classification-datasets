Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in patients with advanced HIV infection treated with zidovudine.
 We wished to determine the incidence of human immunodeficiency virus-related high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and identify factors associated with the development of NHL in patients receiving zidovudine.
 Data are from a 2-year prospective, observational, multisite study of 1030 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and advanced AIDS-related complex who received zidovudine.
 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma developed in 24 (2.3%) of 1030 patients who received zidovudine during 1463 person-years of follow-up (rate, 1.6 per 100 person-years of therapy).
 The relative hazard for development of NHL was stable throughout 2 years of therapy, with the risk of developing NHL 0.8% for each additional 6 months of therapy.
 Factors associated with development of NHL were a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, herpes simplex virus infection, or lower mean neutrophil count.
 Less strongly associated was a prior diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia or homosexual transmission of HIV.
 By Cox proportional hazards analysis, a prior diagnosis of Kaposi's sarcoma, cytomegalovirus disease, or oral hairy leukoplakia was most strongly associated with development of NHL.
 Our study demonstrates a relatively high incidence of NHL in patients with advanced human immunodeficiency virus disease who are undergoing antiretroviral therapy and suggests possible risk factors for development of NHL.
