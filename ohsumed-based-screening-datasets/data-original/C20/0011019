Factors influencing outcome of treatment with zidovudine of patients with AIDS in Australia. The Australian Zidovudine Study Group.
 In a multicentre study of zidovudine therapy in Australia commencing in June 1987, 308 homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS started on zidovudine by 30 June 1988.
 Using follow-up data collected through 31 December 1988, the outcome of the first 18 months of zidovudine therapy in these patients has been analysed in terms of efficacy, expressed as survival and as time to development of a new AIDS-defining condition, and in terms of safety, expressed as toxicity.
 Median survival from time of diagnosis of AIDS was 124 weeks, significantly longer (P less than 0.001, logrank statistic) than the median survival of 44 weeks in historical controls representing AIDS patients prior to the availability of zidovudine therapy.
 Median survival time from starting zidovudine has not been reached in these patients, while 172 (56%) developed new AIDS-defining conditions, with median time to progression of 48 weeks.
 Anaemia requiring transfusion was experienced by 155 patients (50%).
 Significant differences (P less than 0.01, logrank statistic) in survival were found in favour of patients who commenced zidovudine therapy (Dx-zidovudine time) within 12 weeks of diagnosis and had baseline Karnofsky scores greater than or equal to 80, haemoglobin greater than or equal to 11 g/dl, CD4+ cell counts greater than or equal to 50 x 10(6)/l.
 Therapy-related significant differences (P less than 0.01, logrank statistic) in survival were found in favour of patients with no weight loss and who received the full zidovudine dose (1.2g) during the first 52 weeks of therapy.
