The epidemiology of AIDS in the New York and California Medicaid programs.
 An epidemiological analysis of the impact of AIDS on the New York and California Medicaid programs was conducted for 1983-1986.
 The epidemic affected the New York and California Medicaid programs in several similar ways.
 The total number of cases grew rapidly over the study time period.
 In both states, the epidemic was mostly confined to the young adult (21-44 years) age group.
 Cases were geographically concentrated and highly localized even within counties, but evidence of geographic dispersion to counties outside of the urban centers was also evident.
 Some dramatic differences were also found between California and New York.
 Patients with claims histories of drug use were far more likely to be found in the New York population and the proportion of other adult males (our proxy for the homosexual risk group) was higher in California.
 A much higher proportion of New York's population was female (30 vs.
 5%).
 New York also had many more pediatric cases.
 Most importantly, New York's raw number of cases was substantially higher than California, with approximately three times as many cases during the time period (1983-1986).
 There is also substantial evidence that transmission of the disease to heterosexual partners of drug users places heterosexual urban minorities at grave risk of contracting the disease through interaction with infected persons.
