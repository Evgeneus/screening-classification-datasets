Shoulder limitation in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 One hundred consecutive children with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) were evaluated for shoulder dysfunction.
 Shoulder arthritis was virtually absent in all 45 children with pauciarticular onset JRA.
 Twenty of 40 children (50%) with polyarticular JRA and 12 of 15 (80%) with systemic onset JRA had shoulder involvement characterized by pain or restricted passive range of motion (PROM).
 Ninety-five percent of those with shoulder arthritis had bilateral involvement.
 Children with systemic onset were likely to have shoulder disease within 2.5 years of onset and to have more severely limited PROM.
 Children with polyarticular onset developed shoulder arthritis any time during the course of their disease.
 With either type of onset, internal rotation was the most commonly and severely limited motion, followed by abduction.
 Clinicians treating children with JRA should carefully monitor pain and examine both rotational and planar components of shoulder motion.
