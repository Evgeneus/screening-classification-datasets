HIV-2 infection in an American.
 HIV-2 is endemic in West Africa but rare elsewhere.
 In the USA there have been 18 reported cases of HIV-2 infection; most identified people have been West Africans.
 We recently diagnosed the first case of HIV-2 infection in a native-born US citizen, a woman whose serum was found to be reactive to anti-HIV-1 enzyme immunoassay (EIA) when she attempted to donate blood in 1986.
 Although both HIV-1- and HIV-2-specific EIAs were reactive, the anti-HIV-2 Western blot (WB) was positive, while the anti-HIV-1 WB was positive or indeterminate on different occasions.
 Synthetic peptide testing was reactive for HIV-2 but not HIV-1.
 HIV-2 DNA was detected using the polymerase chain reaction procedure.
 Although she had travelled to West Africa, it is unclear how she became infected with HIV-2.
