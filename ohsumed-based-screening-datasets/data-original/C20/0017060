Colonic histoplasmosis in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Report of two cases.
 Colonic histoplasmosis is a rare entity.
 There have been four previous reported cases within the population of patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 Because of the increasing incidence of HIV infection within regions where histoplasmosis is endemic, this condition may become more common.
 Gastrointestinal histoplasmosis has protean clinical manifestations, and symptoms are often nonspecific.
 Any patient with HIV infection who has unexplained GI symptoms should undergo evaluation for possible histoplasmosis.
 Aggressive long-term amphotericin B therapy has been effective in HIV patients with histoplasmosis.
 Resection or diversion of symptomatic colonic strictures caused by histoplasmosis may be necessary in addition to medical therapy.
