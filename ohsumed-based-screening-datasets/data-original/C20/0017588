Substance p-induced cutaneous and bronchial reactions in children with bronchial asthma.
 We studied substance P-induced cutaneous and bronchial reactions in children with allergic disorders.
 Furthermore, inhibitory effects of lidocaine on these responses elicited by substance P were also studied.
 In the intradermal test, children with moderate or severe bronchial asthma showed significantly stronger reactions than controls.
 In bronchial challenge with substance P, children with bronchial asthma showed an increasing fall in FEV1 and V50 in proportion to the severity of their asthma.
 Concomitant use of lidocaine significantly inhibited not only substance P-induced intradermal erythema and wheal reactions but air flow limitations.
 It also inhibited histamine-induced erythema and house dust-induced wheal and erythema reactions.
 No adverse reactions to lidocaine were observed.
 These results suggest that substance P might play an important role in cutaneous and bronchial hypersensitivity reactions in humans and that lidocaine has an inhibitory effect on substance P-induced reactions.
