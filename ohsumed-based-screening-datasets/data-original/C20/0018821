Enhancement of HIV-1 cytocidal effects in CD4+ lymphocytes by the AIDS-associated mycoplasma.
 Coinfection with Mycoplasma fermentans (incognitus strain) enhances the ability of human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) to induce cytopathic effects on human T lymphocytes in vitro.
 Syncytium formation of HIV-infected T cells was essentially eliminated in the presence of M.
 fermentans (incognitus strain), despite prominent cell death.
 However, replication and production of HIV-1 particles continued during the coinfection.
 Furthermore, the supernatant from cultures coinfected with HIV-1 and the mycoplasma contained a factor that inhibited the standard reverse transcriptase enzyme assay.
 The modification of the biological properties of HIV-1 by coinfection with mycoplasma may be involved in the pathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
