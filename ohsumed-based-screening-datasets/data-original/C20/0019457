Gastrointestinal dysfunction and disaccharide intolerance in children infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
 Because gastrointestinal dysfunction is a major problem in children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we utilized breath hydrogen measurements to determine the relationship between disaccharide malabsorption and gastrointestinal dysfunction in HIV-infected children.
 We found a strong association between lactose intolerance and persistent diarrheal disease in this population (p less than 0.007, Mann-Whitney U test).
 We also found evidence of sucrose malabsorption and persistent diarrheal disease in three of the children.
 Extensive microbiologic evaluations failed to reveal an etiologic agent related to the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms.
 Our findings indicate that disaccharide intolerance is a common occurrence in HIV-infected children with persistent diarrheal disease.
 Careful attention to dietary intake may be required to ameliorate clinical symptoms and to maintain adequate nutrition.
