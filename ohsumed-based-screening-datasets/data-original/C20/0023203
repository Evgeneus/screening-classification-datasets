AIDS in primary care: a report from the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network.
 BACKGROUND.
 Despite the importance of the epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), little is known about the incidence and prevalence of AIDS in the patient population of primary care physicians.
 This study was designed as an initial step in evaluating the impact of this disease on primary care practices.
 METHODS.
 We conducted a survey to characterize the AIDS cases in the Ambulatory Sentinel Practice Network (ASPN).
 ASPN is a practice-based primary care research network.
 In 1987 it was composed of 65 practices and 193 clinicians serving approximately 270,000 patients in the United States and Canada.
 Clinicians representing each practice were asked to report the number of AIDS patients that their practice cared for between January 1982 and December 1987.
 They were further asked to characterize relevant data for these patients.
 RESULTS.
 Thirty-nine prevalent cases of AIDS were reported in ASPN from January 1982 through December 1987.
 Seventy-nine percent of the patients were male, 15 to 44 years of age; three patients (7.6%) were female; and all cases had at least one risk factor for AIDS.
 An expected number of cases for the 194,973 patients of 47 practices was calculated using age-sex register data and nationally based rates from 1986.
 The projected number, 13, corresponded with the number of AIDS cases, 11 and 15, reported from ASPN practices in 1986 and 1987, respectively.
 CONCLUSIONS.
 This survey suggests that AIDS is at least as prevalent in the primary care practices in ASPN as predicted using national estimates, and may, in fact, be more prevalent.
 Primary care clinicians need to be prepared to assume a major role in addressing the AIDS epidemic.
