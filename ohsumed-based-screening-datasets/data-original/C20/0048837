Advances in pediatric drug therapy of asthma.
 Most pediatric patients requiring medication to prevent or treat asthmatic symptoms require only the use of inhaled beta 2 agonists.
 Children younger than 6 years old usually require use of the nebulized or oral forms of beta 2 agonists.
 Theophylline or cromolyn is added as a second-line agent to the regimens of children who need an additional agent.
 Anticholinergic agents are added as third-line agents for resistant cases of asthma.
 Inhaled and oral steroids are reserved for resistant cases of childhood chronic asthma, even though adults frequently are given inhaled steroids as second-line agents.
 Parenteral steroids are used for the treatment of status asthmaticus.
