The allergic patient who is noncompliant and abusive: dealing with the adverse experience.
 The field of Allergy-Immunology is involved with the care of patients with chronic illness.
 The care of these patients is enhanced when the physician has established good rapport with the patient.
 The noncompliant, disruptive behavior of some patients can try the patience of even the most understanding physicians and, in turn, impede the delivery of care.
 Interactions with this type of patient may leave the physician with feelings of guilt, frustration, and helplessness.
 We review such an encounter with the purpose of describing how to deal with this type of patient and to guide the physician in responding to this adverse behavior.
 Such patients will usually require limits to be set on behavioral acting out for their own best interest.
 Further, it is often necessary to make continued care contingent on compliance with the ground rules set.
 The physician must be aware of his or her adverse feelings toward the patient and be able to interpret the behavior in the context of the psychiatric disorder so that appropriate psychologic help for the patient can be provided.
