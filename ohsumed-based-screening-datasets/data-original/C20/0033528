Protooncogene (C-Myc) expression in the infiltrating cells of lesional skin from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Polyclonal activation of lymphocytes due to an unknown cause is considered to be one of the most important findings of systemic autoimmune disorders including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
 In order to confirm the expression of the C-Myc protooncogene in lesional skin, tissue specimens from SLE were examined by the histo in situ hybridization method and a histochemical method using a specific antibody reactive with C-Myc related products.
 Twenty-two cases of SLE, six cases of DLE, one case of lupus erythematosus profundus, two cases of lichen planus, and five skin specimens from healthy volunteers were selected for the examination.
 In the SLE group, further comparative examination of diseased skin and normal skin from the same patient, and of diseased skin in an active stage and a stable stage in the same SLE patient with renal involvement, were carried out.
 In most of the active SLE cases, protooncogene expression had apparently increased as compared with the expression in the groups of inactive and treated SLE, active DLE, active lichen planus, and those with healthy skin.
 Even in normal-appearing skin from active SLE without other organic failure, the protooncogenes were not expressed very strongly.
