Lack of graft rejection in a renal transplant recipient with AIDS.
 A renal transplant recipient developed evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and severe opportunistic infection 44 months after transplantation.
 A strikingly reduced dosage of pharmacologic immunosuppression was required to maintain renal graft function.
 This may be the result of impaired helper T-cell function associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
