Hypercalcemia as a clinical prodrome to lymphoma.
 A 73-year-old man was admitted for evaluation of unexplained hypercalcemia and was found to have a large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with stage IV disease.
 Treatment with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin (Adriamycin), vincristine sulfate, and prednisone chemotherapy returned his calcium levels to normal.
 Hypercalcemia with lymphoma is rare, and persistent evaluation for malignancy is essential.
