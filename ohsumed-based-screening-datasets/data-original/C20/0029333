Knowledge and attitudes of day care center parents and care providers regarding children infected with human immunodeficiency virus.
 It was hypothesized that parents and child care providers are not prepared to accept children infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), who are increasing in number, into the day care center setting.
 To determine their knowledge and attitudes toward HIV transmission, 219 parents in 4 day care centers and 176 care providers in 12 day care centers were given confidential questionnaires.
 More than 98% of respondents knew that sex and needle sharing can transmit HIV; 84% of parents and 77% of care providers knew that contact with blood can transmit HIV.
 There was, however, uncertainty about transmission via many common contacts in day care centers: human bites, urine, stool, tears, and vomit; kissing; sharing of food and eating utensils; and diaper changing areas.
 Only 43% of parents said they would allow their child to stay in the same room with a child who was infected with HIV.
 In a multiple logistic regression model, the unwillingness of parents to have their child stay in the same room with a child who was infected with HIV was significantly (P less than .0001) associated with black ethnicity, beliefs that such a child is likely to infect others (40%) and is dangerous to others (58%), and fear of their child being exposed to HIV (86%).
 Care providers' unwillingness to care for a child infected with HIV in the classroom (48%) was significantly (P less than .0001) associated with beliefs that such a child is likely to infect others (44%) and that common day care center contacts can transmit HIV (62%).
