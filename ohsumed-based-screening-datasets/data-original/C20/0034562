Salivary secretion rate, yeast cells, and oral candidiasis in patients with acute leukemia.
 Stimulated salivary secretion rate was repeatedly determined in 29 patients with acute leukemia during two periods of cytotoxic treatment in myelosuppressive doses.
 For comparison, the salivary secretion rate was studied in 83 healthy persons and in three other groups of hospitalized patients without malignant disorders.
 At the start of cytotoxic treatment the secretion rate in the patients with leukemia was lower than in healthy persons.
 The rate fell significantly after 1 to 3 days and later rose to the level seen in the healthy persons.
 Several interacting factors may have contributed to the decrease in salivary secretion rate, but the most important factor was probably the use of antiemetic drugs during the first 3 days of the study periods.
 No relationship was found between salivary secretion rate and the number of gram-negative rods found in the mouth.
 Patients with low salivary secretion rates had high numbers of yeast cells and more often oral candidiasis.
