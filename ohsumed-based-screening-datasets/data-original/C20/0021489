Combined ganciclovir and recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in AIDS patients.
 Ganciclovir is effective in halting or delaying the progression of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 However, the development of neutropenia necessitates the interruption of ganciclovir therapy in 40-50% of AIDS patients.
 In an ongoing randomized, controlled trial, AIDS patients with CMV retinitis are receiving standard ganciclovir therapy or ganciclovir plus recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rHuGM-CSF).
 rHuGM-CSF is administered by daily subcutaneous injections and is given in ascending doses based on the neutrophil response in the individual patient.
 Preliminary data obtained from 36 evaluable patients (21 receiving ganciclovir alone, 15 receiving ganciclovir plus rHuGM-CSF) suggest that rHuGM-CSF administration is associated with a trend toward a decrease in the proportion of patients developing an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of less than 750 cells/microliter (40% vs.
 59%), in the overall incidence of such neutropenic episodes (20 vs.
 68), and in the duration of ganciclovir treatment interruption due to the development of an ANC of less than 500 cells/microliter (5.5 days vs.
 10.1 days).
 rHuGM-CSF administration has been generally well tolerated, and no consistent proliferative effect of this agent on human immunodeficiency virus infection has been observed.
 Definitive conclusions regarding the coadministration of rHuGM-CSF and ganciclovir await completion of the trial.
