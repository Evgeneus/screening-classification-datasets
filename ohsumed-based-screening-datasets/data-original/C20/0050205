Depletion of CD4+ T cells in major histocompatibility complex class II-deficient mice.
 The maturation of T cells in the thymus is dependent on the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.
 By disruption of the MHC class II Ab beta gene in embryonic stem cells, mice were generated that lack cell surface expression of class II molecules.
 These MHC class II-deficient mice were depleted of mature CD4+ T cells and were deficient in cell-mediated immune responses.
 These results provide genetic evidence that class II molecules are required for the maturation and function of mature CD4+ T cells.
