Comparison of linear antigenic sites in the envelope proteins of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 2 and type 1.
 The occurrence of dominant linear antigenic sites in the envelope glycoproteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) was evaluated.
 Twenty-five peptides representing different regions of HIV-2, strain SBL-6669, were synthesized.
 For comparison the corresponding peptides of HIV-1, strain BRU, were also prepared.
 The peptides were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with human sera from individuals with proven HIV-1 or HIV-2 infection and simian sera from animals infected with HIV-2 or simian immunodeficiency virus of sooty mangabay monkey origin (SIVsm).
 Four major antigenic regions were identified.
 Peptides representing parts or the whole V3 (neutralizing loop) region and an additional stretch of amino acids located at the carboxy terminal of this region showed considerable reactivity.
 This reaction was predominantly type specific, but some heterotypic reactivity was also seen.
 Peptides representing the carboxy terminal 21 amino acids of the V3 region of the type-related viruses HIV-2 and SIVsm allowed selective identification of strain-specific antibodies.
 A second major antigenic region was found close to the carboxy terminal end of the large glycoproteins.
 This region was cross-reactive between the two types.
 The two additional dominating antigenic regions were located in the amino terminal region of the transmembrane glycoprotein.
 One region has previously been shown to be a uniquely antigenic type-specific site.
 The other region was also type-specific, but was identified only in HIV-2, amino acids Glu634-Lys649.
 Excellent facilities are available for the design of not only type-unique site-specific serological tests but potentially also type-cross-reactive and strain-specific assays.
