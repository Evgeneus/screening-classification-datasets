Enhanced reactive oxygen species metabolism of airspace cells and airway inflammation follow antigen challenge in human asthma.
 Airflow limitation and airway inflammation follow antigen bronchoprovocation in sensitized individuals.
 Inflammation likely results from the interplay of several previously demonstrated factors, but the participation and persistence of enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism of airspace cells after antigen challenge have received more limited attention.
 We studied nine subjects with mild asthma by bronchoalveolar lavage before and 48 (one subject) to 72 (eight subjects) hours after antigen bronchoprovocation and compared airspace cell numbers and types, cell function, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein, albumin, and immunoglobulins.
 Mild, but significant, airflow limitation persisted at the time of the second lavage.
 Eosinophil influx was a notable component of the increased airspace cells in postchallenge lavages.
 Airspace cells demonstrated significantly enhanced ROS metabolism, and total protein, albumin, and IgM levels were higher in postchallenge lavage specimens.
 Antigen bronchial challenge produces airspace inflammation, which may develop, in part, as a consequence of enhanced ROS metabolism of airspace cells.
