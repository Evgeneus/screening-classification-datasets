Treatment of AIDS with combinations of antiretroviral agents.
 Although 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (zidovudine, AZT) has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, there are limitations associated with its use.
 Consequently, other agents, such as 2',3'-dideoxycytidine (ddC) and 2',3'-dideoxyinosine (ddI), are being assessed for the treatment of patients with HIV infection.
 However, the most effective therapy for HIV infection may be combination therapy with zidovudine and any of a number of other therapies.
 To obtain maximum efficacy, combination regimens should include agents that do not share cross-resistance, have different mechanisms of action, and have different dose-limiting toxicities; the relative merits of a concurrent dosage schedule (limits drug failure) and a consecutive dosage schedule (limits toxicity) must also be considered.
 In addition, the shift between administering a starting regimen and a rescue regimen should be based on time on therapy, disease breakthrough, or drug complication.
 Eventually, the shift may be precipitated by the in vitro resistance patterns of individual viruses, as is now the case with antibiotics for infection.
 Several trials are currently in progress to assess combination therapy with zidovudine and ddC; initial results indicate that the combination may allow for improved efficacy and decreased side effects, compared with treatment with either drug alone.
 Trials of combination therapy with ddI, interferon alfa, and acyclovir are also in progress.
 It is hoped that these initial studies will pave the way for rational drug sequencing in the treatment of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
