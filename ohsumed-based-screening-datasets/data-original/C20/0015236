Assessment of risk for HIV-1 infection for missionaries in sub-Saharan Africa.
 North American mission boards (N = 82) with programs in sub-Saharan Africa were surveyed to identify practices affecting risk of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection among international staff.
 Thirty-four percent of participating boards thought risk for HIV-1 infection in missionaries in Africa was greater than it was for the general US population, and 53% considered it greater for overseas medical staff serving in the region than for domestic health care workers.
 Nevertheless, only 24% of boards had formal AIDS education programs for overseas health care workers, and 19% for nonmedical personnel going abroad.
 Medical care provision and acquisition were considered high-risk activities; 42% of boards with a known policy acknowledged that disposable injection equipment was routinely reused, 68% indicated that immunizations were provided abroad, and 60% admitted that inoculations were administered by indigenous health care workers.
 The most frequently cited specific suggestion for decreasing the risk of HIV-1 infection overseas was the implementation of a walking blood bank program.
 We conclude that current practices and logistic constraints make HIV-1 transmission possible.
 Risk reduction strategies include more comprehensive health education programs, greater adherence to universal precautions, less dependence on the indigenous Third World health care system, and implementation of innovative programs for health care delivery.
