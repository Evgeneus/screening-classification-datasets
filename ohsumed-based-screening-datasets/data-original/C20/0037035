A growing spectrum of surgical disease in patients with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Experience with 120 major cases.
 One hundred twenty major general surgical procedures were performed on 88 adult patients harboring the human immunodeficiency virus.
 Fifty-eight (48%) of the procedures were performed on patients who fulfilled the criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 The patients were predominantly male (94%).
 Single risk factors included homosexuality (73% of cases), intravenous drug abuse (8%), and previous blood transfusions (8%).
 Four patients (5%) had multiple risk factors; risk factors were denied by seven patients (8%).
 The mean age at surgery was 41.6 years (range, 22 to 67 years).
 Surgical conditions that rarely affect the population without the human immunodeficiency virus presented diagnostic challenges.
 Altered physiologic responses to even routine conditions were observed.
 Thirty-day morbidity rates for emergency (group A) and elective (group B) procedures were 19% and 9%, respectively.
 This included seven surgical deaths (13%) in group A and one in group B (2%).
 Patients undergoing 92 of 112 procedures (82%) not associated with surgical mortality were followed up.
 Patients who were dead at follow-up had mean procedure-survivals of 19 weeks (group A) and 21 weeks (group B) for 33 procedures.
 Those who remained alive had a mean procedure-survival of 86 weeks for 59 procedures.
 No single prognosticator could be correlated with outcome, although the combination of hypoalbuminemia with a history of opportunistic infection(s) was associated with short survival.
 Emergency and elective procedures can be performed in the patient with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome with acceptable morbidity and mortality.
 Procedures are indicated to extend patient life or to improve quality of life.
