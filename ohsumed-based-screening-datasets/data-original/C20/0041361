Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy in patients with spinal cord dysfunction.
 Patients with spinal cord dysfunction are at an increased risk for urolithiasis.
 A retrospective study was undertaken to determine the effectiveness of extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) in this population.
 Thirteen kidneys received 19 treatments averaging 2,350 shocks per renal unit.
 All but one of the stones showed good fragmentation; however, none of the patients was stone-free at three months.
 Four of 9 patients with long-term follow-up were stone-free at five to fifteen months.
 Our poor stone-free rate is similar to that found in other studies of patients with spinal cord dysfunction.
 ESWL was well tolerated in this population, however, the clearance of stones is poor and delayed.
