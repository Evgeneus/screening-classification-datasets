AIDS awareness in North Dakota--a knowledge and attitude study of the general population.
 The AIDS program of the North Dakota Department of Health and Consolidated Laboratories has provided a broad range of information concerning AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) and HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) to State residents over the past few years.
 The ultimate intent of these intervention efforts was to decrease viral transmission.
 To assess residents' knowledge and attitudes regarding AIDS, a statewide, random telephone study was conducted by AIDS Program personnel in the fall of 1987, 1988, and 1989, with technical assistance from the Bureau of Governmental Affairs, University of North Dakota.
 Study results indicated a majority of the respondents considered themselves to have at least "some" knowledge about AIDS.
 Participants' comprehension of viral transmission routes and prevention methods increased over the 3 years, yet misconceptions still exist.
 Identified areas of misconception were accentuated in subsequent State educational programs.
 When the results were compared with national studies, knowledge levels in North Dakota were generally similar to but frequently superior to the nationwide levels.
