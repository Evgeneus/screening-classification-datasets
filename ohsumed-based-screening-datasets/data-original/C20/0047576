T-dependent destruction of thyroid isografts exposed to IFN-gamma.
 Several autoimmune diseases are accompanied by tissue-specific expression of class II molecules of the MHC, and it has been suggested that this elicits a T cell response against tissue-specific Ag to which the individual is not tolerant.
 However, recent transgenic studies have indicated that non-lymphoid expression of class II genes in the pancreas, liver, and kidney is either innocuous or induces peripheral tolerance.
 To test this hypothesis in another organ-specific autoimmune disease, we attempted to induce autoimmune thyroiditis in normal mice with class II+ thyroid tissue.
 Normal thyroid lobes were cultured with and without IFN-gamma and then transplanted to adult isogeneic recipients.
 The thyroid that had been induced to express class II genes by IFN-gamma was destroyed in normal mice, whereas the control cultured thyroid and the native cervical gland survived.
 Both types of transplants remained intact and functional in congenic nu/nu recipients, indicating that neither exposure to IFN-gamma nor expression of class II genes compromised the thyroid.
 Thus, in some tissues, exposure to IFN-gamma and/or the induction of class II expression can lead to T-dependent autoimmune disease.
