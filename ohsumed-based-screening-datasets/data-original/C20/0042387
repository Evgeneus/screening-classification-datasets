Decreased CD45RA T cells in B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia patients: correlation with disease stage.
 T-cell subsets CD4, CD8 and suppressor-inducers (CD45RA) were determined in 20 patients with B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL).
 The proportion of CD4 and CD45RA was decreased when compared with T cells from normal subjects.
 CD8 was markedly increased.
 The activity of concanavalin A-induced suppressor cells was not significantly different from that of normal controls and was negatively correlated to the percentage of CD4 of B-CLL patients.
 The selective loss of CD45RA cells was more prominent in patients in advanced Rai stages of the disease (III to IV) than in early stages (0 to II).
 Six patients of the advanced stages group suffered from autoimmune hemolytic anemia, whereas no patient in the early stages of disease showed an autoimmune phenomenon.
 Our results may indicate a mechanism of autoimmunity in B-CLL similar to that of patients with autoimmune diseases.
