Human cytomegalovirus viraemia in HIV-1-seropositive patients at various clinical stages of infection.
 Eighty-two HIV-1-seropositive subjects were examined for the presence and quantification of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) by polymerase chain reaction, culture and immunofluorescence in order to investigate the relationship between viraemia and immunosuppression.
 Patients were divided into three groups: (1) asymptomatic subjects with greater than 400 x 10(6)/l CD4 lymphocytes (n = 30); (2) asymptomatic subjects with less than 400 x 10(6)/l of CD4 lymphocytes and zidovudine (n = 20), and (3) AIDS-related complex (ARC)/AIDS patients on zidovudine (n = 32).
 Evidence of HCMV infection in circulating PMNL was found in 15 out of 29 ARC/AIDS patients examined (51.7%), whereas no infection was detected among the 50 asymptomatic HIV-1-seropositive subjects.
 HCMV-related symptoms were found only where the number of infected PMNL was greater than 50 per 2 x 10(5) cells.
