Neuropsychological deficit in haemophiliacs with human immunodeficiency virus.
 Neuropsychological impairment is widely accepted as being common in acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) but infrequent in asymptomatic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals.
 The neuropsychological function of a homogenous sample of HIV-infected haemophiliacs was investigated.
 Neuropsychological impairment, the nature of which is compatible with that described in the existing literature, was found in one of four AIDS cases.
 Eleven AIDS related complex (ARC) and 12 asymptomatic HIV-infected individuals were free of neuropsychological deficit.
