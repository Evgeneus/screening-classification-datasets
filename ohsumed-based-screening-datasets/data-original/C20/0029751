Atopic dermatitis provoked by AL721 in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
 A 40-year-old patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) had an atopic dermatitis-like skin eruption and elevated serum IgE levels after therapy with AL721.
 This agent is a mixture of egg yolk lipids used for the treatment of AIDS.
 The relationship between the drug and the eruption has been based on circumstantial evidence and confirmed by the positive results of skin tests.
 Although an almost unlimited amount of materials have been reported to be responsible for atopic manifestations, cases of drug-induced atopic dermatitis are rare.
 AL721, however, can be regarded as a food product; therefore, the appearance of the eruption following intake of this agent should not be considered exceptional.
