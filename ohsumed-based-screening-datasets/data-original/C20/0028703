Role of surgery in multimodality therapy for gastrointestinal lymphoma.
 Between 1973 and 1989, 49 patients with gastrointestinal lymphomas were treated at the Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Washington, and followed in the tumor registry.
 The purpose of this review was to determine the influence of treatment on long-term survival of these patients.
 The mean age was 63 years (range: 38 to 83 years).
 There were 33 men and 16 women.
 The primary tumor sites were gastric 33 (67%), small bowel 11 (22%), and colon 5 (10%).
 Common signs and/or symptoms at presentation were pain (n = 38), bleeding (n = 11), and weight loss (n = 14).
 The diagnostic sensitivities of contrast radiography, computed tomography, and endoscopic biopsy were 76%, 89%, and 79%, respectively.
 Forty-eight patients were treated, and one received supportive care only.
 Thirty-one patients had surgical resections, 33 patients had chemotherapy, and 16 patients had radiotherapy.
 Most (n = 30) had multimodality treatment.
 Statistically significant variables affecting survival rates in patients with gastric lymphomas were lower tumor stage, younger patient age, and surgical resection.
