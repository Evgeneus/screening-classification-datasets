Surgery for sinusitis and aspirin triad.
 An 11-year retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the surgical treatment of sinusitis in aspirin-triad patients.
 Twenty-five patients were selected for surgery when their sinus disease and asthma progressed despite intense medical treatment.
 Sixteen patients had radiographic evidence of severe ethmoid disease, and their initial surgical procedures were limited (i.e., bilateral intranasal ethmoidectomies).
 Of these 16 patients, 6 required subsequent surgery for recurrent sinusitis.
 Nine of the 25 patients had radiographic evidence of severe antral, as well as ethmoid, disease.
 Their initial surgical procedures were radical, i.e., bilateral Caldwell-Luc operations with intranasal and transantral sphenoethmoidectomies.
 None of these 9 patients required further surgical treatment for control.
 This review indicates that if antral and sphenoid disease are detected in association with ethmoid involvement, a radical surgical approach is the operation of choice.
