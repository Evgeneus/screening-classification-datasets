Major aphthous-like ulcers in patients with AIDS.
 This report describes persistent, painful oral ulcers that occurred in nine patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
 These ulcers resembled major aphthous ulcers in clinical appearance and response to therapy.
 They occurred less frequently in patients with AIDS than those caused by herpes simplex and were found in 4 of 346 (1.1%) patients with AIDS at one medical center.
 Lesions were typically painful.
 Identification and treatment with topical tetracycline and steroids led to resolution with relief of symptoms.
 Further study is necessary to understand the etiology and pathogenesis of these ulcers.
