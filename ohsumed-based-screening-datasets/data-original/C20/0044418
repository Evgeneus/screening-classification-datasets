Factors that could influence the spread of AIDS in Ghana, West Africa: knowledge of AIDS, sexual behavior, prostitution, and traditional medical practices.
 Ghana is a West African nation in the early stages of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic.
 In a series of surveys done between 1987 and 1989, we examined factors related to the spread of HIV infection, including knowledge about the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), sexual habits, use of prostitutes, traditional healer practices, and skin-piercing customs.
 Although a polygamous society, three-fourths of married men had only one wife.
 The number of sexual partners at any one time was generally low.
 However, the divorce rate was more than 29% and 55% of married men had current sexual partners in addition to their wives.
 Knowledge about AIDS was widespread, yet 4% of men interviewed had had a sexual encounter with a prostitute within the last month.
 Use of condoms was very limited and 66% of customers of high-class prostitutes refused to use a condom even after a request to do so by the prostitute.
 Skin piercing, including scarification, was done by an unsterile instrument by 39% of 74 rural traditional healers, many of whom had more than one patient per day.
 To combat the spread of AIDS, Ghanaians will have to apply their knowledge of AIDS risk factors to their actual behavior.
 Many of the social customs are products of poverty and its ensuing social consequences.
 Funds are needed for specific AIDS prevention programs as well as improved education and health care throughout the country.
