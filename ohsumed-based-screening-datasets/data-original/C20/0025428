The role of leukotriene antagonists and inhibitors in the treatment of airway disease.
 Since the early recognition that leukotrienes are generated in response to allergen exposure, a role for these multipurpose mediators has been sought.
 The pharmacologic actions of the leukotrienes and their cell sources were strong evidence that they should contribute to allergic airway disease.
 That promise is now being fulfilled.
 Potent leukotriene receptor antagonists and enzyme inhibitors of leukotriene generation are now being investigated.
 With the availability of these new compounds, not only will greater insight to leukotrienes in asthma become apparent, but possibly newer, more effective therapeutics.
 Of additional interest and relevance is the potential role of leukotrienes in other nonrespiratory inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis.
 Therefore, the role of leukotrienes in inflammation is not limited to the respiratory system but are more universal in their ability to cause tissue injury.
 Consequently, studies that have shown benefit from inhibition of leukotriene synthesis and antagonism of the LTD4 receptor in respiratory diseases are suggestive that such an approach will also be beneficial in other inflammatory diseases.
 For example, a study of 72 patients with A-64077 (zileuton) has demonstrated that 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors are efficacious in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease.
 Therefore, the contribution of leukotrienes to inflammation is likely to be a global phenomenon, and the introduction of leukotriene antagonists and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors may represent the beginning of a new era for the treatment of many inflammatory diseases.
