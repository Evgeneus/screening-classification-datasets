Antibodies against defined carbohydrate structures of Candida albicans protect H9 cells against infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 in vitro.
 In this study we raised antibodies against Candida albicans mannans of serotype A and B which comprise mannose alpha(1----2)-and mannose alpha(1----3)-linked residues.
 These antibodies inhibited human immunodeficiency virus type IIIB (HIV-IIIB) infection of H9 cells in vitro; 5 micrograms/ml of antibodies against mannan from serotype A and 10 micrograms/ml of antibodies against serotype B mannan were sufficient to inhibit infection by almost 100 and 85%, respectively, after an incubation period of 4 days.
 During a prolonged incubation period (8-12 days), the amount of HIV particles (as measured by reverse transcriptase activity in the culture medium) increased again in assays with antibodies raised against serotype B, but only little in assays containing antibodies against serotype A.
 Applying the Western blotting technique and a novel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system it was established that the antibodies reacted with the gp120 of HIV-1 exclusively.
 Immunofluorescence inspection using a confocal laser scanning microscope revealed that the gp120 protein is exposed on the outer surface of H9 cells where it is recognized by the anti-mannan antibodies.
 These results indicate that mannan residues of C.
 albicans can serve as antigens to raise neutralizing antibodies against HIV infection.
