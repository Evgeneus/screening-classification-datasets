Allergy to penicillin: fable or fact?
 OBJECTIVE--To assess whether, on the basis of one blood test, penicillin allergy might be excluded sufficiently for general practitioners to give oral penicillin to patients claiming a history of penicillin allergy.
 DESIGN--Prospective study of patients referred by general practitioners.
 SETTING--Outpatient allergy clinic in a district general hospital.
 PATIENTS--175 referred patients who gave a history of immediate type reaction to penicillin, of whom 144 attended as requested and 132 completed the investigations.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES--History and examination, serum radioallergosorbent test to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin, and oral challenge with penicillin.
 RESULTS--Of 132 patients, four were confirmed to have penicillin allergy by the radioallergosorbent test and 128 had an oral penicillin challenge without ill effect.
 CONCLUSIONS--Most patients who gave a history of penicillin allergy are not so allergic, and their actual allergic state should be substantiated whenever feasible.
 For patients reporting minor or vague reactions negative findings with a radioallergosorbent test to phenoxymethylpenicillin and benzylpenicillin provide sufficient evidence to give oral penicillin safely.
