The effect of nedocromil sodium on the early and late reaction and allergen-induced bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
 Bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine was studied in 14 patients with asthma and five healthy control subjects, with and without pretreatment with nedocromil sodium, 3 and 24 hours after allergen challenge.
 Eleven patients demonstrated a dual asthmatic response.
 A significant decrease in the provocative concentration causing a 20% fall in FEV1 was found from a geometric mean starting value of 1.18 mg/ml on the control day to 0.24 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) and to 0.17 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) 3 and 24 hours after allergen challenge.
 A significant correlation was observed between the increased BHR at 3 hours and the magnitude of the late response (r = -0.57; p less than 0.05).
 Nedocromil sodium (6 mg) significantly inhibited the increase in BHR, 1 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) at 3 hours and 0.50 mg/ml (p less than 0.001) at 24 hours.
 Nedocromil sodium shifted the severity of the early allergic reaction (EAR) from mean -34.8% to -6.9% and inhibited the later allergic reaction (LAR) from -30.5% to +0.4% (p less than 0.005).
 From the study can be concluded that nedocromil sodium inhibits the EAR and LAR and the allergen-induced increase in BHR.
 The inhibitory effect of nedocromil sodium on the LAR may be related to its ability to inhibit the increased BHR before the development of the LAR.
