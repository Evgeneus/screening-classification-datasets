Increased free light chains in the urine from patients with multiple sclerosis.
 We quantitated free kappa (kappa) and lambda light (L) chains in coded urine specimens from subjects with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS) (N = 56), other neurologic diseases (OND) (N = 30), and age-matched normal controls (N = 28).
 Urine from MS patients showed statistically significant increases in free L chains compared with the other groups, although there was overlap between MS patients and OND patients.
 The ratio of kappa/creatinine was significantly greater in the relapsing-remitting MS group than in patients with clinically stable MS, OND, and normal controls.
 Elevated free L chains were usually independent of urinary albumin and beta 2-microglobulin levels.
 Serial studies showed that urinary free kappa/creatinine ratios were elevated during periods of clinical worsening in seven of eight MS patients and subsequently decreased during clinical recovery.
 The measurement of free L chains in urine obtained at intervals from MS patients may be useful as a marker to monitor disease activity.
