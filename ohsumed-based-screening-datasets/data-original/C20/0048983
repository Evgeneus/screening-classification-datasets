Most CD8+ cells in skin lesions of CD3+ CD4+ mycosis fungoides are CD3+ T cells that lack CD11b, CD16, CD56, CD57, and human Hanukah factor mRNA.
 To define further the characteristics of CD8+ cells in skin lesions of CD3+ CD4+ mycosis fungoides (MF), the authors used single- and double-label immunohistologic techniques and in situ hybridization to detect antigens and transcripts associated with certain types of cytotoxic or suppressor function.
 The cytotoxic markers included CD16, CD56, CD57, and an anti-sense probe for human Hanukah factor (HuHf) mRNA.
 Analysis of 23 cases demonstrated that lesional CD8+ cells were CD3+ T cells that generally lacked expression of any of the cytotoxic markers studied.
 Analysis of another 10 cases confirmed the CD3+ T-cell lineage of lesional CD8+ cells and demonstrated that these cells also lacked expression of the suppressor-associated marker, CD11b.
 In aggregate, these results indicate that most CD8+ cells in CD3+ CD4+ MF skin lesions are of T-cell rather than NK-cell differentiation.
 Their overall phenotype suggests that they may be major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted cytotoxic T cells lacking appreciable levels of HuHF serine protease.
 Because the induction of CD8+ suppressor T cells is mediated by CD4+ T cells expressing the CD45RA+ RO- phenotype, CD45 epitope expression was studied in 15 MF cases.
 The vast majority (13/15) contained CD3+ CD4+ tumor cells that were CD45+ RA- RB+ RO+ 2B11+.
 This phenotype is consistent with memory T cells rather than suppressor-inducer T cells, and correlates with the paucity of phenotypically defined suppressor T cells in CD3+ CD4+ MF skin lesions.
