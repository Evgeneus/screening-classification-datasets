Hyaline globules reacting positively with zidovudine antibody in brain and spinal cord of AIDS patients.
 Histology of the central nervous system in nine AIDS showed extracellular hyaline globules in the white matter of the brain and the spinal cord.
 In immunohistochemical studies with a battery of antibodies, the only positive reaction of these globules was with an antibody to zidovudine.
 High-performance liquid chromatography showed the presence of a zidovudine isomer in eluates of brain tissue from these patients.
