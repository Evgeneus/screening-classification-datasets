Respiratory distress in a child in the office.
 We have reviewed respiratory distress from a pathophysiologic approach.
 Two specific disease entities, epiglottitis and asthma, which commonly present with respiratory distress, are reviewed.
 The office management of respiratory distress encompasses early recognition of disease to prevent symptoms from progressing.
 Referral should be considered in any difficult cases.
