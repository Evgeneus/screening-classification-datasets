Interleukin-1 and a 7-kDa T-cell inhibitory monokine reflect disease activity in infection with HIV-1.
 Previous studies demonstrated that cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with AIDS produce high levels of interleukin 1 (IL-1) and a 7-kDa T-cell inhibitory monokine (TCIM).
 To determine if the increase in the production of these cytokines corresponded with disease activity, we studied the production of IL-1 and TCIM by PBMC from patients with different stages of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
 Eight patients with asymptomatic seropositive infection, three patients with AIDS-related complex (ARC), three patients with persistent generalized lymphadenopathy (PGL), and six patients meeting the full criteria for diagnosis of AIDS were studied.
 Patients with AIDS produced increased amounts of TCIM (4.1 times control values, p less than 0.003) and IL-1 (2.0 times control values, p less than 0.05).
 In contrast, asymptomatic seropositive patients produced less TCIM (0.36 times control values, p less than 0.004) and IL-1 (0.61 times control values, p less than 0.05).
 Different trends in the levels of these factors produced by patients with ARC and PGL were noted, although results were not statistically significant in general.
 Patients with ARC tended to produce less IL-1 (0.42 times control values, p less than 0.05), whereas patients with PGL tended to produce increased amounts of IL-1 (1.7 times control values, NS).
 ARC patients produced a wide range of TCIM values (0.05-2.8 times control values, NS), and patients with PGL tended to produce increased TCIM values, (4.0 times control values, p less than 0.02).
 No correlations between the levels of IL-1 or TCIM and T-cell subpopulation numbers (CD4 or CD8) or CD4/CD8 ratios were found.
