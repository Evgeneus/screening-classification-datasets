Histopathology of multiple sclerosis lesions detected by magnetic resonance imaging in unfixed postmortem central nervous system tissue.
 Postmortem unfixed whole brains from 17 multiple sclerosis and 6 control cases were examined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using a T2-weighted spin echo sequence and histology to determine the relationship between areas of abnormal MRI signal and underlying pathological change.
 In group 1, small MRI lesions and correspondingly small plaques, most of which were chronic, were detected histologically in 5 brains.
 In 4 brains there were more extensive areas of both abnormal signal and histological plaques which were more often active (group 2).
 However, in a further 5 brains extensive MRI abnormalities were observed when only small periventricular plaques were present histologically (group 3).
 Lesions in the hindbrain and cerebral grey matter were infrequently observed by MRI.
 The extensive MRI abnormalities seen in areas in which only small histological plaques were found may be the result of vascular permeability changes in the normal-appearing white matter surrounding plaques.
