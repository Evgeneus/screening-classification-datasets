Low-dose ACOP-B and VABE: weekly chemotherapy for elderly patients with advanced-stage diffuse large-cell lymphoma.
 Elderly patients with advanced-stage diffuse large-cell lymphomas (DLCLs) are either excluded from or under-represented in most clinical trials of combination chemotherapy regimens because they tolerate treatment poorly and usually have a worse outcome.
 We report two brief weekly chemotherapy regimens designed specifically for elderly patients.
 Eligible patients were aged 65 to 85 years, had advanced-stage DLCL (diffuse mixed, diffuse large-cleaved or noncleaved, immunoblastic, or diffuse large-cell not otherwise specified).
 Advanced stage was defined as Ann Arbor stage III or IV or stage I or II with a mass greater than 10 cm or B symptoms.
 Low-dose doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, bleomycin, and prednisone (LD-ACOP-B) accrued 40 patients between March 1983 and September 1985; 65% achieved a complete response (CR), there were two toxic deaths, the actuarial failure-free survival (FFS) is 19%, disease-specific survival (DSS) 30%, and overall survival (OS) 28%, with a maximum follow-up of 6 years.
 The regimen of etoposide, doxorubicin, vincristine, bleomycin, and prednisone (VABE) accrued 32 patients between July 1985 and June 1987; 63% achieved a CR, there were two toxic deaths, and the actuarial FFS is 34%, DSS 45%, and OS 36%, with a maximum follow-up of 4 years.
 There is no difference in FFS, DSS, or OS between these two regimens.
 VABE caused more myelosuppression and infectious complications, although the toxic death rates were similar.
 We prefer LD-ACOP-B because follow-up is longer and toxicity is less.
