A preliminary report on the neuropsychologic sequelae of human immunodeficiency virus.
 The neuropsychologic sequelae of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and human immunodeficiency virus were studied by comparing the results of a neuropsychologic test battery administered to the following three groups of Danish homosexual men: 20 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, 20 asymptomatic subjects who tested positive for the human immunodeficiency virus, and a matched control group of 20 subjects who tested negative for the human immunodeficiency virus.
 The group with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome performed significantly worse than the control subjects on the tests measuring concentration, memory, and psychomotor speed.
 The group with human immunodeficiency virus performed significantly worse than the control subjects on the tests measuring verbal memory and psychomotor speed.
 On the other tests, their results varied.
 The study supports the hypothesis that not only patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome but also asymptomatic subjects with human immunodeficiency virus may be neuropsychologically impaired early in the course of the disease.
