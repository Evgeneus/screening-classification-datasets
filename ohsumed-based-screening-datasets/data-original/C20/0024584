New York State HIV seroprevalence project: goals, windows, and policy consideration.
 In the summer of 1987, the New York State Department of Health embarked on an extensive effort to determine the prevalence of trends of HIV infection in the state.
 Sero-surveillance for antibody to HIV was undertaken by blind testing of available blood samples.
 Six populations were selected as windows on the epidemic: newborns, homeless adolescents, prisoners, and clients of family planning, STD, and drug treatment clinics.
 Testing of all newborns in New York State began in December 1987, and all six study windows were operational by June 1988.
 As of March 1990 blind testing for HIV antibody had been performed on more than 725,000 blood specimens in these six studies.
 Collectively these seroprevalence activities are providing invaluable information and impetus to preventive actions and public policy.
