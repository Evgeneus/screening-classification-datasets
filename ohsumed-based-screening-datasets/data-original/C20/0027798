Regulation of human basophil activation. I. Dissociation of cationic dye binding from histamine release in activated human basophils.
 Human basophil activation was demonstrated by histamine release (HR) and by the decrease of the toluidine blue-positive basophils (TB+).
 In four experimental systems, TB+ number decreased in the absence of HR (1) in basophils from atopic subjects stimulated by allergen concentrations below the threshold for HR, (2) in basophils sensitized by anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE stimulated by noncovalently linked 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-human serum albumin (also, the threshold for decrease of TB+ required lower concentrations of sensitizing anti-2,4-dinitrophenyl IgE than for HR), (3) in low Ca++ medium, and (4) in the presence of the Na+/H+ exchanger, monensin.
 These results suggest that (1) there is a lower threshold for TB+ decrease than for HR in allergen concentration, number of membrane IgE molecules, and number of IgE cross-linkings; moreover, external Ca++ requirement is lower for decrease of TB+ than for HR and (2) TB+ decrease reflects either granule exocytosis or, in the absence of HR, biochemical changes (most probably cation exchanges) altering the interaction of the basic dye with the granules.
 Thus, monitoring decrease in TB+ allows detection of basophil activation in the absence of HR.
