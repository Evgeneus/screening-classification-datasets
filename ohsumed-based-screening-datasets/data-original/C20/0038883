Aplastic anaemia in systemic lupus erythematosus: a cellular immune mechanism?
 Aplastic anaemia is a rare complication of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
 The mechanism is unclear but is thought to be related to an autoantibody to bone marrow precursors of haematopoiesis.
 We report a case of SLE related aplastic anaemia in which therapy with methylprednisolone and high dose cyclophosphamide followed by prednisolone and azathioprine resulted in complete clinical and haematological remission.
 Bone marrow cultures showed inhibition of erythropoiesis when incubated with acute and remission serum.
 Myeloid colony growth was not affected by either serum.
 The serum inhibitor we demonstrated was only active in vitro, and we postulate that the mechanism for marrow aplasia may have been an autoimmune cellular process.
