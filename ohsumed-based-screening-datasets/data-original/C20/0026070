Lung function improvement in asthma with a cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor antagonist 
 In a double-blind study ten asthmatic patients with impaired lung function received the cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor antagonist ICI 204,219 (40 mg by mouth) and placebo in random order on 2 days at least 1 week apart.
 The increase in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) above baseline was significantly greater after ICI 204,219 than after placebo.
 This effect persisted after nebulised salbutamol.
 These findings suggest that cysteinyl-leukotrienes are one of the causes of persistent bronchoconstriction in chronic asthma.
