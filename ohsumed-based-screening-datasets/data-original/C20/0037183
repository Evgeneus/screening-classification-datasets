Hypersensitivity reactions during hemodialysis related to the use of acetate dialysate. A case report.
 A patient developed a hypersensitivity reaction two weeks after being put on hemodialysis with acetate dialysate.
 The reactions appeared exclusively during hemodialysis and were relieved immediately after its termination.
 These allergic manifestations disappeared with substitution of bicarbonate for acetate dialysate and reappeared upon rechallenge with acetate dialysate.
 The rest of the dialysis materials were excluded as possible causes of allergy by scheduled dialysis sessions with varying materials.
 Acetate dialysate is implicated as the cause of allergy reaction in this case.
