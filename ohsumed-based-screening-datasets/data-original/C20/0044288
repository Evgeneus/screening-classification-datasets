Omenn's syndrome and related combined immunodeficiency syndromes: diagnostic considerations in infants with persistent erythroderma and failure to thrive.
 A 4-month-old male infant had a 2-month history of an exfoliative erythroderma and alopecia.
 Recurrent mucosal infections, diffuse lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphocytosis and eosinophilia, anemia, and failure to thrive later developed.
 Investigation revealed a combined immunodeficiency with T cells of an unusual phenotype in his peripheral blood, skin, and lymph nodes.
 Our patient's clinical manifestations most closely resemble Omenn's syndrome, a rare form of autosomal recessive combined immunodeficiency.
