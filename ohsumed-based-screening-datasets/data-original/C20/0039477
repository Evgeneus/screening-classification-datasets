Fatal varicella in an adult: case report and review of the gastrointestinal complications of chickenpox.
 An unusual and fatal case of primary varicella in an adult is presented.
 Involvement of the small intestine first manifested as abdominal pain and later progressed to gastrointestinal bleeding with subsequent dissemination of the infection.
 Although it has previously been speculated that gastrointestinal bleeding can result from infection with the varicella-zoster virus, the data from this case include histologic and cultural evidence that supports the clinical observations.
 The literature has been reviewed, and the management of this patient has been critically evaluated.
