Defective CD2 pathway T cell activation in systemic lupus erythematosus [published erratum appears in Arthritis Rheum 1991 Jul;34(7):926]
 CD2 (T11; sheep erythrocyte receptor) is the surface component of an alternative, antigen-independent pathway of human T cell activation.
 The response to certain anti-CD2 antibodies is relatively independent of accessory cell signals and therefore provides a direct measurement of T cell function.
 The CD2 pathway may be important in the differentiation of thymocytes, on which the expression of CD2 precedes the appearance of the CD3-T cell receptor complex.
 In view of the impaired T cell regulation of immune responses in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), we examined the activation of peripheral blood lymphocytes by anti-CD2 antibodies in 57 SLE patients and 32 normal control subjects.
 The CD2 pathway response was lower in the SLE patients (P less than 0.0001); 18 of the 57 SLE patients had a lower response than any of the control subjects.
 The SLE low-responder patients did not differ from the normal-responder patients in terms of disease activity or use of antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications.
 Low responses to anti-CD2 were corrected to normal by the coaddition of a submitogenic amount of phorbol myristate acetate (1 ng/ml).
 In some low-responder patients, the responses were normalized by the removal of non-T cells.
 The data indicate that some SLE patients have impaired responses to CD2 pathway activation and that this may reflect intrinsic T cell defects and/or regulatory influences of non-T cells.
