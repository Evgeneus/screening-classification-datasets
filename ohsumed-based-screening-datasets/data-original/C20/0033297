Immune dysfunction in children after corrective surgery for congenital heart disease.
 OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of open- and closed-heart surgery on the immune status of infants and children.
 DESIGN: Prospective study.
 Data collected before anesthesia and surgery and 2 and 24 hrs after surgery.
 SETTING: Operating room and pediatric ICU in a children's hospital.
 PATIENTS: Children undergoing surgery for correction of congenital heart disease (age 3 months to 12 yrs).
 A total of 31 patients were studied (open-heart surgery, n = 25; closed-heart surgery, n = 6).
 MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Increased neutrophil counts and lymphopenia were observed after both open- and closed-heart surgery.
 Serum levels of the complement components C3 and C4 were depressed after open-heart surgery, but not after closed procedures.
 The percentage of T3+ and T4+ lymphocytes, proliferative responses of the lymphocytes and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G and IgM were decreased from preoperative levels after open-heart surgery.
 The percentage of T8+ lymphocytes and serum IgA levels did not change.
 Intraoperative variables and postoperative severity of illness (Pediatric Risk of Mortality score) did not correlate with immune suppression.
 CONCLUSIONS: The immune system is affected after pediatric cardiac surgery, particularly after open-heart surgery.
