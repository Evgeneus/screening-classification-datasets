Failure to detect evidence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection by polymerase chain reaction assay in blood donors with isolated core antibodies (anti-p24 or -p17) to HIV-1.
 Individuals with isolated and persistent core antibodies (anti-p24 or -p17) to HIV-1 are sometimes diagnosed through the systematic screening of blood donations.
 The significance of such serum reactivities remains unknown.
 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a new technique allowing the direct detection of HIV-1 DNA in blood samples.
 In this study, PCR was used to detect HIV-1 DNA in 20 individuals with isolated and persistent core antibodies (14 anti-p24 and 6 -p17), in seven sexual partners of these individuals, in 55 HIV-1-seropositive individuals (positive controls), and in 105 HIV-1-seronegative blood donors at low risk of HIV-1 infection (negative controls).
 No HIV-1 DNA was detected in individuals with isolated and persistent core antibodies, in their sexual partners, or in negative control individuals, although PCR was positive in 54 of 55 seropositive control individuals.
 These results strongly suggest that individuals with isolated and persistent core antibodies are not infected with HIV-1.
