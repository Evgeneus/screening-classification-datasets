Heterogeneity of immune complex-derived anti-DNA antibodies associated with lupus nephritis.
 The mechanisms responsible for the tissue injuries associated with lupus nephritis have not yet been well explained.
 We have investigated the characteristics of anti-DNA antibodies in circulating immune complexes (CIC) and in the deposits of renal glomeruli in patients with active lupus nephritis.
 The CIC-derived antibodies expressed anti-DNA idiotypes (Id) designated as 0-81 Id and NE-1 Id, and bound mainly to single-stranded DNA but never to glomerular basement membrane (GBM) antigens.
 On the other hand, the immunoglobulins (Ig) eluted from renal glomeruli of lupus patients reacted not only with DNA but also with GBM, proteoglycan, and heparan sulfate.
 The binding of glomeruli-deposited Ig was markedly low when GBM antigens were used after treatment with heparitinase, suggesting that some anti-DNA antibodies may bind directly to GBM antigens associated with heparan sulfate, and form in situ IC in renal glomeruli.
 It was also revealed that the renal eluates obtained after passing through GBM antigen-coupled Sepharose lost the binding ability with GBM but still retained DNA-binding and 0-81 Id activity, showing the participation of circulating IC-derived anti-DNA antibodies in the glomerular deposits.
 Theoretically there may be two mechanisms in the pathogenesis of lupus nephritis through the deposition of circulating IC and through in situ formation of anti-DNA IC in renal glomeruli.
 The diversity of histological features in lupus kidneys may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the mechanisms.
