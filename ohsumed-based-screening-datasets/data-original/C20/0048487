CD8+ T lymphocytes and progression to AIDS in HIV-infected men: some observations.
 The relationship between CD8+ lymphocyte counts and progression to AIDS was studied in 340 HIV-1-seropositive men participating in a population-based prospective study.
 Overall, the relative hazard for developing AIDS during 60 months of observation was slightly elevated (1.08, P = 0.003), indicating an 8% increase in risk of progression for every 100 CD8+ cell count increment.
 When the data were analyzed in relation to date of diagnosis, the relative hazard was depressed (0.90, P less than 0.001) for the period 6 months prior to diagnosis, but was close to 1.0 for the period 6-36 months prior to diagnosis.
 These findings suggest a complex relationship between CD8+ cell counts and progression to AIDS, with the possibility that various subsets of the CD8+ compartment play different roles.
