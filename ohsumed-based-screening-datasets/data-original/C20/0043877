The platelet volume-number relationship in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus.
 The pathophysiology of thrombocytopenia in the acquired immune deficiency syndrome has not been elucidated completely.
 Many findings in these patients are identical to those with immune thrombocytopenic purpura.
 However, recent findings in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients including the effect of zidovudine on platelet count and the demonstration of ultrastructural changes and viral RNA in megakaryocytes, have suggested that the human immunodeficiency virus may directly infect megakaryocytes, and play a role in acquired immune deficiency syndrome-related thrombocytopenia.
 To investigate further the mechanism of decreased platelet counts in human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients, the platelet volume-number relationship and corresponding bone marrow findings in 34 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus were studied.
 Parameters evaluated included platelet count and mean platelet volume; bone marrow cellularity, megakaryocyte number, and number and percentage of denuded megakaryocyte nuclei.
 Two thirds of the platelet counts were low, and of these 92% had an inappropriately low mean platelet volume.
 These individuals had a platelet-volume number relationship that is very similar to that seen in myelosuppressive disorders.
 In addition, more than 90% of the bone marrows from thrombocytopenic patients had either normal or decreased numbers of megakaryocytes.
 These observations provide additional evidence to support the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of human immunodeficiency virus-associated thrombocytopenia may be due, at least in part, to a direct effect on the megakaryocytes.
