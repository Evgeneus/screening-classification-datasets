Sensitivity to thimerosal and photosensitivity to piroxicam.
 17 patients allergic to thimerosal, with no previous history of photosensitivity or piroxicam ingestion, 2 patients with piroxicam-induced photosensitivity, and 10 controls were patch or photopatch tested, with 1 or more of the following: thimerosal, thiosalicylic acid, irradiated and non-irradiated solutions of piroxicam alone, L-cysteine alone and piroxicam plus L-cysteine, and piroxicam in petrolatum., The results of the tests supported the hypothesis that there are cross-reactions between thiosalicylic acid and prioxicam, a photosensitizer.
 The mechanism of the cross-reactions may involve photoproducts of piroxicam and L-cysteine, as patients allergic to thiosalicylic acid, who have positive photopatch tests to piroxicam, also had positive patch tests to the irradiated solution of piroxicam plus L-cysteine.
