Evaluation of biotinylated DNA probes for the detection of gene rearrangements in clinical specimens.
 To determine whether a nonisotopic procedure is suitable for analyzing clinical specimens for gene rearrangements, the authors hybridized DNA from 15 specimens of lymphoid tissue with biotinylated DNA probes directed to J beta I + J beta II (T-cell receptor beta chain gene), JH (immunoglobulin gene heavy chain J region), and J kappa (immunoglobulin gene kappa light chain J region).
 Five cases of benign lymphoid hyperplasia, one case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy, and one case of small noncleaved follicular center cell lymphoma had germline hybridization patterns when digested with Bam HI, Eco RI, and Hind III restriction endonucleases.
 Four cases of B-cell lymphoma and three cases of T-cell lymphoma had clearly detectable rearrangements of the genes for immunoglobulin or the T-cell receptor or both.
 One case of dermatopathic lymphadenopathy had a faint, clonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor after digestion with Eco RI and Bam III.
 The authors conclude that biotinylated DNA probes can be useful for analyzing gene rearrangements in clinical specimens.
