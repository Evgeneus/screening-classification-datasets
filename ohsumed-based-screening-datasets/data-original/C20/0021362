Increase of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific B cells in the peripheral blood of egg-allergic patients.
 Allergen-specific B cells were detected by antigen-coated magnetic beads.
 The frequency of ovalbumin (OVA)-specific B cells was significantly higher in patients with egg white-allergy than in age-matched nonallergic individuals.
 These B cells, isolated by the immunomagnetic-beads method, produced anti-OVA antibodies of mostly IgM class when they were transformed by Epstein-Barr virus and cultured for about 2 weeks.
 Based on a chronologic analysis, the increase of OVA-specific B cells was found to precede the increase of IgG and IgE anti-OVA antibodies in the serum.
 These observations indicated that OVA-binding B cells in the peripheral blood are already committed to producing IgM antibody and probably are the precursors of antibody-forming cells of the IgG or IgE class.
