Systemic anaphylaxis after ingestion of a psyllium-containing breakfast cereal.
 Allergic reactions have been described as an occupational hazard among nurses and pharmaceutical workers who handle psyllium-containing laxatives.
 This study reports the case of a 38-year-old female nurse who ingested a bowl of psyllium-containing Heartwise Cereal (Kelloggs, Battle Creek, MI) and 25 minutes later developed severe systemic anaphylaxis manifested by hypotension, a feeling of constriction in the throat, hoarseness, dyspnea, wheezing, generalized pruritus, urticaria, and vomiting.
 She was treated with epinephrine, normal saline, diphenhydramine, and methylprednisolone, and recovered completely.
 Subsequent IgE immunoblot assay was strongly reactive to psyllium.
 Ingestion of psyllium-containing breakfast foods by sensitized individuals can be associated with life-threatening systemic anaphylaxis.
