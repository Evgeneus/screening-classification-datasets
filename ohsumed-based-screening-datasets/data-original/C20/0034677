Population dynamics of natural antibodies in normal and autoimmune individuals.
 We have measured the quantities of naturally occurring autoantibodies in the serum of normal, unmanipulated individuals.
 These changes over time following broad-band complex dynamical patterns that are similar in mouse and man.
 The patterns more likely reflect the network architecture of the natural antibody repertoire, regulating the activation and decay of individual clones.
 The temporal changes of both disease-specific and nonspecific autoantibodies are consistently modified in autoimmune individuals.
