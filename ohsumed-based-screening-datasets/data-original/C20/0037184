Shoulder ultrasound in dialysis related amyloidosis.
 Ultrasonographic changes around the shoulder joint were compared in ten symptomatic patients with dialysis related amyloid (DRA) and seventeen patients without symptoms.
 All patients had been on long-term (greater than 7 years) hemodialysis (HD).
 Three control groups were used: 8 predialysis patients, 10 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 9 HD patients who had been on dialysis for less than two years.
 Dry bodyweight, sex, handedness, length of hemodialysis and fistula side were not significantly different between the study groups.
 Proven amyloid patients were significantly older than other groups (p less than 0.001).
 Parameters assessed included cross-sectional area of long head of biceps tendon (LHB), diameter of supraspinatus tendon (SS), and general features (bursae, deposits) around the joint.
 Results demonstrated significant differences in all parameters in patients with symptomatic amyloid compared with other long-term patients: [SS: 7.4 mm +/- 0.7, mean +/- SEM, vs 5.1 +/- 0.2 (right, R), p = 0.001; 6.7 +/- 0.7 vs 4.9 +/- 0.2 (left, L), p = 0.01.
 LHB: 140.0 mm2 +/- 11.1 vs 79.6 +/- 5.1 (R), p less than 0.001; 114.5 +/- 10.5 vs 80.8 +/- 5.4 (L), p = 0.004.
 Bursae: 5 vs 1 (patients), p = 0.006].
 Compared with controls changes in the amyloid group were less marked though in most cases still significant.
 There was no significant difference between control groups nor between controls and asymptomatic long-term HD patients in any parameter.
 We conclude that shoulder ultrasound may have a role in identifying patients with dialysis related amyloid.
 Serial measurements may also help to elucidate the pathogenesis of the tendon changes.
