Allergic fungal sinusitis. Report of three cases associated with dematiaceous fungi.
 Most reported cases of allergic sinusitis have been attributed to Aspergillus, based on the morphologic features of the organisms in tissue sections.
 However, in most cases, cultures have not been done.
 This is a report of three cases of non-Aspergillus allergic fungal sinusitis.
 The patients' ages were 11, 16, and 43; two were male and one was female.
 Histopathologic study disclosed fungal organisms resembling Aspergillus.
 However, cultures of these patients' nasal secretions grew Drechslera, Exserohilum, and Bipolaris fungal organisms.
 The non-Aspergillus nature of these infections was further supported by positive Fontana-Masson melanin staining.
 The authors conclude that allergic fungal sinusitis most likely results from non- Aspergillus organisms.
 For definitive fungal identification, tissue culture is mandatory.
 When tissue is not cultured or no organisms grow, a Fontana-Masson stain can be a useful adjunct in fungal identification.
