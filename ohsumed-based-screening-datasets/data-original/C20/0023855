Risk of tuberculosis in patients with HIV-I and HIV-II infections in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.
 OBJECTIVE--To examine the association between HIV-II infection and tuberculosis.
 DESIGN--Cross sectional study comparing the prevalence of HIV-I and HIV-II infections in patients with tuberculosis and in blood donors.
 SETTING--Abidjan, Ivory Coast, west Africa.
 PATIENTS--2043 consecutive ambulant patients with tuberculosis (confirmed pulmonary, presumed pulmonary, or extrapulmonary) and 2127 volunteer blood donors.
 MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Prevalence of HIV-I and HIV-II infections as assessed by presence of serum antibodies.
 RESULTS--Overall rates of HIV infection were 40.2% in patients with tuberculosis (26.4% positive for HIV-I, 4.7% for HIV-II, and 9.0% for both); and 10.4% in blood donors (7.2% positive for HIV-I, 1.9% for HIV-II, and 1.3% for both).
 HIV-II infection was significantly more common in patients with all types of tuberculosis than in blood donors (97/2043, 4.7% v 40/2127, 1.9%; odds ratio 3.8%, 95% confidence interval 2.6 to 5.6).
 CONCLUSION--Both HIV-I and HIV-II infections are associated with tuberculosis in Abidjan.
 35% of adult tuberculosis in Abidjan is attributable to HIV infection and 4% specifically to HIV-II.
