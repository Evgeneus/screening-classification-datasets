Proline at position 36: a new transthyretin mutation associated with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy.
 Familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP) is associated with the deposition of an abnormal transthyretin (TTR) molecule.
 We have studied DNA from a family of Greek descent with FAP.
 The proband's TTR gene was asymmetrically amplified by using PCR and then was sequenced directly, to reveal a cytosine-for-guanine substitution in codon 36.
 This substitution removes a recognition site for endonuclease Fnu4HI.
 Allele-specific PCR was employed for diagnosis of the mutation.
 The predicted amino acid change of alanine to proline at position 36 was confirmed by protein sequencing of the proband's plasma TTR.
