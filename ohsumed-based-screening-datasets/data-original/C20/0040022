Lymphokine-activated killer cells are rejected in vivo by activated natural killer cells.
 A 4-h in vivo cytotoxicity assay was used to study the fate of implanted IL-2-generated, lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in mice undergoing an activated NK cell response.
 125Iododeoxyuridine-labeled LAK cells were rejected from selected organs of C57BL/6 mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus or treated with IL-2 or the IFN inducer poly I:C.
 This rejection was abrogated by the selective depletion of NK cells with antibodies to asialo-GM1 and NK1.1 Ag.
 Similar results were noted when LAK cells were generated from the spleens of B and T cell-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency mice and when LAK cells were implanted into severe combined immunodeficiency mice.
 These data indicate that NK cells activated by virus infections or by IL-2 infusions directly or indirectly eliminate implanted LAK cells.
 Because LAK cells are used in the treatment of certain human cancers, the strategy of accompanying this therapy with IL-2 infusions should be reassessed in light of these results.
