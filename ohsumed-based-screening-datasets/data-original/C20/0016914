Detection of HIV-1 in human lung macrophages using the polymerase chain reaction.
 We have used the polymerase chain reaction to investigate HIV-1 infection of lung macrophages from 44 AIDS patients with pneumonia.
 Proviral HIV-1 DNA was detected in the lung macrophages of 47% (21 of 44) of patients tested; 32% (seven of 21) of the patients had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), and 56% (11 of 21) had pneumonia caused by other aetiological agents.
 Matched peripheral blood specimens were obtained from 22 patients in this study, and HIV-1-specific DNA was detected in 100% (22 out of 22) of non-adherent white cell preparations tested.
 HIV was detected in blood monocytes of 11 out of 22 patients (50%), and a virus signal was also found in the lung macrophages of eight of these patients.
 Our results indicate that PCP does not predispose lung macrophages to HIV-1, nor does HIV-1 infection of lung macrophages increase the probability of contracting PCP.
