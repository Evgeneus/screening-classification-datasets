Anti-La antibody production by MRL-1pr/1pr mice. Analysis of fine specificity.
 In evaluating the origin of autoantibodies, patterns of self-Ag recognition have been interpreted to reflect the relative role of Ag in stimulating a response.
 Few studies, however, have assessed whether human autoantibodies display patterns of autoantigen recognition similar to those of SLE-prone mice.
 In previous studies, anti-La antibodies from humans have been shown to bind multiple epitopes on recombinant human La Ag, including immunoreactivity with a large fragment, termed La C, representing the middle portion of the La sequence.
 We report herein for the first time that MRL-1pr mice also spontaneously produce antibodies to recombinant human La protein and resemble human autoantibodies in their reactivity with La C.
 To further investigate the fine specificity of this response, we tested for antibody binding to six synthetic La peptides representing sequences within La C.
 Whereas two of the synthetic La peptides reacted with MRL-1pr sera containing anti-La binding, low reactivity was observed with a large panel of human anti-La sera.
 Our results therefore show that patterns of La antigen recognition displayed by MRL-1pr antibodies differ from those of human autoantibodies, possibly reflecting differences between mouse and man in the induction of these responses.
