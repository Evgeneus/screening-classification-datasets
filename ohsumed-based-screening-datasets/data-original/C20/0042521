Doppler echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic dysfunction.
 Recently, considerable effort has been directed toward the application of Doppler methods for detecting diastolic dysfunction.
 Recordings of transmitral filling velocity as obtained from pulsed-wave Doppler have been extensively investigated as a noninvasive method for determining left ventricular diastolic filling properties.
 Although Doppler parameters appear to reflect volumetric transmitral flow, close correlations with invasive descriptors of diastolic performance have not been found.
 Furthermore, Doppler transmitral velocities are sensitive to changes in ventricular preload, afterload, and heart rate.
 However, at least two distinct Doppler spectral patterns have been identified that are associated with impaired ventricular relaxation and restrictive physiology.
 Thus, Doppler recordings have proven to be of value in identifying the presence and type of diastolic dysfunction, and in the future they may be helpful in following the response to therapeutic interventions.
 The purpose of this paper is to review the available information relating Doppler transmitral recordings with catheterization and clinical descriptors of diastolic function.
 Additionally, the aim is to provide an understanding of the value and limitations of these noninvasive measurements in identifying and treating patients with diastolic abnormalities.
