The intracutaneous progressive dilution multi-food test.
 Data have been published supporting the view that skin response is more valid and reliable than symptom provocation for interpretation of the intracutaneous provocative food test (IPFT).
 As such, an intracutaneous progressive dilution food test technique interpreted by skin response is now the standard IPFT technique taught at American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy-sponsored courses.
 While this test technique is less time-consuming than the 5-day oral challenge food test of Rinkel, the 15- to 90-minute per test demand still presents a significant deterrant to widespread use.
 Here we present a time-efficient, multi-test technique that allows testing of three to seven foods at one time.
 The technique is not recommended for use on patients with a history of severe allergic reactions, such as asthma or angioedema, or for testing any food that by history may produce an anaphylactic reaction.
