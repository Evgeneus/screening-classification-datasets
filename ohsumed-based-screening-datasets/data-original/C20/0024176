Arthritis impact measurement scales: reliability of a French version and validity in adult Still's disease.
 The Arthritis Impact Measurement Scales (AIMS) questionnaire was administered to 57 patients with adult Still's disease (ASD) and 104 controls.
 Six of the 9 scales were consistent for both groups (Cronbach's alpha greater than or equal to 0.70).
 Two scales, Mobility and Dexterity, were consistent for ASD only (alpha greater than or equal to 0.70).
 The reliability of a French version of the AIMS was similar to the standard AIMS.
 Of the 13 associations evaluating criterion related validity of the AIMS in ASD, 11 were statistically significant.
 We conclude that the French and standard AIMS are comparable and that this questionnaire is reliable and valid for assessing outcome in ASD.
