Zidovudine resistance predicted by direct detection of mutations in DNA from HIV-infected lymphocytes.
 Zidovudine-resistant strains of HIV have recently been isolated from individuals during prolonged treatment.
 Analysis of the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) gene from clinical isolates revealed that resistance was due to multiple nucleotide changes conferring specific amino acid substitutions in this enzyme.
 In order to correlate the degree of resistance with these amino acid changes, we constructed a series of infectious HIV variants with specific combinations of mutations in the RT gene and assessed their sensitivity to zidovudine.
 The reproducible nature of the mutations seen in clinical isolates has enabled the polymerase chain reaction to be used to identify lesions associated with resistance.
 This procedure was validated by analysis of sensitive and resistant clinical isolates with RT genes of known DNA sequence.
 Using a 'double' amplification procedure, zidovudine sensitivity was assessed by direct detection of specific mutations in DNA from peripheral-blood lymphocyte samples.
 This should make it possible to test large numbers of individuals receiving zidovudine therapy, with the aim of establishing the clinical significance of the resistant isolates.
