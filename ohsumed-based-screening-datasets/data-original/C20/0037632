Identification of profilin as a novel pollen allergen; IgE autoreactivity in sensitized individuals.
 A complementary DNA encoding a pollen allergen from white birch (Betula verrucosa) that was isolated from a pollen complementary DNA library with serum immunoglobulin E from a birch pollen-allergic individual revealed significant sequence homology to profilins.
 The recombinant protein showed high affinity to poly-L-proline.
 Immunoglobulin E antibodies from allergic individuals bound to natural and recombinant birch profilin and also to human profilin.
 In addition, birch and human profilin induced histamine release from blood basophils of profilin-allergic individuals, but not of individuals sensitized to other plant allergens.
 The structural similarity of conserved proteins might therefore be responsible for maintaining immunoglobulin E antibody titers in type I allergy.
