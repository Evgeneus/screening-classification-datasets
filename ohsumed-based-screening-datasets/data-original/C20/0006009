Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia manifested as a hilar mass and cavitary lesion: an atypical presentation in a patient receiving aerosolized pentamidine prophylaxis.
 A case of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) in a patient with AIDS was manifested radiographically as a hilar mass and cavitary lesion.
 The patient had been receiving aerosolized pentamidine as prophylaxis against PCP.
 Nonuniform deposition of aerosolized pentamidine was probably responsible for this atypical radiographic appearance of PCP.
