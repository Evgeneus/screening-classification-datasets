Wilderness emergency medical services: the experiences at Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.
 This article describes the National Park Service wilderness emergency medical services (EMS) system, as implemented at Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park.
 EMS records on all 434 patients in the period from August 1, 1986, to July 31, 1987, were reviewed.
 Most patients had minor problems.
 Overall, 77% of patients contacting the EMS system were released at the scene, and base hospital contact was made in only 28% of cases.
 However, there were three deaths, 44 (10%) patients who received advanced life support, and 292 (67%) patients who received basic life support.
 Seven patients who received advanced life support were released without transport.
 Decisions regarding scope of practice in a low-volume, wilderness EMS system are complicated by long transport times and problems with skills maintenance.
 Differences between the times and problems with skills maintenance.
 Differences between the patients treated by a wilderness system and those seen in most urban systems may make it appropriate to release a greater portion of patients without ambulance transport.
 In a system with long response and transport times, use of personnel with different training than in the urban setting becomes necessary.
