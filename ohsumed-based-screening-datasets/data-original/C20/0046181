Biosynthesis and processing of cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase in the leukemic myeloid cell line U-937.
 The processing of the neutral proteases cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase, normally synthesized in myeloid precursor cells and stored in azurophil granules, were investigated by biosynthetic labeling with 14C-leucine of the monoblastic cell line U-937.
 The proteases were precipitated with specific antibodies and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by fluorography.
 The transfer to lysosomes of newly synthesized proteases was demonstrated in pulse-chase labeling experiments followed by centrifugation of cell homogenates in a Percoll gradient.
 The presence of a closely spaced polypeptide band-doublet at intermediate gradient density suggested cleavage of the specific aminoterminal pro dipeptide extension before storage in lysosomes.
 The molecular heterogeneity observed for cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase seemed to be due to modifications occurring after sorting into lysosomes, most likely because of C-terminal processing.
 Modifications of the secreted enzymes were not detectable by SDS-PAGE.
 In contrast to other lysosomal enzymes, no phosphorylation was demonstrated.
 Newly synthesized cathepsin G and neutrophil elastase rapidly became resistant to endoglycosidase H, indicating transport through the medial and trans cisternae of the Golgi complex and conversion to "complex" oligosaccharide side chains.
 This conversion was inhibited by an agent swainsonine, but translocation from the Golgi complex and secretion were unaffected.
 The processing described may play a role in activation of the proteases.
