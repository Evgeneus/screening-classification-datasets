Murine IgE and IgG responses to melittin and its analogs.
 Melittin, a bee-venom peptide of 26 amino acids, induces IgE and IgG responses in man and animals.
 The antibody response was shown previously to be specific primarily for the C-terminal 6 residues and its T cell epitope in H-2d restricted mice was shown to be in residue 11-19 of melittin.
 To study the relationship of peptide structure and immunogenicity in mice, we have prepared a series of melittin analogs varied in length and composition at the C-terminus.
 Immunogenicity of the analogs for IgG and IgE responses was found to correlate with two factors: a peptide length of more than 24 residues and the presence of a hydrophilic C-terminal region preferably with two to four cationic groups.
 These factors result in the ability of peptide to bind to cell membranes.
 Analogs that possess these features are good immunogens whereas those lacking any of these features are weak immunogens.
