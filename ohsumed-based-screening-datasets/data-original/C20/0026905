Care for caregivers: a support group for staff caring for AIDS patients in a hospital-based primary care practice 
 OBJECTIVE: To assess the types of stress experienced by health care personnel caring for AIDS patients and to develop ways to reduce that stress.
 DESIGN: A multidisciplinary support group for AIDS caregivers met weekly for three months, providing a context for the meaningful expression of personal and professional concerns about AIDS-related care.
 SETTING: A hospital-based primary care group practice at Beth Israel Hospital, Boston.
 PARTICIPANTS: Health care personnel caring for patients with AIDS.
 CONCLUSIONS: Those who care for people with AIDS need support systems to help them gain some mastery over the complex clinical and emotional problems raised by the illness.
 During the course of this support group, the members moved from feeling overwhelmed to a new sense of confidence, collegiality, and understanding of their own and others' emotional reactions, and a renewed approach to the care of these patients.
