HLA-DQA1*0101 haplotypes and disease outcome in early onset pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
 To further investigate a clinical impression that patients with early onset pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (EOPA-JRA) who carry HLA-DQw1 have more severe arthritis, we subtyped HLA-DQw1 in American midwestern patients with EOPA-JRA.
 The HLA-DQA1*0101 subtype was present in 10 of 19 patients who developed persistent polyarticular erosive disease compared with 18 of 92 healthy controls (chi 2 = 9.13, p = 0.003, RR = 4.6), and occurred more frequently in this polyarticular group than in patients without polyarticular erosive disease (chi 2 = 4.11, p = 0.040, RR = 3.0).
 The presence of HLA-DQA1*0101 was significantly lower in patients with chronic iridocyclitis than in patients without chronic iridocyclitis (chi 2 = 7.07, p = 0.008, RR = 0.21).
 In HLA-DQA1*0101 positive patients, DNA sequences of the beta-1 domain of the HLA-DQ alpha and HLA-DQ beta genes (HLA-DQA1*0101, HLA-DQB1*0501 and HLA-DQB1*0503) were identical to those in controls.
 In this midwestern EOPA-JRA population, HLA-DQA1*0101 or genes in linkage disequilibrium with it, are associated with a cohort of patients with EOPA-JRA with distinct clinical characteristics.
