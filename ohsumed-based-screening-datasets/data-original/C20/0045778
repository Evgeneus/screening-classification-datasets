Characterization of common variable immunodeficiency: identification of a subset of patients with distinctive immunophenotypic and clinical features 
 The peripheral blood lymphocyte surface markers and clinical features of 38 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) were assessed.
 These studies identified a subset of CVID consisting of 14 of the 38 patients with a distinctive T-cell immunophenotype and clinical findings.
 The phenotypic changes were characterized by an abnormally low CD4/CD8 ratio (less than or equal to 0.9) due primarily to a significant increase in CD8 T cells.
 In addition, there was an expansion in CD8 T cells coexpressing CD57 and increased expression of the activation markers HLA-DR and interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) by these cells.
 This group of immunophenotypically abnormal CVID patients also had characteristic clinical features, including splenomegaly (P less than .02) and in vivo T-cell dysfunction based on the evaluation of delayed-type hypersensitivity (P less than .05).
 Approximately 71% of these patients had splenomegaly and 42% were anergic in contrast to the remaining group of CVID patients, in which 29% had splenomegaly and 7% were anergic.
 These findings define a subgroup of CVID patients that have specific immunophenotypic features and functional T-cell abnormalities.
