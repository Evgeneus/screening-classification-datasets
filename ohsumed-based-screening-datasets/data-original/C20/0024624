Bambuterol: a new long acting bronchodilating prodrug.
 Bambuterol, a carbamate prodrug of terbutaline as a 5, 10, or 20-mg tablet, was given once every evening to patients with asthma in a randomized double-blind crossover study.
 Twenty milligrams improved pulmonary functions over 24 hours; 5 and 10 mg did not.
 Few side effects were observed.
