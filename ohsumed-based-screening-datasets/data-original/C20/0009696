Massive hepatic infarction in systemic lupus erythematosus.
 Liver disease in systemic lupus erythematosus, as demonstrated by abnormal histopathology, is rare and usually mild; typically, this hepatic disease is of chronic nature and not related to a hypercoagulable state.
 A patient is described in whom life-threatening hypercoagulability in association with systemic lupus erythematosus resulted in extensive liver infarction.
 Follow-up radionuclide liver scintigraphy suggested that regenerative recovery in the infarcted areas of the liver may be delayed or absent, but there was no evident functional hepatic impairment.
