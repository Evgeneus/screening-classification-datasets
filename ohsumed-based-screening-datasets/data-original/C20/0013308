Variable prevalence of lymphocytic thyroiditis among diabetes-prone sublines of BB/W or rats.
 The BB/Wor rat develops spontaneous autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (DM) and lymphocytic thyroiditis (LT).
 Six different inbred sublines of this rat model have been selected for studying the pathogenesis of DM and, thereby, the prevalence of DM has been carefully monitored and found to be relatively constant.
 In contrast, we have observed a striking difference in the prevalence and intensity of LT in these six sublines, varying from 100% in NB subline rats to 4.9% in BE subline rats at 105-110 days of age.
 Excess iodide administration frequently increases the prevalence of LT but did not do so in the two sublines (BB and BE) with the lowest frequency of spontaneous LT.
 In view of this variable prevalence of LT in the different BB/Wor sublines, it is imperative that investigators studying the pathogenesis and modulation of LT in this rat model select those sublines which express a desired frequency of spontaneous LT.
