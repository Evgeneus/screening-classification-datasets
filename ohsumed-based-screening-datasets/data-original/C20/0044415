HIV prevention among injecting drug users: three years of experience from a syringe exchange program in Sweden.
 Exchange of syringes and needles has for the last 3 years been offered to injecting drug users as part of an HIV prevention project in a small university town in south Sweden.
 The program at the local hospital has been visited by 979 drug users, of which 182 have participated on a more regular basis.
 The typical participant is a 30-year-old male who has injected amphetamine or heroin for at least 10 years.
 The seroprevalence for HIV among drug users in south Sweden has been maintained at approximately 1% in contrast to up to 60% in subpopulations from other Scandinavian regions with a comparable drug problem.
 No project participant has become HIV infected during the study period and a reduction in risk behavior has been noted among local drug injectors.
 The HIV prevention project has attracted many individuals with no previous contact with drug rehabilitation programs; for a number of drug users, the syringe exchange has served as an introduction to such treatment efforts.
