Clinicopathologic study of large cell anaplastic lymphoma (Ki-1-positive large cell lymphoma) among the Japanese.
 The clinical, prognostic, phenotypic, and genotypic findings of 30 patients with large cell anaplastic lymphoma (Ki-1-positive large cell lymphoma) were analyzed.
 There were 13 male and 17 female patients (male-female ratio, 0.8) whose ages ranged from 3 to 81 years of age (mean, 28 years of age; 67% of the patients younger than 30 years of age).
 The 5-year survival rate was 52%; this was better than that of other types of high-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
 Histologic examination showed distinctive morphologic features such as tumor cell pleomorphism, sinus infiltration, fibrosis, partial lymph node involvement, sparing of B-cell regions, and occasional plasma cell infiltrates.
 Eighty percent of the cases were of T-cell phenotype, and others expressed neither B-cell nor T-cell markers.
 The tumors were frequently positive for a histocompatibility antigen (HLA-DR), CD25 (the interleukin-2 receptor), and epithelial membrane antigen.
 Rearrangements of the T-cell receptor beta gene were observed in nine of 13 cases (69%).
 These findings indicated that many of the tumors had the phenotype and genotype of activated T-cells.
 This study also showed that large cell anaplastic lymphoma has a survival figure intermediate between Hodgkin's disease and low-grade peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
