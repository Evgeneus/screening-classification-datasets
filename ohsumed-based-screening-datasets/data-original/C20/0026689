Separation of late bronchial responses from airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic sheep.
 Allergic sheep with antigen-induced early and late responses were used to determine whether airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to carbachol is present during the late response and whether blocking the late response with the leukotriene D4 (LTD4) antagonist MK-571 also blocks this AHR.
 To do this, we first showed that MK-571 blocked the antigen-induced late response, and then, in a separate study, we determined the effect of MK-571 treatment on airway responsiveness 6 h after antigen challenge (at the start of the late response).
 MK-571 (5 mg, by metered dose inhaler) given 30 min before and 4 h after Ascaris suum challenge had no effect on the acute response to antigen but blocked (P less than 0.05) the late response compared with placebo (n = 7).
 In the second study (n = 6), the antigen-induced acute increases in mean specific lung resistance (sRL) were also similar in the placebo (249%) and drug trials (247%).
 By 6 h postchallenge, however, mean sRL in the placebo trial began to increase (54%, P less than 0.05), whereas in the drug trial mean sRL was baseline.
 Nevertheless, AHR was apparent in both trials as indicated by a mean twofold leftward shift in the dose-response curves to inhaled carbachol (P less than 0.05 vs.
 prechallenge).
 Bronchoalveolar lavage at 6 h showed that MK-571 did not prevent the inflammatory cell influx into the lung.
 These observations suggest that although LTD4 may be a mediator of the late response in sheep, it is not a primary mediator affecting cholinergic AHR during this period.
