Retrospective analysis of the incidence of pulmonary disease in hypogammaglobulinemia.
 To determine the best predictors of chronic pulmonary disease in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, we evaluated the clinical records, chest x-ray films, and pulmonary function tests of 10 patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) followed for a mean of 12.5 years, and 12 patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) followed for a mean of 10.5 years.
 These patients, most of whom were treated with intramuscular gamma globulin and long-term oral antibiotics, had very few pneumonias after diagnosis.
 The patients with XLA had 0.10 pneumonias per treatment year, and the patients with CVID had 0.18 pneumonias per treatment year.
 Seven of the 10 patients with XLA had normal chest x-ray films 8 to 15 years after diagnosis, and none had bronchiectasis.
 Pulmonary disease was more common and more severe in the group with CVID, but five patients in this group also had normal chest x-ray films after long follow-up.
 In the entire group of 22 patients, nine of the 10 patients with abnormal chest x-ray films on most recent evaluation already had pulmonary disease at the initial visit (p = 0.00002).
 These studies indicate that the best predictors of good pulmonary function in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia are early diagnosis and good compliance with gamma globulin replacement therapy and oral antibiotics.
