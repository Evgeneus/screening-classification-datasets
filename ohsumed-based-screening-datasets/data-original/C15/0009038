 The numerous clinical presentations of congenital abnormalities of the lymphatic system in children and the confusing terminology used to describe their pathologic diagnoses impede the physician's understanding of the condition.

 Future research should concentrate on the specific causes and the treatment of these congenital abnormalities.
