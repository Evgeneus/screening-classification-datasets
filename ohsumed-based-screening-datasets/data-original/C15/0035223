Intestinal and hepatic apolipoprotein B gene expression in abetalipoproteinemia.
 A 20-year-old woman with abetalipoproteinemia underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for cirrhosis, affording access to her liver and small intestine for study.
 Before transplantation, her plasma apolipoprotein B concentration was less than 1 mg/dL according to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas after transplantation her plasma apolipoprotein B concentration was 76 mg/dL (all apolipoprotein B-100).
 Apolipoprotein B content was reduced in her intestine and liver compared with normal and cirrhotic controls.
 Cultured hepatocytes from the patient's explanted liver secreted a 1.006 g/mL less than or equal to d less than or equal to 1.063 g/mL lipoprotein rich in apolipoprotein E and a 1.063 g/mL less than or equal to d less than or equal to 1.21 g/mL lipoprotein containing apolipoproteins E and A-I with no immunodetectable apolipoprotein B in the culture medium.
 Normal hepatocytes secreted very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein containing apolipoprotein B-100.
 Abetalipoproteinemic intestinal apolipoprotein B messenger RNA concentration was 4-5-fold higher than control values.
 However, the patient's liver apolipoprotein B messenger RNA level was one fifth that of control normal and cirrhotic liver.
 Analysis of the patient's intestinal and hepatic apolipoprotein B messenger RNA for posttranscriptional stop-codon insertion revealed normally edited transcripts.
 These results suggest that apolipoprotein B is synthesized as the product of a normally edited messenger RNA transcript, but not secreted, in abetalipoproteinemia.
