Exercise performance of polycythemic chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients. Effect of phlebotomies.
 The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of phlebotomy on the exercise tolerance and right and left ventricular ejection fraction of polycythemic patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 Ten patients with COPD (mean FEV1 = 1.32 +/- 0.55 L) and polycythemia (mean Hct = 62 +/- 3 percent) were studied before and after their hematocrits had been reduced to approximately 50 percent.
 Post-phlebotomy the maximal oxygen consumption increased from 1.09 +/- 0.34 L/min to 1.26 +/- 0.43 L/min (p less than 0.05) and the maximum workload increased from 56.5 +/- 32.6 watts to 74.5 +/- 23.4 watts (p less than 0.05).
 The increase in the exercise tolerance appeared to be primarily due to an increased cardiac output at Emax.
 There was no relationship between the increases in the upright exercise capacity and changes in the supine ejection fractions of the right or left ventricular either at rest or during exercise.
