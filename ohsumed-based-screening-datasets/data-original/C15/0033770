Thrombocytopenia possibly caused by structurally related third-generation cephalosporins.
 Thrombocytopenia is defined as a decrease in the platelet count to less than 100 x 10(9)/L and it is the most commonly reported drug-induced blood dyscrasia.
 Heparin is the most commonly reported cause of drug-induced thrombocytopenia with a reported incidence between one and ten percent.
 Thrombocytopenia induced by cephalosporins has been reported but is relatively rare.
 This report does not completely document that two third-generation cephalosporins caused platelet counts to fall less than 100 x 10(9)/L in the patient described but there was no other explanation available.
 Platelet counts began to fall with the institution of third-generation cephalosporins and began to rise when these agents were stopped.
 In order to document that thrombocytopenia was induced by the third-generation cephalosporins a rechallenge would have been necessary; this was not considered to be safe in this patient.
 A review of the literature is presented describing similar cases of cephalosporin-induced thrombocytopenia.
