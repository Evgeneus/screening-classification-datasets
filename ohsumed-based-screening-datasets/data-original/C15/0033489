An acquired antithrombin autoantibody directed toward the catalytic center of the enzyme.
 Antibody inhibitors against human thrombin are rare and have remained poorly characterized.
 We report the case of a 40-yr-old patient who developed a potent thrombin inhibitor revealed by mild bleeding symptoms and marked prolongation of most laboratory clotting times.
 After two years of evolution, he died from cerebral hemorrhage.
 The inhibitor, a polyclonal IgG, was associated with hematological and immunological criteria of autoimmune disorder.
 Antithrombin IgG was isolated from the patient's plasma by protein A- and thrombin-affinity chromatography.
 Fab fragments inhibited amidolytic activity of alpha thrombin, and thrombin-thrombomodulin catalyzed protein C activation with a Ki of approximately 10(-8) M in a noncompetitive manner.
 Alpha to gamma conversion of thrombin resulted in a moderate loss of affinity for the inhibitor.
 Upon complex formation of thrombin with staphylocoagulase or alpha 2-macroglobulin (alpha 2M), inhibition was decreased by two orders of magnitude and acquired an apparent competitive character.
 In Western blot experiments, the antibody reacted with active alpha-thrombin, did not react with chloromethylketone-inhibited thrombin and reacted with a lower affinity with iPr2P-thrombin.
 The inhibitor did not block thrombin binding to benzamidine-, heparin-, or fibrin-Sepharose, but displaced proflavin from its complex with thrombin.
 Taken together, these results indicate that the patient's autoantibody recognized a conformational structure which includes, at least in part, the apolar binding site adjacent to the catalytic site of thrombin.
