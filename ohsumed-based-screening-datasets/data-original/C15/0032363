Clinical and cytogenetic characteristics of myelodysplastic syndromes developing myelofibrosis.
 Myelofibrosis occurs in various hematologic neoplasias, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), with a relatively low incidence.
 To gain insight into the clinical and cytogenetic implications of MDS patients in whom myelofibrosis develops, statistical analysis was done on 82 primary MDS patients with successful cytogenetic results.
 Seven patients had myelofibrosis during the course of the disease (8.5%, Group I), 34 had abnormal karyotypes without myelofibrosis (41.5%, Group II), and the other 41 had abnormal karyotypes without myelofibrosis (50%, Group III).
 All of the MDS patients except one with myelofibrosis had cytogenetic abnormalities, and four of them had multiple chromosome abnormalities.
 In univariant analysis, MDS patients with myelofibrosis showed no significant differences in age, sex, or peripheral blood data.
 In contrast, patients with chromosome abnormalities evolved into myelofibrosis with a high incidence compared with those with normal karyotypes (14.6% versus 2.4%, P = 0.054).
 The occurrence of myelofibrosis was higher during the first 6 months after the diagnosis of MDS than in the next 6 months (6.1% versus 0%, P = 0.045).
 Most of the MDS patients survived for less than 10 months after myelofibrosis was evident.
 Furthermore, survival was significantly shorter in Group I compared with Groups II (P less than 0.05) and III (P less than 0.01).
 Among the MDS patients in whom myelofibrosis developed, some were associated with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, indicating a heterogeneity of clinical features in MDS with myelofibrosis.
