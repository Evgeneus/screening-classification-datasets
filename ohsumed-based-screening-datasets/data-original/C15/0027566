Autosplenectomy complicating pneumococcal meningitis in an adult.
 We present a rare complication of pneumococcal meningitis.
 A 56-year-old female patient with pneumococcal meningitis developed acute hyposplenism.
 Left-sided hypochondriacal pain accompanied by a marked thrombocytosis developed during the convalescent period.
 Abdominal radionuclide and computed tomographic scans demonstrated damage to the spleen.
 The findings were compatible with autosplenectomy.
