Should intravenous immunoglobulin G be first-line treatment for acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura? Case report and review of the literature.
 Acute thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare and serious disease.
 Treatment with prednisone, anticoagulation, antiplatelet drugs, splenectomy, exchange transfusions, vincristine, and plasmapheresis may be effective in some patients, but the response to these therapies is inconsistent and all carry the potential for serious side effects.
 We, and others, have recently seen dramatic responses to intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin G (IgG) when other treatments have failed.
 Although IV IgG is expensive, its costs are low compared with those extended plasmapheresis regimens.
 Since the response to treatment can usually be evaluated within a few days and the side effects appear less than with other treatments, we believe a strong case can be made for the use of IV IgG as first-line therapy for acute TTP.
 Continued multicenter studies are necessary to finally solve the problem of competing and confusing treatment attempts and synergism of treatment in acute TTP.
