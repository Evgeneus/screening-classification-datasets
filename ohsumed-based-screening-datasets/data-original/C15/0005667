Peripheral vascular disorders. Assessment and intervention.
 Peripheral vascular diseases are being seen with increased frequency in the health care setting today.
 It is imperative that nurses have a clear understanding of arterial, venous, and lymphatic circulatory mechanisms as well as the pathophysiologic changes that accompany common diseases of these systems.
 Providing the ongoing assessment to obtain a diagnosis, establish the acute versus chronic nature of findings, monitor progression, plan care, and assess the response to treatment is an important role for the nurse in order to preserve function, life, and limb in these patients.
