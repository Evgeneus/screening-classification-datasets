Nitrobenzene poisoning and spurious pulse oximetry.
 The successful management of nitrobenzene poisoning in a 21-year-old patient is presented.
 We report our experience of ventilatory care with additional intravenous methylene blue and ascorbic acid therapy.
 Pulse oximeters available at present are not useful in patients treated with methylene blue and should be used cautiously in the presence of cyanosis of unknown aetiology.
