Hurthle cell hyperplasia and sarcoidosis of the thyroid.
 We report of a case of Hurthle cell hyperplasia of the thyroid that was correctly identified preoperatively by fine-needle aspiration cytology but was unexpectedly associated with sarcoid granulomas.
 To our knowledge, the association has not been previously reported.
 The rarely described thyroid involvement by sarcoidosis is briefly reviewed.
