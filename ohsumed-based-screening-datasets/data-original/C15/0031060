Dapsone for thrombocytopenic purpura related to human immunodeficiency virus infection.
 PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of dapsone on platelet count in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
 PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia received dapsone (50 to 125 mg/day) for 2 to 43 months.
 Patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome were not enrolled.
 RESULTS: Of the 11 patients, six developed platelet counts above 50 X 10(9)/L and did not require any other specific therapy.
 No significant side effects were observed.
 CONCLUSION: We conclude that dapsone may be effective in some patients with HIV-related thrombocytopenia.
