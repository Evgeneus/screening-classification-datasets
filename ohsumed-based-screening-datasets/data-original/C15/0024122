BIPP induced methaemoglobinaemia.
 Bismuth subnitrate, one of the constituents of BIPP is known to cause methaemoglobinaemia.
 Ten patients had blood estimations for methaemoglobin levels before and after nasal packing with BIPP impregnated gauze.
 Only one patient exhibited abnormal levels of methaemoglobin and this was most probably the result of the large quantity of BIPP used.
 It is unlikely that significant methaemoglobinaemia occurs during the routine use of BIPP in the nose.
