Ulcerative lesions and herpes simplex virus type 2 in a patient with Evan's syndrome.
 We have described a case of herpes genitalis in a patient with Evans's syndrome who had violaceous macules leading to deep ulcerations.
 This case serves as a reminder that HSV infection may be atypical and have an unusual course in immunocompromised patients.
 With the availability of specific therapy for this infection, it is important to consider HSV in the differential diagnosis of all ulcerative skin lesions.
