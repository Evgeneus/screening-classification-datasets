Improvement of mouse beta-thalassemia by recombinant human erythropoietin.
 Homozygous beta thalassemic mice received 50 U (1,660 U/kg) of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEpo) 5 days a week for 2 weeks.
 Hemoglobin increased from 9.2 +/- 0.6 g/dL to 10.5 +/- 0.4 g/dL (P = .002) and hematocrit increased from 29.2% +/- 0.9% to 34.1% +/- 1.9% (P = .0014).
 The beta minor/alpha globin chain synthesis ratio increased slightly but significantly between day -4 (0.75 +/- 0.07) and day 4 (0.81 +/- 0.04) (P = .01) and reached a minimum ratio (0.67 +/- 0.03) on day 15 (P = .001), being parallel to reticulocyte counts and to the incorporated trichloracetic acid (TCA)-insoluble radioactivity, therefore parallel to the erythropoietic output in thalassemic mice, as in normal mice.
 Erythrocyte defects were improved in beta thalassemic mice treated by rhEpo: membrane-associated alpha globin was significantly decreased (P less than .01), thiol group reactivity of ankyrin was significantly improved (P less than .05), spectrin alterations were reduced, and deformability of mouse thalassemic red blood cells was normalized.
 These results provide experimental criteria for modulating globin chain imbalance necessary for the therapy of human beta thalassemia intermedia, and suggest that rhEpo might be of interest to improve the red blood cell mass and reduce erythrocyte alterations in this disease.
