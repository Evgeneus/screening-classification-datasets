Vancomycin added to empirical combination antibiotic therapy for fever in granulocytopenic cancer patients.

 A total of 747 febrile granulocytopenic patients with cancer were randomized to receive ceftazidime plus amikacin (CA) with or without vancomycin (V) as initial empirical therapy.
 Single gram-positive bacteremias responded in 29 (43%) of 68 patients treated with CA and in 48 (72%) of 67 treated with CAV (P = .001).
 For single gram-negative bacteremias and clinically documented and possible infections the response rates of CA and CAV were 80% and 63% (P = .17), 55% and 75% (P = .009), and 74% and 81% (P = .16), respectively.
 However, for patients with gram-positive bacteremia and for all other patients, there were no differences by treatment regimens in the proportion of febrile patients on each trial day (P = .85, P = .82, respectively) or in the duration of fever (P = .22, P = .93, respectively).
 Moreover, no patient with gram-positive bacteremia died during the first 3 days of true empirical therapy.
 Antibiotic-associated nephrotoxicity was more frequent in patients treated with vancomycin (6% vs.
 2%, P = .02).
 These results do not support the empirical addition of vancomycin to initial antibiotic therapy in cancer patients with fever and granulocytopenia.
