Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis.
 Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is characterized by the spontaneous development of recurrent, sterile papules, pustules, and plaques on the face, trunk, arms, and occasionally the palms and soles.
 Although the large majority of the reported cases have occurred in Eastern Asians, most patients in the United States have been infants or men seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus.
 We describe a North American woman with eosinophilic pustular folliculitis who was neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor of Asiatic descent.
