Neutropenia in an extremely premature infant treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.
 Neutropenia in the newborn is often associated with sepsis, maternal hypertension, or prematurity.
 We describe a 654-g infant born at 30 weeks' gestation by cesarean section due to severe maternal hypertension.
 His course was complicated by five episodes of sepsis, including three with group B streptococcus.
 The results of hematologic and immunologic studies were normal except that absolute neutrophil counts were low (less than 1 x 10(9)/L) with intermittent increases during sepsis.
 Human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor administered subcutaneously (10 micrograms/kg per day initially) resulted in an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 30 x 10(9)/L within 2 weeks.
 The dosage was lowered and the absolute neutrophil counts were maintained at 8 to 12 x 10(9)/L with no further septic episodes.
 The human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor therapy was discontinued after 7 months, and the patient remained healthy with an absolute neutrophil count of greater than 2 x 10(9)/L.
 Thus, treatment with human recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor may be useful as a temporary measure for neonatal neutropenia associated with sepsis.
 A controlled, clinical trial is warranted.
