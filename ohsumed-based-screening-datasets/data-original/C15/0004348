Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis: fungal folliculitis?
 Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is a rare condition with no known cause.
 However, a fungal cause is suggested by (1) tinea-like annular lesions, (2) initial clinical consideration of fungal folliculitis in many reported cases, (3) an association with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, and (4) an association with scaly and vesiculopustular lesions of palms and soles.
 We report a case histologically identical to eosinophilic pustular folliculitis but in which hyphal fungal organisms were demonstrated in one of the involved hair follicles.
