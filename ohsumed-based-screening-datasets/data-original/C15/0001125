Low plasma iron status and akathisia.
 Thirty patients were examined to test the hypothesis that a depletion of iron levels is associated with symptoms of akathisia.
 Fifteen akathisic patients were pair-matched with 15 non-akathisic patients.
 Plasma ferritin levels were significantly decreased in the akathisic patients, and there was a significant inverse correlation between plasma iron levels and akathisia rating.
 In addition, akathisia ratings were found to be correlated with a scale measuring symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.
