Decreased hypoprothrombinemic response to warfarin secondary to the warfarin-nafcillin interaction.
 Patients who are receiving multiple medications must be screened for significant drug interactions.
 The specific mechanism of a drug interaction determines whether the patient may experience a subtherapeutic effect or a potentially toxic reaction.
 Three cases of relative warfarin resistance, possibly related to high-dose nafcillin, are described in this report.
 Several reports have suggested that penicillinase-resistant penicillins, such as nafcillin and dicloxacillin, exert an important enzyme-inducing effect in patients receiving warfarin.
 This potential interaction must be appropriately recognized and managed in order to maintain adequate anticoagulation in this patient population.
