Spinal cord thromboplastin-induced coagulopathy in a rabbit model.
 Coagulopathy results from many diverse events, including several neurogenic causes.
 Using a rabbit model, we produced coagulopathy by injecting autologous spinal cord and extracted thromboplastin intravenously.
 Serial coagulation panels were performed to evaluate the activation of the thrombotic and fibrinolytic pathways.
 Group 1 animals (n = 4) received intravenous injections of homogenized spinal cord tissue.
 Coagulopathy was not produced with 36 mg of homogenized spinal cord tissue, but 50 mg or more resulted in death.
 Group 2 animals (n = 12) received intravenous injections of extracted rabbit cord thromboplastin, which contained approximately 60% activity of a commercially purified rabbit brain thromboplastin.
 Five animals receiving 2.5 to 5.5 mg of thromboplastin per kilogram of body weight survived with evidence of coagulopathy.
 Seven animals receiving 2.5 to 100 mg of thromboplastin per kilogram of body weight died.
 Group 3 (4 control animals) received normal saline injections without changes in clinical or laboratory status.
 The thrombotic pathway was activated in all animals as evidenced by decreased platelet counts and fibrinogen levels.
 Activation of the fibrinolytic system was demonstrated by increased concentrations of protamine sulfate and abnormal euglobulin clot lysis times.
 The most sensitive parameters were the platelet count, protamine sulfate concentration, and white cell count (margination), which became abnormal within 15 minutes after the injections and returned to normal within 1 hour.
