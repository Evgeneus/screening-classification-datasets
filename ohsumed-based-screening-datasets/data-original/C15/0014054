The role of ras gene mutations in myeloproliferative disorders.
 Mutations in the ras genes frequently are found in myeloproliferative disorders.
 These abnormalities have prognostic significance in the myelodysplastic syndromes, but their clinical importance in other hematopathic states remains unclear.
 The study of this gene in leukemic conditions is providing insights into the genetic pathways leading to leukemic progression.
