G gamma and A gamma globin genes are identical from -471 of the promoter midway through gamma IVSII in a Benin beta s haplotype associated with elevated fetal hemoglobin.
 In seven kindreds in which sickle cell (SS) patients had elevated (greater than 12%) fetal hemoglobin (Hb F), Milner and colleagues reported that a determinant for elevated Hb F and elevated F cells was linked to the beta s gene.
 Independently, the Senegal (SEN) beta s haplotype has been found in association with elevated Hb F in SS and beta-thalassemia patients.
 We have used the kindreds of Milner and colleagues to characterize further the association of haplotype and gamma gene DNA sequence variation with Hb F expression.
 For the largest kindred, Wi, all four SS had high (greater than 14%) Hb F and both SEN and Benin (BEN) haplotypes.
 Two AS cases carrying SEN had low Hb F and low F cells, while three AS and one CS carrying BEN had elevated Hb F and elevated F cells; only one AS carrying BEN had low Hb F and low F cells.
 In order to look for genetic alterations that could account for the elevated Hb F of kindred Wi, we sequenced both the G gamma and A gamma genes of the Wi BEN haplotype.
 The data showed largely identical G gamma and A gamma genes which may have been generated by two gene conversions: the A gamma promoter was like that of G gamma 3' to -471, while the G gamma IVSII was like that of A gamma in its 5' half.
 In addition, three new mutations were found in gamma IVSII.
