Mitoxantrone and high-dose etoposide for patients with relapsed or refractory acute leukemia.
 Among 35 patients with relapsed or refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who received salvage chemotherapy, 28 were treated with mitoxantrone (7.5 mg/m2/d intravenously [IV] over 1 hour for 5 days) and etoposide (VP-16) (2 g/m2 over 4 days either as a daily infusion or as two daily doses).
 Seven patients received mitoxantrone (6 mg/m2/d for 5 days) and VP-16 (1500 mg/m2 over 3 days).
 The median duration of the initial complete remission (CR) was 6 months and 83% of the patients had initial CR that lasted 12 months or less.
 Forty-six percent of the patients were undergoing a second or subsequent salvage attempt.
 Eight patients (23%) achieved CR; seven of these CR were obtained after one course of therapy.
 Twelve patients (33%) died and 15 patients (42%) had disease that was resistant to treatment.
 Patients undergoing a first salvage attempt had a higher incidence rate of CR than those undergoing a second or subsequent salvage attempt (37% versus 6%; P = 0.03).
 CR rates were also higher in patients with a favorable (translocation 8;21 or 15;17) or diploid karyotype compared with other patients (32% versus 8%; P = 0.10).
 The median survival time was 2 months for all patients and 8 months for patients achieving CR.
 Mucositis occurred in 74% of the patients and was severe in 32%.
 Diarrhea and rash occurred in less than 33% of the patients.
 Fever was noticed in all but 1 of the patients and documented infections occurred in 65% of the patients.
 Six patients had pancytopenia or thrombocytopenia that lasted more than 42 days from the initiation of treatment.
 Although mitoxantrone and high-dose VP-16 is an effective antileukemic regimen, it is associated with a high incidence of mucositis.
 Strategies that are used to limit mucosal damage may improve the tolerance of this combination.
