Evaluation of the transfusion effectiveness of various platelet concentrates by means of an in vitro perfusion technique.
 An in vitro perfusion technique was used for the assessment of the effectiveness of platelet concentrates (PCs) administered to patients with bone marrow failure.
 Denuded rabbit arterial segments mounted in annular chambers were exposed to nonanticoagulated blood drawn directly from the antecubital vein.
 This perfusion system allows the direct visualization of platelet-subendothelium interactions.
 The deposition of platelets on exposed subendothelium and the presence of fibrin were evaluated morphometrically.
 Perfusions were performed before and 10 and 120 minutes after the transfusion of PCs that had been obtained by apheresis and administered immediately after collection (A) or separated by centrifugation of blood units and transfused 24 hours after storage at 22 degrees C (B) or 4 degrees C (C).
 Bleeding times were also determined systematically.
 The deposition of platelets on the subendothelium increased significantly (p less than 0.01) 10 minutes after transfusions of A and B PCs, but the presence of fibrin did not differ from pretransfusion values.
 Two hours after the administration of A or B PCs, the improvement of platelet deposition persisted.
 By then, the presence of fibrin increased markedly (p less than 0.01).
 The deposition of platelets was not modified after the transfusion of C PCs, but the presence of fibrin was augmented significantly at both posttransfusion times.
 Comparisons between bleeding times and morphometric results pointed to a possible role of fibrin formation in contributing to primary hemostasis.
