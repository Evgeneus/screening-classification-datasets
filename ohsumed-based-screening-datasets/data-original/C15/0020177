Blood mononuclear cells from patients with severe congenital neutropenia are capable of producing granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.
 Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a disorder of myelopoiesis characterized by severe neutropenia or absence of blood neutrophils secondary to a maturational arrest at the level of promyelocytes.
 We examined peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of SCN patients who demonstrated normalization of their blood neutrophil counts in a phase II clinical study with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF).
 When stimulated in vitro with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), PBMC of those SCN patients produced G-CSF activity, as judged by proliferation induction of the murine leukemia cell line, NFS-60.
 Western and Northern blot analysis showed G-CSF protein and G-CSF-mRNA indistinguishable in size from those of normal controls.
 We conclude that PBMC of the SCN patients tested are capable of synthesizing and secreting biologically active G-CSF in vitro.
