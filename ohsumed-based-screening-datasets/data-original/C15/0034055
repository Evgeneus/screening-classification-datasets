A phase II study of 4'-epirubicin in the treatment of poor-risk Kaposi's sarcoma and AIDS.
 Twenty-six patients with poor-risk Kaposi's sarcoma and AIDS were treated with epirubicin 90 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks.
 One patient achieved complete response and 10 achieved partial response (overall response rate 42.3%).
 The median time to treatment failure was 22 weeks.
 The dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia.
