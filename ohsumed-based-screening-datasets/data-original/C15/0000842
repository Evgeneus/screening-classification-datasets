Hypereosinophilic syndrome with unusual cutaneous manifestations in two men with HIV infection.
 We report two men with human immunodeficiency virus infection who had unusual cutaneous manifestations of hypereosinophilic syndrome, exfoliative erythroderma, and linear flagellate plaques.
 In the first patient the cutaneous disease was the initial manifestation, and in the second the skin was the only organ affected.
 We also describe a favorable response to systemic corticosteroids and to psoralen with UVA phototherapy in one patient.
