Microvascular right-to-left pulmonary shunt demonstrated by a radionuclide method.
 A 37-yr-old man with angiolymphoid hyperplasia (Kimura's syndrome), who had been treated unsuccessfully for suspected asthma, was investigated due to a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation (86%).
 Right heart catheterization and angiography of the pulmonary artery failed to demonstrate any right-to-left shunts.
 However, simultaneous scintigraphy over the lungs, kidneys, and head after injection of 150 MBq technetium-99m-labeled macroaggregated albumin i.v.
 and inhalation of 150 MBq krypton-81m demonstrated a right-to-left shunt in the lungs probably caused by precapillary pulmonary arteriovenous shunts.
