Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia of the hand. A case report.
 Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is an uncommon benign vascular neoplasm manifested by multiple or solitary subcutaneous nodules, usually on or about the head of young adults.
 Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia is characterized microscopically by marked proliferation of large endothelial cells with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils.
 This benign skin disorder may resemble an angiosarcoma both clinically and histologically.
 We wish to report a patient with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia on the palm of the hand and discuss therapeutic recommendations.
