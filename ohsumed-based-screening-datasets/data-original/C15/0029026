Intestinal lymphonodular hyperplasia of childhood: patterns of presentation.
 In this retrospective analysis we searched for a constellation of signs or symptoms attributable to childhood lymphonodular hyperplasia (LNH).
 Of 147 children with documented LNH reviewed, 43% had lesions in the small bowel, and 57% in the large bowel.
 Children in this study presented with complaints of abdominal pain (58%) and bright red blood per rectum (32%).
 Physical examination revealed little except right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal tenderness and "fullness" in 35%.
 The pain was periumbilical, dull-cramping, rarely acute, and nonradiating.
 The hematochezia was most commonly streaky red in mucoid strands adhering to the stools, with no associated tenesmus.
 Three clinical patterns emerged: (a) Under 1 year of age most patients were male, with painless bleeding and pancolonic LNH.
 (b) Between 2 and 6 years, although the LNH was predominantly colonic, pain and bleeding occurred equally.
 (c) From 7 years old on, the main symptom was abdominal pain, but LNH distribution was nearly equal between the small bowel and the colon.
 To date, our long-term follow-up of the children with isolated LNH has revealed no sequelae.
