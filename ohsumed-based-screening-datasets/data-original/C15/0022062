Laryngeal involvement in disseminated coccidioidomycosis.
 Coccidioidomycosis is a pulmonary fungal infection endemic to the desert southwest of the United States and northern Mexico.
 Rarely (0.5% of cases), the fungus disseminates widely, causing life-threatening complications.
 Seven percent of these cases will involve the head and neck.
 We report a case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis that involved the larynx and cervical lymph nodes in a 40-year-old white woman who presented with hoarseness and unsuspected airway compromise.
 Review of the 12 reported cases of laryngeal coccidioidomycosis showed a predominance of male and dark-skinned patients; seven were children, and nine presented with airway compromise.
 Other reported sites of head and neck involvement include the skin, mucosa, bones of the skull, and meninges, and there have been reports of abscesses of the soft tissues and fascial spaces of the neck.
