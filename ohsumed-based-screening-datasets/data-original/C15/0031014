Intranodal leiomyoma. Another distinctive primary spindle cell neoplasm of lymph node.
 Two intranodal spindle cell neoplasms are described that were interpreted as leiomyomas.
 Both occurred in young men.
 The first case involved a single peripancreatic lymph node of a patient with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) who died of AIDS-related infection.
 The second case simulated a parotid gland tumor because of its location in an intraparotid lymph node in an otherwise asymptomatic patient.
 Both neoplasms were composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with blunt-ended nuclei that seemed to arise from the walls of blood vessels.
 The tumor cells were immunoreactive for muscle-specific actin but were desmin negative.
 These leiomyomas expand the clinical and morphologic spectrum of primary spindle cell neoplasms of lymph nodes.
