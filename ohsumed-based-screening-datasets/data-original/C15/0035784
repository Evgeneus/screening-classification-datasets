Agranulocytosis associated with enalapril.
 An 83-year-old patient developed agranulocytosis following six months of enalapril 10 mg/d.
 The patient also had received verapamil for three years.
 Upon discontinuation of both drugs the white blood cell count was rapidly restored.
 Cases of agranulocytosis due to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, mainly captopril, have been previously described.
 We could, however, find no single case associated with verapamil.
 This, and the very long exposure of the patient to verapamil, support the assumption that this life-threatening complication might have been caused by enalapril.
