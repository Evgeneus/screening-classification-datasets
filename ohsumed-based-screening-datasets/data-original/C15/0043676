Mononeuropathy multiplex complicating idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.
 Peripheral nerve hemorrhage has rarely been reported with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP).
 We describe a patient with severe ITP who developed mononeuropathy multiplex.
 At autopsy, multisystem hemorrhages were found, including intraneural hemorrhage, without evidence of extraneural hematoma.
 ITP represents an unusual cause for clinical mononeuropathy multiplex.
