Stanozolol in treatment of leg ulcers due to cryofibrinogenaemia.
 Five consecutive patients with cryofibrinogenaemia in association with painful leg ulcers and intravascular dermal thrombi were treated with stanozolol, an androgenic steroid with fibrinolytic properties.
 In all patients treatment was followed by rapid and striking pain relief and healing of the ulcers.
 Cryofibrinogenaemia was not detected on subsequent laboratory evaluation, and dermal intravascular thrombi had resolved on repeat histological examination.
