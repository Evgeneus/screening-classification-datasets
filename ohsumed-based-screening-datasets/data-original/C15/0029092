Phase I-II studies of yttrium-labeled antiferritin treatment for end-stage Hodgkin's disease, including Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 87-01 [published erratum appears in J Clin Oncol 1991 Aug;9(8):1516]
 Radiolabeled antiferritin immunoglobulin (Ig) preparations were tested in patients with advanced, end-stage Hodgkin's disease.
 Four patients received indium-111 (111In)-labeled monoclonal antiferritin (QCI).
 Targeting was not observed in tumor-bearing areas.
 Instead, scans showed rapid accumulation of QCI in normal liver.
 Forty-five patients were injected with 111In-labeled polyclonal antiferritin (rabbit, pig, or baboon).
 Forty (89%) patients showed tumor uptake, with dosimetric estimates ranging from 300 to 3,000 cGy in 1 week for the subsequently administered yttrium-90 (90Y)-labeled antiferritin.
 Yttrium-labeled antibody caused hematologic toxicity.
 Treatment-induced toxicity was not observed in any other organ system.
 Intravenous autologous bone marrow cells, 18 days after the yttrium infusion, accelerated hematopoietic recovery in eight patients receiving 30 mCi or 40 mCi.
 Hematopoietic recovery after a 20 mCi 90Y-labeled antiferritin infusion was not influenced by an autologous bone marrow transplant.
 Two patients receiving 20 mCi and one patient receiving 50 mCi remained aplastic after transplantation for unknown reasons.
 In 29 assessable patients, a 62% response rate was observed; nine of the 18 responses were complete.
 Responses ranging from 2 to 26 months were more commonly noted in patients with small tumors and long disease histories.
 Dosimetric calculations did not predict for responses.
 Recurrences frequently occurred in new areas instead of areas exhibiting bulky disease at the start of the treatment.
 Complete responses after 90Y antiferritin were significantly (P less than .02) more frequent than in a previous study with iodine-131 (131I) antiferritin.
 Further improvements are needed to make this new treatment modality curative.
