Quinine-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation.
 Recurrent disseminated intravascular coagulation occurred in 3 women after ingestion of quinine tablets for cramp.
 All had circulating quinine-dependent antibodies to platelets and in 2 there was initial evidence of antibody consumption, with low titres that rose steeply over the next few days and remained high for many months.
