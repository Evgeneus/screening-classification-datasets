Frequency and prognostic importance of thrombocytopenia in symptom-free HIV-infected individuals: a 5-year prospective study.
 The exact frequency of HIV-associated thrombocytopenia (TCP), defined as platelet count less than 150 x 10(9)/1, was studied in 435 symptom-free HIV-seropositive individuals.
 At the baseline control, 23 (5.5%) had TCP.
 TCP individuals had a significantly lower mean CD4 lymphocyte count than the non-TCP individuals.
 During a mean follow-up of 30 months, 79 out of the 435 individuals (18%) had TCP at least once.
 During the study period, only 1% of our patients had a platelet count less than 50 x 10(9)/l.
 TCP was more frequent in intravenous drug users than in other risk groups.
 A spontaneous normalization of platelet count was observed in more than 50% of TCP individuals.
