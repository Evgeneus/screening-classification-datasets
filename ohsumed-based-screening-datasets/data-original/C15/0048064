Efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor on neutropenia in patients with AIDS.
 The efficacy of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF) on neutropenia was evaluated in 14 patients with AIDS and AIDS-related complex (ARC).
 In all patients, including 11 neutropenic patients, 100 or 200 micrograms/m2 of rhG-CSF significantly increased the neutrophil counts.
 The response was greater in patients with higher neutrophil counts before the treatment, and was also dose-dependent.
 Although the effect seemed to be less potent, the agent also increased the neutrophil counts even when zidovudine (azidothymidine, AZT) and other myelosuppressive antiviral agents were administered simultaneously.
 These observations indicate that rhG-CSF may be beneficial in preventing and treating some secondary infections, and will make it easier to continue therapy with antiviral agents in patients with AIDS or ARC.
