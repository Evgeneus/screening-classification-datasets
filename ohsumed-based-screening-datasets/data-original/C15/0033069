Post-transfusion purpura.
 Post-transfusion purpura is a complication of blood product transfusion in which the recipient produces antiplatelet antibodies resulting in severe thrombocytopenia.
 The typical patient is a multiparous woman who develops sudden severe purpura 1 week after receiving a transfusion of packed red cells or whole blood.
 Post-transfusion purpura should, however, be considered in any patient with thrombocytopenia following infusion of a blood product.
 Untreated, the disease can be fatal or cause serious morbidity.
 Treatment options include plasmapheresis, intravenous immunoglobulin, and corticosteroids.
 Platelet transfusion is usually unsuccessful.
