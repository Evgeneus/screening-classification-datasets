Prevention of gram-positive infections after bone marrow transplantation by systemic vancomycin: a prospective, randomized trial.
 Gram-positive bacteria are the most commonly isolated organisms after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) and severe streptococcus septicemia has been reported.
 In order to evaluate the benefit of a gram-positive prophylaxis after BMT, we conducted a prospective, randomized trial of systemic vancomycin among 60 patients undergoing BMT for hematologic malignancies.
 Patients were randomized to receive (n = 30) or not receive (n = 30) prophylactic vancomycin 15 mg/kg every 12 hours from day -2 until resolution of neutropenia or until the first episode of fever.
 All patients were treated in laminar air-flow rooms, received sterile diet, total gut decontamination, and had central venous catheters placed surgically.
 Vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (P less than .002).
 All gram-positive infections occurring in the control group were symptomatic (nine septicemia and two local infections), and one patient with Streptococcus septicemia died with pneumonia.
 Thus, gram-positive prophylaxis was found to decrease infection morbidity after BMT.
 Moreover, the number of days with fever (P less than .001), and empiric antibiotic therapy (P less than .01) was reduced without added toxicity or cost.
 This study confirmed the high prevalence of gram-positive infections after BMT and emphasized the clinical benefits of an adapted prophylaxis.
