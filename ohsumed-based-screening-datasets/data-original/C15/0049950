Immunodepletion of extrinsic pathway inhibitor sensitizes rabbits to endotoxin-induced intravascular coagulation and the generalized Shwartzman reaction.
 We have reported earlier that immunodepletion of extrinsic pathway inhibitor (EPI) sensitizes rabbits to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) induced by infusing a low concentration of tissue factor (TF).
 We now describe the effect of immunodepletion of EPI in rabbits administered endotoxin.
 Cortisone-treated rabbits were administered anti-rabbit EPI immunoglobulin (IgG) or Fab fragments or were administered control nonimmune material before an injection of endotoxin.
 In four of seven rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI activity levels were reduced by 70% to 80% of initial levels for 6 to 8 hours.
 In these rabbits the endotoxin induced extensive DIC, as evidenced by substantial decreases in fibrinogen, factor V, factor VIII, and platelets, and gross hemorrhagic necrosis of the kidneys due to massive deposition of fibrin in the glomerular microcirculation (the generalized Shwartzman reaction).
 In three rabbits administered anti-EPI, plasma EPI levels were only transiently reduced.
 In these rabbits and in four rabbits administered nonimmune IgG or Fab, endotoxin induced minimal to moderate intravascular clotting and deposits of fibrin were not found in the glomerular capillaries.
 Because it is believed that TF expressed on monocytes triggers endotoxin-induced coagulation, these data are taken as evidence that EPI functions as a natural anticoagulant that can regulate factor VIIa/TF activity expressed on cell surfaces in vivo.
 They support a hypothesis that EPI prevents thrombotic complications that might otherwise result from exposure of blood to cytokine-induced generation of small amounts of TF on cell surfaces in many inflammatory and infectious disease states.
