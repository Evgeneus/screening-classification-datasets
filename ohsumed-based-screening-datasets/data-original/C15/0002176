Bronchoalveolar lavage findings in a patient with the organic dust toxic syndrome.
 A previously healthy student developed the organic dust toxic syndrome after unloading a grain silo for one day.
 Bronchoalveolar lavage seven days later showed a total cell count six times normal with 70% lymphocytes.
 This suggests that the previously described acute neutrophil influx into the alveolar spaces in this syndrome is rapidly replaced by a lymphocyte dominated infiltration.
