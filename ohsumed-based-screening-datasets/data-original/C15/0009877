Treatment of drug-induced agranulocytosis with recombinant GM-CSF 
 A 53-year male patient, treated for rheumatoid arthritis with sulphasalazine, developed a total agranulocytosis.
 When this state had prevailed for at least 10 d no bone marrow granulocyte progenitor cells were detectable.
 Intravenous GM-CSF treatment was initiated 5 d later, and the patient recovered within the next 6 d.
 GM-CSF treatment for severe agranulocytosis deserves further investigation.
