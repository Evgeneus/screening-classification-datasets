Recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor after chemotherapy in patients with acute myeloid leukemia at higher age or after relapse.
 To reduce critical neutropenia after chemotherapy (CT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) we administered recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) to patients over the age of 65 years with newly diagnosed AML and to patients with early or second relapse.
 CT was 9-day 6-thioguanine, ara-C, and daunorubicin (TAD9) in newly diagnosed AML and sequential high-dose ara-C and mitoxantrone (S-HAM) for relapse.
 In patients whose bone marrow was free from blasts a continuous intravenous infusion of GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/d started on day 4 after CT.
 Thirty-six patients entered the study and 30 of them did receive GM-CSF.
 For comparison, a historical control group of 56 patients was used.
 Complete remission rate was 50% (18 of 36) versus 32% in controls (P = .09), and early death rate was 14% versus 39% (P = .009).
 Treatment with GM-CSF was not associated with major adverse events.
 Two patients showed a marked leukemic regrowth that was completely reversible in one patient and appeared to be GM-CSF independent in the other patient.
 Remission duration does not seem to be reduced after GM-CSF.
 Under GM-CSF the blood neutrophils recovered 6 and 9 days earlier in the TAD9 (P = .009) and S-HAM (P = .043) groups associated with a rapid clearance of infections in most patients.
 We conclude that GM-CSF was of therapeutic benefit to our patients and this provides a basis for larger controlled trials.
