Changes in the cochlear iron enzymes and adenosine triphosphatase in experimental iron deficiency.
 The influences of iron deficiency on the cochlear iron enzymes and adenosine triphosphatase were studied in 68 iron-deficient rats and 68 control rats (normal and with chronic anemia).
 A disorderly or topographic distribution and reduction or disappearance of the cochlear succinic dehydrogenase and peroxidase reaction products were found in 37.8% of the rats fed on a basic iron-deficient diet for 14 to 100 days.
 The activity of cochlear sodium-potassium-dependent adenosine triphosphatase in iron-deficient rats was slightly increased, compared to that in normal controls.
 These results suggest that iron deficiency would produce significant abnormalities of succinic dehydrogenase and peroxidase activity, which in turn would disturb cell respiration and initiate peroxidative damage to the inner ear cells, result in sensorineural hearing loss, or provide a pathologic basis for cochlear deafness.
