Administration of IL-7 to normal mice stimulates B-lymphopoiesis and peripheral lymphadenopathy.
 Normal mice were injected with IL-7 (500 ng, twice daily) for various periods of time up to 6 days and the cellularity and phenotypic composition of the thymus, spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow was assessed.
 After 6 days of treatment, significant increases in the cellularity of the spleen, lymph node, and bone marrow were observed which returned to the normal range within 6 days after cessation of treatment.
 After 3 days of IL-7 treatment, increased numbers of B220+/surface(s) IgM- bone marrow cells were observed.
 After 6 days of treatment, these numbers were still further increased and a significant population of B220+/sIgM- cells were observed in the spleen.
 The numbers of c mu+/sIgM- cells were also increased in the IL-7-treated mice.
 Analysis of the expression of B220 and BP-1 on the sIgM- bone marrow cells revealed that the B220+/BP-1+ population was dramatically increased after IL-7 treatment and the size of the B220+/BP-1- population did not differ from control mice.
 The pre-B cell numbers declined rapidly after the cessation of IL-7 treatment.
 After 6 days of IL-7 treatment, a twofold increase in the number of B cells in the spleen and lymph node was observed.
 The B cell numbers declined to normal values within 6 days after the cessation of IL-7 administration.
 In the spleens of the IL-7-treated mice, there was a significant increase in the number of B cells with an immature phenotype (e.g., sIgMhi/sIgDlo, decreased levels of Ia and FcR expression).
 The numbers of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were also increased in the lymph node and spleen of the IL-7-treated mice.
 These numbers declined to normal levels after the cessation of IL-7 treatment.
