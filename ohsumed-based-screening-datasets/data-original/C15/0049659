Antenatal suppression of Rh alloimmunization.
 For more than the past decade, attempts have been made to suppress HDN by the administration of drugs or biologic materials to the Rh-immunized pregnant woman.
 With the possible exceptions of IGIV therapy and plasma exchange substitution of IGIV for maternal IgG, all such attempts have been ineffective.
 On the other hand, antenatal administration of RhIg (300 micrograms at 28-30 weeks' gestation) to the pregnant, unimmunized Rh-negative woman is very effective in preventing Rh immunization and is now the accepted standard of obstetric care.
 Physicians who neglect to carry out antenatal prophylaxis neglect to do so at their patient's and their own peril.
