Red cell aplasia in myelodysplastic syndrome.
 Six cases of red cell aplasia occurring in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) showed a diversity of clinical course and prognosis.
 In some patients red cell aplasia may have represented an evolution of MDS while in others autoimmune destruction of erythoblasts may have been the mechanism.
 A proliferative phase is seen in many of these patients, the clinical importance of which is uncertain.
