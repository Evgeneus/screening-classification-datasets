On the need for erythropoietin treatment in dialysis patients. A Copenhagen City Dialysis Unit study 
 We evaluated the need for erythropoietin (EPO) treatment in 134 end-stage renal disease patients assuming a level of hemoglobin below 6 mmol/l (9.6 g/dl) as indication for treatment.
 91 patients (68%) fulfilled this criterion.
 Absolute contraindications in 2 patients were previous thrombotic encephalopathy and refusal of treatment.
 Relative contraindications due to cardiac disease were found in 3 patients.
 In 15 patients additional treatment was required because of hypertension (5) or deficiency states (10).
 The implications of elevated serum PTH and aluminum overload are discussed.
