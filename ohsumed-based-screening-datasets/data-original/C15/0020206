High-dose cisplatin plus dacarbazine in the treatment of metastatic melanoma.
 The combination of cisplatin plus dacarbazine (DTIC) is active in metastatic melanoma with response rates reported between 10% and 55%.
 To optimize this regimen, a Phase II study was conducted employing a dose intensity of cisplatin higher than previously reported.
 Twenty-two patients were treated.
 Eight patients received cisplatin 100 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 combined with DTIC 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 8 and 9 (regimen A).
 Because of excessive toxicity, the protocol was modified so that cisplatin was given at 50 mg/m2 per day and DTIC 350 mg/m2 per day on days 1 through 3 (regimen B).
 The overall response rate was 32% and consisted of four partial and three complete responses (CR).
 The median duration of response was 6 months.
 Two of the CR remain in sustained, unmaintained remission in excess of 1.5 years.
 All seven patients that responded were treated on regimen B.
 High-dose cisplatin plus DTIC on a 3-day schedule represents an effective, well-tolerated therapy for metastatic melanoma.
