Yersinia enterocolitica infection with ileal perforation associated with iron overload and deferoxamine therapy.
 Despite the frequency of gastrointestinal disease caused by Yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal perforation is a rare complication of this infection and to date only eight cases have been reported in the English literature.
 We describe a case of this unusual condition in a 17-year-old male patient with thalassemia intermedia requiring transfusion, who was also taking deferoxamine.
 The severity of the clinical picture is probably due to the increased virulence of Yersinia enterocolitica in the presence of deferoxamine and iron.
