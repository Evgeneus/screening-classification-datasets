Effects of self-monitored exercise on selected blood chemistry parameters of end-stage renal disease patients.
 The effects of exercise on patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is relatively unexplored.
 Of the complications associated with kidney failure, anemia and abnormal blood lipids profiles are among those that exercise may alter.
 Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a self-monitored exercise program on the blood chemistry status in ESRD patients.
 The program consisted of aerobic activity maintained for a minimum of 15 min at least three times per week at an intensity of 10.8 +/- 2.13 on the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale (this scale correlates with heart rate and is used in cases where heart rate is not a reliable predictor of exercise intensity such as hemodialysis patients).
 Monthly blood samples were taken to assess the patients status regarding anemia and blood lipids.
 Results indicate no significant differences (P greater than 0.05) were seen from the beginning of the program until the end of the eighth month as seen below: [table; see text] Values are X +/- SEM.
 These data indicate that a self-monitored exercise program of moderate intensity may not be beneficial in helping regulate the anemia and altered blood lipid status of ESRD patients.
 Thus, since no physiological benefits are apparent with a self-monitored exercise program of low intensity, it is important to realize the potential risk involved with patients undertaking an unsupervised exercise program.
 These data illustrate that ESRD patients need supervised exercise programs in order to elicit a physiological training response.
