The spectrum of beta-thalassemia mutations in Taiwan: identification of a novel frameshift mutation.
 Seventy-four beta-thalassemia genes from 37 unrelated beta-thalassemia-major patients were systematically characterized by using PCR, dot-blot hybridization, and direct sequencing of amplified genomic DNA.
 We found that six mutations--namely, II-654, 41/42, -28, 17 beta, -29, and 27/28--were prevalent, accounting, respectively, for 45.9%, 28.4%, 10.8%, 10.8%, 1.4%, and 2.7% of studied patients.
 The 27/28 mutation has at codon 27-28 a cytosine insertion which has never been reported before.
 These results indicate that four oligo-probes (II-654, 41/42, -28, and 17 beta) allow allele-mutant determination by oligonucleotide analysis in 95.9% of this group of patients, and direct sequencing can be carried out for other samples.
 These data will facilitate the prenatal diagnosis of this disease by DNA analysis in Taiwan.
