Coronary artery bypass grafting in a patient with cryoglobulinemia.
 Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed in a patient with cryoglobulinemia.
 In order to decrease the concentration of cryoglobulin, the patient underwent double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) pre- and postoperatively as well as during cardiopulmonary bypass.
 Bypass surgery was performed under total cardiopulmonary bypass, moderate systemic hypothermia, and ventricular fibrillation without aortic crossclamping.
 No adverse effects of cryoglobulin appeared during the peri- and postoperative course.
 Technical considerations for open heart surgery in patients with cryoglobulinemia are described.
