Tumor necrosis factor receptors in lymphoid tissues and lymphomas. Source and site of action of tumor necrosis factor alpha.
 Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), which is produced by germinal center dendritic reticulum cells (DRC) in lymphoid tissue, plays a regulatory role in a local immune response.
 However no information is available on the nature and location of cells responding to this cytokine.
 Thus TNF receptor distribution was investigated in situ by immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies directed against the p75 and p55 receptor proteins.
 Receptor expression was unique and restricted to the lymphoreticular tissue.
 The p75 receptor was found on activated lymphocytes and interdigitating reticulum cells of the T-cell area, whereas the p55 receptor was confined to the germinal center DRCs, which are the main site of TNF alpha production.
 The two receptor proteins were expressed on distinct cell populations of the lymphoid system and no coexpression was observed.
 Preliminary results indicate that TNF receptor (TNFR) expression is regulated; Upregulation of TNFR proteins was found in reactive hyperplasia together with increased TNF alpha expression.
 In lymphoproliferative disorders, expression of the p75 receptor and TNF alpha was found mainly in high-grade malignant non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
 In summary, TNF alpha produced by germinal center DRCs might regulate an in vivo immune response through autocrine and paracrine pathways.
 Thus TNF alpha might signal, through the distinct TNFR proteins, the p55 and p75 receptor, which are expressed on different cell types in lymphoid tissue.
