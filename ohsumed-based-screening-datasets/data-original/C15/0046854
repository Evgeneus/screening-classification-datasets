Ifosfamide continuous infusion without mesna. A phase I trial of a 14-day cycle.
 Twenty patients received 27 courses of ifosfamide administered as a 24-hour continuous infusion for 14 days without Mesna.
 The goal of the study was to deliver a dose rate and total cumulative dose of ifosfamide that would be comparable to standard bolus or short-term infusions administered with Mesna.
 Dose escalations proceeded from 200 to 300, 400, 450, 500, and 550 mg/m2/d.
 Four patients developed transient microscopic hematuria at 400, 450, and 500 mg/m2/d.
 There were no instances of macroscopic hematuria.
 At 550 mg/m2/d, three patients experienced nonurologic toxicity; confusion (1), nausea (1), and Grade 2 leukopenia (1).
 The recommended dose of 500 mg/m2/d delivers a total dose of 7 g/m2 per cycle, which is comparable to that delivered in clinical practice for bolus or short-term infusion.
 Because few patients received multiple courses over time, the cumulative effects are indeterminate in the present trial.
 The frequency and predictability of hematuria are not precise, and at least daily monitoring by urine Hematest is essential, adding Mesna to the infusate in patients with persistent hematuria.
 The protracted infusion schedule for ifosfamide permits convenient outpatient administration without Mesna and reduces the drug cost of clinical usage of this agent by up to $890 per cycle.
 Clinical activity was demonstrated in a single patient, but a comparative trial of standard bolus schedules with the protracted infusion schedule will be necessary to determine if the clinical effectiveness of the drug is maintained.
