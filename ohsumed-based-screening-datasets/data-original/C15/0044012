Cerebrovascular abnormalities in pediatric stroke: assessment using parenchymal and angiographic magnetic resonance imaging.
 Three-dimensional (volume) magnetic resonance angiography is a noninvasive technique that images the intracranial and cervical arterial vasculature without contrast agents.
 Twenty-four children with strokes had combined parenchymal magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography 1 day to 4 years after acute presentation.
 Eight had had prior intra-arterial angiography.
 Eighteen magnetic resonance angiographic studies showed arterial stenosis or occlusion in the vascular distribution of magnetic resonance image-defined brain infarction and, in 7 children, in the same location as previously defined abnormalities on intra-arterial angiography.
 One child had a normal intra-arterial angiogram and magnetic resonance angiogram.
 The other 5 children with normal magnetic resonance angiographic studies included 3 with presumed embolic disease, 1 with meningitis, and 1 with Crohn's disease-related vasculitis.
 Collateral flow patterns could be determined in 4 children.
 Artifact presenting as filling defects in vessels was present in 10 studies, but did not interfere with interpretation of 8 studies.
 Combined magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance angiography provides a screening technique to evaluate noninvasively brain parenchyma and vasculature in children with suspected large-vessel abnormalities, allowing selection for intra-arterial angiography and serial monitoring of vascular abnormalities over time and during therapeutic intervention.
