A lifelong bleeding disorder associated with a deficiency of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1.
 A 36-year-old patient was investigated for a lifelong history of epistaxis and delayed bleeding after minor surgeries.
 Deficiencies or abnormalities of the coagulation system, of platelet function, or of factor XIII and alpha-2-antiplasmin were excluded.
 Consistently, however, over a period of 7 years, a high basal euglobulin fibrinolytic activity was observed that was characterized by a high tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity, normal t-PA antigen, and undetectable plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) antigen and activity.
 The high specific activity of t-PA (640,000 IU/mg) and the minimal amounts of t-PA/PAI-1 complexes detected by fibrin zymography suggest that in this patient all t-PA was active.
 This is in striking contrast to normal plasma, where the majority of t-PA is complexed to PAI-1.
 Thus, in this patient, a severe deficiency of PAI-1 is associated with a delayed type bleeding tendency.
 Our observation underscores the importance of plasma PAI-1 for the stabilization of the hemostatic plug.
