Large-cell anaplastic (Ki-1-positive) lymphoma complicated by disseminated intravascular coagulation.
 Large-cell anaplastic lymphoma (Ki-1-positive lymphoma) was first described as a type of large-cell lymphoma that has morphologic, enzymatic, and immunologic similarities to malignant histiocytosis.
 To date, an association between Ki-1-positive lymphoma and disseminated intravascular coagulation has not been described, but cases of malignant histiocytosis with disseminated intravascular coagulation have been reported.
 We report a case of anaplastic, Ki-1-positive, large-cell lymphoma complicated by clinical and laboratory evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation with histologic evidence of vascular invasion and fibrin thrombi.
