Extrarenal production of calcitriol.
 Under normal circumstances extrarenal sources of calcitriol probably constitutes a microendocrine system involved in cell differentiation and local intercellular communication with no influence on systemic calcium homeostasis.
 Under pathological conditions such as chronic renal failure, extrarenal sources have the potential to normalize serum calcitriol after adequate stimulation (such as, 25(OH)D administration).
 Extrarenal 1,25-(OH)2D3 synthesis is controlled by physiological levels of calcitriol.
 However, in sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases, 1,25-(OH)2D3 production by macrophages is deregulated, causing severe alterations in systemic calcium homeostasis.
