High hemoglobin A2 beta 0-thalassemia due to a 532-basepair deletion of the 5' beta-globin gene region.
 We identify and characterize a novel beta 0-thalassemia mutation that is associated with an unusually high level of hemoglobin (Hb) A2 in the heterozygote.
 This newly discovered mutation is caused by a 532-basepair deletion that extends from positions -454 to + 78 relative to the mRNA cap site of the beta-globin gene.
 The propositi are 9-month-old fraternal twins.
 One of the twins is a compound heterozygote for the deletion and Hb S, the other is a compound heterozygote for the deletion and Hb C.
