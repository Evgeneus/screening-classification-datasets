Correlation between dermal interstitial immunoglobulin G and hypergammaglobulinemia.
 The diffuse dermal immunofluorescence (DDIF) observed in human skin biopsies that is produced by fluorochrome-conjugated antisera reactive with human immunoglobulin G (IgG) has commonly been viewed in the past as an artifact of direct immunofluorescence microscopy.
 However, it has been our belief that DDIF, which has been observed in 14% of the biopsies processed in our laboratory, might represent an in vivo phenomenon of excess unbound dermal interstitial immunoglobulin G reflective of elevated serum IgG levels.
 To examine this hypothesis, we carried out a blinded prospective study of the frequency of DDIF in two groups of age- and sex-matched patients that differed with respect to the presence or absence of serum hypergammaglobulinemia (gamma globulin greater than 2.5 mg/100 ml).
 The subjective intensity of DDIF and the fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated anti-human IgG antibody titer at which point DDIF disappeared were both compared with serum gamma globulin levels.
 Also, the amount of IgG that could be extracted from biopsy specimens by an overnight phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) elution procedure was quantified by solid-phase immunoassay.
 We noted a trend of increased DDIF intensity with increasing serum gamma globulin levels.
 In addition, there was a relatively weak but significant positive correlation between DDIF endpoint titers and serum gamma globulin levels (p = 0.05, r = 0.429).
 The strongest positive statistical correlation observed in the study was between the quantities of IgG that could be eluted from skin biopsies and serum gamma globulin levels (p = 0.01, r = 0.599).
 These findings suggest that DDIF is a true biologic phenomenon reflective of elevated serum gamma globulin levels and demonstrate that simple overnight elution of unbound dermal IgG can unmask the presence of disease-related, specifically-bound IgG.
