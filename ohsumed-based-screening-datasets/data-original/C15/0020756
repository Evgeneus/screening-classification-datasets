Heterogeneity of human red cell autoantibodies assessed by isoelectric focusing.
 Human red cell (RBC) autoantibodies may be the products of a single lymphocyte clone or of a restricted number of clones.
 For insight into the clonal distribution of human RBC autoantibodies, serum fractions from 28 individuals with various forms of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA) and two nonanemic individuals with positive direct antiglobulin tests were separated by isoelectric focusing (IEF), and RBC binding in each fraction was quantitated with a solid-phase radioimmunoassay.
 IEF fractions of serum from normal volunteers and patients with nonimmune hemolytic anemia served as controls.
 These studies indicate that RBC antibodies are found in a restricted number of IEF fractions in sera from some patients with immune hemolytic anemia.
 IEF fractions containing RBC-binding activity vary among patients with idiopathic AHA, and distinct patterns of binding activity are found in serum from some patients with AHA associated with alphamethyldopa and procainamide or with B-cell immunoproliferative diseases.
 These findings suggest that the mechanism leading to autoantibody production may differ among patients with the various forms of immune hemolytic anemia.
