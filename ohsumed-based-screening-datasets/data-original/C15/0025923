The impact of varying degrees of iron nutriture on several functional consequences of iron deficiency in rats.
 The impact of varying severities of iron-deficiency anemia on fasting blood glucose, plasma triiodothyronine, heart norepinephrine concentrations and resting oxygen consumption were evaluated.
 Male weanling Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to one of six dietary groups (4, 6, 11, 16, 23 or 40 mg Fe/kg diet) for 6 wk.
 Hemoglobin, liver iron and transferrin saturation were significantly lower in the 4 and 6 mg Fe/kg diet groups relative to the other groups and were indicative of anemia, low tissue iron stores and impaired erythropoiesis.
 Fasting blood glucose and heart norepinephrine concentrations were significantly higher and lower, respectively, in the 4 and 6 mg Fe/kg diet groups than the three highest dietary Fe groups.
 Although fasting blood glucose was significantly inversely correlated (r = -0.89, P = 0.0001) with hemoglobin concentration; a significant quadratic relationship (R 2 = 0.70, P = 0.0001) existed between hemoglobin and heart norepinephrine concentration.
 Differences in plasma triiodothyronine concentrations and resting oxygen consumption were not significant among the groups.
 Thus, base on hemoglobin concentration as an index of the severity of iron deficiency, these findings demonstrate that certain physiological manifestations of iron deficiency occur at even moderate-to-mild degrees of anemia.
