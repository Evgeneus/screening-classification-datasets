Hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and consumption coagulopathy.
 We describe a case of hepatic giant cavernous hemangioma with both microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and consumption coagulopathy, but without thrombocytopenia, which was completely cured by surgical resection of the tumor.
 The patient was a 54-yr-old Japanese woman whose chief complaint was right upper abdominal discomfort.
 Angiography and dynamic computed tomography revealed typical findings of hepatic cavernous hemangioma.
 The patient also had hematological disorders.
 At surgery, we performed an atypical right lobectomy to preserve as much normal liver tissue as possible.
 The patient has been well, with no related complaints or abnormal laboratory findings, 5 yr since her operation.
 This case indicates that giant cavernous hemangioma of the liver should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MAHA, and if surgical treatment is adequate, hematological abnormalities may be eliminated.
