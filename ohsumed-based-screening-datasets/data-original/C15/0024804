Life expectancy of patients with chronic nonleukemic myeloproliferative disorders.
 This study determines, within the frame of current therapeutic possibilities, the impact of chronic nonleukemic myeloproliferative disorders on expected survival.
 The survival data for 1067 patients (454 with polycythemia vera, 247 with essential thrombocythemia, and 366 with idiopathic myelofibrosis) were collected from 38 Spanish institutions.
 The actuarial survival probability of each group of patients was compared with that of the age-matched and sex-matched control population.
 The survival of the patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia did not differ from that of the control population (P = 0.92 and, 0.22, respectively), whereas the survival of the patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis was strikingly reduced with respect to the control population (P = 0.0000000007).
 Thus, in terms of survival, current therapeutic procedures may be considered as quite satisfactory in patients with polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.
 On the other hand, due to poor survival of patients with idiopathic myelofibrosis, new therapeutic approaches for this condition are clearly needed.
