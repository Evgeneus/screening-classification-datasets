Anterior mediastinal tumor of 30 years' duration.
 A 67-year-old woman had a large mediastinal mass with calcification.
 On roentgenogram of 30 years ago, the same mass without calcification was seen.
 The mediastinal mass was removed by surgery and proved to be a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), most probably as a transition from a giant lymph node hyperplasia (Castleman's disease).
