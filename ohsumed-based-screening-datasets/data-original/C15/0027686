Successful long-term control of idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome with etoposide.
 A 38-year-old man with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome had an inadequate response to steroids and severe side effects from hydroxyurea treatment, which necessitated withdrawal of the treatment.
 Successful control of clinical symptoms and eosinophil counts was obtained with etoposide (VP16-213) for 18 months.
 VP16-213 may be valuable in idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome treatment.
