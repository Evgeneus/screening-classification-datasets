A randomized clinical trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation of sickle cell retinopathy. A long-term follow-up.
 Long-term follow-up of patients enrolled in a randomized prospective trial of feeder vessel photocoagulation for proliferative sickle retinopathy has been completed.
 Of the 44 patients enrolled in Chicago, nearly a decade follow-up has been achieved on 29 patients (45 eyes).
 There were 20 control untreated eyes and 25 argon laser-treated eyes.
 Prolonged loss of visual acuity was rare in both groups.
 Argon laser photocoagulation has had a sustained effect on reducing the incidence of vitreous hemorrhage and visual loss from vitreous hemorrhage.
 Nine (45%) of 20 control eyes had vitreous hemorrhage, and it was recurrent in six (66%) of these nine eyes.
 A single episode was the only hemorrhagic event in the treated eyes.
 The laser-induced complications of choroidal neovascularization or retinal detachment were not associated with long-term visual sequelae.
 New sea fan evolution in 47% of study eyes suggests that these patients require long-term surveillance.
