von Willebrand factor: clinical features of inherited and acquired disorders.
 The physiologic mechanisms that influence plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (vWF) are poorly understood but include race, blood group, age, pregnancy, exercise, and adrenergic and neurohumoral stimuli.
 Inherited abnormalities in von Willebrand's disease (vWD) are associated with a defect of the vWF gene on chromosome 12, but in some cases, coexistence of impaired response of plasminogen activator and telangiectasia suggests the presence of a regulatory defect or more extensive endothelial perturbation.
 Three broad types of vWD are recognized; in addition, a platelet-type vWD (pseudo-vWD) is due to an abnormal platelet receptor for vWF.
 The prevalence of vWD, which is difficult to determine because of variations in severity even within a kindred, is reportedly as high as 1%.
 In a survey of European patients, the prevalence of treated vWD varied from 4.5 to 24 per million.
 Preliminary results of an international survey of vWD indicate that about 3% of treated patients have seroconversion to human immunodeficiency virus, 50% of whom have symptoms.
 Inhibitor of vWF occurs in type III vWD after treatment and is associated with the presence of gene deletions.
 Acquired vWD may complicate lymphoproliferative and autoimmune disorders, and proteolytic degradation of vWF complicates myeloproliferative disorders.
 The level of vWF is increased during pregnancy and in vascular and other disorders; it may be involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
 High-molecular-weight multimers of vWF and a cofactor are thought to promote the formation of microthrombi in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and the hemolytic uremic syndrome.
 Thus, study of vWD has shed light on pathogenetic mechanisms in a wide range of disorders.
