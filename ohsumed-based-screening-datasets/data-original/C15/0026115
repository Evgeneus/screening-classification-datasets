Outbreak of Kawasaki syndrome in Denver, Colorado: association with rug and carpet cleaning.
 Between October 1984 and January 1985, the largest outbreak of Kawasaki syndrome reported to date in the continental United States (62 cases) occurred in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains, extending from Colorado Springs, Colorado, to Cheyenne, Wyoming.
 Fifty-two (84%) of these Kawasaki syndrome patients lived in the Denver metropolitan area.
 A case-control study revealed that 16 (62%) of 26 Kawasaki syndrome patients compared with 10 (20%) of 49 matched control subjects had a history of exposure to shampooed (19%) or spot-cleaned (81%) rugs or carpets within 30 days of the Kawasaki syndrome onset date (odds ratio = 5, P less than .01).
 The time of exposure to shampooed or spot-cleaned rugs or carpets for 9 of 10 Kawasaki syndrome patients who had a single exposure and for all 6 Kawasaki syndrome patients who had multiple exposures were clustered within an interval 13 to 30 days before the onset of illness.
 Although the reason for this unusually large outbreak remains obscure, it is the third in which a statistically significant association between Kawasaki syndrome and rug or carpet cleaning has been found.
