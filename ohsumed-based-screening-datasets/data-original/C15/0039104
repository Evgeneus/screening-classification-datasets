Surgical management of extracranial vertebral artery occlusive disease.
 Thirty-seven consecutive patients underwent vertebral artery (VA) reconstruction over a 6 years period (1983-1989).
 Detailed neurologic, medical, and angiographic information was obtained for all patients.
 Indications for surgery were as follows: (1) stenosis of VA with symptoms of vertebrobasilar insufficiency; (2) very tight stenosis (greater than 75%) of the dominant VA with stenosis or occlusion of the contralateral VA; (3) very tight stenosis of VA with bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid artery (ICA); (4) very tight stenosis of VA with homolateral ICA lesion eligible for simultaneous repair; (5) very tight stenosis of VA and very tight stenosis of the homo or contralateral carotid siphon.
 There were 15 isolated vertebral lesions (group I), and 22 were VA lesions associated with lesions of the supraaortic trunks which were simultaneously treated (group II).
 The reconstructions of the first portion of the VA were 30 (12 of group I and 18 of group II) and reimplantation of the VA into the common carotid artery was the procedure of choice.
 There were 7 revascularizations of the third portion of the VA at C1-C2 level (3 of group I and 4 of group II): carotid-vertebral bypass, using an autogenous vein graft, was the procedure of choice.
 Three patients in group II died in the immediate postoperative period from myocardial infarction but no patient presented immediate postoperative neurologic deficits.
 All symptomatic patients but one were relieved of their symptoms in a median follow-up of 31 months.
 No postoperative complications were observed.
 Long-term results were satisfactory in all the 28 patients at their last follow-up visit.
