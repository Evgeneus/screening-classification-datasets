Normocytic and macrocytic anemias.
 Differential diagnosis of normocytic and macrocytic anemias is guided by the patient history, physical examination results, reticulocyte count, and specific red blood cell abnormalities identified on the peripheral smear.
 In some cases this information is sufficient for diagnosis.
 When further tests are needed, a stepwise approach, as described by the author, ensures maximum cost-effectiveness without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy.
