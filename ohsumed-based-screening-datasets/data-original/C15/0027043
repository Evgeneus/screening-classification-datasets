Enhancement of T-cell activation by the CD43 molecule whose expression is defective in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.
 CD43 (sialophorin, leukosialin, leukocyte large sialoglycoprotein), a heavily sialylated molecule found on most leukocytes and platelets, was initially identified as a major glycoprotein of mouse, rat and human T cells.
 CD43 expression is defective on the T cells of males with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X chromosome-linked recessive immunodeficiency disorder.
 Affected males are susceptible to opportunistic infections and do not respond to polysaccharide antigens, reflecting defects in cytotoxic and helper T-cell functions.
 Anti-CD43 monoclonal antibodies have a modest costimulatory effect on T cells, natural killer cells, B cells and monocytes, and one such antibody has been shown to activate T cells directly.
 To investigate a possible physiological role for CD43, a complementary DNA encoding the human protein was introduced into an antigen-responsive murine T-cell hybridoma.
 We observed that CD43 enhances the antigen-specific activation of T cells and that the intracellular domain of CD43, which is hyperphosphorylated during T-cell activation, is required for this function.
 We also found that antigen-presenting cells can bind specifically to immobilized purified CD43 and that the binding can be inhibited by liposomes containing CD43 as well as by anti-CD43 monoclonal antibodies.
