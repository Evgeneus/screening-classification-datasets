Interstitial lung disease and cryoglobulinemia in polymyositis.
 Alveolar septal deposits of immunoglobulins and complement were found in the lung biopsy of a patient with polymyositis and interstitial lung disease.
 Anti-Jo 1 antibody was present in the serum and in isolated mixed cryoglobulins of the patient, suggesting the role of immune complex deposition in the pathogenesis of lung disease.
 Significant amounts of cryoglobulins were found in 10 of 16 (62.5%) patients with polymyositis/dermatomyositis tested.
