Exonic point mutations in NADH-cytochrome B5 reductase genes of homozygotes for hereditary methemoglobinemia, types I and III: putative mechanisms of tissue-dependent enzyme deficiency.
 We analyzed the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase gene of hereditary methemoglobinemia type I and type III, by using PCR-related techniques.
 The mutation in type I is a guanine-to-adenine substitution in codon 57 of exon 3 of the NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase gene, and the sense of this codon is changed from arginine to glutamine.
 In type III the mutation is a thymine-to-cytosine transition in codon 148 of exon 5, causing leucine-to-proline replacement in type III.
 The former mutation abolishes the MspI recognition site.
 Homozygosity for the former mutation in a patient with type I was confirmed by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified fragments and by dot blot hybridization of amplified products with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes.
 The latter mutation generates a recognition site for MspI.
 Amplification of exon 5 by PCR followed by digestion with MspI revealed homozygosity for this mutation in patients with type-III.
 Putative mechanisms of tissue-dependent enzyme defects in hereditary methemoglobinemia are discussed.
