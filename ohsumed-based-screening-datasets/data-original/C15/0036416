Kikuchi's necrotising lymphadenitis.
 Three cases of Kikuchi's necrotizing lymphadenitis without granulocytic infiltration presented to the ENT department as cervical lymphadenopathy with neutropaenia.
 Differential diagnosis from malignant lymphoma was difficult both clinically and histopathologically.
 Two recovered spontaneously without treatment within three months, one improved initially but was lost to follow-up after one month.
