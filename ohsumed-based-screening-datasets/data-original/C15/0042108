Lymphangiosarcoma associated with lymphedema in a man with Maffucci's syndrome.
 A man with Maffucci's syndrome and lifelong lymphedema in the right lower extremity had a lymphangiosarcoma in the same extremity.
 Despite amputation of the limb and radiotherapy, he died several months later of pulmonary metastases.
 Malignancies of vascular origin rarely have been reported in this syndrome.
 Our patient's features suggest that lymphedema may predispose patients with Maffucci's syndrome to the development of lymphangiosarcoma.
