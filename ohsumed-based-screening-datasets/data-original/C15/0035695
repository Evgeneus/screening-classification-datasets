Renal peripelvic lymphangiectasia: appearance at CT.
 In a patient who had undergone emergency nephrectomy during exploratory surgery, a pathologic diagnosis of peripelvic lymphangiectasia was made.
 Subsequent computed tomographic examination of the remaining kidney showed large multilocular renal sinus cysts, renal capsular cysts, and regions of fluid attenuation surrounding the mesenteric vessels, findings consistent with peripelvic lymphangiectasia.
 A brief discussion of cystic disease of the renal sinus is presented.
