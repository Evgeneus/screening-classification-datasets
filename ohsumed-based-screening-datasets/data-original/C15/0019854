Collateral circulation in Kawasaki disease with coronary occlusion or severe stenosis.
 Forty patients with Kawasaki disease with severe coronary sequelae were investigated.
 All had at least a 90% reduction in the diameter of the major coronary artery.
 Collateral vessels were seen in 32 of 33 (97%) patients with total occlusion.
 All patients with severe stenosis but not total occlusion had no or poorly developed collateral vessels.
 Analysis according to the presence or absence of collateral vessels showed no significant differences in the results of treadmill stress testing and myocardial imaging between these two groups.
 In patients treated surgically, the abnormalities recognized by these tests were normalized or improved when the bypass was patent.
 These data indicate that collateral circulation in patients with Kawasaki disease cannot be seen angiographically unless there is total occlusion and the presence of collateral circulation cannot provide protection against stress-induced myocardial ischemia.
