Cat-scratch disease.
 Cat-scratch disease is a relatively common disorder that is the result of infection with a recently identified gram-negative bacillus.
 Although it is overwhelmingly a benign, self-limited illness requiring only supportive care, serious complications can occur and the disease may be life-threatening on occasion.
 Although randomized clinical trials of antibiotic therapy for CSD do not exist, CSD has demonstrated in vitro susceptibility to several antibiotics, and gentamicin has been reported beneficial in a few patients with systemic manifestations of the illness.
 Therefore, pending clinical trials, gentamicin may be worthy of consideration in CSD patients with serious manifestations of this illness.
 CSD is one of the most common causes of adenopathy and should be considered in all patients who present with unilateral or regional lymphadenopathy.
