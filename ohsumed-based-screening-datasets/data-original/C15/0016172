Acetazolamide-associated aplastic anaemia.
 Eleven cases of acetazolamide-associated aplastic anaemia were reported in Sweden during a 17-year period.
 There were six women and five men with a median age of 71 years (range 63-85 years).
 The median dose of acetazolamide was 500 mg, and the median duration of treatment was 3 months (range 2-71 months).
 Ten of the eleven patients died, all within 8 weeks after detection of their aplastic anaemia.
 The relative risk of developing aplastic anaemia when taking acetazolamide was 13.3 (95% confidence limits (CL); 6.8-25.3).
 The estimated incidence of reported acetazolamide-associated aplastic anaemia is approximately one in 18,000 patient years.
 The results strongly indicate that acetazolamide treatment is associated with a substantial increase in the risk of developing aplastic anaemia.
