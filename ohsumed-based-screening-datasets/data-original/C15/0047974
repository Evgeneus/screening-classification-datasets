A familial occurrence of natural killer cell--T-lymphocyte proliferation disease in two children.
 Several reports describe the association of hyperlymphocytosis with neutropenia.
 This syndrome, named lymphoproliferative disease, is characterized by a chronic indolent clinical course, bone marrow lymphocyte infiltration, and granulopenia of central origin.
 The proliferating lymphocytes share large granular lymphocyte natural killer cell and T-lymphocyte characteristics.
 They are either of monoclonal or polyclonal origin.
 In this report the familial occurrence of a similar syndrome observed in two children is described.
 Lymphocyte morphologic abnormalities including nuclear pockets, were noted, a feature usually present in leukemic cells.
 Lymphocyte proliferation was distinct in each case as shown by the presence of a predominant CD4+ cell population in one and a predominant CD8+ population in the other.
 Monoclonal gene rearrangements of T-cell receptor beta-chain gene were found although clonal variations occurred with time in one patient.
 The cause of this unique familial occurrence of monoclonal lymphoproliferation associated with neutropenia is unknown.
