Twin-twin transfusion syndrome.
 Twin-twin transfusion syndrome associated with acute polyhydramnios in one sac and severe oligohydramnios in the other, which characteristically is diagnosed between 18 and 28 weeks, is associated with a high mortality rate for the involved twins.
 Patients who are managed without intervention have essentially 100% perinatal mortality.
 Nineteen patients with this diagnosis were treated at Good Samaritan Medical Center over a 5-year period.
 Because of the known perinatal mortality and because of early experiences with the twin-twin transfusion syndrome, we began to actively intervene in such patients with various modes of therapy.
 As experience was gained, it was found that repeated therapeutic amniocenteses, if performed before severe maternal abdominal distention or labor, appears to be beneficial.
