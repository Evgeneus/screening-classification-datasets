Defective immune adherence and elimination of hepatitis B surface antigen/antibody complexes in patients with mixed essential cryoglobulinemia type II.
 Mixed essential cryoglobulinemia type II (monoclonal Ig/polyclonal IgG) is characterized by systemic vasculitis caused by the deposition of circulating immune reactants that include the monoclonal component.
 Such reactants may include immune complexes (IC) formed from exogenous Ag.
 IC binding to E C receptor type 1 appears to play a role in transport and buffering of such IC (immune adherence: IA).
 To define the mechanisms responsible for immune deposition, 7 patients with cryoglobulinemia type II (IgM kappa/polyclonal IgG) and 14 normal volunteers were injected i.v.
 with hepatitis B surface Ag/antibody complexes.
 Two minutes after injection, only 19.4% (mean) of the circulating complexes were bound to E in patients as compared with 63.1% in normal subjects.
 This IA correlated directly with C4 and inversely with the IgM rheumatoid factor (RF) titer.
 Disappearance of IC was faster in patients (mean elimination rate: 15.7%/min) than in normal subjects (9.3%).
 In vitro experiments demonstrated that C depletion, interference with IC opsonization by monoclonal IgM RF, and decreased binding of opsonized IC in the presence of monoclonal RF are each associated with decreased IA.
 These observations suggest that, in patients with cryoglobulinemia type II, monoclonal IgM RF and low C contribute to reducing IA of circulating IC that might be rapidly trapped in tissues, resulting in injury.
