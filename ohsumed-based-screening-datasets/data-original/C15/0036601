Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (Kimura's disease): report of a large-sized lesion.
 Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE) is an uncommon lesion with a predilection for skin of the head and neck region.
 It usually presents as one or a few smooth-surfaced nodules which are often asymptomatic.
 Histologically the nodules reveal two components: abnormal proliferating vessels and a cellular infiltrate consisting of lymphocytes and eosinophils, involving both the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue.
 A case is presented of an unusually large recurrent lesion on the scalp.
