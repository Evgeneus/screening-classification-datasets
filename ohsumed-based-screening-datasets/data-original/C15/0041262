Lack of association between neutropenia and the incidence of bacteremia associated with indwelling central venous catheters in febrile pediatric cancer patients.
 To assess the incidence of bacteremia in pediatric cancer patients with indwelling central venous catheters with fever, we reviewed the records of all 67 such patients sequentially admitted during a 10-month period at our institution.
 There were a total of 140 episodes of fever in these 67 patients.
 In 55 of the episodes (39%) patients were nonneutropenic (absolute neutrophil count, greater than 500/mm3); 85 episodes (61%) were associated with neutropenia.
 Twenty-four percent of all episodes of fever in nonneutropenic patients were related to bacteremia vs.
 9.5% of episodes of fever in the presence of neutropenia (P less than 0.05).
 When clinical evidence of an exit site infection was absent, the incidence of bacteremia in the neutropenic and nonneutropenic groups was similar (11% in the neutropenic group; 10% in the nonneutropenic group).
 We conclude that bacteremia is frequently observed in febrile pediatric cancer patients with indwelling venous catheters who are not neutropenic, particularly if there is clinical evidence of an exit site infection.
 Thus empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted in all pediatric oncology patients with indwelling catheters who develop fever.
