Point mutations in the beta-subunit of cytochrome b558 leading to X-linked chronic granulomatous disease.
 The NADPH:O2 oxidoreductase of phagocytic leukocytes is an important enzyme for the bactericidal activity of these cells.
 Cytochrome b558 is a membrane component of this enzyme.
 In X-linked chronic granulomatous disease (Xb- CGD) the phagocytes are defective in the beta-subunit (gp91-phox) of this cytochrome.
 We have studied the genetic defect in a group of six X-linked CGD patients characterized by complete or partial loss of cytochrome b558 with the use of the polymerase chain reaction.
 All patients had a different single point mutation in the gp91-phox gene, indicating that the genetic defect in Xb- CGD is very heterogeneous.
 In one patient the mutation leads to a premature termination codon.
 In the other five cases these mutations predict incorporation of a different amino acid.
 The mutations were with one exception found in the N-terminal half of the protein, suggesting that this part of cytochrome b558 is important for the binding of the heme or for formation of a stable complex with p22-phox.
 Two histidyl residues were found that might be ligands of the heme iron.
