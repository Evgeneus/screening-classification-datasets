Peripheral neuropathy in cold agglutinin disease.
 Cold agglutinin disease (CAD) characteristically presents as anemia and cold-induced rash.
 We report a man with purpura, anemia, cold agglutinins, and a sensory-autonomic polyneuropathy.
 Treatment with corticosteroids and plasma exchange resulted in resolution of the anemia and polyneuropathy.
 We propose that CAD may be associated with a reversible sensory-autonomic neuropathy in the absence of cryoglobulinemia.
 Although unsupported by pathologic findings, pathogenetic hypotheses for the neuropathy in CAD are similar to those proposed for cryoglobulinemic neuropathy.
