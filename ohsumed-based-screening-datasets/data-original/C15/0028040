Dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging of the spleen: normal enhancement patterns and evaluation of splenic lesions.
 The authors studied the ability to improve detection of splenic lesions during suspended respiration with dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
 In the first phase of the study, normal splenic contrast material enhancement patterns were assessed in 10 control patients without splenic lesions.
 A heterogeneous signal intensity pattern was observed in 11 patients with splenic lesions during bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine, with conversion to homogeneous enhancement 1 minute later.
 Mean splenic enhancement was 321% during bolus injection, with a rapid return toward baseline signal intensity thereafter.
 In the second phase, evaluation of 18 splenic lesions detected with contrast-enhanced computed tomography in 11 patients revealed that dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR pulse sequences significantly improved lesion conspicuity and detectability compared with conventional T1-and T2-weighted pulse sequences.
 Contrast-to-artifact ratio measurements were 0.5, 3.7, and 9.3 for conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced MR images, respectively.
