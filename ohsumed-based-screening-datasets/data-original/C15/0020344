Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced colonic strictures: a case report.
 Adverse effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs can occur throughout the whole gastrointestinal tract.
 Recently, several cases of "diaphragmlike" thin ileal strictures have been reported.
 These strictures seem to result from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced inflammatory changes and apparently represent a newly recognized nosological entity.
 The case of a 61-year-old man who gradually developed similar inflammatory changes in the ascending colon during prolonged intake of a slow-release form of diclofenac is presented, and the literature on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-induced intestinal strictures is briefly reviewed.
