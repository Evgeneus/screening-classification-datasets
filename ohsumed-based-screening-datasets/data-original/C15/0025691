Pulmonary hypertension associated with long-standing thrombocytosis.
 A case of thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension associated with long-standing thrombocytosis is presented.
 In this patient we found a significant local pulmonary platelet activation and thrombin generation as indicated by the existence of a transpulmonary gradient for thromboxane A2, beta thromboglobulin and fibrinopeptide A.
 Prolonged heparin and acetylsalicylic acid treatment resulted in improvement of clinical and hemodynamic conditions.
 These findings support the usefulness of anticoagulating and antiaggregating therapy in selected cases of pulmonary hypertension.
