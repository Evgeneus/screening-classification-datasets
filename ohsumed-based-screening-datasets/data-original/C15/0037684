Sonography in the diagnosis of acute appendicitis.
 Acute appendicitis can be a diagnostic dilemma.
 The classic triad of leukocytosis, pain at McBurney's point and a history compatible with appendicitis has a diagnostic accuracy rate of only 80 percent.
 Ultrasonography, combined with this triad, can improve the diagnostic accuracy, decreasing the negative laparotomy rate from 20 percent to less than 10 percent.
