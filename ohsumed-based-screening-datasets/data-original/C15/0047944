Analysis of the relationship of von Willebrand disease (vWD) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia and identification of a potential type IIA vWD mutation (IIe865 to Thr).
 Reports of families with members affected with both von Willebrand disease (vWD) and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) suggest a possible relationship between these two disorders.
 vWD, the most common inherited bleeding disorder in humans, is due to either a quantitative or qualitative defect in von Willebrand factor (vWF).
 The gene for vWF has been cloned and mapped to chromosome 12 (12p12----12pter).
 HHT, an uncommon inherited bleeding disorder, is characterized by malformed, dilated, fragile blood vessels.
 The chromosomal location of the gene for HHT is unknown.
 We studied two families by RFLP analysis to determine whether there is a molecular basis for the association of vWD and HHT.
 Family A is affected with both type IIA vWD and HHT; family B is affected with HHT alone.
 Linkage of HHT to the vWF gene was not detected, and vWF was ruled out as a candidate gene for HHT.
 The vWF gene was found to be tightly linked to type IIA vWD in family A (lod score 3.61 at recombination fraction .00).
 By PCR and DNA sequence analysis of vWF exon 28, a single T----C transition resulting in the substitution of Thr for Ile865 was identified.
 This substitution is located immediately adjacent to two previously identified type IIA vWD mutations.
