Lindane (Kwell)-induced aplastic anemia.
 Numerous toxic exposures have been implicated in causing aplastic anemia.
 Thirteen cases of aplastic anemia and 5 cases of other blood dyscrasias, eg, red blood cell aplasia and thrombocytopenia, associated with lindane, have been reported in the literature.
 However, aplastic anemia secondary to the scabicidal product (lindane [Kwell]) has not been documented, to our knowledge.
 We present the case of a 21-year-old man with a diagnosis of aplastic anemia, known prolonged exposure to lindane, and documented elevated serum lindane levels.
 His clinical course is described as well as various defects are explored for the aplasia.
