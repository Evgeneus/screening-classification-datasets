Vesical manifestations of chronic granulomatous disease in children. Its relation to eosinophilic cystitis.
 Two children with chronic granulomatous disease involving the bladder are reported.
 Their clinical course was characterized by lower urinary tract symptoms, decreased vesical capacity, unilateral ureterovesical junction obstruction, and an intense eosinophilic infiltrate on biopsy specimens in each.
 Chronic granulomatous disease and eosinophilic cystitis appear to have remarkably similar clinical manifestations.
 A review of urinary tract involvement in chronic granulomatous disease and its comparison with eosinophilic cystitis is presented.
