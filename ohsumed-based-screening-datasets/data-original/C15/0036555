Antenatal diagnosis of fetal splenic cyst. A case report.
 Antenatal ultrasonography detected a fetal splenic cyst at 35 weeks' gestation.
 Serial ultrasonography and follow-up neonatal ultrasonography confirmed the presence of a solitary splenic cyst.
 The finding of asymptomatic but potentially serious fetal lesions allows optimum management of the newborn infant and adds to the benefits of antenatal sonography.
