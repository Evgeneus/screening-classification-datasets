Bone remodelling after growth factor and cyclosporine A therapy for aplastic anemia.
 We describe a patient with viral induced aplastic anemia who developed severe bone pain after treatment with multiple courses of antithymocyte globulin, cyclosporine A, recombinant human granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor and deferoxamine.
 Radiographs and bone biopsy revealed extensive new trabecular bone formation in long bone diaphyses and adjacent periosteal reaction.
 The effects of hematopoietic growth factors, cyclosporine A and deferoxamine on bone metabolism are reviewed.
