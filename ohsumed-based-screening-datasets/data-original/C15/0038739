Acquired aplastic anaemia: still a serious disease.
 Over 15 years, 42 children aged 2-14 years were diagnosed as having acquired aplastic anaemia.
 Adequate clinical details were available for 38 children who were categorised as very severe (n = 13), severe (n = 16), or nonsevere (n = 9) by the modified Camitta criteria.
 Treatment varied over the study period.
 Seven children received a bone marrow allograft from a full match family donor and three a matched unrelated donor transplant after failed treatment with antilymphocyte globulin.
 The remainder were treated with antilymphocyte globulin (n = 11), antilymphocyte globulin and oxymetholone (n = 4), oxymetholone with or without prednisolone (n = 12), or supportive treatment alone (n = 1).
 With a minimum follow up of one year since treatment, the five year survival was 70% for bone marrow transplantation with a family donor, 30% for antilymphocyte globulin, and 25% for oxymetholone.
 All three children with a matched unrelated donor transplant died.
 The prognosis of acquired aplastic anaemia remains poor for most children and new approaches to treatment are urgently required.
