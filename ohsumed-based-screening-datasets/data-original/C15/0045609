Preoperative hemostatic assessment of the adenotonsillectomy patient.
 Intraoperative or postoperative hemorrhage in the patient who has undergone an adenotonsillectomy because of an unrecognized hemostatic defect may increase morbidity and can be potentially life-threatening to the patient in what should be a "routine" procedure.
 Preoperative identification of occult hemostatic abnormalities, coupled with perioperative management directed at correcting the effects of the defects, should serve to reduce the incidence of this distressful complication.
 Routine use of preoperative laboratory screening tests for this purpose has been discouraged recently as a result of concerns over cost-effectiveness and the low predictiveness of the tests for bleeding.
 Our experience with the routine use of a comprehensive hemostatic laboratory screening panel--which includes a bleeding time test--in the adenotonsillectomy patient population demonstrated that 11.5% of our patients had abnormal initial screening laboratory tests; these results were ultimately attributable to occult hemostatic defects.
 Clinical history, the universally recommended method of preoperative hemostatic assessment, failed to detect any previously unrecognized coagulation disorder.
 Laboratory screening improved preoperative detection of occult hemostatic defects and allowed for appropriate alterations in perioperative care.
 Our results with this approach are presented, along with illustrative case histories and a discussion of the current recommendations for preoperative laboratory screening of the hemostatic system, as found in a review of the literature.
