Effectiveness of low dose erythropoietin: a possible advantage of high flux hemodialysis.
 Recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) was administered to 32 stable out-patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on a priority basis three times a week.
 All patients underwent dialysis with polysulfone hollow fiber dialyzers.
 Mean time-averaged blood urea nitrogen (BUN) value was 50 +/- 12 mg/dl, and Kt/V for urea was 1.20 +/- 0.34/dialysis.
 The initial dose of EPO was 2,800 +/- 950 U/dialysis (45 +/- 17 U/kg/dialysis).
 The maintenance dose averaged 2,500 U/dialysis.
 Within the mean time of observation, 15 +/- 4 weeks, all but one patient responded to EPO by eliminating transfusion requirements, and 29 of 32 achieved the target hematocrit of 30-33%.
 For patients with hematocrits below 25% before EPO, the increase averaged 1.6 +/- 0.8%/week.
 The dose of EPO was lower and the hematocrit response was higher than reported previously.
 The rate of increase in hematocrit did not correlate with small molecular weight solute removal.
 Mean red blood cell survival was 52 +/- 18 days.
 No adjustments in blood pressure (BP) medications or dry weight were required to control BP.
 These data and earlier experiences with recovery from the anemia of ESRD after more effective dialysis suggest that the bone marrow response to EPO may be augmented by high flux hemodialysis.
