Phase I study of weekly intravenous infusions of CPT-11, a new derivative of camptothecin, in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.
 7-Ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino]carbonyloxy-camptothecin (CPT-11) is a novel camptothecin derivative that has been selected for clinical evaluation because of its broad spectrum of antitumor activity in animal models and its unique inhibitory effects on mammalian DNA topoisomerase I.
 Seventeen patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer were treated with CPT-11 at weekly dose levels ranging from 50 to 150 mg/m2.
 At least three weekly doses were given to all patients except four, and a total of 74 weekly doses were given to the 17 patients.
 The dose-limiting toxic effects were myelosuppression (predominantly leukopenia) and unpredictable diarrhea.
 Gastrointestinal toxic effects were severe and not well controlled by standard therapy in some patients.
 Interpatient variability of toxic effects was substantial (including two deaths) and did not correlate with the pharmacokinetic parameters of CPT-11 and 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin, its major metabolite.
 Two previously untreated patients, who received doses of 100 and 125 mg/m2, had partial responses lasting 3.2 and 4.0 months, respectively.
 The maximum tolerated dose on this schedule was 100 mg/m2, which we also recommend as a starting dose for phase II studies.
 This schedule appears to allow a CPT-11 dose intensity which is double the dose intensity possible on a once-a-month schedule.
 However, careful supervision to assess gastrointestinal toxic effects and myelosuppression is indispensable because of wide individual differences in drug tolerance.
