Ventricular cerebrospinal fluid eosinophilia in children with ventriculoperitoneal shunts.
 To determine the significance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) eosinophilia, the charts of 106 patients treated with shunt-related procedures during the calendar year 1985 were reviewed.
 Sixty-nine patients presented for a shunt revision; their charts were retrospectively reviewed from the time of shunt insertion until January, 1988.
 The remaining 37 patients had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt inserted during the study period and were subsequently followed to January, 1988.
 A total of 558 shunt-related procedures were performed on these patients during the study period, with a mean follow-up period of 6.9 years.
 The infection rate was 3.8%.
 Eosinophilia was diagnosed when eosinophils accounted for 8% or more of the total CSF white blood cell count.
 Ventricular CSF eosinophilia occurred in 36 patients sometime during their clinical course.
 These 36 patients required a mean of 8.5 shunt revisions, while the remaining patients required a mean of 2.5 revisions (p less than 0.001).
 Shunt infections were also more frequent in patients with eosinophilia (p less than 0.01).
 In no case was peripheral eosinophilia or a parasitic infection present.
 This study demonstrates that CSF eosinophilia is common in children with shunts.
 Children with this laboratory finding will experience more shunt failures.
 In addition, the new appearance of eosinophilia in the CSF of a patient with a shunt in place suggests the possibility of a shunt infection.
