Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia and peripheral neuropathy. Case report and literature review.
 A man with multicentric angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia and a polyclonal gammopathy developed a debilitating sensory-motor peripheral neuropathy that resolved with plasma-pheresis and immunosuppressive therapy.
 Fourteen similar cases have been reported in the literature; however, to our knowledge, this is the first report of successful treatment with plasma-pheresis.
 Severe peripheral neuropathy usually occurs in the setting of multicentric, plasma cell-type disease with hypergammaglobulinemia and is often responsive to immunosuppressive therapy.
