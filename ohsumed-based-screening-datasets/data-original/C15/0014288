Pentostatin induces durable remissions in hairy cell leukemia.
 Fifty patients with hairy cell leukemia were treated with pentostatin (2'-deoxycoformycin; dCF) for a median of 3 months; 32 (64%) patients achieved complete remission (CR), and 10 (20%) patients achieved partial remission (PR), for an overall response rate of 84%.
 After reaching maximal response, no maintenance therapy was administered.
 The median duration of follow-up is now 39 months, and only four of 32 patients in CR and two of 10 patients in PR have relapsed.
 dCF therapy produces durable long-term, disease-free survival in patients with hairy cell leukemia.
