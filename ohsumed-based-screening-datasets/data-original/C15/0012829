Lymphoedema/hypercalcaemia syndrome mediated by parathyroid-hormone-related protein.
 A 24-year-old woman presented with a cryptogenic, hypercalcaemic syndrome with metastatic pulmonary calcification and leg and massive breast enlargement and bilateral chylous pleural effusions compatible with a generalised lymphatic abnormality.
 The patient's serum parathyroid hormone-related protein concentration was very high at a time when she was significantly hypercalcaemic, implying that the hypercalcaemia was mediated by this protein.
