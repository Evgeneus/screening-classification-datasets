Apolipoprotein synthesis in normal and abetalipoproteinemic intestinal mucosa.
 The genetic disease abetalipoproteinemia is characterized by a total absence of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins from plasma.
 A presumed synthetic defect in apolipoprotein B synthesis was thought to be responsible for this disorder.
 The present study quantitates apoprotein B synthesis and apolipoprotein B messenger RNA levels in duodenal mucosa from normal patients and four patients with abetalipoproteinemia.
 After in vitro [3H]leucine incorporation, small intestinal biopsy specimens from three of four patients with abetalipoproteinemia synthesized immunoprecipitable apolipoprotein B of identical mobility (on sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis) to normal apolipoprotein B.
 In abetalipoproteinemia, the apolipoprotein B content of intestinal mucosa by radioimmunoassay was 15% of normal mucosal values, whereas apolipoprotein B messenger RNA quantitation showed 3-20-fold increased levels compared with normal mucosa.
 In one patient, smaller-molecular-weight fragments of apolipoprotein B were immunoprecipitated from duodenal biopsy specimens.
 The synthesis rates and messenger RNA levels of two other chylomicron apoproteins (apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein A-IV) were found to be reduced by 50%.
 These results show the synthesis of immunologically recognizable apolipoprotein B48 in abetalipoproteinemia.
 The significance of mucosal apolipoprotein B content in abetalipoproteinemia is discussed in terms of factors controlling apolipoprotein B synthesis in normal mucosa and in abetalipoproteinemia.
