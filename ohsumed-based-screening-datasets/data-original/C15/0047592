Absent splenic uptake of indium-111-oxine-labeled autologous leukocytes in functional asplenia.
 An incidental finding of absent splenic uptake of autologous, indium-111-oxine-labeled leukocytes in an immunosuppressed renal transplant recipient was documented to be associated with functional asplenia based on absence of technetium-99m-sulfur colloid clearance by a morphologically normal spleen.
 The patient had recently suffered an episode of disseminated varicella infection that might have led to the development of functional asplenia.
