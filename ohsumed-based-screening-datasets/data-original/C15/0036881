Hyporegenerative anemia associated with intrauterine transfusion in rhesus hemolytic disease.
 Serial erythropoietin and ferritin levels were monitored in a fetus and newborn requiring three intravascular transfusions (in utero) for severe Rh disease.
 The newborn had a hematocrit of 37% at birth; however a hyporegenerative transfusion-dependent anemia developed and lasted approximately 3 months.
 The prolonged hyporegenerative anemia may be caused in part by erythropoietin suppression as a result of the fetal intravascular transfusions.
 In addition, anti-D antibody may also contribute to this anemia by a direct toxic effect on erythroid precursors and by peripheral hemolysis of reticulocytes.
