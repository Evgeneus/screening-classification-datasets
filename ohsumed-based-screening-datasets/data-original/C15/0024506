Vascular proliferation as an unusual cause of hemorrhagic diathesis in myelofibrosis.
 One year after splenectomy, a patient with myelofibrosis developed spontaneously large hematomas that were not due to coagulation abnormalities or functionally defective platelets.
 At autopsy, the liver, muscle, and skin showed extramedullary hematopoiesis associated with capillary proliferation and extravasation of blood.
 These findings indicate that neovascularization can be an additional cause of bleeding in myeloproliferative disorders and might be induced by neoplastic hematopoietic cells.
