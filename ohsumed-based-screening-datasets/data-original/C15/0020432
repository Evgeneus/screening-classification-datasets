Hematologic aspects of mastocytosis: II: management of hematologic disorders in association with systemic mast cell disease.
 Individuals with systemic mast cell disease (SMCD) may develop various hematologic abnormalities, including cytopenias, myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes, lymphoproliferative syndromes, and primary or secondary leukemias.
 Management of those patients is often complicated by their associated hematologic abnormalities.
 In the case of non-malignant hematologic syndromes, the approach to management is supportive.
 At present, overt malignancies are managed with traditional chemotherapy.
 The presence of leukemia in patients with mast cell disease usually indicates a grave prognosis.
