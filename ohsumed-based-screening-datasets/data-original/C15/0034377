Weekly low-dose methotrexate therapy for cutaneous sarcoidosis.
 Three patients with severe, treatment-resistant cutaneous sarcoidosis were treated with low-dose oral methotrexate on a weekly basis.
 Facial granulomas and ulcerations responded best.
 A response was apparent after several weeks of treatment, but 6 to 9 months were required to reach maximal effect.
