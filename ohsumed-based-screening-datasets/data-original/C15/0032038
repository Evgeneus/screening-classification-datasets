Monosodium glutamate-related orofacial granulomatosis. Review and case report.
 A case is reported in a 15-year-old white girl who had a swollen lower face and lips; a diagnosis of orofacial granulomatosis was made.
 It was suspected that her condition had an allergic basis because an increase in clinical signs and symptoms was shown to be related to the food additive monosodium glutamate.
 Treatment with a restricted diet resulted in resolution of the facial swelling.
