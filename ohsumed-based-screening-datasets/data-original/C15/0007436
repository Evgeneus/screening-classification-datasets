A new surgical approach in genital lymphedema.
 A new surgical approach has been used in a case of genital lymphedema.
 After resection of the lymphedematous mass, U-shaped flaps were made from the suprapubic region anteriorly and the posterior scrotal skin posteriorly.
 The denuded penis was transposed to its original place by passing it through a buttonhole incision made on the anterior flap.
 The testicles were placed and fixed in pouches prepared between the anterior and posterior flaps.
 The patient had an acceptable postoperative outcome both in testicular function and habitual sexual activities.
