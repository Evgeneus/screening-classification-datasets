Neuropathy caused by spontaneous intraneural hemorrhage: case report.
 A case of ulnar neuropathy at the elbow produced by spontaneous intraneural hemorrhage in a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and thrombocytopenia is reported.
 Intraneural hemorrhage in patients with bleeding disorders occurs infrequently.
 It consists of acute intrafascicular bleeding, presumably producing very high elevations of endoneurial fluid pressure.
 The clinical features and treatment of this condition are considered, the pertinent literature is reviewed, and the involved pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed.
