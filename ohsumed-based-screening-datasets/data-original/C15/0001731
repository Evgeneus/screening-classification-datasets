Immune hydrops fetalis attributable to anti-HJK.
 We describe a new low-frequency antigen as the cause of immune hydrops fetalis in a fetus presenting at 27 weeks with a hematocrit of 6%.
 The fetus was treated successfully by intravascular transfusion.
 This antigen, temporarily identified as HJK, has been detected in only one family.
