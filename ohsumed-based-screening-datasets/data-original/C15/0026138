Severe thrombocytopenia secondary to alcohol use.
 Thrombocytopenia in hospitalized alcoholics may be caused by splenomegaly, folate deficiency, and, most frequently, a direct toxic effect of alcohol on production, survival time, and function of platelets.
 Platelet count begins to rise after 2 to 5 days' abstinence from alcohol.
 The condition is generally benign, and clinically significant hemorrhage is rare.
