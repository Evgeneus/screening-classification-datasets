Video viewing as an alternative to sedation for young subjects who have cardiac ultrasound examinations.
 Sedation is often required for extended or quantitative echocardiographic examination of young patients.
 To test the hypothesis that patient viewing of entertaining videotapes during echocardiographic examinations would reduce the need for sedation and that Doppler pressure gradients so obtained would correspond satisfactorily with subsequent catheterization pressure gradients, 38 patients (age, 5 to 64 months; mean age, 18.6 months) with a variety of cardiac defects were studied.
 Because of excessive activity, resistance, fear, or crying, all of these patients would have normally been sedated.
 Instead, an age-appropriate videotape was used for patient viewing.
 In 35 of 38 patients, complete examinations were obtained with video viewing with no sedation.
 Twelve study patients later underwent catheterization while receiving sedation.
 The Doppler pressure gradients obtained while patients were viewing videotapes corresponded well with catheterization (r = 0.94).
 However, those pressure gradients were higher than those obtained with catheterization (mean, 8.3 mm Hg), but there was only one significant discrepancy of 22 mm Hg.
 In this series, complete examinations were obtained without sedation in 92% of subjects who would have normally required sedation (p less than 0.001), with minimal reduction in the accuracy of prediction of subsequent sedated catheterization pressure gradients.
 This suggests that near baseline conditions existed while patients were viewing television.
 Video viewing during echocardiographic examinations appears to be advantageous.
