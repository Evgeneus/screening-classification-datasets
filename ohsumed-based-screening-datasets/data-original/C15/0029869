Glucocorticoid receptor mRNA expression in pulmonary alveolar macrophages in sarcoidosis.
 The presence of the glucocorticoid receptor was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in pulmonary alveolar macrophages obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage.
 Also, GR mRNA content was determined by solution hybridization in PAM from 12 healthy volunteers and in 6 patients with sarcoidosis.
 No significant differences with regard to GR mRNA expression was detected between the two groups examined.
 For comparison, lung tissue from three patients undergoing thoracic surgery was examined and found to contain GR mRNA levels in the same range.
 As an indication of GR function, we also determined the mRNA levels of a glucocorticoid-regulated gene, metallothionein IIA, during basal conditions and after in vitro incubation of PAM with dexamethasone.
 Neither the control sample nor the dexamethasone-stimulated MTII mRNA values in PAMs differed significantly between the two groups.
 Solution hybridization is a rapid, sensitive and convenient assay which enables accurate and specific quantitation of GR mRNA in PAM.
 The GR mRNA content and basal as well as dexamethasone-induced MTII mRNA levels in PAM from patients with sarcoidosis is not significantly different from those in healthy volunteers.
