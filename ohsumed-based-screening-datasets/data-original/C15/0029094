Effective treatment of small-noncleaved-cell lymphoma with high-intensity, brief-duration chemotherapy.
 Small-noncleaved-cell (SNC) lymphoma is a high-grade, biologically aggressive neoplasm notable for poor response to therapy, high relapse rate, and less than a 20% long-term survival.
 We treated 20 patients with SNC lymphoma with a novel chemotherapeutic regimen using intensive doses of chemotherapy at frequent intervals in the inpatient setting.
 All patients were previously untreated.
 Sixteen patients (80%) had stage IV disease.
 Most patients (95%) had at least one other characteristic associated with poor prognosis (bulky [greater than 10 cm] disease, multiple extranodal sites, poor performance status), and 85% had two or more characteristics associated with poor prognosis.
 Seventeen patients (85%) achieved a complete response (CR) to therapy, including all three patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disease.
 There have been three relapses, all occurring less than 18 months after treatment, and two of three relapses occurred in patients who were unable to complete therapy.
 At a median follow-up of 29 months, 13 patients (65%) remain disease-free; the calculated 5-year actuarial disease-free survival is 60%.
 Toxicity, chiefly myelosuppression, was severe but manageable.
 There were two treatment-related deaths, both in elderly patients with poor performance status and advanced-stage disease.
 These data suggest that such a dose-intensive approach improves the response and survival of patients with SNC lymphoma.
