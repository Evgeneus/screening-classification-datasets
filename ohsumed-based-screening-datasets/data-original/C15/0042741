Efficacy of antilipopolysaccharide and anti-tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibodies in a neutropenic rat model of Pseudomonas sepsis.
 Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) directed against bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) provide partial protection in experimental models of septic shock.
 To determine if additional benefit accrues from a combination of anti-TNF and anti-LPS MAb in the treatment of septic shock, a neutropenic rat model was developed to study active infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa 12.4.4.
 Animals were treated intravenously with an irrelevant MAb (group 1); anti-TNF MAb (group 2); MAb directed against P.
 aeruginosa 12.4.4 LPS (group 3); or a combination of anti-TNF and anti-LPS MAb (group 4).
 None of the control animals in group 1 survived the 7-d period of neutropenia (0/16).
 In contrast, the survival rate was 44% in group 2 (P less than 0.02); 37% in group 3 (P less than 0.05); and 75% in group 4 (P less than 0.0002).
 The combination of monoclonal antibodies provided greater protection than either MAb given alone (P less than 0.05).
 Serum TNF levels during infection were significantly greater in groups 1 and 3 (20.1 +/- 3.3 U, mean +/- SE) than in groups 2 and 4 (0.9 +/- 0.8 U, P less than 0.0001).
 These results indicate that a combination of monoclonal antibodies to LPS and TNF have additive benefit in experimental Pseudomonas aeruginosa sepsis.
 This immunotherapeutic approach may be of potential utility in the management of serious, gram-negative bacterial infection in neutropenic patients.
