The effect of intrauterine intravascular blood transfusion on iron metabolism in fetuses with Rh alloimmunization.
 Fetal plasma ferritin concentrations were measured in 43 normal fetuses at 18-36 weeks and in 78 blood samples collected before transfusion from 23 fetuses with Rh alloimmunization.
 Among controls, there was a significant correlation between fetal serum ferritin and gestational age (r = 0.39, P = .009), consistent with an increase in fetal storage of iron during normal pregnancy.
 In Rh-alloimmunized fetuses, the ferritin concentration was above the reference range in 63% of the samples.
 Before the first transfusion, the fetal ferritin concentration was increased compared with controls (mean multiples of the mean = 2.6, range 1-26) and showed a negative correlation with fetal hematocrit (r = -0.43, P less than .05), suggesting that the worse the fetal anemia, the higher the iron store.
 Serial transfusions were associated with further increase in serum ferritin, which correlated primarily with the total volume of blood transfused.
 Three fetuses had plasma serum ferritin concentrations above 1 mg/L, a level compatible with a diagnosis of iron overload in children.
 These observations suggest that there is a potential risk of iron overload in Rh-alloimmunized fetuses undergoing intrauterine blood transfusion.
