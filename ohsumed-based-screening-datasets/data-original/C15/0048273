Clonal analysis of CD4+/CD8+ T cells in a patient with aplastic anemia.
 T cell clones were established from peripheral blood of a patient with severe aplastic anemia.
 8 of 18 individual clonal T cell populations stably coexpressed CD4 and CD8 molecules, a phenotype characteristic for thymocytes and a minor subpopulation of circulating T lymphocytes.
 Analysis of T cell receptor genes revealed identical rearrangements of T cell receptor beta chain genes, suggesting clonality of these T cells.
 CD4+/CD8+ T cells clones were found to be efficiently cytotoxic towards autologous lymphoblasts.
 Autocytotoxicity could be blocked by a CD3 MAb, a MAb specific for monomorphic MHC class II determinants, and particularly, by an MHC-DP-specific MAb, suggesting specificity for autologous DP molecules.
 Perhaps more important, CD4+/CD8+ T cell clones inhibited differentiation of autologous progenitor enriched bone marrow cells in vitro by a direct cell-mediated mechanism.
 These data suggest that circulating cytotoxic CD4+/CD8+ T cell clones specific for autologous MHC-DP determinants may be involved in hematopoietic failure in some cases of aplastic anemia.
