Multimodality cisplatin treatment in nonresectable alpha-fetoprotein-positive hepatoma.
 Twenty-eight patients with alpha-fetoprotein-positive (AFP+) nonresectable hepatoma have been enrolled in a new multimodality Phase I, II program.
 Induction therapy consisted of 50 mg/m2 intravenous cisplatin followed by 2100 cGy irradiation to the tumor volume in seven fractions over 10 days.
 Hepatic arterial infusion of 50 mg/m2 cisplatin (IA-CDDP) was then administered at monthly intervals.
 Twenty-one patients have completed induction and at least two cycles of IA-CDDP.
 Twelve-month cumulative survival was 52% for all 28 patients and 69% for the 21 patients completing induction and IA-CDDP.
 Median survival has not yet been reached.
 Response rate (complete and partial) was 36% overall and 48% among the 21 patients who completed treatment.
 The improved survival of the present series of patients as well as the minimal hematologic toxicity suggests possible further integration of new modalities for therapy.
