Pregnancy outcome in patients with high titer anti-RNP antibodies. A retrospective study of 40 pregnancies.
 In a retrospective study the outcome of 40 pregnancies in 20 women with a high titer of anti-RNP antibodies was evaluated.
 In the 18 pregnancies that occurred after disease onset, transient proteinuria was noted in 3 and transient thrombocytopenia in 2.
 Deep venous thrombosis was observed in one patient.
 Preeclampsia in another woman necessitated cesarean sections in 2 pregnancies with successful outcome.
 The observed complications may all be seen in normal pregnancies.
 There was no evidence of exacerbation of maternal disease during pregnancy or in the postpartum period.
 Our study indicates that in women with high anti-RNP titer the risk of fetal loss or maternal worsening of disease seems slight.
