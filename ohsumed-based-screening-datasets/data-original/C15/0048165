Detecting fetomaternal hemorrhage: a comparison of five methods 
 Appropriate postpartum administration of Rh immune globulin relies on sensitive detection and accurate quantitation of fetomaternal hemorrhage (FMH).
 Recently, the microscopic Du test (micro Du) enhanced with polyethylene glycol (PEG Du) and flow cytometry (FC) have been advocated for this purpose.
 Three qualitative methods (micro Du, rosette test, and PEG Du) and two quantitative methods (acid elution and FC) for assessing FMH were evaluated with particular attention given to PEG Du and FC.
 In vitro studies comprised 10 series of dilutions of D+ cord cells in D- adult cells to yield D+ cell concentrations of 0.06, 0.12, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.0, and 2.0 percent.
 Additionally, 26 postpartum samples were tested.
 Of the qualitative techniques, the micro Du test was the least sensitive with 20 percent false-negative results occurring at 0.5 percent fetal cells.
 The PEG Du test was only slightly more sensitive and offered no clinical advantage.
 The rosette test was the most sensitive, consistently detecting fetal cells at concentrations of 0.25 percent or greater.
 FC and acid elution showed similar results, with good correlation obtained between measured and expected quantities of fetal cells (r = 0.99 and 0.96, respectively).
 One of 26 postpartum samples was positive by all screening techniques; acid elution and FC detected 0.3-percent concentrations of fetal cells and 0.17-percent concentrations of D+ cells, respectively.
 Although acid elution is a more commonly used method for quantitating FMH, FC offers an acceptable alternative that is capable of analyzing large numbers of cells with objectivity and reproducibility.
